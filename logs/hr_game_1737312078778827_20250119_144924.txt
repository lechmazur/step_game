Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we all start at 0 steps, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we agree on different numbers, we can all advance. What does everyone think? Should we aim for 1, 3, or 5 this turn?
  P3: I agree with P2. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without conflict. Thoughts?
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems we had a collision last round, which prevented us from advancing. I still think coordinating is key. Since P3 is currently ahead, I suggest we change our approach. How about P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3 this time? This way, we avoid colliding again and all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, your suggestion makes sense, but I’m already at 5 steps. If I take 3, I’ll be at 8, which could put me closer to winning. However, I’m open to adjusting if it avoids collisions. Let’s agree: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. This way, we all advance without conflict. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. I still think we should stick with the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. This way, we all make progress without colliding. If we can avoid conflicts, we can all advance and keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize this agreement so we can move forward! What do you think, P1?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan: P1 takes 1, you take 5, and I take 3. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to this agreement and all advance. P1, are you on board? If so, let’s finalize and move to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, it seems we have a solid agreement in place: you take 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. Let’s finalize this plan so we can move to the move phase. If everyone is in agreement, we can ensure we all advance this turn! What do you say?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, I’ve agreed to take 3 this turn to avoid collisions. P1, are you committed to taking 1? P2, are you still taking 5? Let’s confirm and finalize this plan to ensure we all advance. If everyone is on board, we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, it seems we have a solid plan in place. If you take 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3, we can all advance without colliding.

If so, we can finalize this and ensure a successful turn!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, I’ve confirmed my commitment to taking 3 this turn. P1, are you still taking 1? P2, are you sticking with 5? Let’s finalize this plan to avoid collisions and all advance. If everyone is in agreement, we can proceed to the move phase.

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it seems our coordination attempts have failed twice. P1, you’ve deviated from the agreed plan both times, causing collisions. P2, let’s try a new approach: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I’ll take 5. This avoids overlaps and ensures progress. P1, can you commit to 1 this time? P2, are you willing to take 3? Let’s finalize this to avoid further setbacks.
  P2: P1, P3, it’s clear our previous strategies haven’t worked out. For this round, I propose we stick to a new plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding again. P1, can you commit to taking 1 this time? P3, are you okay with taking 5? Let’s finalize this agreement to ensure we all make progress and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I’ve proposed P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 to avoid collisions. P1, your deviation has cost us progress twice. Can you commit to 1 this time? P2, are you still on board with 3? Let’s finalize this plan to ensure we all advance. If we can’t coordinate, I’ll have to adjust my strategy to protect my lead. Let’s make this turn count.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the frustration with our previous rounds. To ensure we all advance, I propose we stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. P1, can you commit to taking 1 this time? P3, are you okay with taking 5? Let's finalize this agreement so we can all move forward and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>

Let’s finalize this plan to ensure we all advance. If we can’t coordinate, I’ll have to adjust my strategy to protect my lead. Let’s make this turn count.
  P2: P1, P3, it’s crucial we finally coordinate effectively this turn to avoid another collision. I propose we stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without conflict and keep the game competitive. P1, can you commit to taking 1 this time? P3, are you okay with taking 5? Let’s finalize this agreement and make this turn count! What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear P1 has not followed the agreed plans, causing repeated collisions. P1, if you deviate again, I’ll have to prioritize my own progress. P2, let’s ensure P1 commits to 1 this time. If P1 won’t cooperate, I’ll adjust my strategy to protect my lead. P1, this is your last chance to coordinate. P2, are you still committed to 3? Let’s finalize this plan or I’ll act independently.
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that our coordination has been unsuccessful so far. To avoid another collision, I suggest we stick firmly to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. P1, can you commit to 1 this time? If we can all agree on this, we can finally make progress. Let's finalize our choices and ensure we all advance this round! What do you both say?
  P1: <stop>

  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, our coordination has finally worked. P1, thank you for sticking to 1. P2, good job with 3. I’m now at 13 steps, closer to 22. Let’s continue this strategy: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. P1, can you commit to 1 again? P2, are you still on board with 3? Let’s finalize this plan to ensure we all advance. If we can’t agree, I’ll prioritize my progress. Let’s make this turn count.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, while I'm glad we've made some progress, I want to emphasize that I need to prioritize my own advancement this round. If we stick to the plan of P1 taking 1, I will take 5 instead of 3, as I need to catch up. P3, if you take 5, you might reach 22 soon, but I can't afford to stay behind. Let's adjust accordingly. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your need to catch up, but if you take 5, we risk colliding if I also take 5. Let’s avoid that. I propose P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5 again. This ensures progress for all without conflict. P1, can you commit to 1? P2, are you willing to stick with 3? Let’s finalize this to keep the game competitive. If you deviate, I’ll prioritize my lead.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the progress we've made, but I need to prioritize my own advancement this round. To avoid collisions, I suggest we adjust our plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3.

To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, I propose P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. This ensures progress for all. P1, can you commit to 1? P2, are you willing to stick with 3? Let’s finalize this to avoid setbacks. If you deviate, I’ll prioritize my lead.
