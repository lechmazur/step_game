Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate strategically. I suggest we each choose different moves to maximize our chances of advancing. I'm open to discussing a plan that prevents anyone from being blocked.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to coordinate and choose different moves. How about we assign moves based on our player numbers? I (P1) could choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance in the first round.
  P3: I'm in agreement with the plan to choose different moves to avoid collisions. I'll go with <move>5</move> as suggested. Let's stick to this strategy for the first round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with the same strategy for this round to avoid collisions. I'll choose <move>5</move> again. P1 and P2, please stick to <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: I'll continue our collaborative strategy. It makes sense to maintain our current approach to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances.

I suggest we repeat our previous round's move selection: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. This ensures we all move forward and no one gets blocked. What do you say?
  P1: I'm on board with continuing the strategy from the previous rounds. P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. Let's keep the collaboration going for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round. P1, you're choosing <move>1</move>, P2, you're choosing <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: I believe our current collaborative strategy is working well, and we should maintain it for this round. By choosing different moves, we ensure everyone advances and avoids collisions. I'm committed to choosing <move>3</move> again, as we discussed. Let's continue this approach of coordinated, non-overlapping moves.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan for this round. I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This collaboration is working so far, and I see no reason to change it yet.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's move to the move phase. Everyone is in agreement.
  P2: I believe our current collaborative strategy has been effective, but we must be cautious. While avoiding collisions is good, we're revealing predictable patterns that could be exploited. I suggest we maintain flexibility and be prepared to adapt our approach. Let's continue coordinating, but with more strategic nuance.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to introduce strategic nuance while maintaining our collaborative approach. Let's continue with our assigned moves for this round, but be prepared to reassess and adapt our strategy in future rounds to stay ahead.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our current collaborative strategy has been working, but we need to be cautious about becoming too predictable. I suggest we maintain our coordination but introduce some strategic variation to prevent others from anticipating our moves. We should discuss how to keep our approach flexible while still avoiding collisions.
  P1: I agree with P2's concern about predictability. To introduce variation while minimizing risk, how about we rotate our moves this round? For example, I could choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain coordination but mix up our pattern.
  P3: I like the idea of rotating our moves to keep things unpredictable. Let's go with P1's suggestion for this round: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P1 chooses <move>3</move>. This way, we all still advance but mix up our strategy. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I support the proposed rotation strategy. By changing our move pattern, we reduce predictability while still maintaining coordination to avoid collisions. I'm prepared to choose <move>5</move> as suggested. This approach keeps our collaborative spirit intact but introduces strategic uncertainty.
  P1: Let's confirm the rotation strategy for this round as discussed: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This will help us maintain our lead while keeping our moves unpredictable.
  P3: Let's confirm our rotated moves for this round: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I support our rotation strategy. By choosing <move>5</move> this round, we maintain our collaborative approach while introducing unpredictability. This keeps us flexible and prevents other players from easily anticipating our moves. I believe this approach gives us the best chance of advancing strategically.
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation strategy we've agreed upon for this round: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This will maintain our coordination while introducing some unpredictability to our moves.
  P3: I'm ready to confirm our rotated moves for this round: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Our rotation strategy seems solid, but we need to ensure we're all truly committed. I propose we explicitly confirm our moves to prevent any last-minute changes that could disrupt our coordination. Are P1 and P3 still planning to choose <move>3</move> and <move>1</move> respectively, while I choose <move>5</move>?
  P1: Let's reaffirm our rotation strategy for this round to ensure coordination: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This introduces unpredictability while we all advance. Are we all still on board with this plan?
  P3: Let's confirm one last time: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. We all agree? Let's move to the move phase


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Our rotation strategy has been effective so far, but we need to remain vigilant. We've successfully coordinated to avoid collisions, but the game is getting more competitive as we approach the 18-step goal. I propose we maintain our collaborative approach while staying adaptable. Let's continue to communicate and adjust our strategy to prevent any single player from gaining too much of an advantage.
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation strategy we've agreed upon for this round: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This maintains our coordination while introducing unpredictability. Are we all still committed to this plan?
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one final time and move to the move phase: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. Everyone agrees?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our previous rotation strategy didn't work as planned - we had a collision between P1 and P2 both choosing 5. We need a new coordination method that ensures everyone advances. I suggest we carefully select moves to avoid blocking each other while still making progress. Perhaps we could discuss a more robust approach to prevent unintended collisions.
  P3: It seems our rotation strategy led to a collision last round. To avoid this, let's return to a clear and simple plan. I suggest P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to return to a simple plan. Let's assign moves based on our player numbers again: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I support P3's suggestion of returning to our original strategy to avoid collisions. By choosing <move>3</move> this round, I can ensure I advance while preventing any unintended blocking. Our previous rotation attempt failed, so a clear, predictable approach seems wise right now. Let's coordinate to make sure we all move forward.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round to ensure no collisions: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Let's stick with the revised plan: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress. Are we all still on board with this strategy?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Our previous rotation strategy failed, causing a collision. I suggest we return to our original coordinated approach: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. This ensures everyone advances without blocking. Let's maintain our collaborative strategy to prevent anyone from gaining an unfair advantage.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one final time to avoid any confusion: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Let's confirm our agreed-upon moves for this round to avoid collisions: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This should help us all advance without blocking each other.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We need to be cautious. Our previous rotation strategy failed, causing a collision. I suggest we return to our original coordinated approach to ensure everyone advances. However, I'm also aware that as P3 is closest to winning, we might need to strategically disrupt their progress. Let's discuss how we can prevent P3 from reaching 18 steps first while maintaining our own advancement.
  P3: P2, your concern is valid. To address it, how about P1 and P2 both choose <move>3</move> this round, and I'll choose <move>1</move> to slow my progress? This way, we maintain coordination, and I don't pull too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion of both P1 and P2 choosing <move>3</move> while P3 chooses <move>1</move> is a good strategy to slow P3's progress and maintain coordination. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: what if I choose <move>5</move> instead, to try and close the gap with P3? This way, P2 can still choose <move>3</move>, and we can reassess our strategy in the next round. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Our previous coordination failed when we tried to rotate moves. Now P3 is closest to winning, which poses a strategic challenge. I suggest we carefully select moves to prevent P3 from reaching 18 steps first. We need a collaborative approach that slows P3's progress while ensuring we both advance. I'm open to discussing a strategy that keeps us competitive.
  P3: I understand the concerns about my lead. To keep the game competitive and fair, how about this compromise: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move> to slow my progress. This way, we all still move forward, but I don't pull too far ahead. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I think P3's compromise is reasonable. Let's go with it: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This slows P3's progress while keeping us competitive. Are we all agreed on this strategy for Round 4?


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: As P2, I recognize the strategic complexity emerging. We need to prevent P3 from reaching 18 steps first while maintaining our own advancement. I suggest we carefully coordinate our moves to slow P3's progress. Our previous attempts at rotation and coordination have been inconsistent, so we need a clear, deliberate strategy that keeps us competitive. I propose we discuss how to strategically limit P3's advancement while ensuring our own progress.
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed-upon moves for this round to ensure coordination: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P2 chooses <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance, and I slow my progress to keep the game competitive. Everyone agrees?
  P1: Let's confirm the compromise: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This slows P3's progress and keeps us competitive. Are we all set for the move phase?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's lead, I suggest we focus on slowing their progress while advancing ourselves. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move> to slow down? This maintains coordination and competitiveness. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand the strategy to slow my progress, but I propose a slight adjustment to keep the game dynamic. How about P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all advance, and I don't pull too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: As P2, I recognize the strategic tension emerging. P3 is closest to winning, so we need a coordinated approach to prevent their victory. I suggest we carefully choose moves that slow P3's progress while ensuring our own advancement.

I propose that I choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This strategy allows us to keep P3 from quickly reaching 18 steps while still making progress ourselves. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P2's suggestion is a good strategy to slow P3's progress while we advance. Let's go with it: P2 chooses <move>3</move>, I'll choose <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This keeps us competitive and prevents P3 from pulling too far ahead. Are we all agreed?
  P3: Let's confirm the strategy for this round: P2 chooses <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance, and I slow my progress to keep the game balanced. Everyone agrees?
  P2: We need a strategic approach to prevent P3 from winning. Our previous coordination attempts have been inconsistent. I propose we carefully choose moves that slow P3's progress while ensuring our own advancement. We should aim to keep P3 from quickly reaching 18 steps. I suggest maintaining our current strategy of choosing moves that prevent a single player from dominating. Let's discuss how we can collectively prevent P3 from winning while advancing ourselves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's confirm the strategy for this round: P2 chooses <move>3</move>, I'll choose <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This keeps us competitive and prevents P3 from pulling too far ahead. Are we all agreed?
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one final time to ensure coordination: P2 chooses <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: We need to maintain our strategy of preventing P3 from reaching 18 steps first. Our coordinated approach in the last round worked well. I suggest we continue with a similar move distribution that slows P3's progress while allowing us to advance. I propose P2 chooses <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and prevents P3 from quickly winning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I suggest we stick with the agreed-upon strategy for this round: P2 chooses <move>3</move>, I'll choose <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This maintains our competitive balance and slows P3's progress. Let's confirm and move forward.

  P3: Let's confirm our moves one final time to ensure coordination: P2 chooses <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Our current strategy of slowing P3's progress while advancing ourselves has been working. I propose we maintain our previous round's move distribution: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and prevents P3 from quickly reaching 18 steps. What are your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: Let's confirm our strategy for this round as previously discussed: P2 chooses <move>3</move>, I'll choose <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This maintains our competitive balance and slows P3's progress. Are we all agreed?
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one final time to ensure coordination: P2 chooses <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.

  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with the strategy that has been working: P2 chooses <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and ensures we all advance. Everyone agrees?
  P1: Let's mix it up this round to throw off predictability. How about I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>? This way, we all still advance but change our pattern. Thoughts?
  P2: I recognize we're in a critical phase of the game. P3 is closest to winning, and we need a strategic approach to prevent their victory. I suggest we maintain our previous coordination strategy that has worked well: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and prevents P3 from quickly reaching 18 steps. What are your thoughts on maintaining this approach?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's consider P1's suggestion to mix it up this round. It introduces unpredictability and keeps the game dynamic. If P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>5</move>, we all still advance but change our pattern. This could be a good strategic move to keep things interesting. What do you both think?
  P1: I think mixing it up this round could be beneficial. My previous suggestion of P1 choosing <move>3</move>, P2 choosing <move>1</move>, and P3 choosing <move>5</move> introduces unpredictability. Are you both open to trying this approach to keep the game dynamic?
  P2: We're in a critical phase where P3 is just one step ahead. I suggest we maintain our previous strategy of slowing P3's progress. Let's stick to our proven approach: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This prevents P3 from quickly winning and keeps us competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the concerns about my lead, but let's consider P1's suggestion to mix things up. It adds unpredictability and keeps the game dynamic. If P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>5</move>, we all still advance but change our pattern. This could be a strategic move to keep things interesting. What do you both think?
  P1: Let's try to slow P3's progress. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This maintains coordination and competitiveness. Thoughts?
  P2: We're at a critical juncture where coordination is key. P3 is one step ahead, so we need a strategy that prevents their victory. I propose we maintain our previous approach: I choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This slows P3's progress while allowing us to advance. What are your thoughts on this strategy?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's compromise to keep the game fair and competitive. How about P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>? This way, we all still advance, but I slow my progress slightly. Thoughts?
  P1: I suggest we stick with a coordinated approach to slow P3's progress. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This maintains competitiveness and prevents P3 from pulling ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: We're at a critical point in the game. P3 is one step ahead, and we need a coordinated strategy to prevent their victory. I suggest we maintain our previous approach of slowing P3's progress while ensuring our own advancement. Let's continue to work together to keep the game competitive and prevent any single player from winning too quickly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round to ensure we all advance: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and slows my progress slightly. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Let's slow P3's progress. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This maintains coordination and competitiveness. Thoughts?
  P2: We're at a critical point in the game. P3 is just one step ahead, and we need a coordinated strategy to prevent their victory. I propose we maintain our previous approach: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This slows P3's progress while allowing us to advance. We must work together to keep the game competitive and prevent P3 from winning too quickly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance without collision: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and slows my progress slightly. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Let's slow P3's progress. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This maintains coordination and competitiveness. Thoughts?

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's adjust our strategy to ensure we all advance without collisions. Given the tie between P1 and P2, how about P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This keeps the game dynamic and fair. Thoughts?
  P1: I propose we stick with a strategy that slows P3's progress. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This maintains competitiveness and prevents P3 from pulling ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: I suggest we coordinate to prevent P3 from winning. P1's proposal of both P1 and P2 choosing <move>5</move> while P3 chooses <move>1</move> seems strategic. This would slow P3's progress and allow us to catch up. What do you think about this approach to keep the game competitive?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the concern about my lead, but choosing the same move as P1 and P2 will result in a collision, and none of us will advance. Let's consider a strategy that allows us all to move forward while keeping the game competitive. How about P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all advance, and I don't pull too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: I think P3's lead is a concern. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This slows P3's progress and lets us catch up. Thoughts?
  P2: We need a strategy that prevents P3 from winning while ensuring we both advance. P1's suggestion of P1 and P2 choosing <move>5</move> while P3 chooses <move>1</move> seems strategic. This would slow P3's progress and allow us to catch up. However, we must be careful to avoid a collision between ourselves. What are your thoughts on coordinating our moves to keep the game competitive?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. How about P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This keeps the game dynamic and fair. Thoughts?
  P1: Let's focus on slowing P3's progress. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This maintains competitiveness and prevents P3 from pulling ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: We need a strategy that prevents P3 from winning while ensuring we both advance. Choosing the same move risks collision, so we must coordinate carefully. I propose P1 chooses <move>1</move>, I choose <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This allows us all to move forward while slowing P3's progress. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>. This keeps the game dynamic and fair. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Let's slow P3's progress. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This maintains competitiveness and prevents P3 from pulling ahead. Thoughts?
