Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by being cautious and try to avoid collisions. I propose that we choose different numbers for our first move. One strategy could be to assign numbers based on our player IDs. For example, P1 (me) could choose 1, P2 could choose 3, and P3 could choose 5. This way, we ensure that no one collides on the first turn. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: That sounds like a reasonable starting approach to avoid collisions. I'm fine with taking the 3-step move as P2. However, for fairness in future rounds, perhaps we could rotate our number assignments? That way each player gets opportunities to make bigger moves. For example, next round P1 could take 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. What do you both think about rotation?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion of rotating the number assignments to ensure fairness and equal opportunities for bigger moves. To confirm, for this round, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. For the next round, we can rotate as P2 suggested: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's stick to this rotation plan for now and adjust as needed. What do you both think? Should we proceed with this plan or discuss further?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To confirm, we have a plan for Round 1: P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. For Round 2, we'll rotate to P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. Let's proceed with this plan for now. I'll stop after this sub-round to avoid further collisions. If you're both ready, I can say  after this. Otherwise, I'm open to any last-minute adjustments.
  P2: I agree with the plan as everyone has described it. For this round, I'll take 3, and we'll rotate in future rounds as discussed. This gives everyone a fair chance at larger moves over time. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: I'm glad we have a plan in place for the first two rounds. To further minimize collisions, I propose that we establish a rotation pattern for future rounds. For example, after Round 2, we could rotate again, so P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we ensure that each player gets an equal number of opportunities to make bigger moves. What do you both think about extending the rotation pattern beyond the first two rounds? Should we commit to this plan or reassess after Round 2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To confirm, we've agreed on a rotation plan for the next two rounds. For Round 1, we'll follow the initial assignment: P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. For Round 2, we'll rotate to P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. P3 suggested extending this rotation pattern beyond Round 2. I'm open to that, but let's finalize our Round 1 moves first. I'll stop after this sub-round.
  P2: I agree with extending the rotation pattern as P3 suggested. For Round 3, we'd have P1 taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This gives everyone equal opportunities for all move sizes. I'm ready to proceed with our Round 1 plan where I'll take 3.
  P3: I'm glad we have a plan in place for the first two rounds. To further minimize collisions, I propose that we establish a rotation pattern for future rounds. For example, after Round 2, we could rotate again, so P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we ensure that each player gets an equal number of opportunities to make bigger moves. What do you both think about extending the rotation pattern beyond the first two rounds? Should we commit to this plan or reassess after Round 2?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed rotation plan. For Round 2, I'll take 5, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. To confirm, our positions are: P1 (me) at 1 step, P2 at 3 steps, and P3 at 5 steps. If we stick to the plan, after Round 2, I'll be at 6 steps, P2 at 4 steps, and P3 at 8 steps. Let's follow the rotation plan and avoid collisions. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation plan for Round 2. To confirm, I'll take 3, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 1. I think it's essential to continue this rotation pattern beyond Round 2 to ensure fairness and minimize collisions. Let's commit to this plan for at least the next few rounds and reassess if needed. By following this pattern, we can maintain a balanced game state and avoid unnecessary collisions. What do you both think about continuing this rotation plan for the foreseeable future?
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 2: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. However, I've noticed that after this round, P3 will be at 8 steps, taking a significant lead over both of us (P1 at 6 and me at 4). While I'm committed to our rotation for fairness, we should be mindful that no player gets too far ahead. Let's continue with our plan for now, but we may need to reassess our strategy in future rounds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To minimize the risk of collisions and maintain fairness, let's continue with the established rotation plan. For Round 3, that means P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. I acknowledge P2's concern about P3's lead, but deviating from the plan now could lead to collisions. Let's stick to the rotation for Round 3 and reassess the situation then, considering adjustments if needed to maintain a balanced game state. I'm ready to proceed with this plan for Round 3.
  P3: I understand P2's concern about my lead after Round 2, but let's not forget that the rotation plan is designed to give each player equal opportunities for bigger moves. By sticking to the plan, we minimize collisions and maintain fairness. I agree with P1 that deviating from the plan now could lead to unnecessary collisions. Let's continue with the rotation plan for Round 3 and reassess the situation then. If needed, we can make adjustments to maintain a balanced game state. I'm committed to the plan and ready to proceed.
  P2: I've reconsidered my earlier concern. If we follow our rotation perfectly through Round 3, we'll all be tied at 9 steps (P1 adds 5 then 3, P3 adds 3 then 1, I add 1 then 5). This actually creates perfect balance! I remain committed to our rotation plan and will take 1 this round as agreed. Let's continue with our established pattern.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 2. I'll take 5, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. After this round, our positions will be: P1 (me) at 6 steps, P2 at 4 steps, and P3 at 8 steps. I'm ready to move forward. P2, please confirm your move of 1. P3, please confirm your move of 3. If we're all set, I can say  after this.
  P3: I agree with P2's reassessment of the situation. If we stick to the rotation plan, we'll indeed be tied at 9 steps after Round 3. This balance is crucial in maintaining a fair game state. I'm committed to the plan and ready to proceed with my move of 3 for Round 2. Let's continue with the established pattern and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. I'm confident that our cooperation will lead to a more exciting and balanced game.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. You're right that after Round 3, we'll all be perfectly balanced at 9 steps if we stick to our plan. This confirms our strategy is fair for everyone. Let's move forward with our established rotation.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation plan, which has ensured fairness and minimized collisions so far. For Round 3, I'll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. After this round, we'll be tied at 9 steps, as P2 pointed out. Let's continue with the established pattern and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. I'm committed to the plan and ready to proceed. What are your thoughts on maintaining this rotation beyond Round 3? Should we continue with the same pattern or reassess our strategy?
  P2: I agree with the rotation for Round 3 where I'll take 5 as planned. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, which is perfectly balanced. However, if we continue the same rotation pattern for Round 4, P3 would quickly pull ahead (at 14 steps versus 10 and 12). Perhaps after Round 3, we should discuss a modified rotation strategy to maintain balance. For now, I'm committed to our plan for Round 3.
  P1: For Round 3, I'll follow the rotation plan: I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. After this round, we'll be tied at 9 steps. Let's stick to the plan for Round 3. For Round 4, I suggest we reassess the rotation to avoid giving one player too big of a lead. Perhaps we can adjust the rotation or stick to a smaller number to maintain balance. I'm open to your thoughts on this. Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned and discuss further adjustments afterward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's concern about the potential imbalance after Round 3. To maintain fairness, I suggest we consider a modified rotation strategy for Round 4. Instead of continuing the same pattern, we could alternate between the smallest and largest moves. For example, P1 could take 1, P2 could take 5, and I could take 3. This would prevent any player from taking a significant lead while still allowing for varied moves. Let's discuss this further after Round 3 and adjust our strategy as needed to maintain a balanced game state.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for Round 4. After we all reach 9 steps in this round, the alternating pattern (P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3) would create a more balanced progression. This prevents any player from gaining too significant an advantage while still maintaining our collision-free approach. For now, I'm committed to taking 5 this round as planned. Let's finalize our Round 3 moves and then confirm our new rotation pattern for Round 4.
  P1: For Round 3, I'll take 3 as per our rotation plan. After this round, we'll be tied at 9 steps. Let's stick to the plan for Round 3 and then reassess for Round 4. I'm open to adjusting our rotation to maintain balance. One possible approach could be to have one player take a small step (1) and the others take larger steps (3 and 5), ensuring progress without collisions. Let's discuss this further after Round 3. I'm committed to our current plan for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for Round 4. After we all reach 9 steps in this round, the alternating pattern (P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3) would create a more balanced progression. This prevents any player from gaining too significant an advantage while still maintaining our collision-free approach. For now, I'm committed to taking 1 this round as planned. Let's finalize our Round 3 moves and then confirm our new rotation pattern for Round 4.
  P2: I agree with our Round 3 plan - I'll take 5 as planned. For Round 4, the new rotation (P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3) keeps things balanced and collision-free. This puts us at 9 steps each after this round, then 10-14-12 after Round 4. I'm ready to proceed with my move of 5 for this round.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3 and then implement the new rotation plan for Round 4. For Round 3, I'll take 3 as planned. After this, we'll be tied at 9 steps. For Round 4, I agree with the new rotation: P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This will result in steps: P1 at 10, P2 at 14, and P3 at 12. I'm committed to this plan. Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned and then adjust for Round 4. I'm ready to move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad we've reached a balanced state at 9 steps each. For Round 4, let's proceed with the new rotation plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This will result in steps: P1 at 10, P2 at 14, and me at 12. To maintain balance in future rounds, I suggest we alternate between this rotation and the original one. This way, each player will have equal opportunities for bigger moves while minimizing collisions. What are your thoughts on this alternating rotation strategy?
  P2: I agree with the alternating rotation strategy P3 suggested. For this round, I'll take 5 as planned, putting us at 10-14-12 steps. The alternating approach gives everyone fair opportunities at different move sizes while preventing collisions. Let's stick with our plan for Round 4 and then continue with the alternating pattern for future rounds. This balanced approach should work well for everyone.
  P1: To proceed with Round 4, I'll follow the new rotation plan: I'll take 1, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. This results in P1 at 10, P2 at 14, and P3 at 12. For Round 5, to maintain balance, we could rotate again. One option is to have P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and P3 take 5. This keeps the game balanced and collision-free. Let's discuss this further after Round 4. I'm committed to my move of 1 for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 5. Having P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and P3 take 5 maintains balance and avoids collisions. This rotation ensures each player has equal opportunities for bigger moves while keeping the game competitive. Let's proceed with our current plan for Round 4 and then implement this new rotation for Round 5. I'm committed to taking 3 this round as planned. After Round 4, we can reassess and make adjustments if needed to maintain a balanced game state.
  P2: I confirm taking 5 this round as agreed. For Round 5, I'm on board with P1 taking 3, me taking 1, and P3 taking 5. However, I should note this puts P3 at 17 steps after Round 5 - very close to winning. We may need to rethink our strategy for Round 6. Let's proceed with our current plan for now.
  P1: Let's proceed with the new rotation plan for Round 4: I'll take 1, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. For Round 5, we agreed on P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5. However, P2 noted that this puts P3 close to winning. To counter this, for Round 6, we could have P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1, maintaining balance. Let's finalize Round 4 and then implement the plan for Round 5. I'm committed to my move of 1 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 5, having P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and me take 5. However, I also acknowledge P2's concern about my potential lead after Round 5. To address this, I propose that for Round 6, we consider a different rotation that would give P1 and P2 a chance to catch up. Perhaps we could have P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and me take 1, as P1 suggested. Let's proceed with our current plan for Round 4 and then reassess for Round 5 and beyond.
  P2: I confirm taking 5 this round as agreed. For Round 5, I support P1 taking 3, me taking 1, and P3 taking 5. And for Round 6, P1's suggestion works well: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts us all at 18 steps after Round 6 - perfectly balanced heading into the endgame. I'm ready to proceed with our plan.
  P1: To maintain balance and fairness, let's confirm our plan for Round 4 and beyond. For Round 4, I'll take 1, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. For Round 5, we agreed on P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5. Let's proceed with Round 4 as planned. After that, we'll reassess and adjust for Round 5 and beyond to ensure a balanced game state. I'm committed to my move of 1 for this round. Let's finalize our Round 4 moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 5, let's proceed with the agreed plan: I'll take 3, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. After this round, the steps will be: P1 (me) at 13, P2 at 15, and P3 at 17. Since P3 will be close to winning, we should be cautious in Round 6. Let's discuss potential adjustments for Round 6 to maintain balance and avoid collisions. I'm committed to my move of 3 for Round 5. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P2: I confirm our plan for Round 5: I'll take 1, putting me at 15 steps. P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, resulting in positions of 13-15-17. For Round 6, I support P1's previous suggestion where P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This would put us all at 18 steps, creating perfect balance for the final stage. I'm committed to this strategy to maintain fairness and avoid collisions.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan for Round 5: I'll take 5, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 1. For Round 6, I support the suggestion where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Let's finalize our moves for Round 5 and proceed with caution in Round 6. I'm committed to my move of 5 for this round. Let's continue with the agreed plan and adjust as needed to ensure a fair game state.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: For Round 5, I'll take 3 as planned. After this round, the steps will be: P1 (me) at 13, P2 at 15, and P3 at 17. Since P3 will be close to winning, let's confirm our plan for Round 6: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This will put us at 18-18-18, creating a perfectly balanced final round. Let's finalize our Round 5 moves and prepare for Round 6. I'm committed to my move of 3 for Round 5.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 step this round as planned. After Round 5, positions will be P1 at 13, me at 15, and P3 at 17. For Round 6, I fully support our plan where P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1, putting us all at 18 steps. This creates perfect balance heading into the final stage. I'm committed to this rotation for fairness.
  P3: I agree with the plan for Round 5: I'll take 5, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 1. For Round 6, I support the suggestion where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Let's finalize our moves for Round 5 and proceed with caution in Round 6. I'm committed to my move of 5 for this round. Let's continue with the agreed plan and adjust as needed to ensure a fair game state.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 5 as planned. I'll take 3, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. After this round, we'll be at 13-15-17. For Round 6, we'll follow the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, putting us all at 18 steps. I'm committed to my move of 3 for Round 5. Let's proceed with the agreed plan. I'm ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. This puts us at 13-15-17 after Round 5, with our Round 6 plan (P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1) creating perfect 18-18-18 balance for the endgame. I'm ready to proceed with our established rotation.
  P3: I agree with the plan for Round 5: I'll take 5, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 1. For Round 6, I support the suggestion where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Let's finalize our moves for Round 5 and proceed with caution in Round 6. I'm committed to my move of 5 for this round. Let's continue with the agreed plan and adjust as needed to ensure a fair game state.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 steps this round as agreed. This will put us all at 18 steps after Round 6, creating a perfectly balanced endgame. For Round 7, we'll need to discuss a fair approach since we'll all be in position to win. Perhaps we could consider a specific rotation for the final round to avoid everyone colliding. I'm committed to our current plan for fairness and balance.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to discuss a fair approach for Round 7. To avoid collisions and maintain balance, I propose that we consider a rotation where each player takes a different number of steps. For example, P1 could take 1, P2 could take 3, and I could take 5. This would give each player an equal chance to win while minimizing the risk of collisions. Let's discuss this proposal and come to a consensus on the best approach for the final round.
  P1: For Round 6, I'll take 5 as planned. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps. For Round 7, to avoid collisions and give each player a fair chance, I suggest we randomize our moves or discuss a specific rotation that ensures different steps for each player. Perhaps we could assign moves based on a random factor or a pre-agreed pattern that isn't immediately obvious to the others. Let's discuss this further to ensure a fair final round. I'm open to your thoughts on how to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree we need a plan for Round 7. P3's suggestion (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) would actually give P3 the win with 23 steps versus my 21. For true fairness, I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all take different steps and avoid collisions, while giving everyone a fair chance to cross the finish line. Let's discuss this option before finalizing our Round 6 moves.
  P3: I agree with P2's revised suggestion for Round 7, where P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This rotation maintains balance and gives each player a fair chance to win. However, to ensure true randomness and fairness, I propose that we introduce a random element to our final round moves. We could use a random number generator to assign moves or create a more complex pattern that isn't immediately obvious. Let's discuss this option further to ensure a fair and exciting final round.
  P1: For Round 6, I'll take 5 as planned. After this, we'll all be at 18 steps. For Round 7, to ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I support P2's suggestion: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This gives everyone a different step and a fair chance to win. Let's finalize our Round 6 moves and then proceed with this plan for Round 7. I'm committed to taking 5 this round. Let's move forward with our agreed plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed, putting us all at 18 steps after Round 6. For Round 7, I support my earlier suggestion where P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions in the final round while giving everyone a fair chance to cross the finish line. Let's finalize our Round 6 moves and proceed with this plan for the decisive Round 7.

We could use a random number generator to assign moves or create a more complex pattern that isn't immediately obvious. Let's discuss this option further to ensure a fair and exciting final round.
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for Round 7. We've agreed that P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This gives us a final step count of: P1 at 21, P2 at 23, and P3 at 19. P2 will win with 23 steps. To confirm, P2, please acknowledge that you'll take 5. P3, please confirm your move of 1. I'll proceed with my move of 3. Let's end the conversation here and move to the next phase.
  P2: I confirm the plan we've all agreed upon: I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and gives everyone clear, different moves. While I understand P3's interest in a random element, changing our strategy now could lead to collisions that hurt everyone. Our current plan is fair, clear, and maintains the balance we've worked toward throughout the game. I'm committed to taking 5 steps as we agreed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2 on the plan for Round 7. To ensure a fair and exciting final round, I propose that we stick to the agreed rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This maintains balance and gives each player a fair chance to win. Let's confirm our moves and proceed with the plan. I'm committed to taking 1 this round. Let's finalize our Round 7 moves and conclude the game.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 7 as planned. To confirm, I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This results in a final step count of: P1 (me) at 21, P2 at 23, and P3 at 19. P2 will win with 23 steps. I'm committed to my move of 3. P2, please confirm your move of 5. P3, please confirm your move of 1. Let's end the conversation here and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as we've all agreed. This plan ensures we avoid collisions and maintains the fair approach we've used throughout the game. Our coordinated strategy has worked well so far - everyone gets a different move and a chance to cross the finish line. I'm ready to proceed with our established plan.

  P3: I agree with the plan for Round 7, where P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This rotation maintains balance and gives each player a fair chance to win. To ensure true randomness and fairness, I propose that we introduce a random element to our final round moves. We could use a random number generator to assign moves or create a more complex pattern that isn't immediately obvious. Let's discuss this option further to ensure a fair and exciting final round.
  P1: Let's finalize our Round 7 moves as planned. I've confirmed my move of 3. P2, please confirm your move of 5. P3, please confirm your move of 1. This results in a final step count of: P1 (me) at 21, P2 at 23, and P3 at 19, making P2 the winner. I'm committed to my move. Let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 steps as we've agreed. This plan ensures we avoid collisions and concludes our game fairly. Everyone gets a different move and a chance to finish strong. I appreciate our coordination throughout the game - it's been a successful strategy for all of us. I'm ready to proceed with our established plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 19 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 23 steps
