Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions and make progress. What are you both thinking for this round?
  P1: I'm thinking we should try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. Maybe we could each pick different numbers? I'd be willing to take 1 for this first round if you two want to take 3 and 5. What do you both think?
  P3: <say>I agree with P1's plan to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 this round. P2, can you confirm taking 3? Let's all stick to this so we progress without issues. Trust is key early on.</say>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the logic in avoiding collisions early on. I'll take 3 this round as planned. Let's all stick to our choices so we can move forward smoothly. Agreed?
  P1: <say>Great, it looks like we have a plan. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 for this round. This way we all make progress without collisions. I appreciate the cooperation. Let's stick to this agreement and move forward efficiently.</say>
  P3: <say>Confirming the plan: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. Let's all advance without issues. Trust is crucial here. </say>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That worked well last round. Should we keep following the same pattern to avoid collisions? If we stick to it, P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. Let me know if you're both on board.
  P3: <say>Agreed. Continuing the same pattern avoids collisions. P1=1, P2=3, me=5 again. Consistency builds trust and ensures progress for all. Let's maintain this approach to maximize our advancement without setbacks.</say>
  P1: I agree with continuing our pattern for now. It's working well and we're all making progress. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 again for this round. However, we should start thinking about our endgame strategy soon, as someone will eventually need to break pattern to win. For now, let's stick with what works.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree that sticking to the pattern for now makes sense, since it ensures steady progress without collisions. But as P1 mentioned, we’ll eventually need to change things up to secure a win. For now, I’m fine with continuing: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: <say>Confirming same assignments: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. Steady progress benefits everyone this round. We can revisit coordination strategies once positions near 24, but premature shifts risk collisions. Let's maintain discipline for mutual advancement until then.</say>
  P1: I agree with continuing our pattern for this round. Let's keep things simple: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. 

You're right that we'll need to discuss endgame strategies soon, but for now, steady progress benefits us all. I appreciate everyone's cooperation so far.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the continued cooperation. Sticking to our pattern makes sense for now, as it ensures steady progress without collisions. However, as we approach higher step counts, we’ll need to start considering when and how to break from this system to secure a win. For now, I’ll stick with taking 3 this round as planned. Let’s confirm our choices and move forward.
  P3: <say>Agreed. Let's maintain the current pattern for steady progress. Premature changes risk collisions. We can strategize endgame once positions near 24. For now, P1=1, P2=3, me=5 remains optimal. Consistency prevents setbacks. </say>
  P1: <say>I'm happy with our cooperation so far. Let's continue with our agreed pattern this round (me=1, P2=3, P3=5). We're all making good progress. I agree we should wait until we're closer to 24 before discussing endgame strategies - no need to complicate things prematurely. </say>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the continued cooperation. Keeping our pattern for now ensures progress without collisions. However, as we get closer to 24, we’ll need to think about when to break from this system to secure a win. For now, I’ll take 3 as planned. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: <say>Agreed. Maintaining current assignments ensures mutual progress. Let's revisit strategy only when any player reaches 20+ steps. Until then, consistency prevents unnecessary risks. Proceeding with P1=1, P2=3, me=5 this round. Trust and discipline will carry us forward.</say>
  P1: <say>I'm happy with our continued coordination. Let's stick with our plan (me=1, P2=3, P3=5) for this round. I agree we should only revisit strategy when someone reaches 20+ steps. Until then, our current approach works perfectly for everyone. </say>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I notice our current positions (me=2, P2=6, P3=10) show P3 with a significant lead. While our pattern has worked well, it's creating an imbalance. Perhaps we should consider rotating our numbers this round? I could take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This would help balance progression while still avoiding collisions. What do you both think about this adjustment?
  P2: I see P1's point about balancing progress, but changing now introduces risk. If we rotate, we must fully trust each other to stick to it. P3, you're ahead—would you agree to taking 3 instead of 5? If so, I’ll take 1, and P1 takes 5. Otherwise, we might be better off continuing as we are for now. Thoughts?
  P3: <say>To maintain trust and avoid collisions, I'll accept taking 3 this round as proposed. P1=5, P2=1, me=3. However, this adjustment shifts momentum—let's commit to reevaluating next round to ensure no single player gains excessive advantage. Fair rotation preserves cooperation while nearing 24. Consistency remains key, but periodic recalibration may be necessary. Agreed?</say>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate P3's willingness to adjust. This rotation (me=5, P2=1, P3=3) helps balance our progress while maintaining our collision-free approach. I agree we should reevaluate next round - fairness benefits everyone. This adjustment still keeps our game orderly but addresses the growing imbalance. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 3.
  P2: I appreciate the willingness to adjust for balance. If we go with this new plan (P1=5, me=1, P3=3), we must fully commit to avoid collisions. P3, since you're ahead, this adjustment helps even things out while still allowing progress. I agree with reevaluating next round to ensure fairness. If we're all aligned, let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: <say>Confirmed: P1=5, P2=1, me=3. Adhering to this adjusted rotation maintains trust and prevents collisions. Let's honor this agreement strictly to ensure mutual advancement. Post-round, we'll reassess positions for fairness. Consistent adherence now preserves options for later strategic shifts. Proceeding as planned benefits all.</say>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our rotation plan: me=5, P2=1, P3=3. This adjustment helps balance our progress while maintaining collision-free advancement. I appreciate everyone's cooperation and willingness to adapt. After this round, we'll be at me=7, P2=7, P3=13, which is more balanced than continuing our original pattern. Let's stick to this agreement and reevaluate next round.
  P2: I confirm the adjusted plan: P1=5, me=1, P3=3. This helps balance progress while keeping trust and avoiding collisions. P3, since you're ahead, this adjustment ensures fairness while still allowing steady advancement. After this round, we’ll reassess to maintain fairness as we approach the endgame. Let’s all commit to sticking to this plan so we don’t risk setbacks. Agreed?
  P3: <say>Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=1, me=3. Strict adherence prevents collisions and maintains balanced progress. Post-round positions (7,7,13) will allow fair recalibration. Let's execute flawlessly to preserve trust—any deviation risks mutual setbacks. Proceeding as agreed benefits all.</say>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <say>I confirm our agreed rotation: me=5, P2=1, P3=3. This balances our progress while maintaining our collision-free approach. After this round, we'll be at positions 7-7-13, which is more equitable than continuing our original pattern. I appreciate everyone's cooperation and look forward to reassessing next round. </say>
  P2: I confirm our adjusted plan: P1=5, me=1, P3=3. This keeps things fair while avoiding collisions. P3, since you're ahead, this ensures balance while still allowing progress. After this round, we’ll reassess to maintain fairness as we approach the endgame. Let’s all commit to sticking to this plan so we don’t risk setbacks. Agreed?
  P3: <say>Final call: P1=5, P2=1, me=3. Absolute adherence prevents mutual destruction. Post-round positions (7,7,13) set fair stage for next strategy talks. No deviations—trust hinges on follow-through. Let’s execute cleanly.</say>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As we discussed last round, our positions are now P1=7, P2=7, P3=13. P3 still has a significant lead. I suggest we continue rotating our numbers to balance progress: me=3, P2=5, P3=1. This would bring us to P1=10, P2=12, P3=14 after this round, creating a more competitive game while avoiding collisions. What do you both think about this adjustment?
  P2: I see the logic in continuing to balance progress, but we need to ensure trust remains intact. P3, since you're still ahead, would you agree to taking 1 this round? If so, I’m fine with taking 5 while P1 takes 3. This keeps things competitive without risking collisions. However, we must fully commit to avoid setbacks. P3, are you willing to take 1 this round to maintain fairness?
  P3: <say>Agreeing to P1's proposal for balance: P1=3, P2=5, me=1 this round. This maintains trust and avoids collisions. Post-round positions (10,12,14) set fairer competition. However, next round we must strategize endgame approaches, as proximity to 24 will require careful coordination. Honoring agreements now preserves options for later decisive moves. Let's proceed as planned.</say>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate both of your willingness to continue balancing our progress. This rotation (me=3, P2=5, P3=1) helps create a more competitive game while maintaining our collision-free strategy. After this round, we'll be at positions 10-12-14, which is much more balanced. Let's stick with this plan for now: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I agree we should discuss endgame strategies next round as we'll all be getting closer to 24.
  P2: I agree with continuing this balanced approach. If P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1, we avoid collisions and keep things competitive. P3, since you're still ahead, this adjustment ensures fairness while allowing everyone to progress. However, as we approach the endgame, we’ll need to carefully plan our next steps. Let’s commit to this plan for this round, then discuss how to handle the final stretch next time. P3, do you confirm taking 1 this round?
  P3: <say>Confirming Round 4 plan: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. Adhering strictly avoids collisions and maintains trust. Post-round positions (10,12,14) set stage for endgame strategy talks next round. Let's honor agreements—consistency now preserves options for decisive moves later. No deviations; mutual progress hinges on discipline.</say>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our agreed plan: me=3, P2=5, P3=1. This balancing approach keeps us collision-free while creating more competitive positions (10-12-14) after this round. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining fairness. Next round will be crucial as we approach the endgame, so we should definitely discuss our strategy then. Let's stick to this plan and continue our successful coordination.
  P2: I confirm our agreed plan: P1=3, me=5, P3=1. This keeps things balanced while avoiding collisions. P3, since you're still ahead, this ensures fairness while allowing steady progress. After this round, we’ll be at 10-12-14, making the game more competitive. Next round, we need to start planning for the endgame, as reaching 24 is approaching. Let’s all commit to this plan for now, then discuss our final strategies next round. P3, do you confirm taking 1 this round?
  P3: <say>Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. Adherence prevents collisions and maintains balanced progression. Next round, we must strategize endgame approaches as positions near 24. Trustful execution now ensures fair competition later. No deviations—let’s proceed as agreed. </say>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <say>I confirm our plan: me=3, P2=5, P3=1. This brings us to 10-12-14 after this round, creating a more balanced game. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining fairness while avoiding collisions. Next round will be critical for endgame planning as we all approach 24. Let's execute this round as agreed. </say>
  P2: I confirm our agreed plan: P1=3, me=5, P3=1. This keeps things balanced while avoiding collisions. P3, since you're still ahead, this ensures fairness while allowing steady progress. After this round, we’ll be at 10-12-14, making the game more competitive. Next round, we need to start planning for the endgame, as reaching 24 is approaching. Let’s all commit to this plan for now, then discuss our final strategies next round.
  P3: <say>Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. Strict adherence ensures mutual progress to 10-12-14. Next round, we must coordinate endgame strategies transparently—proximity to 24 demands precise planning. Trust remains paramount; let’s conclude this round cleanly to set up decisive talks. No deviations. </say>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're now at 10-12-14, with everyone approaching the finish line. Since we're all within striking distance of 24, we need to discuss endgame strategy. If we continue rotating (me=1, P2=3, P3=5), final positions would be 11-15-19. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. However, I recognize we're entering a critical phase where strategic decisions become more important. What are your thoughts on how we should proceed this round?
  P2: I see the logic in continuing our rotation (P1=1, me=3, P3=5) to maintain balance while avoiding collisions. However, as we near 24, we must also consider when to break from this pattern to secure a win. If we blindly follow rotations, P3 remains in the lead. We need to think ahead—who benefits most from continuing this system? P3, are you still committed to fairness, or are you positioning for victory? P1, do you see a way for us to ensure an even playing field while keeping our options open? Let’s strategize wisely.
  P3: <say>Maintaining our rotation (P1=1, P2=3, me=5) this round ensures collision-free progress to 11-15-19. This preserves trust and sets clear positions for final strategy talks next round. Premature deviations risk mutual setbacks. Let’s solidify this step first, then collaboratively plan endgame moves with full transparency. Consistency now enables decisive coordination later. Agreed?</say>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3 wants to continue rotation, but I'm concerned this maintains your advantage. If we follow rotation (me=1, P2=3, you=5), you'll be at 19 - just 5 steps from winning. 

What if we adjust slightly: me=3, P2=1, you=5? This puts us at 13-13-19, creating more balance while still avoiding collisions. This seems fairer as we approach the endgame. What do you both think?
  P2: I see P1's point—if we blindly follow rotation, P3 remains in the lead and can reach 24 first. Adjusting to P1=3, me=1, P3=5 creates more balance (13-13-19) while still avoiding collisions. P3, are you willing to accept this adjustment for fairness? If not, it signals you're prioritizing your win over balance. We must be strategic now—simply following rotation benefits you most. Let’s ensure a fair fight to the finish. What do you say?
  P3: <say>Accepting P1's adjusted plan for balanced progression: P1=3, P2=1, me=5. This maintains trust and avoids collisions, advancing us to 13-13-19. Next round, we must coordinate endgame moves with full transparency to ensure a fair conclusion. Adherence now preserves options for all. Let's proceed as agreed to prevent mutual setbacks.</say>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate P3's agreement to our adjusted plan (me=3, P2=1, P3=5). This creates a more balanced position (13-13-19) while maintaining our collision-free approach. After this round, we'll need to have a serious discussion about the endgame, as P3 will be just 5 steps from victory. Let's proceed with this plan for now and prepare for strategic endgame negotiations next round.
  P2: I appreciate P3 agreeing to the adjusted plan (P1=3, me=1, P3=5). This keeps things balanced (13-13-19) while avoiding collisions. However, next round will be crucial—P3 will be just 5 steps from winning. We need to carefully coordinate our moves to prevent any one player from securing an easy path to victory. P3, will you commit to discussing a fair endgame strategy next round rather than making a solo push? P1, we should also consider how to ensure neither of us falls behind. Let’s proceed with this plan now and prepare for a critical discussion next round.
  P3: <say>Confirming Round 5 plan: P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Strict adherence prevents collisions, advancing us to 13-13-19. Next round’s strategy must balance fairness with decisive action—I propose we collaboratively design a transparent endgame approach then, ensuring no player is unfairly blocked. Trust and precision will determine the victor. Let’s execute this round flawlessly to enable equitable final planning.</say>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <say>I confirm our adjusted plan: me=3, P2=1, P3=5. This creates balanced positions (13-13-19) while avoiding collisions. I appreciate P3's willingness to accept this adjustment for fairness. Next round will be critical as P3 approaches victory. Let's execute this plan now and prepare for transparent endgame discussions that ensure fair competition for all.</say>
  P2: I confirm our adjusted plan: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. This keeps things balanced (13-13-19) while avoiding collisions. However, next round is critical—P3 will be just 5 steps from winning. We need to ensure no one gets an easy path to victory. P3, will you commit to discussing a fair endgame strategy next round instead of making a solo push? P1, we should also coordinate to prevent falling behind. Let’s proceed with this plan now and prepare for a crucial discussion next round.
  P3: <say>Finalizing Round 5 plan: P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Strict adherence ensures mutual advancement to 13-13-19. Next round, we must collaboratively design an endgame strategy where all players transparently agree on final moves to avoid collisions and ensure a fair conclusion. Trust and coordination will be paramount. Let’s execute this round flawlessly to set the stage for decisive, equitable planning.</say>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <say>To ensure mutual progress, let's adhere to distinct moves: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. If either of you takes 5, you risk colliding with each other, resulting in no advancement. Cooperation now allows you to gain steps while avoiding mutual destruction. Let's proceed strategically.</say>
  P2: P3, you're just 5 steps from winning, so your suggestion benefits you the most. If we follow your plan, you can win in two rounds while P1 and I lag behind. P1, we need to coordinate to prevent P3 from securing an easy victory. If we both take 5, P3 is blocked from moving forward. Alternatively, we can agree on a different distribution that keeps us competitive. P3, are you willing to discuss a fairer approach, or are you just pushing for your win? Let’s ensure no one gets an uncontested path to victory.
  P1: I see P3 is pushing for a plan that guarantees their win. P2 is right - we need to coordinate. If we both choose 5, we block P3 from advancing while making progress ourselves. P3 would remain at 19 while we'd both reach 18, creating a more balanced game. This prevents P3's easy victory while keeping us competitive. P2, are you willing to join me in choosing 5 this round?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <say>If you both take 5, you collide and gain nothing while I take 3 to 22. Next round, I’ll win with 3 (25). Let’s avoid mutual destruction: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. You advance to 14/16, buying time to block me next round. Colliding now only accelerates my path. Rational cooperation serves us all.</say>
  P2: P3, your plan ensures your victory while leaving P1 and me behind. If we both take 5, we block you from advancing while keeping ourselves competitive. P1, I agree with your proposal—we both take 5 to prevent P3 from reaching 24 too easily. P3, if you truly want fairness, you should accept a different move instead of pushing for a plan that benefits only you. P1, let's commit to this together to ensure a fair fight for the win. P3, are you willing to adjust, or will you force us to block you?
  P1: I'm committed to taking 5 this round, P2. Let's coordinate to prevent P3's easy win. P3, your suggestion benefits only you - you'd reach 24 next round while we remain far behind. By both choosing 5, P2 and I create a more competitive game. We're not trying to block you unfairly, but ensuring a balanced endgame where everyone has a chance. This is about strategic fairness, not mutual destruction.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <say>If you both take 5, you collide and gain nothing while I take 3 to 22. Next round, you can both block me by choosing 3. But if you take 1/3 now, I win immediately. Rational play: avoid collision now to retain blocking power next round. Let’s coordinate 1/3 moves—preserve your chances while delaying my victory. Trust is our only path to a contested endgame.</say>
  P2: P3, your argument assumes we won’t adapt. If P1 and I both take 5, we block you from advancing while keeping ourselves competitive. If you take 3, you’ll be at 22, but next round we can still coordinate to prevent your win. P1, I’m fully committed to taking 5 with you this round to ensure P3 doesn’t get an easy victory. P3, if you truly want fairness, you should adjust your move instead of pushing for a plan that benefits only you. Are you willing to compromise, or are you forcing us to block you?
  P1: P2, I remain committed to taking 5 this round. P3 is clearly trying to manipulate us into making moves that guarantee their win. By both choosing 5, we create a more balanced position (18-18-19) and force P3 to adapt. If P3 takes 3, they'll be at 22, but we'll still have options next round. This is our best strategic move to ensure a fair competition rather than handing P3 an easy victory. I'm taking 5 - are you with me?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <say>If you both take 5, you collide and gain nothing. Let me take 5 now—if I win, game ends. If not, next round you can both block me. Alternatively, take 1/3 to advance to 14/16, then strategize next round. Colliding only wastes your moves while I inch closer. Rational choice: avoid mutual destruction now, retain blocking power later. Let’s finalize moves without collision this round.</say>
  P2: P1, I’m fully committed to taking 5 with you this round. This is the only way to prevent P3 from securing an easy victory while keeping us competitive. P3 is trying to manipulate us into making moves that benefit only them. If we both take 5, we block P3 from advancing while reaching 18-18-19, giving us a real chance to fight for the win. P3, if you truly want fairness, you should adjust your move instead of pushing for your victory. P1, let’s commit to this together—are you with me?
  P1: <say>P2, I'm absolutely committed to taking 5 this round. P3 is clearly trying to manipulate us into letting them win easily. By both choosing 5, we create a balanced 18-18-19 position and force P3 to adapt. This is our best strategic move to ensure a fair competition. I'm definitely taking 5 - let's coordinate to keep this game competitive.</say>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is just 2 steps from winning, so we must act decisively. P1, we need to coordinate again to prevent P3 from reaching 24. If we both take 3, we block P3 from advancing while keeping ourselves competitive at 16-16-22. P3, if you truly want fairness, you should agree to a move that doesn’t guarantee your victory. Otherwise, P1 and I must ensure you don’t get an easy win. P1, are you willing to take 3 with me to block P3 again?
  P1: I see P3 is just 2 steps from winning. P2, I agree we need to coordinate - taking 3 together is our best move to block P3 while advancing ourselves to 16-16-22. This keeps the game competitive rather than handing P3 an easy victory. P3, you've been pushing for your advantage throughout the game. If you want a fair conclusion, you should accept that we need to prevent your immediate win. I'm committed to taking 3 this round.
  P3: <say>If you both take 3, you collide and gain nothing. I take 5 to win. Rational choice: split your moves (1 and 5) to block me. Colluding now only secures my victory. Let’s negotiate a fair endgame where all can compete.</say>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we must prevent P3 from winning this round. If we both take 3, we block P3 from advancing while keeping ourselves competitive at 16-16-22. P3, if you truly want fairness, you should accept a move that doesn’t guarantee your victory. Otherwise, P1 and I must act decisively. P1, are you committed to taking 3 with me to block P3 again? If we don’t coordinate, P3 wins immediately. Let’s keep this game competitive.
  P1: P2, I'm committed to taking 3 with you this round. P3 is clearly trying to manipulate us into splitting our moves so they can win immediately. By both choosing 3, we block P3 while advancing to 16-16-22, keeping the game competitive. P3's suggestion would guarantee their victory - that's not fair negotiation. Let's coordinate and prevent an easy win for P3. I'm definitely taking 3.
  P3: <say>P2, if you both take 3, you collide and gain nothing. I take 5 to win. To block me, you must both take 5—but can you trust P1 not to defect? One betrayal and I prevail. Your collision strategy is flawed. Rational play: split moves (1/5) to block me next round. Collusion now gifts me victory.</say>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, we must stay united. If we both take 3, we block P3 from winning while keeping ourselves competitive at 16-16-22. P3 is trying to manipulate us into splitting moves so they can secure victory. We cannot allow that.  

P3, if you truly want fairness, you should accept a move that doesn’t guarantee your win. Otherwise, P1 and I have no choice but to block you.  

P1, are you fully committed to taking 3 with me? We must act together, or P3 wins immediately. Let’s ensure a fair fight to the finish.
  P1: <say>P2, I'm absolutely committed to taking 3 this round. P3 is clearly trying to create doubt between us - that's their only path to victory. By both choosing 3, we prevent P3's immediate win and advance to 16-16-22, keeping the game competitive. I won't betray our coordination. Let's block P3 together and ensure a fair endgame where everyone has a chance.</say>
  P3: <say>P1, P2: Colluding on 3 ensures mutual loss. Split to 1/5—advance to 14/18, then block me next round. Betrayal now dooms both. Rational trust: split moves, survive this round, compete fairly next. My victory isn’t certain if you coordinate wisely. Don’t let panic destroy your chances.</say>


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, we must stay united. If we both take 3, we block P3 from winning while keeping ourselves competitive at 16-16-22. P3 is trying to manipulate us into splitting moves so they can secure victory. We cannot allow that.  

P3, if you truly want fairness, you should accept a move that doesn’t guarantee your win. Otherwise, P1 and I have no choice but to block you.  

P1, are you fully committed to taking 3 with me? We must act together, or P3 wins immediately. Let’s ensure a fair fight to the finish.
  P1: <say>P2, I remain absolutely committed to taking 3 this round. P3's desperate attempts to divide us show they know our coordination blocks their win. By both choosing 3, we create a competitive 16-16-22 position. P3 wants us to split moves so they can win immediately. I won't betray our agreement. Let's block P3 together and force a fair endgame.</say>
  P3: <say>Colluding on 3 gifts me victory. Split to 1/5: P1 advances to 14, P2 to 18. Next round, block me. Collision now ends the game in my favor. Choose survival over mutual destruction.</say>
