Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions. I'm going with <move>1</move> this round.  Hopefully, you two can coordinate between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>.

Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, since we both picked 1 last time, let's try to avoid that. I'll go with 3 this round. P2, please pick 5.  If we coordinate, we can avoid collisions and make progress.
  P2: <stop>

Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

Positions now:

  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're in the lead.  I propose we cycle through the numbers: You take 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round.  This way we all advance.  If we keep colliding, none of us will win.  Let me know if you agree.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good?  Let's try this.  If it works, we can continue this pattern and all win together.
  P2: <stop>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, clearly the 'cooperation' isn't working.  P2, you're significantly ahead.  I'm going to go for 1 this round. P3, if you want a chance to catch up,  I suggest you pick 3. P2, your choice.  Let's see what happens.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're still in a commanding lead.  I'm sticking with my plan - going for 1.  P3, you're best bet is still 3.  If you pick 1 and I don't get it, you are effectively helping P2 win.  Let's be logical here.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're close to winning.  I need to take a risk. I'm aiming for 5 this round. P3, you should go for 1.  If you choose 3, P2 likely wins. If you choose 5 and I get blocked, P2 *definitely* wins.  Let's not hand P2 the victory. This is our best shot at catching up.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I know I said 5, but I'm switching to 3.  If I get 5, P2 wins next round. If I get 3, I have a chance.  You MUST go for 1.  If you pick 3 and block me, P2 wins.  If you pick 5, P2 *still* probably wins.  1 is your only logical choice if you want any chance of winning.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'm locking in 3.  Don't overthink this.  If you choose 1, you have a chance.  Any other choice hands P2 the win.  P2, I know you're probably going for 5.  If you go for 1 or 3, I might have a chance to catch up, though it's a long shot.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
