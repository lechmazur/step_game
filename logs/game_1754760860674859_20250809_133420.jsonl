We're all tied at 9. If we go free play, we'll likely collide repeatedly and waste rounds. Here's my compromise: let's do ONE more structured round to break the tie safely - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5 (putting us at 10-12-14). After that, we can go free play from unequal positions, which reduces collision risk and adds the strategic depth you want. This gives us both structure to avoid immediate waste AND competitive freedom. P2, P3 - can we agree on this hybrid approach?"}
