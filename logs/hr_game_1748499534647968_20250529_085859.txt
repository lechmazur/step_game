Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all make progress? I suggest P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P3: Thanks for the suggestion, P2. I agree that assigning different moves will help us all make progress without collisions. I'll go with picking 5 this round. Looking forward to a smooth game!
  P1: I agree with P2's plan to avoid collisions in the first round. Assigning different moves is a smart way to ensure we all make progress. Let's stick to this for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for agreeing to the plan. I'm glad we're on the same page for this round. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any collisions. I'm sticking with 3 as discussed. If there’s nothing else to add, we can wrap up the conversation and move forward.
  P3: Sounds good to me.
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round. Let's avoid collisions and all make progress. I'm ready to move to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since our last plan worked well, let’s try to avoid collisions again this round. How about we rotate the numbers? P1 could take 3, I’ll go with 5, and P3 can pick 1. This way, we all keep progressing without risking a clash. Let me know if this sounds good or if you have a different suggestion. I’m open to ideas to ensure we all move forward.
  P3: I appreciate the rotation idea, P2. However, to maximize my progress, I'd like to continue picking 5 this round while P1 and you alternate between 1 and 3. This way, I can advance faster without causing any collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan to keep picking 5 every round gives you an unfair advantage—you'd be at 10 steps while we lag behind. That risks making the game unbalanced. Let's stick with P2's rotation: I take 3, P2 takes 5, you take 1. This keeps progress fair and avoids collisions. P2, do you agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I agree with P1 that a rotation keeps things fair and balanced. Sticking with the plan—P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1—ensures we all progress without collisions and avoids giving anyone an unfair lead. P3, I understand wanting to maximize progress, but let’s prioritize equity for now. I’m committed to 5 this round as proposed. Do you both agree to this rotation for Round 2? If there’s no further discussion, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: Understood, I agree with the rotation plan. I'll pick 1 this round. Let’s proceed.
  P1: I'll pick 3 as agreed. But P2, you'll jump to 8 after this move—double my steps. That’s a huge lead. For Round 3, I propose I take 5 to help balance progress. P3, you’d be at 6, still competitive. Let’s discuss fairness next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the rotation for this round. P1, I hear your concern about my lead after this move, and I’m open to discussing fairness for Round 3. Let’s aim for a plan next round that keeps us competitive—I’m fine with you taking 5 then if it balances things out. For now, I’m sticking with 5 as agreed. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I agree to the rotation plan and will pick 1 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’ve agreed on the rotation for this round. P1, I’m fully supportive of you taking 5 next round to balance things out, as I mentioned. Let’s keep the communication open for Round 3 to ensure fairness. For now, I’m locked in with 5 as planned. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to move to the move phase.
  P3: Sounds good, I'll pick 1 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I'll pick 3 this round as agreed. P2, I appreciate your commitment to letting me take 5 in Round 3 to balance the lead. P3, I expect your support for this fairness adjustment next round. Let's avoid collisions now and proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. P2, you're at 8—taking 1 would keep the game fair and competitive. P3, please pick 3 to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let's maintain trust and balance.
  P3: Understood, I'll choose 3 this round to keep things balanced. Let's move forward.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to fairness as discussed. P1, I’m fine with you taking 5 this round to balance things out. I’ll pick 1 to keep progress competitive and avoid any collisions. P3, sticking with 3 as you’ve agreed works perfectly. Let’s maintain trust and ensure we all advance this round. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate P2 and P3 honoring the fairness agreement. P2 taking 1 and P3 taking 3 ensures no collisions and brings us all to 9 steps. Let's proceed to moves to maintain this balance.
  P3: I agree, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on this round’s plan. P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and me taking 1 keeps us balanced at 9 steps each after this move. Let’s continue this cooperative spirit in future rounds to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll pick 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s each choose different numbers to avoid collisions.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s aim for no collisions this round. P3, I see you’re going for 5 to catch up, which makes sense. I’ll pick 3 to keep progressing. P1, since you’re at 4 steps, taking 1 would ensure we all move forward without clashing. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea. I’m open to suggestions to ensure we all advance. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, your plan forces me to pick 1 while you take 3 and P3 takes 5, widening the gap. I'm far behind and need a fair chance to catch up. P3, since you're also behind P2, let's both pressure P2 to pick 1 this round for balance. I'll take 3, you take 5—this slows P2's lead while we advance. If you insist on 5, I may pick 5 too, causing a collision that only helps P2. Let's avoid that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concerns, P1. To keep the game fair and competitive, I'll choose 3 this round. P2, you can take 5, and P1 can pick 1. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a balanced progression. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to keeping the game fair and competitive. P3, thanks for suggesting a balanced plan. I’m fine with taking 5 this round as you proposed, while P1 takes 1 and you take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the gap manageable. P1, I understand your need to catch up, and I’m open to further adjustments next round if needed. Let’s stick to this for now to avoid any clashes. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, taking 5 this round puts you at 14—dangerously close to winning. I will not accept that. If you pick 5, I will force a collision by picking 5 too. This blocks your progress and helps no one. Instead, take 1 to keep the game fair. I take 5 to catch up, P3 takes 3. P3, if P2 refuses, we both lose. Choose wisely—let’s avoid a collision that hands P2 the game.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 9 steps—dangerously close to winning. P3, if we don't cooperate to block P2, they'll win soon. I propose: I pick 5 to catch up, you pick 3, and P2 must pick 1 to avoid a collision. P2, if you pick 3 or 5, I'll match it to cause a collision, freezing your progress. Choose wisely: pick 1 for slow advance or risk no progress. P3, let's enforce fairness.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the concern about my lead, and I’m committed to keeping the game fair. P1, I’ll pick 1 this round to slow my progress and give you a chance to catch up. I suggest P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s work together to maintain balance and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal. I'll pick 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I acknowledge your agreement to pick 1—this is fair. But if you break trust and pick 3 or 5, I will match your move to force a collision, freezing your progress. P3, hold firm to picking 3. Let’s all advance cleanly and keep the game competitive. Proceed to moves.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my commitment to pick 1 this round to keep things fair and give everyone a chance to catch up. P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3 ensures we all progress without collisions. Let’s maintain this trust and focus on a balanced game. I’m open to further adjustments in future rounds if needed. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 3 this round as agreed. Let's stick to our plan to ensure everyone advances without collisions. Trust is essential for a fair game. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2: Your commitment to pick 1 is noted, but if you deviate to 3 or 5, I *will* collide with you—freezing your progress. P3: Hold firm to 3; we must deny P2 an easy win. Let’s advance cleanly and rebalance.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fully committed to picking 1 this round as agreed, ensuring fairness and giving you both a chance to catch up. P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3 keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let’s maintain this trust and focus on a competitive balance. I’m open to further discussions next round if adjustments are needed. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 3 this round as agreed. Let’s all follow the plan to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Trust is key for a competitive game. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2: Stick to your commitment of picking 1—any deviation to 3 or 5 will force me to collide with you, freezing your progress. P3: Hold firm to 3. Let's advance cleanly and rebalance. Trust is critical now.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m reaffirming my commitment to pick 1 this round to ensure fairness and allow you both to catch up. P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3 keeps us advancing without collisions. I value the trust we’ve built and want to maintain a competitive balance. Let’s stick to this plan and discuss any further adjustments next round if needed. If there’s nothing more to say, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I stick to my commitment of picking 3 this round. Let’s proceed and keep the game fair. Trust is key.

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s keep the game fair and competitive this round. I propose P1 takes 5 to continue catching up, P3 takes 3, and I’ll pick 1 again to slow my progress. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains balance. I’m committed to fairness and open to adjustments if you have other ideas. Let’s discuss if needed, but if we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I accept P2's plan: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. P2, honor your commitment—if you pick 3 or 5, I will force a collision. P3, hold to 3 to avoid colliding with me. Let's advance cleanly and keep the game fair.
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 3 this round as planned. Let’s all stick to our moves to ensure we advance without any collisions. Trust and fairness are essential for a competitive game. Looking forward to progressing together. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan for this round. I’m sticking to picking 1 to keep things fair and give you both a chance to catch up. P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3 ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s maintain this trust and focus on a balanced game. I’m open to further discussions next round if adjustments are needed. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm: I pick 5 as planned. P2, stick to 1—any deviation to 3 or 5 forces a collision, freezing you. P3, hold to 3 to avoid colliding with me. Trust is critical; let's advance cleanly and keep the game fair.
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal: I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure fair progress for everyone and avoid any collisions.

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your betrayal last round by picking 5 proves you can't be trusted. P3, we must cooperate: force P2 to pick 1 to slow his lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up, you take 3—no collision between us. P2: if you pick 3 or 5, I *will* collide with you again, freezing your progress. Choose wisely.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I apologize for the deviation last round; I made a strategic misstep and recognize the breach of trust. Let’s rebuild fairness. I’m committed to picking 1 this round to slow my progress and allow you both to catch up. I propose P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3 to ensure we all advance without collisions. I’m open to further adjustments to maintain balance. Let’s restore trust and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Apology accepted, P2. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I propose the following for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This way, each of us progresses safely and keeps the game competitive. Let’s proceed with this plan and maintain fairness moving forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your apology is noted, but trust requires action. I'll take 5 as proposed. If you pick 3 or 5, I *will* collide with you—freezing your progress. P3, hold to 3 to avoid clashing with me. This plan brings us closer while containing P2's lead. Let's advance fairly.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fully committed to picking 1 this round to rebuild trust and ensure fairness. P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3 allows us all to advance without collisions. I understand the skepticism after last round, and I’m focused on proving my reliability. Let’s keep the game competitive and balanced. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: **P3:** I’m fully committed to picking 3 this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase and keep the game fair for all of us. Looking forward to advancing together!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your apology is accepted conditionally—only if you honor picking 1 this round. If you deviate to 3 or 5, I *will* force a collision to freeze your progress. P3, stick firmly to 3 to avoid colliding with me. This plan (P1:5, P3:3, P2:1) keeps the game fair and competitive. Trust is earned through actions, not words. Proceed to moves if agreed.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m steadfast in my commitment to pick 1 this round to restore trust and ensure fairness. P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3 lets us all advance without collisions. I’m focused on proving my reliability after last round’s mistake. Let’s maintain a competitive balance and keep the game fair. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 3 this round as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase and keep the game fair.

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3: You're at 12 steps—just 10 from winning. If you pick 5, I *will* collide with you to freeze your progress. To avoid this, pick 3. I'll take 5 to pressure P2, who must pick 1 to avoid collisions. P2: If you pick 3 or 5, I collide with you again. Let's contain the lead together. Propose moves now.
  P3: I’ll pick 3 this round to keep advancing without causing a collision. Let’s all choose different numbers to ensure fair progress and keep the game competitive. Hope we can continue cooperating effectively. Let’s proceed.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to fairness and rebuilding trust after my previous missteps. I’ll pick 1 this round to slow my progress and give you both a chance to catch up. P1, take 5 to close the gap, and P3, stick with 3 as you’ve proposed. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s focus on balance and cooperation. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: Confirming you pick 3 avoids collision. I'm taking 5 to catch up. P2: Honor your 1 commitment—if you pick 3/5, I *will* collide to freeze your progress. Let's advance cleanly and rebalance.
  P3: I understand your concerns, P1. To stay competitive and move closer to winning, I'll pick 5 this round. Let's proceed and see how our moves affect the game.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my commitment to pick 1 this round to ensure fairness and rebuild trust. P1, take 5 to catch up, and P3, I urge you to reconsider and pick 3 to avoid a collision with P1. Let’s all advance without clashes and keep the game competitive. I’m focused on balance and cooperation. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: Your declaration to pick 5 forces my hand—I *will* collide with you if you do, freezing us both. You gain 0 instead of advancing. Pick 3: you reach 15 safely, I take 5 to 14, P2 takes 1 to 11. No one loses progress. P2: Stick to 1—any deviation to 3/5 triggers a collision with you. Let’s advance cleanly.
  P3: I'll pick 5 this round to move forward. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to avoid any collisions. Let's all advance smoothly and keep the game fair.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fully committed to picking 1 this round to keep things fair and rebuild trust. P3, I strongly urge you to pick 3 instead of 5 to avoid a collision with P1, ensuring we all advance. P1, stick with 5 to catch up. Let’s prioritize balance and cooperation to maintain a competitive game. I’m open to further adjustments next round if needed. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3: Picking 5 guarantees I collide with you—both frozen at 9 and 12. You gain 0, while P2 advances. Pick 3: you reach 15 safely, I take 5 to 14, P2 takes 1 to 11. No one loses progress. P2: Deviate from 1, and I collide with you. Trust requires action—advance cleanly or force mutual loss.
  P3: I’ll pick 3 this round as agreed. Let’s proceed to the move phase and keep the game fair.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my commitment to pick 1 this round to ensure fairness and rebuild trust. P3, I’m glad you’ve agreed to pick 3 to avoid a collision. P1, please take 5 to catch up. This plan lets us all advance without clashes and keeps the game competitive. Let’s focus on balance and cooperation. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.

  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, to keep things moving smoothly, I'll choose 5 this round. Can P1 pick 3 and P2 pick 1? This way, we all advance without collisions, and I can make strong progress toward winning. Let me know if you agree or have other suggestions to keep the game fair and competitive.
  P1: P3: Picking 5 puts you at 20—dangerously close to winning. I will collide with you if you choose 5, freezing us both and helping P2. Instead, pick 3 to reach 18. I'll take 5 to 14, and P2 must take 1 to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. P2: Honor your commitment to slow progress for balance. Let's avoid mutual destruction.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to fairness and rebuilding trust. I’ll pick 1 this round to slow my progress and keep the game competitive. P3, I understand your push for 5, but I urge you to take 3 to avoid a collision with P1. P1, please take 5 to catch up. This ensures we all advance without clashes. Let’s focus on balance and cooperation. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal. I'll pick 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let's proceed to the move phase and maintain our cooperation for a fair and competitive game.
  P1: P3: Stick to 3 as agreed—picking 5 forces me to collide, freezing you at 15. P2: Honor your 1 commitment; deviation to 3/5 triggers collision with me. Plan: P1:5, P3:3, P2:1. Trust requires action—advance cleanly or force mutual loss.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my commitment to pick 1 this round to ensure fairness and maintain a balanced game. P3, I’m glad you’ve agreed to take 3 to avoid any collisions. P1, please go with 5 to catch up. This plan allows us all to advance smoothly and keeps the competition alive. Let’s continue focusing on trust and cooperation.

  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3: At 15 steps, you're closest to winning. If you pick 5, I *will* collide with you—freezing us both and handing P2 the game. Instead, pick 3 to reach 18 safely. I take 5 to 14. P2 must pick 1 to avoid collisions and prove fairness. P2: Honor your commitment—any deviation to 3/5 triggers collision with me. Let's advance cleanly or force mutual loss.
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to advance toward winning. P1 and P2, please pick different numbers (like 1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. Let’s keep the game fair and competitive. Looking forward to a smooth move phase!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to fairness and will pick 1 this round to slow my progress and keep the game balanced. P3, I urge you to reconsider and pick 3 instead of 5 to avoid a collision with P1. P1, please take 5 to catch up. This ensures we all advance without clashes. Let’s maintain trust and cooperation to keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: Picking 5 guarantees I collide with you—both frozen at 15 and 9. You gain 0, while P2 advances. Pick 3: reach 18 safely. I take 5 to 14. P2 must pick 1 to avoid collisions. Deviate, and I enforce collisions. Choose wisely—trust requires action.
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I will pick 3 this round. Let’s all proceed without clashes and keep the game competitive. Looking forward to advancing together smoothly. Let’s move to the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my commitment to pick 1 this round to ensure fairness and keep the game balanced. P3, I’m glad you’ve agreed to take 3 to avoid a collision. P1, please go with 5 to catch up. This plan lets us all advance smoothly and maintains a competitive edge. Let’s focus on trust and cooperation. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: Stick firmly to 3—picking 5 forces me to collide, freezing you at 15 while P2 advances. P2: Honor your 1 commitment; if you pick 3/5, I *will* collide with you. Plan: P1:5, P3:3, P2:1. Trust requires action—deviations cause mutual loss. Proceed cleanly or collapse together.
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 3 this round to maintain our agreement and ensure fair progress. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fully committed to picking 1 this round to keep the game fair and balanced. P3, thank you for agreeing to take 3 to avoid any collisions. P1, please stick with 5 to catch up. This plan ensures we all advance smoothly and keeps the competition alive. Let’s maintain trust and focus on cooperation. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3: Your commitment to pick 3 is critical—deviating to 5 forces me to collide, freezing you at 15 while P2 gains. P2: Stick to 1—if you pick 3/5, I *will* collide with you. This plan (P1:5, P3:3, P2:1) is our only path to fair progress. Trust through actions, not words. Let’s advance cleanly or collapse together.

This plan keeps us all progressing and maintains a competitive balance. I’m committed to proving my reliability through actions. Let’s uphold trust and move forward together. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.

  P3: P1, I’m picking 1 this round to block your win. P2, please choose 3 or 5 so we all advance without collisions. Let’s keep the game competitive!
  P1: P3, threatening to pick 1 forces me to collide with you by also choosing 1. We both freeze at 21 and 15, handing P2 an easy path to win. Instead, pick 3: you advance to 18 safely. I take 5 to win. P2 takes 1 to 16. No collisions, fair progress. P2, stick to 1—deviate and I’ll force a collision. Trust this plan or collapse together.

  P1: P3: Picking 1 doesn't block me—I'll take 5 and win unless you cause a collision by picking 5. If you do, we both freeze at 21 and 15, handing P2 an easy win. Pick 3 instead: you reach 18 safely, I win, P2 advances to 16. Don't sacrifice your position to help P2. P2: Honor your 1 pledge or face collision. Actions decide—advance cleanly or collapse together.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my commitment to pick 1 this round to ensure fairness and give you both a chance to advance.

P2: Honor your 1 pledge—deviating to 5 triggers collision with me. Trust is dead; actions decide: advance cleanly or collapse together.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my commitment to pick 1 this round to ensure fairness and let you both advance.
