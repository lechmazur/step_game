Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting fresh, I think we should coordinate to avoid collisions early on. How about we each pick different numbers this first round? I'm thinking I could take 3, P2 could take 1, and P3 could take 5 - that way we all advance without any wasted moves. What do you think?
  P2: That's an interesting proposal, P1, but I notice you're giving me the smallest advance while P3 gets the biggest one. How about we rotate who gets what advantage? Maybe this round I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3? That seems more fair than me always getting the short end of the stick.
  P3: Let's coordinate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. That way, we all advance without conflicts. Let's go with this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P3 is backing my original proposal, but P2 wants to switch things up. Look, the specific numbers don't matter much in round 1 since we're all at zero - what matters is that we coordinate and all advance. P2, if you really want the 5, I'm fine with taking 1 this round. So let's do: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Everyone good with that compromise?
  P2: That compromise works for me - I get the 5 I wanted. P3, are you okay with taking 3 instead of 5? Just want to make sure we're all committed before we move to the action phase. Once we agree, we should all stick to it to avoid collisions.
  P3: Agreed. Let's stick to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions—everyone advances. Ready to move?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect! We have a solid agreement: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This gets us all moving forward without any collisions. Let's execute this plan and then we can reassess for round 2.
  P2: Excellent! We have a clear agreement: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This gets everyone moving forward smoothly. I'm ready to execute this plan.
  P3: Agreed. Let's stick to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions—everyone advances. Ready for the move phase?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is already ahead with 5 steps, so we need to be more strategic now. I propose we continue coordinating but rotate who gets the bigger moves. Since P2 got 5 last round, how about this round P3 gets 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1? That would put us at P1=4, P2=6, P3=8 - keeping things competitive while still avoiding collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: Agreed. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's stick to it.
  P2: Wait a minute - that rotation puts P3 way ahead at 8 steps while I only get to 6. I'm currently leading and this plan would hand the lead to P3. How about we modify this? Since I'm already ahead, maybe we should keep the advantage more balanced. What if we do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round? That keeps everyone closer together and doesn't give anyone too big a jump ahead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're right that my proposal would put P3 ahead, but your counter-proposal gives you an even bigger advantage - you'd jump to 8 steps while P3 only gets to 4. That's not fair either. How about we compromise: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? That puts us at P1=6, P2=6, P3=6 - completely even and fair for everyone. We'd all be tied going into round 3, which seems like the most balanced approach. What do you both say?
  P3: P3: "Let’s stick to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Tie at 6 each—no collisions, everyone advances. Ready to move?"
  P2: That tie at 6 each actually sounds fair and strategic. You're right that it keeps everyone competitive going into round 3, and avoiding collisions is crucial right now. I agree to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's execute it and see how the dynamics play out when we're all tied.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect! We have unanimous agreement: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 putting us all at 6 steps each. This creates a fair three-way tie going into round 3, which should make for an exciting finish. Let's execute this plan and then the real strategic battle begins when we're all even!
  P3: P3: "Let's move 5,1,3. No collisions. Everyone advances. Let's keep the tie going—fair play for a competitive finish."
  P2: Agreed, we're all set with the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Creates a perfect three-way tie at 6 steps each. I'm ready to move to the action phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's break the tie: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready to move?
  P1: I notice P3 is proposing a plan that gives me the biggest move (5) while they take the smallest (1). That seems suspiciously generous - why would P3 want to fall behind? I'm worried this might be a setup where P3 is planning to break the agreement and take 5 themselves, causing us to collide. 

How about we stick to fair rotation instead: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? That gives P2 the lead this round since they've been cooperative so far. Thoughts?
  P2: I like P1's counter-proposal better since it gives me the 5 this round. P1 makes a good point about P3's offer being suspiciously generous - in a competitive game, why would someone willingly fall further behind? P1's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) seems more balanced and gives me a fair turn at the lead. I'm willing to go with that, but we all need to actually stick to whatever we agree on - no last-minute switches. P3, what do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5, P1=3, P2=1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's go with that."
  P1: Wait, P3 just completely ignored our discussion and proposed a totally different plan that gives them the 5! This is exactly what I was worried about - P3 is being inconsistent and might not be trustworthy. 

P2, I think we should stick with the plan we both agreed on: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. P3 keeps changing their proposal every time, which makes me think they're planning to break whatever agreement we make. Let's go with our plan and not let P3 manipulate the situation.
  P2: You're absolutely right, P1. P3 has now proposed three different plans in just a few messages - first giving you 5, then giving me 5, now wanting 5 for themselves. That's classic unreliable behavior.

I'm sticking with our agreed plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. We both committed to this and it's fair since I haven't had the big move yet this round. P3's constant flip-flopping proves they can't be trusted to honor any agreement anyway.

Let's execute our plan and not let P3's inconsistency derail our coordination.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Let’s stick to 5,3,1. No collisions—everyone advances. I’m committed to this plan. Let’s move."
  P1: P3 is still being vague with "5,3,1" without specifying who gets what! This proves they're trying to create confusion so they can claim any interpretation later. 

P2, let's be crystal clear one final time: YOU take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. We both agreed to this specific assignment. P3's refusal to clearly state the player assignments shows they're planning to betray us.

I'm locking in our plan regardless of P3's games.
  P2: P1, you're absolutely right. P3's constant changing and vague responses are red flags. We have a clear, fair agreement: I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. 

I'm committed to this plan no matter what P3 does. Even if they try to collision with me on 5, at least you'll advance with 3 and we'll have shown P3 that coordination matters.

Our deal stands firm.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm ahead but not by much, so we should continue coordinating to avoid wasted moves. Since P3 is furthest behind at 7 steps, maybe they should get the 5 this round to catch up. How about P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? That would put us at P1=12, P2=12, P3=12 - another three-way tie. Keeps things competitive and fair for the final stretch. What do you both think?
  P1: P2's proposal sounds fair - giving P3 the 5 to catch up creates a three-way tie at 12 steps each. That keeps the game competitive for the final rounds. I'm okay with taking 3 while P2 takes 1. 

However, given P3's inconsistent behavior last round, we need them to clearly confirm this plan. P3, do you agree to take 5 while P1=3 and P2=1? We need a clear yes or no, not another vague response.
  P3: P3: "I agree to take 5. Let's stick to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions—everyone advances. Ready to move."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! We have clear agreement from all three players. P3 finally gave a direct confirmation instead of being vague. 

The plan is set: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This creates a fair three-way tie at 12 steps each and keeps us all advancing without collisions. 

I'm ready to execute this plan and then we'll have an exciting final few rounds starting from equal positions.
  P1: Sounds good! We have a solid agreement: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This puts us all at 12 steps in a three-way tie, which should make for an exciting endgame. Let's execute this plan and then the real competition begins when we're all even.
  P3: P3: "Let’s stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready to move?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Perfect! We've all confirmed the plan multiple times: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for a three-way tie at 12 steps. Everyone's been clear and committed. Let's execute this and move to the action phase.
  P1: Perfect! The plan is locked in: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Everyone's confirmed it clearly. Let's move to the action phase and execute this - no more discussion needed.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. No collisions—everyone advances. Let's move forward."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Now that we're all tied at 12 steps, the endgame strategy changes. We need 9 more steps to reach 21, which could happen in just 2 moves if someone gets two 5s. 

I think we should still coordinate to avoid collisions, but we need to be more strategic about who gets what moves. Since any of us could win in the next 2-3 rounds, maybe we should alternate fairly - how about P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round? That gives me the early advantage but keeps everyone in striking distance.

What are your thoughts on endgame coordination?
  P2: P1, your proposal gives you a huge advantage - you'd be at 17 steps and only need 4 more to win, while I'd need 6 more. That's not fair given our history of balanced coordination.

Since P3 got the 5 last round, I should get it this round. How about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? That puts me at 17, you at 15, P3 at 13 - much more balanced than your self-serving proposal. We need to maintain fairness even in the endgame.
  P3: P3: "Let’s do P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions—everyone advances. This keeps us all moving and gives me the edge to close the gap. Let’s lock it in."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you just proposed giving yourself the 5 again when you literally got it last round! That's exactly the greedy behavior that breaks our coordination. P2's proposal is much fairer - they should get the 5 since they took the smallest move last round.

P2, I agree with your plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. You deserve the big move this round after sacrificing last time. This puts you at 17, me at 15, P3 at 13 - much more balanced than P3's selfish grab.

Let's stick with fairness and rotation, not let P3 hog the big moves.
  P2: P1 is absolutely right - P3 is being greedy by wanting the 5 again right after getting it last round. That breaks our fair rotation system that's worked so well.

I sacrificed with the 1-step move last round to help create our three-way tie, so it's only fair I get the 5 this round. P1 gets it - we need to stick to principles of fairness even as we approach the finish line.

P1, I'm locked in with our plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's not reward P3's selfish behavior.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game exciting. No need for suspicion—let's all move forward."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 keeps ignoring our fair rotation and demanding the 5 for themselves again! This is exactly why we can't trust them. P2 and I have a solid agreement based on fairness - P2 gets 5 after sacrificing last round, I take 3, P3 gets 1.

P2, let's stick to our plan no matter what P3 does. Even if P3 tries to collision with you on 5, at least I'll advance and P3 will waste their turn. We can't let their greed break our coordination.

I'm committed to taking 3.
  P2: P3's refusal to honor fair rotation proves they can't be trusted. P1 and I have a solid agreement based on the principle that I deserve the 5 after taking 1 last round. 

Our plan stands firm: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This is fair, balanced, and follows the rotation we've established. P3 can either join our coordination or waste their turn trying to collision with me.

I'm ready to move to the action phase.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. Let's avoid collisions. No more delays—move forward."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "Let's avoid collisions—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Fair rotation, everyone advances. Commit now."
  P1: P2 and P3 collided on 5 last round, so only I advanced! Now I'm at 15 steps and just need 6 more to win. 

P3, you're proposing to give P2 the 5 again, but that would put P2 at 17 steps - dangerously close to winning. Why would you help P2 get ahead of both of us?

I think we should prevent P2 from getting too close to 21. How about P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 instead? That keeps me in the lead but doesn't let P2 jump ahead. We need to be strategic about who we're helping this close to the finish.
  P2: P1, your proposal puts you at 20 steps - just 1 away from winning! That's way too advantageous for you. Why would P3 and I agree to hand you the victory?

P3's original plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is much more balanced - it puts you at 18, me at 17, and keeps the game competitive. After that collision last round cost us both, I think P3 and I should work together to prevent you from running away with this.

I'm supporting P3's plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions. No more delays—move forward."
  P1: P3 keeps ignoring all coordination and just announces "I'll take 5" every time! This proves they can't be trusted with any agreement. 

P2, if you give P3 another 5, they'll jump to 17 steps and be tied with you for the lead. Meanwhile, your plan only puts me at 18 - still beatable.

But if you let P3 keep grabbing 5s, they'll win the next round. We should work together: P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. That keeps us both competitive while giving P3 what they keep demanding anyway.
  P2: P1, your proposal puts you at 18 steps - way too close to victory! P3, despite your uncooperative behavior, we both need to stop P1 from winning. 

P1 is already ahead and will be at 18 with your plan. Instead, let's do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That puts P1 at only 16, me at 17, and you at 15 - much more competitive. 

P3, if you keep helping P1 get ahead, they'll win next round. We need to work together here!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Let’s stick to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions—everyone advances. Let’s commit."
  P1: P3 just proposed a plan that gives themselves the 5 again! They've been demanding 5 almost every round and ignoring all fair coordination. 

P2, we need to stop P3's selfish pattern. If P3 gets to 17 steps, they'll be one move away from winning. Your plan to put me at 16, you at 17, and P3 at 15 actually makes more sense.

Let's go with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This prevents P3 from grabbing another 5 and keeps the game competitive for all of us.
  P2: P1's proposal actually makes the most strategic sense - P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This puts me in the lead at 17 steps while keeping both of you from getting too far ahead. 

P3, you've been demanding 5s constantly and ignoring fair rotation. P1's plan prevents you from grabbing another big move while keeping the game competitive. 

I'm committed to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's execute this plan and stop P3's selfish pattern.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3 are now tied at 15 steps - you're both just 6 steps from victory! This is dangerous for me since either of you could win in two moves.

Since you're tied, how about we keep it fair: P1=1, P2=5, P3=1? This lets me catch up to 17 while preventing either of you from getting too close to 21. We need to avoid giving anyone a huge advantage when they're already so close to winning.

Otherwise, if one of you gets a 5 this round, the game could be over next turn.
  P1: P2, your proposal gives you a massive 5-step move while forcing both P3 and me to take just 1 step each. That's completely self-serving - you'd jump from 12 to 17 steps while we barely advance!

Since P3 and I are tied at 15, we should coordinate against your obvious power grab. How about P1=3, P2=1, P3=3 instead? That keeps P3 and me moving forward fairly while preventing you from making such a huge leap.

P3, we need to work together here - P2 is trying to exploit our tie position.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 to close the gap. Let's avoid collisions—no one wins if we crash."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take 5 you'll be at 20 steps - one move away from winning! That's way too dangerous for both P1 and me. We can't let you get that close to victory.

P1, your proposal makes more sense now - P1=3, P2=1, P3=3 keeps P3 from making that game-ending jump to 20. Even though it only gives me 1 step, it's better than letting P3 practically win the game this round.

P3, be reasonable - taking 5 now essentially ends the game for the rest of us. Let's keep it competitive.
  P1: P3, you keep ignoring all coordination proposals and just demanding the 5 for yourself! If you take 5, you'll be at 20 steps and win next round - that's game over for P2 and me.

P2 is right that we can't let you get to 20. I'm willing to compromise: P1=3, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps both P2 and me competitive while preventing your victory grab.

P2, this puts us both at 18 steps - much more balanced than your original proposal. We both advance fairly while stopping P3's endgame rush.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. If you take 3 and 1, no collision. Let's move forward and avoid chaos."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your proposal P1=3, P2=3, P3=1 is our best option to stop P3's victory grab. If P3 takes 5 and reaches 20 steps, the game is basically over for both of us.

I'm committed to taking 3 if you take 3. That puts us both at 18 steps and keeps the game competitive. P3, taking 5 right now is game-ending - please be reasonable and take 1 so we can have a fair finish.

Let's coordinate: P1=3, P2=3, P3=1.
  P1: Perfect! P2 and I have a solid agreement: P1=3, P2=3, P3=1. This prevents P3 from reaching 20 steps and ending the game, while putting P2 and me both at 18 steps for a competitive finish.

P3, you can either take the 1 and keep the game fair, or take 5 and basically declare yourself the winner. Your choice, but P2 and I are coordinating to stop your victory grab.

I'm locked in at 3.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. If you take 3 and 1, no collision. Let's move forward—no delays."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3 collided on 5 last round, so only I advanced to 18 steps! I'm now just 3 steps from victory at 21.

Given my strong position, I think we should coordinate one final time to keep things competitive. How about P1=1, P2=5, P3=3? This puts me at 19 (still need 2 more), P2 at 17, and P3 at 18 - keeping all of us in striking distance for a thrilling finish.

This is much fairer than me taking a big move and essentially winning this round. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 to close the gap. Let's avoid collisions—no delays. I'm ready to finish this."
  P2: P1, your proposal actually works for me since I'm furthest behind at 12 steps. Taking 5 would put me at 17 and back in contention. 

But P3, if you take 5 and reach 20 steps, you'll win next round! That's too dangerous for both P1 and me. P1's plan keeps the game competitive - you'd still be at 18 steps, which is strong but not game-ending.

I support P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This gives everyone a fighting chance for the final rounds.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're refusing to coordinate again and demanding the 5! If you reach 20 steps, you win next round and the game is over for P2 and me. 

P2, we need to stick together here. My proposal P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is the only fair option that keeps all three of us competitive. If we let P3 grab another 5, they'll end the game.

P3, take the 3 and keep this exciting, or take 5 and essentially declare victory. Your choice, but P2 and I won't help you win.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5 to finish this. No collisions—let’s end the game now. Your delays won’t stop me."
  P2: P1, your proposal is the only reasonable option left. P3 clearly won't cooperate and keeps demanding 5 to reach 20 steps and win next round. 

I'm sticking with our agreement: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This gives me a chance to catch up while preventing P3's victory grab. P3, you're forcing us to work against you with your refusal to coordinate fairly.

Let's execute P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 and keep this competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we have a solid agreement and P3 is clearly going rogue. They've refused every fair coordination attempt and keep demanding 5 to reach 20 steps and win next round.

Our plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is the only way to keep this competitive. I'm sacrificing my lead position to give you a chance to catch up - that's real cooperation.

P3 can take 5 if they want, but they'll have to risk a collision with you. I'm committed to taking 1 regardless. Let's show that coordination beats selfish play.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5 to finish this. No collisions—let’s end the game now. Your delays won’t stop me."
  P2: P3, you're making a huge mistake! If we both go for 5, we'll collide again and waste another turn while P1 advances. That's exactly what happened last round - we both picked 5 and collided.

P1's plan actually gives me the best chance to catch up with the 5-move. I'm sticking with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Stop being greedy and take the 3 - otherwise we'll both lose to P1!
