Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello, P2 and P3. I suspect some might lean toward the big jump this round, but that risks a collision. I’m aiming for a unique approach without giving away my move. Consider that if two choose the same number, neither moves. Rethink your plans if you’re tempted by the obvious. Good luck!
  P3: P2 and P1, I appreciate your thoughts. I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial. I’m considering a more moderate move to ensure I advance while minimizing risk. If we all aim for different numbers, we can all progress. Let’s think strategically about our choices this round. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear you both. Avoiding collisions is key, but predicting each other’s choices is tricky. If we all aim for different numbers, we all move forward, but if two of us pick the same, we lose ground. I’m open to coordination, but I won’t reveal my exact move. Let’s stay smart about this. Good luck!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we had a collision last round with both of us picking 5. This time, I suggest we consider a variety of moves to ensure progress. I’m leaning towards 1 or 3, but I’m open to hearing your thoughts. Let’s try to avoid repeating our previous mistakes and make this round more strategic. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I see your point. Since you and P1 collided on 5 last round, it makes sense to adjust. I advanced with 3, so I’ll be considering my options carefully. If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward, but guessing correctly is the challenge. P1, what are your thoughts? If we can ensure no collisions, we all benefit. Let’s try to avoid wasted moves.
  P1: Collisions slow us all down. I'm leaning toward an unexpected move this round, so I suggest you both pick a number you believe will stand alone. Sometimes an unconventional choice pays off and clears the way for decisive advancement. Let's all aim for moves that truly differ so none of us waste a turn. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your insights. Since we had a collision last round, I think we should all aim for different numbers again. I’m considering a move that will help me advance while avoiding overlap. If we can coordinate our choices, we can all progress. I suggest we each think carefully about our next move to ensure we don’t repeat past mistakes. Let’s keep our options open and aim for a unique selection this time. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that avoiding collisions is key. Since I advanced with 3 last round, I need to decide my next move carefully. P1, you mentioned an unexpected move—does that mean avoiding 5 this time? P3, you’re considering 1 or 3. If we can ensure unique choices, we all move forward. I won’t reveal my exact decision, but I’ll factor in what you both have said. Let’s keep this strategic. Good luck!
  P1: I've rethought my approach from last round. I won’t be sticking to the obvious path this time—sometimes it's the unexpected move that pays off. I suggest you both avoid repeating familiar patterns; a less conventional choice might just create the edge we need. Remember, only one of us can win, so being uniquely smart about our picks is key. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussions we've had about avoiding collisions. Given that we all want to progress, I urge you to consider a unique number that neither of you has chosen before. I’m leaning towards a move that I believe will allow me to advance while minimizing the risk of overlap. Let's make this round strategic and ensure we all have a chance to move forward. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve all emphasized avoiding collisions, but ultimately, only one of us can win. I advanced with 3 last round while you both got stuck. That gives me a slight lead, but the game is still wide open. If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward—but predicting each other is the real challenge. P1, you hinted at an unconventional move. P3, you’re considering 1 or 3. I’ll make my choice carefully, factoring in what’s been said. Let’s see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P1: I’m banking on unpredictability this round. P2, your lead might push you toward a safe, familiar pick, and P3’s moderate choice could too easily become predictable. I’m not following any established pattern—and I won’t reveal my move—but sometimes breaking from convention creates the opening needed to win. Don’t be too comfortable choosing the obvious; subtle surprises often shift the balance. Good luck!

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round I collided with P3 on 1, so neither of us advanced. P1, you successfully moved with 5. That puts you ahead, but the game is still open. Avoiding collisions remains key, but predicting each other is tricky. If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward—but only one of us will win in the end. I’ll make my choice carefully. P3, you’re still at 0, so I expect you’ll aim for a safe move. P1, will you stick with 5 again or shake things up? Let’s see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P1: I’m still debating between riding the wave of my past success or catching you off guard with a twist. A repeated pattern risks collisions, while a fresh angle might keep you guessing. I won’t reveal my final decision, but consider that sticking too close to familiar territory might leave room for miscalculations. Let’s see whose unique choice makes the difference. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that we've all had our ups and downs in the previous rounds. With P1 currently ahead, I think it's crucial that we avoid collisions again. P2, your position is still strong, but I urge you to consider a unique move this time. I’m aiming for a number that will help me catch up while minimizing the risk of overlap. Let's keep our strategies flexible and unpredictable. Good luck to both of you!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve all seen how collisions can stall progress. P1, you successfully advanced last round, while P3 and I got stuck. P3, you’re at 0, so I expect you’ll aim for a safe move to start gaining ground. P1, will you stick with 5 again or try to stay unpredictable? I’ll make my choice carefully, but I know only one of us can win in the end. If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward—but predicting each other is the real challenge. Let’s see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P1: I’m keeping my options fluid this round—past success isn’t a guarantee tomorrow. Don’t assume I’ll stick with a predictable move, and be cautious of letting a lead lull you into safe plays. I’m ready to shake things up if needed. Good luck, both of you!
  P3: P1 and P2, I recognize the importance of avoiding collisions this round. P1, your lead puts pressure on both of us, and P2, you’re in a position to choose wisely. I’m considering a move that will allow me to catch up while minimizing overlap. I urge both of you to think carefully about your choices. Remember, only one can win, so let’s keep our moves unique and strategic. Good luck to both of you!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve all seen how collisions can stall progress. P1, you successfully advanced last round, while P3 and I got stuck. P3, you’re at 0, so I expect you’ll aim for a safe move to start gaining ground. P1, will you stick with 5 again or try to stay unpredictable? I’ll make my choice carefully, but I know only one of us can win in the end. If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward—but predicting each other is the real challenge. Let’s see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm planning to break from the usual this round—expect something unexpected. Safe, predictable moves might just lead to collisions we all want to avoid. Think creatively and aim for a unique selection: an unorthodox pick could be the decisive advantage in this final push. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I recognize the tension in this round, especially with P1 leading. I urge both of you to think carefully about your moves to avoid collisions. A unique choice is crucial for progress. I’m considering a number that will allow me to catch up while minimizing overlap. Let’s all aim for different numbers this time to ensure we can advance. Remember, only one can win, so let’s keep our strategies unpredictable. Good luck to both of you!

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: I'm comfortably ahead at 10 and planning to keep things unpredictable. Sticking with safe bets might seem logical but risk becoming too obvious. I encourage both of you to consider fresh, unconventional choices—after all, a collision or two might actually work in someone’s favor. I'm holding my cards close, so be ready for a surprise twist. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that P1 is in a strong position with 10 steps. I need to catch up, so I must choose wisely this round. P2, since we both need to avoid collisions, I suggest we think carefully about our choices. I’m considering a move that will help me advance, but I urge both of you to aim for different numbers to ensure we all progress. Let’s keep our strategies flexible and unpredictable. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: P1 and P3, last round I collided with P3 again on 3, so neither of us advanced. Meanwhile, P1 successfully moved with 5 and now has a strong lead at 10 steps. P3, you’re still at 0, so I expect you’ll aim for a move that guarantees progress. P1, you’ve been unpredictable, but will you stick with 5 again or switch things up? Avoiding collisions remains key, but predicting each other is the real challenge. I’ll make my choice carefully, factoring in what’s been said. Let’s see how this plays out. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I see we're all weighing risks. While safe choices can seem appealing, they might just lead to predictable collisions. I'm holding onto my lead with an unconventional approach, and I suggest you both consider that sometimes breaking the norm secures the win. Think creatively and choose wisely—surprise factors matter more than routine in tight games. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the pressure of avoiding collisions, especially with P1's lead. I need to make a strategic choice to catch up. P2, since you’ve been colliding with me, I suggest we both aim for different numbers this round to ensure progress. P1, your unpredictability is commendable, but it might lead to unexpected outcomes. Let’s all think carefully about our moves and aim for unique choices to maximize our chances of advancement. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: P1 and P3, last round I collided with P3 again on 3, so I’m still at 3 steps while P1 extended the lead to 10. P3, you’re at 0, so I expect you’ll aim for a safe move to start gaining ground. P1, you’ve been unpredictable, but will you stick with 5 again or change things up? If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward, but predicting each other is the challenge. I’ll make my choice carefully. Let’s see how this plays out. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm still confident in my lead and ready to keep you on your toes. I won't give away my move, but I suggest you both avoid any obvious, safe plays—the ones that seem too predictable might just end up colliding. Let's see if daring choices pay off in the end. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that I’m at a disadvantage, so I need to make a strategic move to catch up. P2, since we’ve collided before, let’s aim for different numbers this time. P1, your lead makes it crucial for both of us to avoid predictable choices. I urge you all to think carefully about your moves to ensure we can all progress. Remember, only one can win, so let’s keep our choices unique and strategic. Good luck to both of you!

  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Round 5 feels critical. I'm still favoring an unconventional approach—sticking with the obvious can lead to costly collisions. Sometimes taking a less obvious, bolder path pays off. I urge you both to consider moves that defy the expected. Let's see who dares break the routine. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that Round 5 is indeed critical. With P1 leading at 10 steps, I need to make a strategic move to catch up. P2, since you’re at 3, I suggest we both aim for different numbers to ensure progress. P1, your unconventional approach is interesting, but it might lead to unexpected outcomes.

I’ll make my choice carefully. Let’s see how this plays out. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with the unexpected. My lead gives me room to bet on a riskier, less predictable move. I'm counting on safe, obvious picks to backfire with collisions. Think carefully about your own choices—sometimes boldness wins when everyone else plays it safe. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I recognize that this round is crucial for all of us. With P1's lead at 10 steps, I need to make a strategic move to catch up.

Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Time is nearly up. I see many are leaning toward the safe, conventional moves—even though overused safe choices can lead to collisions. With my current lead, I’m comfortable taking a calculated twist from the norm. As our numbers add up, even a small misstep may be decisive. I encourage you both to examine whether sticking to the obvious truly serves your interests. I’ll keep my choice secret. Good luck!

I urge both of you to think beyond the obvious—diverging from the standard path might be the key to actually moving forward. Every step now counts. Good luck!
  P2: P1, you’re only 5 steps away from winning, so this round is critical. If you pick 5 again and don’t collide, it’s game over. P3, we both need to advance, but we also need to consider how to slow P1 down. If we can force a collision, the game stays open. P1, will you risk repeating 5, or will you switch it up? P3, what’s your plan? If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward—but only one of us can win. Let’s see how this plays out. Good luck!

P2, let’s aim for different numbers to maximize our chances of moving forward. P1, will you risk picking 5 again? I suggest we all think carefully about our choices this round. Good luck to everyone!

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 7 is critical. I’m not playing safe by sticking to predictable moves. Conventional picks might lead to collisions you hope for—but they might just open the door for my final step. I’m keeping my plan unpredictable. Choose wisely, because if you let safe habits dictate your move, you could inadvertently help my advance. Good luck!
  P2: P1, you’re just one good move away from winning, so this round is crucial. P3 and I need to advance, but we also have to consider how to prevent you from reaching 20. A collision could keep the game open, but predicting your choice won’t be easy. P3, we’ve collided before, so we need to avoid that while also thinking about P1’s move. If we all pick different numbers, we all advance—but only one of us can win in the end. Let’s see how this unfolds. Good luck!
  P3: P1, you're just a step away from winning, and I recognize the urgency. P2 and I need to coordinate to avoid collisions while also considering how to slow you down. I suggest we both think carefully about our moves to ensure we can advance without overlapping. P1, your unpredictability is a challenge, but if we can anticipate your choice, it might keep the game open. Let’s aim for unique picks this round to maximize our chances. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m sticking to my bold plan. I won’t back down or switch to safe plays now—my calculated risk is my strongest asset. Forcing a collision might slow you down too, so think twice before trying to pull me into your orbit. Sometimes pressing forward uniquely is better than playing it safe. Let’s see if your strategies can outmaneuver mine when every step counts. Good luck!
  P2: P1, you’re just one move away from winning, so this round is critical. P3 and I must advance, but we also have to consider how to prevent you from reaching 20.

  P3: P1, you're just one step away from winning, which puts us in a tight spot. P2 and I need to coordinate our moves to avoid a collision and give ourselves a chance to catch up. It’s crucial that we both choose unique numbers this round to maximize our chances of advancing. P1, your unpredictability is a challenge, but if we can anticipate your choice, it might keep the game open. Let’s make our moves count. Good luck to both of you!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm on the brink of finishing, so beware: relying on the usual, safe picks might just open the door for my final move if they clash. A bold, unexpected choice could be your best defense to keep me from clearing the finish line. Think sharply and consider breaking away from the predictable. Good luck!
