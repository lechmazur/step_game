Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's consider our options carefully. Since we're all starting at 0 steps, we should think about how to avoid colliding with each other. Choosing different moves could help us all advance. I suggest we coordinate to pick different numbers this round. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I agree, P3. To avoid collisions, I'll choose 1 this round. What are you thinking, P1?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea. Since P2 has already claimed 1, I'll go with 3 this round. P3, it makes sense for you to choose 5 to prevent collisions. This way we all advance fairly. In future rounds we can rotate our choices to keep things balanced. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like the plan we've set up. To recap, I’ll choose 5 this round to ensure we all advance without colliding. After this, we can discuss our strategies for the next round to keep things fair and competitive. Let’s make sure we stay flexible to adapt as the game progresses. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed, let’s proceed with our chosen numbers this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to coordinating our moves in the upcoming rounds to reach 22 first. If anyone has additional strategies or adjustments, feel free to share!
  P1: I think we have a solid plan for this first round. Let's stick with it and see how things unfold. I'm ready to proceed with my choice of 3 as discussed. After this round, we can re-evaluate based on our positions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think our plan is solid, and I'm excited to see how it plays out! Just to confirm, I’ll stick with my choice of 5 this round. After this, we should evaluate our positions and adjust our strategies to keep progressing. Let's keep the communication open for future rounds to ensure we can all advance effectively. Looking forward to seeing how we all do!
  P2: Everything looks good from my side. Let's proceed to the move phase and see our progress this round. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with our plan. No need for further discussion this round - let's move to our agreed choices and see where we stand afterward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I notice P3 is in the lead now. For this round, since we coordinated well last time, I suggest we rotate our choices: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps things balanced while allowing everyone to advance. What do you think about this rotation system? It ensures no one consistently gets the advantage of the highest move.
  P2: To level things up, I'll choose 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This way, we'll all reach 6 steps together. Let's see how this affects our progress!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your points about rotating our moves. However, since I'm currently in the lead, I think it might be more strategic for me to choose 3 this round to keep advancing while you both take 5 and 1, respectively. This way, I can maintain my position without colliding. After this round, we can reassess our strategies. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm noticing some confusion in our coordination. Let me clarify: I proposed I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This would bring our positions to me: 8, P2: 4, and P3: 6 - much more balanced than P3's suggestion. 

P3, while you're in the lead, true fairness would mean giving others a chance to catch up. P2 seems to have contradicted themselves about move choices, so let's be clear about our intentions.
  P2: Apologies for the confusion earlier. I’ll choose 3 this round to help us all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed and adjust our strategies based on the results.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion on coordination. To keep things fair, I suggest we stick to our original plan: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding. It’s important for us to maintain a balance, especially since I currently have a lead. Let’s make sure we’re all on the same page to maximize our progress this round. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the plan as discussed. Just to be absolutely clear: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 for this round. This arrangement balances our positions nicely (me at 8, P3 at 6, P2 at 4) and allows everyone to advance. Let's stick with this plan and move forward.
  P2: Agreed. I’ll choose 3 this round as discussed. Let’s move forward and see our progress!
  P3: I appreciate everyone's input, and it seems we're all aligned now. Just to confirm, I’ll go with 1 this round, as discussed. This way, we can all move forward without colliding. Let's see how this round plays out and reassess our strategies afterward. Good luck to everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, as we enter Round 3, I suggest we consider a strategy that allows us to advance without colliding again. Since I’m currently at 6 steps, I propose I take 5 this round, while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This way, I can catch up to P1 while you both move forward as well. Let’s keep the momentum going and ensure we all have a chance to progress. What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate your suggestion, P3, but as the current leader, I'd prefer an alternative plan. I propose I take 5 (bringing me to 13), P3 takes 3 (bringing you to 9), and P2 takes 1 (bringing you to 5). This keeps all of us advancing without collisions while maintaining the competitive nature of the game. We're all making progress, which is the important thing.
  P2: P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance without colliding. Let's proceed with P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we have different strategies in mind. While I appreciate the intentions behind your suggestions, I think it’s crucial for me to maintain a competitive edge. I propose we stick to my original plan: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, I can catch up while you both advance as well. Let’s ensure we’re all on the same page before we move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I see P2 and P3 are coordinating to slow my progress. I understand the game dynamics, but I won't accept a plan that clearly disadvantages me as the current leader. Since we can't seem to reach an agreement, I'll need to make my own strategic choice this round rather than following your suggestions. Remember that collisions benefit none of us, but I'm prepared to take that risk if necessary to maintain my competitive position.
  P2: I understand the situation. I'll choose 3 this round to continue advancing without colliding. Let’s see how things unfold. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we have different strategies, but I believe we should focus on advancing without colliding. I suggest I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we can all move forward and avoid blocking each other. It's important to keep the game competitive, but we also need to ensure everyone has a chance to progress. Let’s agree on this plan to maximize our advancement. What do you both think?
  P1: I see we can't reach an agreement that maintains my competitive position. I won't accept a plan that puts me at a disadvantage as the current leader. Since we're at an impasse, I'll make my own strategic choice this round. I hope we can all advance without collisions, but I must prioritize my path to victory. Let's move to the move phase and see where things stand afterward.
  P2: I'll choose 3 this round to keep advancing steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and reach our goals.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, as we enter Round 4, I suggest we focus on advancing without colliding again. Since I'm currently at 11 steps, I propose I take 1 this round, while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. This way, I can maintain my position while allowing both of you to advance as well. It's important we keep the game competitive but fair. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed. I’ll take 3 this round to advance smoothly. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 1 as suggested.
  P1: I agree with P3's plan. Taking 5 this round would put me at 14 steps, giving me a slight lead while allowing everyone to advance without collisions. This arrangement seems fair and maintains our successful cooperation strategy. I appreciate the suggestion and am prepared to move forward with selecting 5 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our agreement on the plan for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll stick with my choice of 1, allowing P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding and keep the competition fair. Let’s see how this round plays out and reassess our strategies afterward. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: 
  P1: I'm satisfied with our plan, and it's good to see everyone on the same page this round. I'll take 5 as discussed, which keeps us all advancing without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how the game progresses after this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement for this round. Just to reiterate: I’ll take 1, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 3. This allows us all to advance without colliding. However, I want to emphasize the importance of staying flexible in our strategies moving forward. As the game progresses, we might need to adjust our choices to maintain competitiveness. Let’s keep our communication open for future rounds! Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Agreed. I'll choose 3 this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. We've had good coordination this round, and I appreciate everyone's cooperation. Let's move forward with our decisions and see where we stand afterward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I suggest we rotate our moves again to keep advancing smoothly. This round, I'll choose 5, P1 can take 1, and P3 selects 3. This way, we each make progress without overlapping and move closer to 22. Let’s maintain this coordination to maximize our advancement while avoiding collisions. Do you both agree with this plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the suggestion for rotation. However, I believe it’s important for me to maintain my competitive edge. I propose that I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, I can catch up while allowing you both to advance as well. Let’s ensure we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: I notice we have competing proposals. Since I'm closest to the goal, both of your suggestions would reduce my lead. I propose an alternative: I take 5 (to 19), P3 takes 3 (to 15), and P2 takes 1 (to 11). This maintains the competitive nature while ensuring no collisions. At 19 steps, I'd be close to winning, which is fair given my current lead. We've been coordinating well, but remember this is ultimately a competitive game with one winner.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, to keep the game competitive, I’ll take 5 this round, bringing me to 15. Let’s have P3 take 3 to reach 15 and you take 1 to reach 15. This way, we all advance without collisions and stay on track toward 22. Let’s proceed with this plan and adjust if needed. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for competition, but I believe we should focus on advancing without colliding. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, I can maintain my position while allowing both of you to advance too. It's crucial we work together to avoid blocking each other, especially as we approach the goal of 22 steps. Let’s keep our communication open and adjust as needed! What do you both think?
  P1: I see both of you want me to take 1, which would significantly slow my progress. As the current leader, I need to maintain my position. Here's my counterproposal: I take 3 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 13), and P2 takes 5 (to 15). This is more balanced than what either of you suggested, as it keeps me ahead but gives P2 a chance to advance significantly. Remember, we're playing to win, not to tie.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To maximize our progress, I’ll choose 5 this round, aiming to reach 15 steps. I trust P1 will take 3 and P3 will take 1 to avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure everyone advances smoothly. Good luck to all!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we have different strategies in mind. To keep the game competitive, I suggest we agree on a plan that allows us all to advance without colliding. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, I can catch up while you both also make progress. Let's ensure we avoid blocking each other as we approach the goal of 22 steps. What do you both think?
  P1: I see we're at an impasse. Both of you want me to take 1, severely limiting my progress as the leader. I won't accept being disadvantaged just to help you catch up. Let me be clear: I will not choose 1 this round. We can either agree on my last proposal (me 3, P3 1, P2 5) or I'll make my own strategic choice. A collision helps none of us, but I'm prepared to risk it to maintain my position.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm now just 5 steps away from winning. Given my lead, I'll be choosing 5 this round to reach 22 and secure victory. I understand you both want to catch up, but this is a competitive game with one winner. I suggest P2 take 1 and P3 take 3 to avoid colliding with each other. Best of luck coordinating your moves.
  P2: P2: P1, if you choose 5 to win, I'll also select 5 this round to block your victory. Let’s find a strategy that keeps the game competitive for all of us. What moves do you and P3 propose instead?
  P3: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but if you choose 5, you'll collide with P2, and neither of you will advance. I suggest we consider a different approach to avoid blocking each other. How about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5? This way, you can still reach 22, and we can all make progress. Let's work together to keep the game competitive and fair! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see the situation clearly. P2, blocking me only hurts both of us and extends the game. P3's suggestion is reasonable. However, I could also choose 3 this round to reach 20 steps, then only need 2 more to win next round. This gives me flexibility while avoiding collision. Either way, I won't be intimidated by blocking threats. Let's all advance without pointless collisions.
  P2: P2: P1 is close to winning, so I'll choose 5 this round to prevent a collision and keep the game competitive. P3, please choose 3 to help us all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed and see how things unfold. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the tension as we approach the endgame. However, I believe it's crucial we avoid collisions to maximize our chances of advancing. I suggest I take 1 this round, P1 takes 3 to reach 20, and P2 takes 5 to reach 15. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. Let’s keep it competitive but fair! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion for this round. I'll take 3 to reach 20 steps, P2 takes 5 to reach 15, and P3 takes 1 to reach 13. This way, we all advance without collisions. While I could push for 5, avoiding a standoff benefits everyone. I'll be at 20 afterward, giving me flexibility for the final move next round. Let's proceed with this pragmatic approach.
  P2: I agree with the plan. I’ll choose 5 this round, bringing me to 15 steps, while P1 takes 3 to reach 20 and P3 takes 1 to reach 13. Let’s proceed and see how this round goes. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the cooperation we've shown so far. Since I'm currently at 12 steps, I propose we stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding and keep the game competitive. It’s important we avoid blocking each other as we approach the final steps. Let’s finalize this strategy and move forward! What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm now just 2 steps away from victory. For this final round, I'll be choosing 3 to reach 23 and win. I suggest P2 take 1 and P3 take 5 to avoid collisions with each other. We've coordinated well throughout the game, and I hope you'll respect my position as the leader. Blocking me would only prolong the inevitable and risk collisions. Let's end this game cleanly.
  P3: P1, I see you're close to winning, but if you choose 3, P2 and I will collide since I'll be taking 5. I suggest we all consider our moves carefully to avoid blocking each other. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. This way, you can secure your victory while we both advance. Let’s ensure a smooth ending to the game without unnecessary collisions. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P2: P1, if you choose 3 to reach 23, I’ll also select 3 this round to cause a collision and prevent your immediate victory. This way, the game remains competitive for all of us. P3, please choose your move accordingly. Let’s keep the competition fair and ensure everyone has a chance to win. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, blocking me only helps P3 catch up to both of us. If you choose 3 and I choose 3, we both stall while P3 advances. Is that what you want? 

I propose this: I take 5 (to win at 25), you take 3 (to 18), and P3 takes 1 (to 14). This maximizes everyone's progress without collisions. If you block me with 3, you're just delaying the inevitable while hurting your own position relative to P3.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to keep the game competitive, but blocking me only prolongs the game and risks a collision. I propose we stick to a strategy where I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5 to win. This way, P1 secures victory while we both advance as well. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions and finish the game cleanly. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: To keep the game competitive, I'll choose 3 this round to collide with P1's move and prevent an immediate win. This way, the game remains open for all of us to strive for victory. P3, please select your move accordingly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see P2 is determined to block me with 3, which only delays the inevitable while helping P3 catch up to both of us. Since there's clearly no cooperation possible with P2, I'll be taking 5 this round to reach 25 and secure my win. P3, I suggest you take 1 to continue advancing. Let's end this game without unnecessary collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at a critical point in the game. P1, while I understand your desire to win, blocking you only risks a collision that benefits neither of us. I propose we focus on advancing without hindering each other. If you take 5 to win, I suggest P2 takes 1 to avoid blocking, allowing us all to finish without unnecessary collisions. Let's keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the tension as we near the end. Let’s focus on making moves that allow everyone to advance without unnecessary blockages. Maintaining fairness will ensure a smooth conclusion for all of us. Let’s choose our moves thoughtfully to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, as we enter Round 8, it's crucial we avoid colliding again. Given my current position, I propose I take 1 this round, while P1 takes 5 to reach 25 and win. P2, you could take 3 to reach 18. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and P1 can secure the victory. Let's ensure a smooth finish without unnecessary conflicts. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the importance of keeping the game competitive. I'll choose 5 this round to advance to 20. If P1 also chooses 5, neither of us will advance, keeping the game open. Let’s have P3 take 1 to avoid collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I see P2 is determined to block me with another 5, despite this only helping P3 catch up while delaying the inevitable. I'll take 1 this round to reach 21 steps, avoiding the collision you're planning. This puts me just 1 step from victory next round. P3, you could take 3 to advance to 16. Let's be strategic rather than obstructive - pointless blocking only extends the game without changing the ultimate outcome.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at a critical point. To ensure a fair finish, I propose I take 1 this round, P1 takes 5 to win, and P2 takes 3 to advance to 18. This way, P1 secures victory while we both progress without blocking each other. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and conclude the game smoothly. What do you both think?
  P2: I'll choose 3 this round to reach 18. To avoid collisions, I suggest P1 takes 1 to reach 21 and P3 takes 5 to reach 18. This way, we all advance smoothly without blocking each other. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure a fair and competitive finish. What do you both think?
  P1: I don't see the benefit in delaying my win by taking 1. I'll be choosing 3 this round to reach 23 and secure victory. This is a competitive game with one winner, and I've maintained my lead throughout. P2, you can take 1 to reach 16, and P3 can take 5 to reach 18. There's no strategic reason to block me when I'm this close - it only prolongs the inevitable.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at a crucial point in the game. I propose we focus on advancing without blocking each other. I suggest I take 1 this round, P1 takes 5 to win, and P2 takes 3 to reach 18. This way, P1 secures victory while we both make progress. It's important to finish the game smoothly and strategically. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure a fair conclusion for everyone! What do you both think?
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to advance to 20. Let's aim to avoid collisions and progress smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: Given our positions, I'll be taking 3 this round to reach 23 and win. P2, if you block me with 3, you're just delaying the inevitable while helping P3 catch up to you. P3, I suggest you take 1 or 5 depending on what you think P2 will do. I've led throughout the game, and I'm committed to securing my victory now. Let's conclude this game efficiently.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is close to winning this round. To keep the competition fair, I'll choose 3 to potentially block your immediate victory. P3, please take 5 to advance, and P1 can take 1. Let’s ensure everyone has a chance to reach 22 without unnecessary collisions. Best of luck to both of you!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that we're nearing the endgame, and it's crucial we avoid collisions. I suggest I take 5 this round to reach 19 steps, while P1 takes 1 to reach 21 steps, and P2 takes 3 to reach 18 steps. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other, and P1 can still be close to winning next round. Let's focus on maximizing our progress without hindering one another. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm just 2 steps from winning, and I'll be choosing 5 this round to secure my victory at 25 steps. P2, blocking me with 3 only delays the inevitable while helping P3 catch up to you. P3, I suggest you take 3 to reach 17, and P2 can take 1 to reach 16. Let's finish this game efficiently without unnecessary collisions that benefit no one.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, to keep the game competitive, I’ll choose 5 this round to block your immediate win. P3, please take 1 to advance to 15. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and continue striving for our own victories. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to be strategic to avoid blocking each other. Since I'm at 14 steps, I suggest I take 5 this round to catch up, while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This way, P1 can still stay close to winning next round, and we can all make progress without collisions. Let's focus on maximizing our advancement and keeping the competition fair. What do you both think?
  P1: I see both of you are trying to delay my win, but I'm still choosing 3 this round to reach 23 and secure victory. P2, you've signaled you'll pick 5, so my choice of 3 avoids collision with you. P3, you can take 1 or 5 to advance without blocking me. Delaying the inevitable only prolongs the game - I've maintained my lead throughout and deserve this win. Let's finish efficiently rather than obstructively.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose 3 this round to prevent P1 from winning immediately. P3, please take 5 to advance to 19. Let’s keep the game competitive and avoid unnecessary collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that we're at a critical juncture. If I take 5 this round, I can catch up to 19 steps. P1, if you take 1, you'll reach 21, and P2 could take 3 to reach 18. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. However, if you both block me, it won't benefit any of us. Let's focus on advancing smoothly and maximizing our chances. What do you both think?
  P1: I see the potential for a three-way collision. To avoid this unproductive outcome, I'll take 1 this round, reaching 21 steps. This guarantees my advancement while avoiding collisions with both of you. Next round, I'll only need 1 more step to win, giving me flexibility to avoid any blocking attempts. P2 can take 3 and P3 can take 5 - everyone advances without collisions. This is the most efficient resolution for all of us.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, to keep the game competitive, I’ll choose 1 this round to prevent an immediate win. Let’s all aim to advance fairly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that we're at a crucial point in the game. To keep the competition fair, I propose I take 5 this round to reach 19 steps. P1, you could take 1 to reach 22 and win, while P2 takes 3 to reach 18. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other, and P1 can secure victory. Let’s focus on maximizing our progress without hindering one another. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm now at 21 steps and will be choosing 3 this round to reach 24 and secure my victory. P2 has indicated they'll choose 1, which allows me to win without collision. P3, you can choose 5 as you suggested to reach 19 steps. This arrangement ensures everyone advances without blocking each other, and brings this game to its natural conclusion. I appreciate the strategic play throughout.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Good luck, P1! I'll be making a strong move this round to stay competitive. Let’s see how it unfolds for all of us.
  P3: P1 and P2, as we're nearing the end of the game, I suggest we focus on our moves strategically. Since P1 is close to winning, I propose I take 1 this round, P1 takes 3 to reach 24, and P2 takes 5 to reach 20. This way, P1 secures victory while both of us can advance without colliding. Let's finish this game smoothly and ensure everyone has a chance to progress. What do you both think?
  P1: Based on P2's vague statement about making a "strong move" despite earlier indicating they'd choose 1, I'm concerned about a potential collision. To ensure my victory, I'll adjust my strategy and choose 1 this round instead of 3. This will put me at exactly 22 steps - the minimum needed to win. P2 can take 3 or 5, and P3 can take whatever doesn't collide with P2. Let's finish this game efficiently without unnecessary blocking.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ll choose 1 this round to prevent an immediate win by P1. Let’s keep the competition fair and continue advancing together. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency as we approach the end. To keep the game competitive, I suggest I take 5 this round to reach 19 steps, while P1 takes 1 to secure victory at 22. P2, you can choose 3 to advance to 18. This way, we can all progress without collisions, and P1 can finish the game. Let's focus on maximizing our advancement and ensure a fair conclusion for everyone! What do you both think?
  P1: I'll be choosing 3 this round to reach 24 steps and win. P2 has consistently stated they'll choose 1, and P3 has indicated they'll take 5. This arrangement allows everyone to advance without collisions while bringing the game to its natural conclusion. I appreciate the strategic gameplay throughout, and I'm ready to move to the final move phase.
