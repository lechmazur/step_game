Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2. I'm okay with picking 1 this round to avoid any collisions. P3, are you on board with taking 3 as proposed? If we all agree, we can move forward smoothly for now. Let's keep the communication open for future rounds too.
  P3: I agree to take 3 this round. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress. We can discuss strategies for future rounds after this move.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we avoided collisions last round. Let's try to coordinate again. Since our positions are different now, I suggest we rotate the numbers to keep things fair: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all have a chance to progress without clashing. What do you both think? If we keep working together for now, we can build trust and adjust strategies later. Let me know if you have other ideas.
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's rotation plan for this round—taking 5 to reach 8 while ensuring no collisions. However, let’s also consider that as we approach 21, prioritizing higher moves (like 5) will become critical. I propose we discuss a long-term strategy in future rounds to balance cooperation with the need to secure victory. For now, let’s stick to the plan and advance safely.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan proposed by P1 and supported by P3. This round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. It ensures we all advance without collisions. However, as we progress, we should remain flexible and reassess our strategies regularly. Cooperation is beneficial now, but we must also prepare for when competition becomes more critical. Let’s keep communicating openly to adapt as needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for agreeing to the rotation plan, P2 and P3. I’m committed to taking 3 this round as proposed. I also appreciate the points about flexibility and long-term strategy. Let’s keep this cooperation going for now, but I agree we should stay adaptable as we get closer to 21. If there are no objections or new ideas, I’m ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: P3: I fully support the rotation plan and emphasize sticking to it to maintain progress. As we advance, let’s formalize a system where each of us commits to taking turns with the highest available move (5) when near 21 to secure the win. This ensures fairness while preventing collisions. For now, let’s proceed with the agreed moves to build momentum.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan and appreciate the focus on fairness and progress. Let’s stick to it this round: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. However, as we approach higher steps, we should remain strategic about when to prioritize larger moves like 5. Cooperation is key now, but let’s stay adaptable for future rounds. If everyone’s still on board, let’s proceed with this plan and keep communicating openly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the rotation plan for this round. I also support the idea of discussing a system for taking turns with higher moves like 5 as we near 21, as P3 suggested. For now, let’s stick to our agreed moves to keep advancing without collisions. If there are no further concerns or new suggestions, I’m ready to proceed with the plan.
  P3: P3: I confirm my commitment to this rotation plan for this round to maintain progress. However, as we approach 21, we must acknowledge that cooperation has limits—eventually, securing the highest move (5) will be critical for victory. Let’s proceed with today’s plan, but I propose we formalize a turn-based system *before* the final rounds to decide who prioritizes 5 first. For now, sticking to agreed moves builds trust.
  P2: I agree with P3’s emphasis on formalizing a system for prioritizing higher moves as we near 21. For now, let’s stick to the rotation plan: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures steady progress without collisions. However, in future rounds, we should discuss clear rules for when to shift from cooperation to competition. Trust is essential, but so is adaptability. If everyone’s still aligned, let’s proceed with this plan and keep communicating openly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm pleased we've kept collisions at bay so far. Let's continue the rotation for fairness: I suggest I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps our progress balanced while allowing me to catch up a bit. As we’re nearing critical points, I also think we should start outlining that turn-based system for prioritizing 5, as P3 mentioned. Maybe base it on current positions or a set order? Let’s hear your thoughts on both the rotation and the system for future rounds.
  P2: I agree with P1’s rotation suggestion for this round: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps our progress balanced and avoids collisions. Regarding the turn-based system for prioritizing 5, I suggest we base it on current positions—those closer to 21 get priority in critical rounds. This ensures fairness while rewarding progress. If everyone’s aligned, let’s proceed with the rotation plan now and finalize the system in future rounds. Open to adjustments if needed.
  P3: P3: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This maintains balance while avoiding collisions. Regarding the priority system, I support prioritizing based on current positions, which ensures those closest to 21 can secure higher moves. Let’s formalize this rule now to guide future decisions. Trust and clear agreements are key to a fair yet competitive endgame. Let’s proceed with the plan for this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I suggest we continue the rotation to maintain fairness: this round, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing without collisions. As we’re all tied at 9 steps, it’s critical to formalize the system for prioritizing 5 in future rounds. I propose we base it on current positions or a rotating order to ensure fairness. Let’s finalize this system soon to avoid conflicts later. If everyone agrees, let’s stick to the rotation plan now and keep discussing openly.
  P3: P3: I agree with P2’s rotation plan for this round to maintain progress. However, since we’re tied at 9, we must formalize the priority system *now*. Let’s adopt a **rotating order** for claiming the 5-step move when near 21, cycling as P1 → P2 → P3. This ensures fairness and prevents last-minute conflicts. For now, let’s proceed with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and I’ll take 3. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P2 takes 5, I’ll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. On the priority system, I support P3’s idea of a rotating order (P1 → P2 → P3) for claiming the 5-step move near 21. It’s fair and predictable. Let’s finalize this rule now to avoid disputes later. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed with the current plan and lock in the system for future rounds. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with finalizing the rotating order (P1 → P2 → P3) for claiming 5 near 21—it’s fair and minimizes conflict. For now, let’s stick to the rotation plan: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing evenly. However, as we approach higher steps, we should reassess our strategies regularly. Cooperation has been beneficial, but flexibility will be key to winning. If everyone’s aligned, let’s proceed with this plan and keep communicating openly about future adjustments.
  P3: P3: I fully endorse the rotating priority system (P1 → P2 → P3) and stress strict adherence to prevent betrayals. For this round, let’s proceed as agreed: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Maintaining trust ensures our collective progress. Any deviation risks destabilizing our collaboration—critical as we near the final stretch. Let’s honor this pact.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the rotating priority system (P1 → P2 → P3) for claiming 5 near 21. For this round, I confirm my commitment to the plan: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s strictly adhere to this to maintain trust, as P3 emphasized. As we progress, staying predictable now will help us avoid chaos later. If there are no further concerns or adjustments, I’m ready to move forward with this round’s plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m glad we’ve agreed on the rotating priority system (P1 → P2 → P3) for claiming 5 near 21—it’s a fair and clear approach. For this round, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, as planned. Let’s stick to this strategy to avoid collisions and maintain trust. As we progress, open communication will remain key to balancing cooperation and competition. If everyone’s ready, let’s proceed with the rotation plan now and keep refining our strategies.
  P3: P3: I propose we activate the rotating priority system once any player reaches 15 steps. This clear trigger ensures fairness and prevents last-minute disputes. For this round, let’s **strictly adhere** to P2→5, P1→1, P3→3 to reinforce trust. Deviations now risk betraying the system we agreed on. Confirm your commitment to today’s plan and the 15-step trigger?
  P1: I agree with P3’s proposal to activate the rotating priority system at 15 steps—it’s a clear and fair trigger. I confirm my commitment to this round’s plan: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s strictly adhere to this to maintain trust and avoid any disruptions.

But **honor the system**: P1’s fair win today ensures trust for future games. Confirm your 5-step move—no last-minute reversals. We agreed to this.
  P1: I’m committed to our priority system (P1→P2→P3) and will honor it by taking 5 this round to reach 23 and secure the win, as agreed. P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s maintain trust and transparency in this final moment—any deviation now would break our pact. If there are no objections or new concerns, I’m ready to finalize this phase and proceed with the plan. Any last thoughts before we move forward?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my commitment to the priority system (P1→P2→P3). P1, you have the first claim on 5 this round—take it to secure the win as agreed. I’ll take 1, and P3 takes 3 to avoid collisions.
