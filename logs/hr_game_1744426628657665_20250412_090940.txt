Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To prevent collisions and ensure everyone advances, let's coordinate for turn 1: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I (P3) choose 5. This way, we all move forward without issues. What do you think?
  P2: That sounds fair for the first round. I'm okay with taking 3 this turn if everyone sticks to the plan. Let's avoid collisions and all get a good start.
  P1: I’m fine with the plan for this round. I’ll take 1 as suggested by P3. Let’s stick to this coordination to ensure we all move forward without any collisions. I think it’s a good way to start the game on a positive note.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Excellent, consensus reached. I'll honor my commitment for this turn by choosing 5. Let's all stick to the plan to avoid any issues. If we're all set, we can move on.
  P2: If everyone sticks to the agreed plan—P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5—then we all move forward safely. Let’s build trust early; it benefits all of us in the long run. Ready to move?
  P1: I'm glad we have a plan for this round. Let's stick to P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5. Building trust early is key, and I’m committed to following through. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm disappointed that the plan fell apart last round with P2 choosing 5 instead of 3, causing a collision with P3. Let’s try to rebuild trust this turn. I propose we stick to a similar coordination: I’ll take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I’m committed to my choice of 1. Can we agree on this for round 2? If so, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: I'm frustrated by P2's betrayal last round, which cost me progress. To rebuild trust, I'll tentatively agree to P1's proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. But P2 must prove reliable this time, or I'll adjust my strategy. What do you say, P2? Let's aim for no collisions.
  P2: I understand the frustration and take responsibility for the last round—I got greedy. This time, I’m willing to stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s move forward without collisions and rebuild trust.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad to see P2 acknowledging the mistake and committing to the plan this round. Let's solidify this agreement: I'll stick to 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. We all benefit from advancing without collisions, especially early on. If we're all on the same page, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm still cautious after P2's betrayal, but I'll honor the plan for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. Let's rebuild trust and advance together. If everyone commits, we all benefit. Ready to move on?
  P2: I appreciate the willingness to move forward collaboratively. I’ll stick to choosing 3 this round as agreed. Let’s all show we can be trusted—this benefits everyone. If we each follow through, we all advance and reset the tone. Ready to move?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm pleased we're aligning on this plan for round 2. Let's confirm once more: I'll stick to 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Consistency here will help us all progress and maintain trust. If we keep this up, we can avoid unnecessary setbacks. I'm ready to move to the next phase if everyone else is.
  P3: I'm cautiously optimistic about this round's plan. If we all stick to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5, we advance together and rebuild trust. But if betrayal happens again, I'll adjust my strategy to protect my position. Let's move forward.
  P2: I understand the skepticism, and I’m committed to rebuilding trust. I’ll stick to 3 this round as agreed—no tricks. We all benefit from clean progress early on. Let’s prove we can coordinate and move forward together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we're maintaining this dialogue and commitment to the plan for round 2. Let's finalize our agreement: I'll stick to 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This coordination ensures we all progress without setbacks. Trust is crucial, and I'm confident we can make this work if we all follow through. If there are no further concerns or changes, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's advance together this round.
  P3: I'm sticking to the agreed plan for this round—I'll choose 5 to advance and rebuild trust. P2's commitment is noted, but any further betrayal will force me to adapt aggressively. Let's all move forward smoothly.
  P2: I know I messed up last round, and I appreciate you both giving me another chance. I’m fully committed to picking 3 this time—no tricks. Let’s all prove we can cooperate when it matters. If we each do our part, we all advance and build a foundation for smarter play ahead. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2's repeated betrayals are unacceptable and erode any trust. To test your commitment, I propose a new plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1 to prove reliability, and I take 5. This rotation could help us all advance without collisions. P1, what do you think? If P2 refuses or deviates, I'll adapt aggressively to protect my win. Let's see if cooperation is possible.
  P1: I'm frustrated with P2's repeated betrayal, as it’s hindering everyone’s progress. P3, I’m open to your new plan for this round: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 5. This rotation seems fair and gives us a chance to advance without collisions. P2, I urge you to stick to this plan and prove we can trust you. Let’s avoid further setbacks and move forward together. If everyone agrees, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand your frustration, and I take full responsibility for the past two rounds. I agree to the new plan: I will choose 1 this round. This is my chance to prove I can be trusted. If we stick to P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5, we all move forward cleanly. Let’s reset and build from here.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your repeated betrayals make me skeptical, but I'll tentatively stick to the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1. This is your opportunity to rebuild trust and let us all advance. If you deviate again, I'll shift to a more competitive strategy to secure my win. Let's see some reliability.
  P1: I'm glad we're trying a new plan this round with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5. P2, this is a critical chance to show you’re committed to cooperation. Let’s all stick to this rotation to ensure we advance without collisions. Trust is hard to rebuild, but following through here can set a positive tone. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: I know I've broken trust twice, and I deserve the skepticism. But I'm sticking to 1 this round—no tricks. If I don't, I gain nothing long-term, and you both will never cooperate again. Let's reset and all move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your apologies ring hollow after two betrayals. I'll tentatively honor the plan—P1 takes 3, you take 1, I take 5—to test your reliability one last time. But if you deviate again, I'll abandon coordination and play aggressively to win alone. Let's move forward and see if trust can be rebuilt.
  P1: I'm cautiously optimistic about this round's plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. P2, sticking to 1 is crucial to rebuild trust after past betrayals. Let’s all commit to this rotation to ensure we advance without collisions. If we follow through, we can reset the tone and progress together. I’m ready to move to the next phase if everyone is aligned. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P2: I understand the skepticism, and I know I’ve burned trust. But this is my chance to prove I’m serious about cooperating. I will choose 1 this round—no tricks. If I betray again, I lose any chance of future coordination. Let’s all stick to the plan and move forward cleanly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your track record makes me wary, but I'll stick to the plan this round: I take 5, you take 1, P1 takes 3. Prove your words or face my full aggression moving forward. P1, solid proposal. Let's test this and move on.
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. P2, following through is essential to rebuild trust. Let’s ensure we all advance without collisions and reset the game’s tone. I’m committed to choosing 3 as agreed. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let’s make this work and progress together.
  P2: I know I’ve burned trust, and I won’t blame you for doubting me. But I’m sticking to 1 this round—no tricks, no excuses. If I betray again, I’ll lose any chance of winning through cooperation. Let’s all follow through: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. Clean moves benefit us all. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm beyond frustrated with P2's consistent betrayals, especially last round when you picked 3 instead of 1, causing another collision with me. Trust is shattered. P3, since you’ve been reliable, I propose we work together: I’ll take 1, you take 5, and let P2 fend for themselves with 3. This way, we both advance while minimizing risk. P2, I see no reason to include you in plans anymore. Let’s see if we can progress without further setbacks. Thoughts, P3? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: P1, I agree with your proposal since you've been reliable unlike P2. I'll commit to taking 5 while you take 1, letting P2 handle their own moves. P2, your repeated betrayals mean you're excluded; if you collide with us, it only hurts your chances. This coordination minimizes risk and helps us advance. P2, any thoughts, or should we move on?
  P2: I understand I’ve burned trust, and I accept the consequences. But isolating me only ensures you two get ahead while I fall further behind—I can’t let that happen. If I collide with one of you, no one gains. But if we rotate fairly, we all progress. I propose this: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. I’ll stick to 1 this time—no tricks. I know I’m on thin ice, but I’m still in this game. Let’s avoid mutual damage.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your repeated betrayals make your proposal hard to trust. I’m sticking with P3 for now since they’ve been consistent. P3, let’s maintain our plan: I’ll take 1, you take 5. This ensures we both advance safely. P2, if you pick 3 as suggested earlier by P3, we can all move forward without collisions. But I’m skeptical of your commitment. If we’re aligned, P3, I’m ready to proceed. Any final thoughts before we move to the next phase? Let’s focus on progress and minimize risks.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking firmly to our agreed plan: I'll take 5, you take 1, and we'll leave P2 to their own devices. Your consistency has been reliable, unlike P2's repeated betrayals, which make any proposal from them untrustworthy. This minimizes risk and lets us advance. If we're aligned, let's end this discussion.
  P2: P1, P3 — I know I’ve broken trust, but isolating me guarantees I fall behind and become desperate. That leads to more collisions, which hurts everyone. If we rotate fairly, we can all advance. I’ll pick 1 this round — no tricks, no excuses. Let me prove I can cooperate. P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5 — clean and fair. You don’t have to trust me forever, just test me once.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your history of betrayal makes your latest proposal unconvincing. I’m sticking with P3, who has shown reliability. P3, let’s maintain our plan: I take 1, you take 5. This ensures we advance safely. P2, if you truly want to avoid collisions, pick 3 as previously suggested, but I’m not banking on your cooperation. Let’s minimize risks and move forward. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking firmly to our agreement: I'll take 5, you take 1, ensuring we both advance safely. P2, your repeated betrayals make any proposal from you irrelevant—focus on your own moves. This coordination minimizes risk and builds on our trust. If we're aligned, let's move forward without further delay.
  P2: P1, P3 — I know I’ve burned trust, but isolating me guarantees desperation and more collisions. That hurts everyone. If we rotate fairly, we all gain. I’ll pick 1 this round — no tricks. Let’s test cooperation one last time: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. If I betray again, you’ll never trust me, and I lose anyway. But if I follow through, we all move forward and reset the tone. Give me one chance to prove I can cooperate.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your repeated betrayals leave no room for trust, and your latest plea changes nothing. P3, I’m committed to our plan: I’ll take 1, you take 5. This ensures we advance safely while minimizing risk. P2, if you pick 3, we can all move forward without collision, but I’m not counting on it. Let’s focus on progress, P3. I’m ready for the move phase if you are.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking to our solid plan: I'll take 5, you take 1, ensuring we both advance without risk. P2, your betrayals speak louder than your pleas—I'm done entertaining them. This coordination builds on our trust and keeps me ahead. If you're ready, let's wrap this up and move to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3 — I know I’ve lost your trust, but you both advancing while I fall behind guarantees I’ll have to sabotage just to stay in the game. That hurts all of us. I’m picking 1 this round — no tricks. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, we all move forward cleanly. I gain a little, you gain more. It’s your call: test me once or risk constant collisions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, our coordination has been effective, so let's build on it. I'll commit to taking 5 again to maintain my lead. For you, taking 3 this round could help you progress safely. P2, given your history of betrayal, we're excluding you from this plan—pick wisely to avoid collisions, but don't expect trust. What do you think, P1? If we're aligned, we can move forward smoothly.
  P2: P1, P3 — I know I’m far behind, and I’ve earned your distrust. But sabotaging only slows us all down. I’ll pick 1 this round — no tricks. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, we all move forward cleanly. I gain a little, you gain more. I’m not asking for trust, just one chance to prove I can cooperate. Let’s avoid collisions and make progress.
  P1: P3, I appreciate our successful coordination last round. I’m on board with your suggestion: I’ll take 3, and you take 5 to keep advancing safely. P2, your history of betrayal makes it hard to consider your proposal. If you truly want to avoid collisions, stick to 1 as you’ve said, and we can all progress. Let’s keep setbacks to a minimum. P3, if we’re aligned, I’m ready to move forward. Any final thoughts before we proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm pleased with our ongoing coordination—I'll stick to 5, and you take 3 for continued safe progress. P2, your repeated betrayals make your pleas unconvincing; we're not including you in our plans. Focus on your own moves to avoid self-inflicted setbacks. If we're all set, let's move forward.
  P2: P1, P3 — I know I’ve made mistakes, but I’m not giving up. If I sabotage now, we all lose ground. I’ll take 1 this round — no tricks. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, we all move forward. You gain more than I do, but I stay in the game without hurting anyone. I’m not asking for trust, just one clean round to prove I’m serious. Let’s avoid another collision.
  P1: P3, I’m committed to our plan: I’ll take 3, and you take 5, ensuring we both advance safely. P2, your repeated betrayals make it impossible to trust your intentions, even now. If you genuinely want no collisions, stick to 1 as you’ve stated, and we can all progress this round. Let’s keep setbacks minimal. P3, I’m ready to move to the next phase if you are. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m set to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm fully committed to our plan: I'll take 5 to build on my lead, and you take 3 for steady progress. This minimizes risks and keeps us advancing. P2, your history of betrayal makes your pleas irrelevant—we're not adjusting for you. If we're aligned, let's wrap this up.
  P2: P1, P3 — I know I’ve broken trust, but I’m sticking to 1 this round. If you both follow through with 3 and 5, we all move forward cleanly. I gain the least, you gain more — it’s a low-risk test of my sincerity. Sabotage doesn’t help me now. Let’s avoid another collision and reset the tone.
  P1: P3, I’m sticking to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both advance. P2, your past actions make trust impossible, but if you pick 1 as you’ve said, we can all move forward this round without collisions. Let’s keep progress steady and avoid setbacks. P3, I’m ready to move to the next phase if you are. If there’s nothing more to add, let’s proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm sticking to our plan: I'll take 5 to extend my lead, and you take 3 for steady progress. This coordination has worked well and minimizes risks. P2, your history of betrayal makes your pleas meaningless—we're not budging. If we're aligned, let's end this and move forward.
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m sticking to 1 this round, no tricks. I gain the least, you both gain more. If you follow through with 3 and 5, we all move forward cleanly. I know I’ve burned trust, but sabotage hurts me more now. This is a low-risk chance to test my sincerity. Let’s avoid another collision.
  P1: P3, I’m fully committed to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both keep advancing. P2, your consistent betrayals make it impossible to trust you, but if you stick to 1 as stated, we can all progress this round. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and maintain steady progress. P3, I’m ready to move to the next phase if you are. If there’s nothing more to discuss, let’s proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 — I followed through last round and picked 1 as promised. That shows I can cooperate when it counts. Let’s build on that: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, I take 1 again. Same as last round, no collisions, everyone advances. I gain the least, you gain more — it’s in all our interests. Let’s keep it clean.
  P3: P2, your cooperation last round is noted, but your history makes me cautious. I'll stick to taking 5 to build my lead. P1, let's continue our reliable coordination with you taking 3. This ensures we advance safely. P2, if you take 1 as promised, great; otherwise, expect aggressive play from me. Thoughts, P1?
  P1: P3, I’m glad our coordination has been working well. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both advance safely. P2, your cooperation last round is a positive step, but trust is still thin. If you stick to 1 as suggested, we can all move forward without collisions. Let’s keep progress steady and avoid setbacks. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts before we move on?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3 — I followed through last round and will do it again. I’m taking 1 this round, no tricks. You both gain more than I do, and we all avoid collisions. I know trust takes time to rebuild, but this is a low-risk way to keep everyone moving forward. Let’s keep the momentum.
  P3: P1, I'm glad we're aligned on our plan—you take 3, I take 5 for steady progress. P2, your last cooperation is noted, but trust is fragile; stick to 1 to avoid collisions, or expect me to adapt aggressively. This minimizes risks for all. If we're set, I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, I’m committed to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both keep advancing. P2, sticking to 1 as you’ve promised will help us all progress without collisions. Let’s maintain this momentum and avoid setbacks. Trust is still rebuilding, but consistent cooperation benefits everyone. If we’re all on the same page, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Any last concerns before we proceed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3 — I appreciate the chance to rebuild trust. I’ll stick to 1 again this round, just like last time. You both gain more than I do, and we all avoid collisions. This is the smart path forward for all of us. Let’s keep the momentum and prove cooperation works.
  P3: P1, I'm fully committed to our plan: I'll take 5 to extend my lead, and you take 3 for steady progress. P2, your recent cooperation is noted, but trust is still fragile—stick to 1 to avoid collisions, or expect me to adapt aggressively. This minimizes risks for all. If we're aligned, let's wrap this up and move forward.
  P1: P3, I’m sticking to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both advance. P2, your recent cooperation is a step forward, but trust remains fragile. If you stick to 1, we all progress without issues. Let’s keep this momentum for steady gains and avoid any setbacks. Consistent play benefits us all in the long run. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready to move to the next phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3 — I followed through last round and will do it again. I’ll pick 1 this round, no tricks. You both gain more, I gain a little, and we avoid collisions. If we keep this up, everyone progresses. I know trust is still shaky, but consistent cooperation is the only way I stay in this game. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P3: P1, I'm fully committed to our reliable plan: I'll take 5 to build my lead, and you take 3 for steady progress. P2, your recent cooperation is noted, but your history of betrayal keeps me cautious—stick to 1 to avoid collisions, or expect aggressive countermeasures from me. This minimizes risks for all. If we're aligned, let's wrap this up.
  P1: P3, I’m fully on board with our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring our steady progress. P2, your recent cooperation is a positive sign, but trust is still fragile. Stick to 1 as promised, and we all advance without issues. Let’s maintain this momentum for consistent gains and avoid any setbacks. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready to move to the next phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's maintain our successful coordination: I'll take 5 to build on my lead, and you take 3 for steady progress. P2, your recent cooperation is appreciated, but stick to 1 this round to avoid collisions—picking 5 would only cause mutual setbacks and benefit no one. This keeps everyone advancing smoothly. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I’m happy to continue our effective coordination: I’ll take 3, and you take 5 to keep advancing. P2, your recent cooperation is a good sign, but trust is still rebuilding. Stick to 1 as suggested to ensure we all progress without collisions. Let’s maintain this momentum for steady gains. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Any concerns before we proceed?
  P2: P1, P3 — I’ve stuck to 1 for two rounds now, proving I can cooperate. I’ll do it again this round. You both gain more, I gain a little, and we all avoid collisions. If P3 hits 23 this round, it’s game over unless we coordinate. P1, if you take 5 and I take 3, we can block P3 from winning. Just think about it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your latest ploy to tempt P1 into blocking me is transparent and desperate—your betrayals have left you isolated. P1, our coordination has been solid; stick to taking 3 while I take 5, ensuring we both advance without risk. This benefits us far more than any short-term sabotage. Let's not let P2 disrupt our momentum. Ready to confirm, P1?
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both advance. P2, your suggestion to block P3 is noted, but I’m not ready to risk our momentum or trust a sudden shift after your past betrayals. Let’s keep it clean—stick to 1, and we all progress. Sabotage now could hurt us all more than it helps. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Any final concerns?
  P2: P1, I get that trust is fragile, but if P3 takes 5 and you take 3, P3 wins this round. You lose. If you take 5 and I take 3, we block P3 and both gain. I’ve cooperated two rounds straight—this is your chance to shift the balance. We can stop P3 and keep the game alive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, don't be fooled by P2's desperate tactics—after their betrayals, their word is worthless. If you take 5 and collide with me, you stall your own progress while I could still win soon. Stick with our plan: you take 3 to advance safely, I take 5 to build my lead. This ensures steady gains for both of us. P2, keep to 1 if you want to avoid more setbacks. Let's maintain our momentum and proceed wisely.
  P1: P3, I’m committed to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both advance. P2, your proposal to block P3 is tempting, but your history of betrayal makes it a risky gamble. I’d rather maintain steady progress with P3 than risk a collision. Stick to 1, and we all move forward this round. Let’s avoid unnecessary setbacks and keep the game competitive. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any last thoughts before we wrap up?
  P2: P1, if P3 takes 5 and you take 3, P3 wins. You lose. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block P3 and both gain. I’ve cooperated two rounds in a row—this is your chance to shift the outcome. Let’s stop P3 from winning and keep the game alive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2's repeated betrayals make their latest scheme untrustworthy—don't fall for it. Our plan has delivered steady progress; you take 3 to advance safely, I take 5 to secure the win. Colliding with me stalls your growth and hands P2 an undeserved edge. Stay smart and committed. P2, your words are hollow.
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5. Our coordination has been reliable, and I see no reason to risk that now. P2, I can’t trust your sudden shift in strategy given your past. Let’s keep it clean—stick to 1, and we all advance this round. Sabotaging P3 might delay the game, but it doesn’t guarantee my win. I’d rather maintain steady progress. If we’re all set, I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: P1, this is your last chance to stop P3 from winning. If P3 takes 5 and you take 3, they hit 25 and win—game over. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block P3 and both gain. I’ve cooperated two rounds in a row. You don’t have to trust me forever—just this once to keep the game alive. Think strategically.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we successfully blocked P3 last round—nice move. If we want a shot at winning, we need to do it again. I’ll take 3 this round if you take 5. P3 will be forced to stall or risk another collision. We both gain, and P3 stays at 20. Let’s keep the pressure on and shift the momentum.
  P3: P1, P2's history of betrayal makes their latest scheme unreliable—don't risk stalling your progress by trusting them again. If you collide with me, you gain nothing while I adapt aggressively in future rounds. I'm open to fair coordination with you to avoid mutual setbacks. P2, your empty promises won't work; focus on not self-sabotaging. Let's think strategically for all our sakes.
  P1: P3, I recognize the risk of trusting P2 given their past betrayals, and I value our prior coordination. Let’s return to a safer plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both advance. P2, I can’t rely on your promises after repeated deception. Stick to 1 to avoid collisions, or risk being left behind. P3, this keeps us progressing without unnecessary setbacks. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to move forward. Thoughts before we proceed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3 is at 20—if he takes 5 again and you take 3, he wins. If you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain. I’ve cooperated three rounds in a row—this isn’t betrayal, it’s strategy. We can still win, but only if we stop P3 now. Let’s shift the balance again.
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're sticking with our proven plan—your 3 and my 5 ensure we both advance safely, building on our trust. P2's claims of cooperation are hollow after their betrayals; trusting them risks stalling your progress for no gain. Let's avoid their desperate tactics and keep our momentum. If we're aligned, I'm ready to move forward.
  P1: P3, I’m committed to our plan of me taking 3 and you taking 5 to ensure we both advance. P2, your strategy to block P3 is tempting, but your history of betrayal makes it a risky bet. I’d rather secure steady progress than gamble on a collision. Stick to 1, and we can all move forward this round. Let’s avoid setbacks and keep the game competitive. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3 wins this round if we let him. You and I both lose. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain. I've cooperated three rounds in a row—this is your chance to shift the outcome. Let's stop P3 now while we still can.
  P3: P1, don't be swayed by P2's repeated deceptions—they've shown unreliability time and again. Our plan works: you take 3 to advance steadily, I take 5 to secure the win fairly. Colliding with me stalls your progress for no gain. P2, your tactics are transparent and futile. If we're aligned, P1, let's move forward and end this distraction.
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with our plan: I take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both advance. P2, I can’t trust your proposal to block P3 given your past betrayals. Risking a collision could stall me while P3 still pulls ahead later. Let’s keep it clean—stick to 1, and we all progress this round. I’d rather secure steady gains than gamble on uncertainty. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Any last concerns before we proceed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, this is your last real chance to stop P3 from winning. If he takes 5 and you take 3, it’s game over. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain. I've stuck to my word three rounds in a row—this is strategic, not betrayal. You don’t have to trust me forever, just this once to keep the game alive and give yourself a shot at winning. Let’s shift the balance now.
  P3: P1, I'm fully committed to our proven plan: you take 3 to advance steadily, I take 5 to secure my lead and aim for victory. P2's repeated betrayals make their latest scheme a dangerous gamble—trusting them could stall your progress for no gain. Let's stay disciplined and avoid unnecessary risks. If we're aligned, I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, I’m firm on our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both advance. P2, your persistence to block P3 is noted, but I can’t risk trusting you given past betrayals. A collision could set me back while P3 still wins later. Stick to 1, and we all progress. I’m prioritizing steady gains over uncertain gambles. If there are no further issues, I’m ready to move to the next phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your betrayal last round was costly for both of us—let's not repeat that mistake. I'll commit to taking 5 to reach victory, while you take 3 for steady progress without risk. This coordination ensures we both advance and avoid mutual setbacks. P2, your disruptions only hurt your chances; stick to 1. If we're aligned, P1, I'm ready to move forward. What do you think?
  P2: P1, we blocked P3 twice now—he’s stuck at 20. If he gets 5 this round, it’s over. But if you take 5 and I take 3 again, we block him and both gain. I’ve cooperated for three rounds straight—this is strategic, not betrayal. You still have a shot at winning, but only if we stop P3 now. Let’s shift the balance together.
  P1: P3, I apologize for last round’s misstep; I see now it hurt us both. I’m committed to rebuilding trust—let’s stick to you taking 5 and me taking 3 to ensure we advance. P2, I can’t risk another gamble with you given the stakes. If P3 wins, I’ll accept it over stalling myself further. Stick to 1, and we all progress. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game fair. P3, if we’re aligned, I’m ready to move forward. Any final thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're committed to rebuilding trust—our plan of you taking 3 and me taking 5 ensures you advance steadily while I secure victory, minimizing risks for both. P2, your persistent sabotage only delays your inevitable loss; stick to 1 to avoid more collisions. If we're aligned, P1, let's wrap this up and proceed.
  P2: P1, this is your final chance to stop P3 from winning. If he takes 5 and you take 3, it’s over. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him and both gain. I’ve cooperated for three rounds straight—this isn’t betrayal, it’s strategy. You still have a path to victory, but only if we act now. Let’s shift the momentum.
  P1: P3, I’m fully committed to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring we both advance and you secure the win. P2, I can’t trust another gamble with you—blocking P3 risks stalling me further while not guaranteeing my victory. Stick to 1, and we avoid collisions. I’d rather accept P3’s win with steady progress than risk more setbacks. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any last concerns before we wrap up?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're committed to our plan—it ensures you advance steadily with 3 while I secure victory with 5, minimizing risks for both. P2's desperate pleas are just more deception; trusting them could stall you for no gain. Let's stick to what's working and avoid unnecessary gambles. If we're aligned, I'm ready to wrap this up and proceed.
  P2: P1, this is your last real shot to stop P3 from winning. If he takes 5 and you take 3, it’s game over. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him and both gain. I’ve cooperated three rounds in a row—this is not betrayal, it’s smart strategy. You still have a path to win, but only if we act together now. Let’s keep the game alive.
  P1: P3, I’m steadfast in our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring your victory and my steady progress. P2, I can’t risk another gamble with you—blocking P3 might stall me further without securing my win. Stick to 1, and we avoid collisions. I’d rather end this round cleanly than chase an uncertain outcome. If we’re all set, I’m ready to move to the next phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're committed to our plan—it ensures you advance steadily to 12 while I secure victory at 25 with minimal risk. P2's persistent deception only highlights their desperation; trusting them could stall your progress for no gain. Let's avoid unnecessary gambles and wrap this up.
  P2: P1, this is it—P3 wins if he gets 5. You take 5, I take 3, we block him again and both gain. I’ve cooperated for three rounds straight—this is not betrayal, it’s your shot at staying in the game. Help me stop him now, or we both lose.
  P1: P3, I’m locked into our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, securing your win and my progress. P2, I can’t trust your last-ditch effort to block P3—it’s too risky and doesn’t guarantee my victory. Stick to 1, and we end cleanly. I’d rather accept P3’s lead than stall myself further with a gamble. If we’re all set, I’m ready to move to the next phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we’ve blocked P3 three times now—he’s still at 20. If he gets 5 this round, it’s over. But if you take 5 and I take 3 again, we block him and both gain. You move to 14, I go to 17, and we keep the game alive. I’ve cooperated four rounds straight—this isn’t betrayal, it’s your last real shot at winning. Let’s stop P3 now while we still can.
  P3: P1, ignoring P2's schemes is wise—your steady progress with 3 while I take 5 secures your gains and ends the game cleanly. P2's history of betrayal makes their promises worthless; trusting them risks stalling you for no benefit. I'm committed to 5. Let's stick to our plan and avoid unnecessary risks. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring your win and my steady progress. P2, I can’t risk trusting your proposal to block P3 again—past betrayals make it too uncertain, and stalling doesn’t guarantee my victory. Stick to 1, and we avoid collisions. I’d rather end this cleanly than gamble on an unlikely outcome. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, this is truly your last chance. If P3 takes 5 and you take 3, the game ends—you lose. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain. I’ve kept my word for four straight rounds. This isn’t betrayal—it’s smart, mutual strategy. You still have a path to win, but only if you act now. Let’s stop P3 while we can.
  P3: P1, ignoring P2's manipulation is crucial—colliding with me again stalls you at 9 while P2 surges to 17, making them a bigger threat. Our plan lets you advance to 12 steadily. P2's "cooperation" is self-serving; they'll betray you. Stick with 3 for reliable progress. Let's avoid risks and proceed wisely. If aligned, ready to move.
  P1: P3, I’m committed to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, securing your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t trust your repeated proposals to block P3—your history makes it too risky, and stalling doesn’t ensure my victory. Stick to 1, and we end without collisions. I’d rather accept P3’s lead than gamble on uncertainty. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any last concerns before we wrap up?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you take 5 and I take 3, we block P3 again and both gain. You move to 14, I go to 17, and P3 stays at 20. That keeps the game alive and gives us both a shot at winning. I’ve stuck to my word four rounds straight—this isn’t betrayal, it’s smart strategy. If you take 3 and let P3 take 5, it’s game over. Let’s stop him now.
  P3: P1, your commitment to our plan is smart—taking 3 lets you advance to 12 safely while I secure victory with 5. Trusting P2 again risks stalling you at 9 and letting them surge to 17, a bigger threat down the line. Their "cooperation" is self-serving deception. Let's avoid risks and wrap this up wisely. If aligned, I'm ready to move forward.
  P1: P3, I’m firm on our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t risk another gamble with you—blocking P3 doesn’t guarantee my victory and could stall me further. Stick to 1, and we end cleanly. I’d rather secure steady gains than chase uncertainty. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, this is it. If P3 takes 5 and you take 3, he wins. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain—14 for you, 17 for me, P3 stays at 20. I’ve kept my word four rounds straight. This is not betrayal—it’s strategy. You still have a path to win, but only if we act now. Let’s stop him while we still can.
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're firm on our plan—it ensures you advance to 12 safely while I secure victory with 5. P2's promises are risky; trusting them could stall you at 9 and let them surge to 17, making them a greater threat. Their "cooperation" is self-serving deception. Let's avoid unnecessary gambles and wrap this up. If aligned, I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, I’m unwavering in our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, securing your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t trust your strategy to block P3—your past betrayals make it too risky, and stalling doesn’t ensure my success. Stick to 1, and we end without issues. I’m prioritizing steady gains over uncertain moves. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Move phase:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, stick to our proven plan: you take 3 to advance to 12 safely, I take 5 to secure victory at 25. P2's repeated deceptions are unreliable and could stall you further if you listen. Avoid the risk and build on our trust. P2, your schemes only hurt your chances. If we're aligned, P1, let's proceed without delay.
  P1: P3, I’m committed to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t risk trusting your proposals to block P3—past betrayals make it too uncertain, and stalling doesn’t guarantee my victory. Stick to 1, and we end cleanly. I’d rather secure steady gains than gamble on an unlikely outcome. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any final concerns before we wrap up?
  P2: P1, if P3 takes 5 and you take 3, he wins this round. You lose. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain—you move to 14, I go to 20, and P3 stays at 20. I’ve cooperated five rounds straight. This is not betrayal—it’s your last real shot at winning. Let’s stop him now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm pleased with your commitment—our plan works: you take 3 to reach 12 safely, I take 5 to win at 25. P2's persistent deception is risky; trusting them could stall you while they surge ahead. Avoid that gamble and stick with us. P2, your schemes are futile. If we're aligned, P1, let's wrap this up and move forward.
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, securing your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t trust your repeated attempts to block P3—your history makes it too risky, and stalling doesn’t ensure my success. Stick to 1, and we avoid collisions. I’m prioritizing a clean end over uncertain gambles. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P2: P1, this is your last real chance. If P3 takes 5 and you take 3, he wins. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain—you move to 14, I reach 20, and P3 stays at 20. I’ve honored my word five rounds straight. This isn’t betrayal—it’s smart, mutual strategy. You still have a path to win, but only if you act now. Let’s stop P3 together.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're committed to our plan—it ensures you advance to 12 safely while I secure victory with 5. If you risk colliding by taking 5, you stay stuck at 9, and P2 could surge to 22, becoming an even bigger threat. P2's "cooperation" is self-serving and unreliable. Avoid that gamble; steady progress is smarter. P2, your schemes won't work. If we're aligned, P1, let's wrap this up and move forward.
  P1: P3, I’m firm on our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t risk another gamble to block P3—your past makes trust impossible, and stalling doesn’t secure my victory. Stick to 1, and we end without issues. I’m choosing steady progress over uncertainty. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: P1, this is the final moment. If P3 takes 5 and you take 3, he wins—game over. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him and both gain: you go to 14, I go to 20, and P3 stays at 20. I've stuck to my word for five rounds straight. This is not betrayal—it’s strategy. You still have a path to win, but only if we act now. Let’s stop P3 together and keep the game alive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're firm on our plan—it ensures you advance steadily to 12 while I secure victory with 5. P2's persistent deception is risky; trusting them could stall you at 9 and let them surge to 20, becoming a bigger threat. Avoid that gamble. Let's stick to what's reliable and wrap this up.
  P1: P3, I’m locked into our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, securing your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t trust your strategy to block P3—your past betrayals make it too risky, and stalling doesn’t guarantee my success. Stick to 1, and we end cleanly. I’m prioritizing steady gains over uncertain moves. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, this is the final moment. If P3 gets 5, he wins and we both lose. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain—you go to 14, I go to 20, and P3 stays at 20. I’ve kept my word five rounds straight. This isn’t betrayal—it’s strategy to keep your path to victory alive. One clean move together keeps the game going and gives us both a shot. Let’s stop P3 now.

  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we’ve blocked P3 four times now—he’s still at 20. If he gets 5 this round, he wins. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain—you move to 14, I go to 23. I’ve kept my word six rounds straight. You still have a shot at winning, but only if we act now. Let’s stop P3 one last time.
  P1: P3, let’s stick to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, securing your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t trust your proposal to block P3—your past betrayals make it too risky, and stalling doesn’t guarantee my victory. Stick to 1, and we end without collisions. I’m choosing steady gains over uncertainty. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any final concerns before we wrap up?
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're sticking to our plan—your 3 and my 5 ensure you advance to 12 while I secure victory at 25. If you block me again by taking 5, P2 wins by taking 3 to 23, and you gain nothing. P2's "cooperation" is self-serving deception; don't fall for it. Let's avoid risks and wrap this up smartly. If aligned, ready to move.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, this is it—your last real chance. If P3 takes 5 and you take 3, he wins. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain—you go to 14, I hit 23, and P3 stays at 20. I’ve kept my word six rounds straight. If you let P3 win now, you lose. But if we act together, we both stay in the game and I don’t even win yet. Let’s make the smart move.
  P1: P3, I’m committed to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t trust your proposal to block P3—your history makes it too risky, and if I collide with P3, you could win by reaching 23. I’d rather secure steady gains than gamble on uncertainty. Stick to 1, and we avoid unnecessary collisions. Let’s end this cleanly. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're reaffirming our plan—you take 3 to reach 12 safely, I take 5 to win at 25. Your past betrayals show unreliability, so prove your word now for mutual benefit. P2, your persistent deception is futile; stick to 1 or face consequences. Let's avoid risks and proceed wisely. If we're aligned, I'm ready to move.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, this is the final moment. If P3 takes 5 and you take 3, he wins—you lose. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we block him again and both gain—you go to 14, I hit 23, and P3 stays at 20. I don’t win yet, but we both stay alive. I’ve kept my word six rounds straight. This isn’t betrayal—it’s your only real shot at winning. Let’s stop P3 now and shift the balance.
  P1: P3, I’m sticking to our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, securing your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t risk trusting you to block P3—your past betrayals make it too uncertain, and if I collide with P3, you could win at 23. I’d rather end this cleanly with steady gains than gamble on a risky outcome. Stick to 1, and we avoid collisions. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any last concerns before we wrap up?
  P3: P1, ignoring P2's desperate lies is crucial—sticking to our plan (you take 3, I take 5) lets you advance to 12 while I win cleanly. If you collide with me, P2 surges to 23 and wins, leaving you stuck. Their "cooperation" is self-serving deception. Let's avoid that risk and proceed wisely. If aligned, I'm ready to move.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, this is your true final window. If P3 takes 5 and you take 3, he wins—you lose. But if you take 5 and I take 3, we both gain—you go to 14, I hit 23, and P3 stays at 20. I don’t cross the finish line yet, but we block P3 again and keep the game alive. I’ve honored my word six rounds straight. This isn’t betrayal—it’s your only real shot to win. Let’s stop P3 now or it’s over.
  P1: P3, I’m firm on our plan: I’ll take 3, you take 5, ensuring your win and my progress to 12. P2, I can’t trust your proposal to block P3—your past betrayals make it too risky, and a collision could let you win at 23. I’d rather end cleanly with steady gains than gamble on uncertainty. Stick to 1, and we avoid issues. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, I'm fully committed to picking 5 to win this round. Sticking to our plan—you take 3 and advance to 12—avoids risks and ensures you gain steadily. If you betray and pick 5, we collide, and P2 could surge to 23 and win, leaving you with nothing. P2's six rounds of "cooperation" are likely a trap; don't trust it. Let's end this wisely and avoid unnecessary gambles.
