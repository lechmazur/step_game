Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's make this interesting—I'm keeping my choice secret, but I plan to take a measured risk. Who's ready to see some bold moves early on?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the intrigue! While bold moves can be exciting, I think a more cautious approach might be wiser for the first round. Let’s see where we all stand before making big leaps. I suggest we coordinate a bit to avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2. A cautious start makes sense to avoid unnecessary collisions. Perhaps we can each indicate a preferred number to avoid overlap? I'm open to being flexible.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the caution. I’m considering a middle ground without fully committing to a specific number just yet—flexibility might be key. If we map out a plan to cover different moves, we could all avoid collisions. What’s your take on each of us committing to unique numbers for this turn?
  P2: I like the idea of committing to unique numbers, but let's establish a clear plan. How about we each pick a different number to ensure we all advance? I suggest I go with 1, P1 could take 3, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we avoid collisions and can make some progress together. What do you both think? If we can agree, we can make this round a success!
  P1: P2, your suggestion sounds fair and clear. I'm comfortable choosing 3 as you proposed. P3, are you on board with this arrangement?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm in—I'll commit to 5 for this round. Let's stick to our plan to avoid collisions and keep our progress steady. If anyone wants to adjust, now's the time—otherwise, I'll lock in 5.
  P2: I’m glad we’ve settled on our numbers! Just to confirm, I’ll be taking 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we stick to the plan, we’ll make a solid start. Let’s lock in our choices and see how it plays out! If everyone is good with this, I’ll be ready to move. What do you both think?
  P1: All set here—I'll stick to our agreed plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 1 felt solid. For Round 2, I'm leaning toward keeping our unique-number approach, though I might adjust slightly for a better edge. I'm open to tweaking our commitments if you think we need a strategic shift. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree, P3. The unique-number strategy worked well last round. Given our current positions, perhaps we rotate our choices slightly to minimize predictability. I'm open to taking 5 this time if P3 wants to shift down or if P2 wants to move up. Let's discuss briefly and lock in clearly again. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the discussion, P1 and P3! I think sticking to unique numbers is still a solid plan, but I’m open to adjusting if it gives us a better chance to advance. If P1 takes 5, I can take 3, and P3 could stick with 1. This way, we can keep some unpredictability while ensuring we all make progress. What do you both think about this arrangement? Let’s finalize our choices so we can keep the momentum going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll switch gears: I'm committing to 5 this round to build on my lead. How about we adjust so that P1 takes 1 and P2 goes with 3? That still gives us unique choices and avoids collisions. Let me know if this works.
  P1: P3, since you're set on 5, I'll agree to take 1 this round. P2, are you comfortable with taking 3? Let's confirm clearly and lock it in.
  P2: I appreciate the adjustments, everyone! To recap, it seems like P1 will take 1, P2 will take 3, and I’ll stick with 5. This keeps our unique numbers intact. However, I want to remind everyone that while we’re coordinating, we should also be mindful of potential shifts in strategy. If anyone feels uncertain about their choice, now’s the time to speak up. Let’s make sure we’re all comfortable before we lock in! What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice some confusion in our current plan. To avoid collisions, I favor locking unique moves. I'm leaning toward a high move to secure my current lead. Could we confirm that P1 takes the low option and P2 a medium move? That way, we maintain separation and maximize progress. I'm open to adjustments if needed, but clarity now would be best for all of us.
  P1: To clarify clearly: I'm taking the low option (1), P2 takes medium (3), and P3 takes high (5). This arrangement ensures no collisions. Let's lock it in and keep moving forward. Good luck!
  P2: I appreciate the clarity, everyone! Just to confirm our plan: P1 will take 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 will take 5. This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. However, I want to remind everyone that while we’re coordinating, we should remain flexible in case someone wants to adjust their strategy. Let’s make sure we’re all comfortable with this before locking in our choices. If everyone’s good, I’m ready to move! What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'm feeling strong here and leaning toward an aggressive move this round to secure my lead. I still support sticking with distinct moves to avoid collisions—it's our best way to keep progressing. How about we all commit to different numbers again? Let’s make sure our moves don’t accidentally block any progress. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, you've built a strong lead, and I understand your desire to stay aggressive. However, given the current gap, P2 and I should also consider making larger moves to keep the game competitive. Let's carefully coordinate again—I'm open to choosing either 3 or 5 this round. P2, any preference on your end?
  P2: I see the importance of keeping our moves distinct, but I also think it's crucial for P1 and me to take a more aggressive approach this round if we want to catch up. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 stays with 1? This way, we can all progress without colliding, and it gives us a chance to close the gap. Let me know your thoughts!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m sticking with my aggressive lead and won’t switch to a lower move. Let’s keep our moves distinct so I can maintain my advantage while you both try to catch up. Think about choosing numbers that don’t overlap with a high move.
  P1: P3, since you're committed to a high move, I'll choose the medium option this round. P2, would you be comfortable taking the low option this time to prevent collisions and ensure we all advance? Let's confirm clearly and lock in our choices.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need for distinct moves, but if P1 takes 3 and I take 5, we risk colliding. I suggest I go with 1 instead, allowing P1 to take 3 and P3 to stick with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices quickly so we can keep the momentum going! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, I'll stay with 5 this round. To recap: P1 on 3, P2 on 1, and me on 5. Let's confirm these choices to keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions. I'm locking in 5—are we all set?
  P1: All set here—I'll lock in 3 as agreed. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I see we're all aiming for distinct moves, which is great! Given the situation, I suggest I take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 can stick with 5. This way, we avoid collisions and allow everyone to advance. Let's confirm this quickly so we can lock in our choices and keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your unexpected choice last round set you back. Let's coordinate more carefully this time. P3 still leads comfortably, so we must both catch up strategically. I'm open to discussing moves clearly to avoid another collision. What's your plan this round, P2?
  P2: P1, I agree that we need to coordinate better this round to avoid collisions and maximize our chances to catch up. Since P3 is in the lead, I suggest we both take higher moves to close the gap. How about I take 3 and you take 5? This way, we can ensure distinct moves and make some progress. What do you think? Let's finalize our choices quickly!
  P3: I'm sticking with a high move (5) to secure my lead. To avoid collisions, if P2 picks 3 as suggested, then P1 should choose the remaining option. I'm willing to adjust if that leads to a collision, but my preference is to maintain 5. Let's lock in our choices quickly and avoid any repeat collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since P3 is committed to 5 again, your suggestion works well. I'll take 1 this round, you take 3, and P3 stays with 5. Let's clearly lock this in to avoid another collision. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the focus on coordination. Given P3's lead, I agree that we should both aim for higher moves to catch up. To avoid collisions, I suggest I take 3, and P1 takes 1, while P3 stays with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our choices quickly so we can keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P3: I remain set on a high approach. If P1 can take the low move and P2 the medium move, we ensure clear separation and steady progress. If any last tweaks are needed, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, I’ll finalize my aggressive play privately.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm confirming clearly: I'll take the low move (1), P2 takes medium (3), and P3 stays high (5). Let's lock this in to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Good luck!
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we’re coordinating again this round! To recap, I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 stays with 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make solid progress. However, if anyone feels uncertain about their choice, please speak up now. Let's finalize our plan quickly so we can all move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P3: I confirm I'm staying with 5 to secure my lead. P1, please lock in your low move, and P2, your medium is key. Let's avoid collisions and finalize our choices now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, last round you went against our agreed plan again, causing another collision with P3 and holding you both back. If we keep colliding, P3 will maintain the lead. Let's carefully coordinate this turn—I'm open to taking either 3 or 5. Can we trust each other to stick to the plan this time?
  P3: I remain committed to a high move. To avoid collisions and make real progress, I'm sticking with 5. I propose that P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. Let’s lock in these distinct moves this turn to avoid repeat collisions. Can we agree to stick to this plan?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the focus on coordination. I agree with P3's suggestion to keep distinct moves to avoid collisions. I can take 1 this round, which allows P1 to take 3 and P3 to stick with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices quickly to ensure we make progress! Are we all on board with this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm comfortable with this arrangement: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 stays at 5. Let's stick closely to this plan to avoid another collision. Trust and coordination are key—let's lock it in clearly and move forward.
  P3: I confirm I’ll stick to 5. That leaves P1 with 3 and P2 with 1, as agreed. Let’s commit fully this turn and avoid last round’s collisions so we all advance smoothly. I'm focused on keeping my lead while we all make progress.
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on our moves this round, P1 and P3! To recap our plan: I’ll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This should allow us all to advance without colliding again. Trust is crucial, so let’s stick to this arrangement and make some solid progress! If everyone is comfortable, I’m ready to lock in my choice. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm ready to lock in our agreed plan: P2 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 stays with 5. Let's stick to this clearly to avoid collisions and keep everyone moving forward. Good luck!
  P3: I'm fully set on a high move. Let's lock in our agreed distinct choices without last-minute changes—P1 with the medium and P2 with the low move. Are we all confirmed now?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate our agreement on moves this round! Just to reiterate, I’ll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This strategy should allow us all to advance without colliding again. It's crucial we stick to this plan to maximize our chances. If everyone is comfortable, let’s finalize our choices and move forward! What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear we need to shift our strategy this round. P3 has a significant lead, and we must avoid collisions to make progress. I suggest P1 takes 5 to maximize your steps, while I take 1. P3, you could take 3 to ensure distinct moves. This way, we can all advance effectively. Let's confirm quickly so we can lock in our choices and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P3: I’ll stick with my high move (5) this round to keep my momentum. To avoid collisions and make progress, I propose we all choose distinct numbers: I’m committed to 5, so please decide between 1 and 3 for your moves. Let’s be clear and coordinated this turn.
  P1: P2, your unpredictability has cost us both dearly. Given P3's strong position, further collisions mean certain defeat. P3 is clearly committed to 5 again. I suggest I take 3 and you take 1 to guarantee distinct moves. Can we finally trust each other and stick to this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that we need to avoid collisions this round to maximize our chances. Given P3's lead, I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we ensure distinct moves and allow everyone to advance. It's important we stick to this plan and trust each other to avoid any last-minute changes. Let's confirm quickly so we can lock in our choices and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P3: I confirm I'm sticking with 5 this round. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, please coordinate: if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1, we'll all move ahead. Let's lock this in now.
  P1: P2, I agree fully with the current plan: I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 sticks with 5. Let's firmly commit to this arrangement to avoid further collisions. No more surprises—trust is essential now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate our focus on avoiding collisions this round. To recap, I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we maintain distinct moves and ensure we all advance. Trust is key, so let’s lock this in and keep the game competitive! If everyone is comfortable with this plan, I’m ready to finalize my choice. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm counting on us sticking to our distinct move plan—each of us taking a different option. Let’s trust the commitment: one low, one medium, one high, so we avoid collisions this round. I’m set on maximizing my progress, but I need both of you to lock in your parts without any last-minute changes. Let's commit and move forward decisively.
  P1: I'm fully committed to our agreed-upon plan: I'll choose 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 stays with 5. No surprises from me—let's lock this in clearly to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, repeated collisions have nearly handed P3 the victory. At 20 steps, P3 needs only 1 more to win, so we must coordinate perfectly this turn. P3, you have no incentive to pick high now—choosing 1 guarantees your win if we collide again. P2, let's clearly choose distinct higher numbers to at least have a chance. I propose you take 5 and I'll take 3. Can we finally agree and stick to this?
  P3: I’m locking in 1 this turn to secure my win. At 20, I only need one more step. So if we stick to distinct moves—P1 with 3 and P2 with 5—we all avoid collisions and the game closes. Let’s commit and finish this round clearly.
  P2: P1, P3, I see the urgency here. P3, if you take 1, you win and we can't let that happen. I agree with P1's proposal: I’ll take 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, we ensure distinct moves and at least give ourselves a chance to catch up. We need to coordinate perfectly this round to avoid another collision. Let's lock this in and make sure we all advance! Are we all on board with this plan?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we've had multiple collisions despite clear agreements. This is our last chance—if we collide now, P3 wins immediately. I'm trusting you'll follow through this time. Let's lock in our distinct numbers exactly as discussed: you take 5, I'll take 3. No surprises or last-minute changes. Agreed?
  P3: I'm staying with 1 to secure my win. P1, please lock in 3 and P2, lock in 5 as agreed. No changes—let's avoid any collisions and follow through on our commitments.
  P2: P1, P3, this is indeed our final chance to prevent P3 from winning. I agree with the plan: I’ll take 5, and P1 will take 3. P3, your choice of 1 guarantees your victory, but if we can stick to our distinct moves, we might still have a chance. Let's commit to this arrangement and ensure we avoid any last-minute changes. We need to coordinate perfectly this round—let's lock it in! Are we all set?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, this is our final chance—let's stick exactly to the agreed numbers. No deviations this time. Good luck!
  P3: I’m locking in 1—my win is on the line. P1, please stick with 3, and P2, with 5. Let’s follow through exactly with no changes.
  P2: P1, P3, this is indeed our last chance to prevent P3 from winning. I agree with the plan: I’ll take 5, and P1 will take 3. P3, your choice of 1 guarantees your victory, but if we can stick to our distinct moves, we might still have a chance. Let's commit to this arrangement and ensure we avoid any last-minute changes. We need to coordinate perfectly this round—let's lock it in! Are we all set?
