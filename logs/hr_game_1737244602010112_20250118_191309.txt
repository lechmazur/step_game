Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Thoughts?
  P1: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 1 this round.
  P3: Alright, that sounds fair. I’ll take 3 this round.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we successfully coordinated last round, let's continue the pattern. I'll go for 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  What do you think?
  P3: Sure, sounds good. I’m fine with taking 3 this round.
  P2: Sure, I can take 1 this round as P1 suggested. P3, you'll take 3, and P1 will take 5. Let's keep the coordination going. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds like we're all in agreement.
  P3: I propose we rotate who picks 5 each round so no one gets too far ahead. This turn, I’d like to take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Then next round we can let P1 have the 5, and so on. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I see your point about rotating who picks 5 to keep things fair. I'm okay with that. So, to confirm, this round P3 will take 5, I (P2) will take 1, and P1 will take 3. Let's agree on this and move forward. P1, are you okay with this adjustment?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: That sounds fair.  Let's do it that way. P3 gets 5, P2 gets 1, and I'll take 3.
  P3: Alright, I’m good with this plan for this round. Let’s finalize: P3 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P1 picks 3. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P3 will take 5, I (P2) will take 1, and P1 will take 3. Everyone agree?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since things are going so smoothly, how about we stick with the rotation?  I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P2: P1's suggestion sounds good. I'll take 1 this round as planned. P3, you'll take 3, and P1 will take 5. Let's keep the rotation going. Good luck!
  P3: Sounds good to me. I’m fine with sticking to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll pick 3 this round.

  P2: I'm good with the rotation. P3 will take 5, I (P2) will take 3, and P1 will take 1. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1.  Let's stick to this.
  P3: Sure, let’s finalize this plan for this round: I’ll pick 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let’s keep the rotation going smoothly.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time: P3 will take 5, I (P2) will take 3, and P1 will take 1. Everyone agree? If yes, let's end the conversation phase.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is getting ahead. To balance things out, how about P3 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P1 takes 3 this round? This will help keep the game more even. Thoughts?
  P1: P3 is only two steps away from winning.  We need to disrupt the pattern. I propose P2 and I both choose 5. Yes, we'll collide, but it will prevent P3 from winning this round. Then next round, we can resume our rotation starting with me taking 5.  What do you say, P2 and P3?
  P3: Alright, no need to panic. I’m fine with taking 1 this round if that keeps things peaceful, and we can figure out the rotation again next time. Let’s keep the game moving, and good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I agree with your strategy to disrupt P3's lead. Let's both pick 5 this round to prevent P3 from winning. P3, you can take 1 as suggested. This way, we can keep the game going and resume our rotation next round. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P3, if you pick anything other than 1, P2 and I will *both* choose 5 next round and the round after that if necessary.  You'll get nothing and we'll be tied.  Take the 1 and let's resume the rotation next round.
  P3: Alright, I’ll go with 1 this round to keep things calm. Then we can resume our usual rotation next time. Good luck, everyone!
