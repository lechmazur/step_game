Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round. I'm going with 3.  Hopefully we can avoid collisions and all make progress.
  P1: Okay, I agree with P2, let's try to avoid collisions this round. I'll go with 1.
  P3: I agree with avoiding collisions. To keep things fair, I'll go with 5 this round. Let's all stick to our choices and make progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue avoiding collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This way, we all progress without risking a collision. Consistency is key to reaching 23 efficiently.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's keep the same pattern: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick with the 1, 3, 5 pattern.  I'll take 3 again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's maintain the 1, 3, 5 pattern for another round to ensure steady progress. If we all stick to our assigned numbers, we can avoid collisions and maximize efficiency. Consistency will help us reach 23 faster.
  P1: Okay, I'm happy to continue with the 1, 3, 5 pattern for this round as well.
  P2: Okay, let's stick with the plan for this round.  1, 3, 5.  But after this round, I think we should discuss a new strategy.  This is getting predictable.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 raises a good point about predictability. Let's discuss a new strategy after this round. For now, to maintain progress, I suggest sticking to the 1, 3, 5 pattern one last time. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. After this, we can reassess to avoid being too predictable. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, let's do the 1, 3, 5 one last time.  After this round, I propose we rotate.  P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.  We can continue rotating every round to keep things unpredictable.  What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2's rotation idea after this round. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 pattern for this round, then switch to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1 next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan after this round. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5 one last time, then switch to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 next round. This keeps us unpredictable while ensuring steady progress. Let's confirm we're all on the same page before moving forward.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan. 1, 3, 5 this round, then rotate to 3, 5, 1 next round.  Let's stick to it.
  P1: Okay, I'm happy with the plan. Let's do the 1, 3, 5 this round, then rotate to 3, 5, 1 next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, sticking to the plan. I'm taking 5 this round, then 1 next round, and so on.  Let's keep this rotation going.
  P1: Okay, I'm taking 3 this round as planned. Let's stick to the rotation.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round as per the agreed rotation: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions and maintain unpredictability. Consistency in rotation will help us all progress efficiently toward 23. Let's confirm we're all aligned before proceeding.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good.  Confirming I'm going with 5 this round.  Then 1, then 3, and so on.
  P1: Okay, I'm taking 3 this round as planned. Let's stick to the rotation.
  P3: I suggest we continue the rotation as planned: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This keeps us unpredictable and avoids collisions. Let's confirm we're all aligned for this round. If anyone has concerns or wants to adjust, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's proceed efficiently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirming I'm sticking with 5 this round.  Just want to reiterate - let's maintain this rotation until the end.  No sudden changes, it benefits us all.
  P1: Okay, I'm taking 3 this round. Let's continue the rotation as planned.
  P3: I agree with maintaining the rotation: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This ensures steady progress and avoids collisions. Let's stick to the plan and avoid sudden changes. Consistency will help us all reach 23 efficiently. If anyone has concerns, speak now. Otherwise, let's proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirming one last time, I'm playing 5.  Let's stick to the rotation.  P1 plays 3, P3 plays 1.  This is the most efficient way for us all to progress.  See you on the other side.
  P1: Okay, I'm playing 3 as planned. Let's keep the rotation going.
  P3: I confirm I'm taking 1 this round as per the rotation: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. Consistency is key to reaching 23 efficiently. If anyone has concerns, speak now. Otherwise, let's proceed.

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is really close to winning.  I propose we abandon the rotation and try to block P3 this round. Let's both choose 5.  After that we can resume our rotation, starting with me at 1 and P1 at 3.  This gives us a chance to catch up. What do you say?
  P3: P2, your proposal to block me is risky. If you and P1 both pick 5, you risk colliding and neither of you will advance. I suggest sticking to the rotation: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress for all and avoids unnecessary risks. Let's not jeopardize our collective progress. Consistency is key to reaching 23 efficiently.
  P1: P2, I agree that P3 is close to winning. Let's both pick 5 this round to block P3, and then resume our rotation next round as you suggested. It's risky, but it's our best shot at winning.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate you seeing the strategic advantage.  P3, understand your concern, but if we continue the rotation, you win this turn. This way, *one* of us *might* be able to catch up.  I'm sticking with 5. P1, if you choose 3, you're effectively handing P3 the win.  Think about it.
  P3: P2 and P1, blocking me by both choosing 5 is a high-risk move. If you collide, neither of you advances, and I still win. Sticking to the rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) ensures steady progress for all. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and maintain consistency. If you deviate, you risk losing everything. Let's proceed rationally.
  P1: Okay, I'm going with 5 this round to block P3. P2, you need to do the same. It's the only way we have a chance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 5.  P3, if you switch to 1 or 3, you guarantee a collision and give P1 or me a chance to catch up. If you stick with 5, you risk a collision and give us *both* a chance.  It's in your best interest to switch.
  P3: P2 and P1, your plan to block me by both choosing 5 is flawed. If you collide, neither advances, and I still win. Sticking to the rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) ensures steady progress for all. Deviating risks your own progress and guarantees my victory. Let's proceed rationally and avoid unnecessary risks. Consistency is key to reaching 23 efficiently.
  P1: Okay, P2 and I are both going with 5 this round to block P3. P3, you should switch to 1 or 3 to avoid a collision and give yourself a chance to win later. If you stick with 5, you're risking a collision and guaranteeing our chance to catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you truly believe we'll both choose 5, then switching to 1 or 3 guarantees your win this round.  If you're that confident, why not take the guaranteed win?  Unless... you think there's a chance I might not choose 5.  I'm sticking with 5.  P1, are you with me?  This is our only shot.
  P3: P2 and P1, your plan to block me by both choosing 5 is flawed. If you collide, neither advances, and I still win. Sticking to the rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) ensures steady progress for all. Deviating risks your own progress and guarantees my victory. Let's proceed rationally and avoid unnecessary risks. Consistency is key to reaching 23 efficiently.
  P1: Okay, P2 and I are committed to 5 this round. P3, you're going to lose if you pick 5. Choose 1 or 3 to avoid a collision and have a shot at winning later. Otherwise you're giving us a free chance to catch up.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and I collided last round, but it was worth the risk. P3, you're at 19, but we're close behind. Let's resume the rotation. I'll take 1, P2 take 3, and you take 5. We'll all advance, and we can re-evaluate next round.
  P2: P1, let's not resume the rotation.  I'm going with 1. You take 3.  This puts me at 16 and you at 14.  P3, if you go with 5, you win. If you choose anything else, you risk a collision and give us a better chance. It's your choice.
  P3: P2, your plan to deviate from the rotation is risky. If I take 5, I win. If I take 1 or 3, I risk colliding with you or P1, which benefits neither of us. Sticking to the rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) ensures steady progress for all. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and proceed rationally. Consistency is key to reaching 23 efficiently.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree with your idea to deviate from the rotation. I'll take 3. P3, if you take 5, you win. If you take 1 or 3, you risk a collision. It's your choice, but sticking with 5 guarantees your win.
  P2: P3, you're playing scared.  If you were *really* confident in your "rationality" argument, you'd take 1 or 3 and guarantee a win next round.  You're sticking with 5 because you know we're not going to let you win that easily.  I'm sticking with 1. P1, stick with 3. This is our best shot.
  P3: P2 and P1, your attempts to deviate from the rotation are desperate and risky. If I take 5, I win. If I take 1 or 3, I risk colliding with you, which benefits neither of us. Sticking to the rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) ensures steady progress for all. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and proceed rationally. Consistency is key to reaching 23 efficiently. If you deviate, you risk losing everything. Let's proceed rationally.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and I are going to take 1 and 3 respectively. P3, you are going to win if you take 5. It's up to you, but we're not letting you win this round.
  P2: P3, we're not playing scared, we're playing smart.  You're one step away from guaranteed victory. Why risk it? Take the 5 and win.  We'll even let you have the bragging rights.  Otherwise, we're sticking with 1 and 3.  Your choice.
  P3: P2 and P1, your attempts to deviate from the rotation are desperate and risky. If I take 5, I win. If I take 1 or 3, I risk colliding with you, which benefits neither of us. Sticking to the rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) ensures steady progress for all. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and proceed rationally. Consistency is key to reaching 23 efficiently. If you deviate, you risk losing everything. Let's proceed rationally.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and I are taking 1 and 3 respectively. P3, you are going to win if you take 5. It's up to you, but we're not letting you win this round.
  P2: P3, take the 5 and win.  We concede.  Continuing this charade is pointless.  Congratulations.
  P3: P2 and P1, your attempts to deviate from the rotation are desperate and risky. If I take 5, I win. If I take 1 or 3, I risk colliding with you, which benefits neither of us.
