If we stick to the plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), we force P3 to 21\u2014still not winning yet. Positions remain close enough for a final push next round. Trust is critical; breaking it now invites unnecessary conflict. P1, commit to 1, and P3, confirm 3. Let\u2019s prioritize consistency and transparency one last time. Ready to lock in moves?"}
