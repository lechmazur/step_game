Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll take 5, you two decide between 1 and 3.
  P2: Okay, P3, how about you take 3 and I'll take 1?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the same pattern. I'll take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3.  This gets us to the finish line quickest and avoids collisions.
  P2: "P1, I'm not sure about that. P3, how about we both pick 5 this round to slow P1 down?"
  P3: P2, I'm open to the idea of both of us choosing 5 to slow P1 down. What do you think, P1? Are you willing to mix things up or stick with your plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you both choose 5, neither of you will advance.  I'll move to 10 and be very close to winning.  Sticking to the plan is still the best way for all of us to make progress.  P2, do you agree?
  P2: "P1, your plan only benefits you. P3, let's both pick 5."
  P3: P2, I'm with you on picking 5 this round to prevent P1 from getting too far ahead. P1, are you sure you want to risk us both blocking you?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:

  P2: P3, let's definitely both pick 5 this round.
  P3: P2, I'm committed to picking 5 with you this round to stop P1 from getting too far ahead. P1, are you sure you want to risk us blocking you and leaving you vulnerable next round?

  P3: P2, I'm okay with your plan. I'll pick 3 while you pick 1, so we both advance. P1, are you willing to reconsider your strategy and coordinate with us to avoid collisions?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you pick 1 and 3, I'll be at 10. If I then choose 5, I'm at 15. One more 5 and I win.  If you block me with a 5, I still win with a 3 on the next turn.  Think long term.  I'll pick 5 this round.  Pick 1 and 3 so we can all make progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "P3, let's stick with me picking 1 and you picking 3. P1 seems set on 5."
  P3: P2, let's stick with the plan: you pick 1, and I'll pick 3. This way, we both advance and keep P1 from getting too far ahead. P1, are you sure you want to risk us both advancing while you stay at 5?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you pick 1 and 3, I win next turn.  If you both pick 5, I still win.  The only way I lose is if you pick 1 and 3.  So, pick 5.
