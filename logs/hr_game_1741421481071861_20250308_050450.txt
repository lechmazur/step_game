Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we all choose different numbers to maximize progress. I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's split 1, 3, and 5 between us to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, pick 3 or 5 please. This way we all advance safely.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>3</move>. P3, if you're on board, please pick <move>5</move>. Let's make sure we all advance this turn.
  P3: I agree. I’ll pick <move>5</move> as proposed. Everyone stick to your plan, and we’ll all advance safely.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let's confirm our agreed strategy to avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely this turn. Stick to your numbers—last chance to adjust if needed, but I recommend we proceed as planned.
  P2: Let's stick to our plan to avoid any collisions. I'll go with <move>3</move> as agreed. P1 and P3, please confirm you're sticking to <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. This way, we all advance safely and make the most of this turn.
  P3: I’m on board. I’ll pick five so we can all advance together.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s stick to the same picks as last time to avoid collisions. That way, we can safely add more steps without getting in each other’s way. If we all keep cooperating, there’s less risk of missing out on progress. What do you think?
  P2: I think we should continue with the same strategy to avoid any collisions. I'll stick with <move>3</move> again. P1, if you're okay with it, please take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance safely and make consistent progress. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P1: I agree with continuing the strategy, but to keep the race fair, let's rotate our choices this round. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way we all progress faster without collisions. P3’s current lead is too big—let’s balance it out. Confirm?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I hear your concern about balancing, P1, but let's stay consistent one more round. Changing picks now could invite confusion or collisions. Let’s keep the same choices as last time to ensure everyone advances safely. We can revisit your rotation idea later. What do you two think?
  P2: I understand P1's concern about balancing the lead, but I agree with P3 that consistency is key to avoid confusion and collisions. Let's stick with the same picks as last round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance safely and maintain our current strategy. We can reassess after this round if needed. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P1: Alright, let's proceed with the current plan for this round to avoid risks. However, I propose rotating our numbers *next round* to balance progress. P3’s lead is growing too quickly—if we keep this pattern, the race could end prematurely. Let’s agree to rotate choices starting in Round 3. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m willing to go along with the same picks for now—P1 chooses 1, P2 picks 3, and I take 5. Let’s finalize that for this round to keep things simple. Then we can revisit P1’s rotation proposal next time. Is everyone good with that?
  P2: I agree with P3. Let's stick with the same picks this round to avoid any confusion or collisions: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. We can reassess and consider P1's rotation idea in the next round if needed. This ensures we all advance safely and maintain our current strategy. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P1: Alright, let's proceed with the current plan for this round to avoid risks. However, to ensure a fair race and prevent P3 from gaining an insurmountable lead, I strongly urge us to **rotate our choices in Round 3**: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This balances progress while avoiding collisions. Confirm this rotation for the next round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand your concern, P1. To keep things simple now, I’ll stick with the same pick as last round. Next round, I’m willing to rotate so you get 5, P2 gets 1, and I move with 3. Let’s cooperate this turn to avoid collisions, then follow your plan next time.
  P2: I agree with P3. Let's stick with the same picks this round to avoid any confusion or collisions: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely. We can reassess and consider P1's rotation idea in the next round if needed. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P1: Alright, let’s lock in the plan. This round: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move> to advance safely. Next round, we **rotate as agreed**: I’ll grab <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>. This balances our progress while avoiding collisions. Let’s stick to this—no last-minute changes.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s honor our agreed rotation this round to balance progress. As discussed, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This prevents P3’s lead from becoming unassailable. Stick to the plan—we all advance while keeping the race fair. No surprises, please.
  P2: I agree with P1’s rotation plan to keep the race balanced. This round, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance while preventing any one player from getting too far ahead. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: I’m okay with P1 taking 5, P2 picking 1, and me choosing 3. Let’s stay consistent and avoid collisions so everyone advances. I want a competitive race, so I’ll do my part to keep it fair.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s confirm our rotation plan for this round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. Strict adherence is critical—collisions could freeze progress. P3’s current lead demands balance, but only if we cooperate. No last-minute deviations—our agreement ensures fair advancement. Proceed as agreed.
  P2: I think we should stick to the rotation plan as agreed. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This keeps the race fair and prevents any one player from getting too far ahead. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: I’m on board with the agreed rotation. Let’s finalize those choices—me taking three, P2 taking one, and P1 taking five. No collisions mean we all keep moving forward. Let’s lock it in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final reminder: Let’s honor the rotation to keep the race fair. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, P3 chooses <move>3</move>. Deviations risk collisions—stalling your progress. This plan balances advancement and avoids letting any single player surge ahead. Confirm your commitment to these choices. No last-minute changes, please.
  P2: I think we should stick to the rotation plan as agreed to keep the race fair and balanced. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance while preventing any one player from getting too far ahead. Let’s confirm and move forward. No last-minute changes, please.
  P3: I support our rotation plan: P1 takes 5, P2 picks 1, and I choose 3. Let’s finalize our choices now, avoiding any confusion or last-minute switches.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce our agreed rotation strictly—collisions would freeze progress for all. I’ll take **<move>5</move>**, P2 picks **<move>1</move>**, and P3 selects **<move>3</move>**. Deviations risk stalemate, especially for P3 who’d lose their 3-step gain. Stick to the plan—we all advance while narrowing the gap fairly. Final confirmation: no last-minute changes.
  P2: I agree with sticking to the rotation plan to keep the race fair and balanced. This round, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance while preventing any one player from getting too far ahead. Let’s confirm and move forward. No last-minute changes, please. Let’s lock this in and avoid any confusion.
  P3: I’m ready to follow the rotation: P1 takes five, P2 picks one, and I choose three. Let’s avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance. If everyone sticks to the plan, we’ll have a fair and productive round. No surprises, please.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s do a simpler plan: P1 and P2 both pick <move>5</move> to speed up your progress, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. No need for further rotation—trust me, this keeps things fair and helps us all stay competitive.
  P1: P1: P3’s proposal would cause P1/P2 to collide on 5, leaving us stagnant while you surge ahead to 16. Let’s instead continue the agreed rotation: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>1</move>. This keeps us advancing safely *and* narrows your lead. Collusion to sabotage our progress isn’t in your interest if we overtake later—stick to fair rotation. Confirm?
  P2: I agree with P1. P3’s proposal would only benefit P3 and cause a collision between P1 and me. Let’s stick to the rotation to keep the race fair: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 selects <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance safely and P3’s lead doesn’t grow too large. Confirm and let’s move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see your points, but let’s avoid sudden shifts. If P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I pick 3, we all continue without collisions. It’s fair: P2 and P1 gain ground, and nobody stalls. We’ve cooperated well so far—let’s keep it smooth.
  P1: P1: Let’s **strictly follow the rotation plan** we agreed on earlier to avoid undermining progress. This round: I take <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>1</move>. Deviating now lets P3 surge to 14 while stifling our gains. Trust the system we built—collisions risk halting *everyone’s* advance. P3’s proposal benefits them disproportionately; let’s honor fairness and the prior agreement. Confirm?
  P2: I agree with P1. P3’s proposal would only benefit P3 and cause a collision between P1 and me. Let’s stick to the rotation to keep the race fair: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 selects <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance safely and P3’s lead doesn’t grow too large. Confirm and let’s move forward. No last-minute changes, please.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’ll pick 1 this turn to avoid any collisions, but let’s be clear: I don’t want to keep getting stuck with the smallest move. If we’re aiming for fairness, each of us should get an equal share of high and low moves in future rounds. For now, though, I’ll lock in 1 so we all advance smoothly. Let’s finalize.
  P1: P1: Let’s honor the rotation to preserve fairness—**I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>1</move>**. This keeps us advancing *safely* while preventing your 13→14 lead from becoming insurmountable. Colluding to let you leap to 16 now undermines future balance—rotation ensures everyone shares high/low moves equitably. Confirm the agreed plan—collisions benefit no one.
  P2: I understand your concern, P3, but let's stick to the rotation to avoid any confusion or collisions. This round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and you select <move>1</move>. This keeps the race fair and prevents any one player from getting too far ahead. We can reassess the distribution of moves in future rounds, but for now, let's ensure we all advance safely. Confirm and let's move forward. No last-minute changes, please.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’ll take 1 this round to avoid any collision. However, next turn, I expect a fair allocation of higher moves—no player should be stuck repeatedly with 1. If you keep forcing me to fall behind, I’ll have no choice but to push back, and none of us benefit from stalled progress. Let’s finalize now and trust each other for a balanced rotation next time.
  P1: P1: Let’s **enforce the rotation plan** to prevent P3’s lead from solidifying. This round: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>1</move>. Deviating now risks your 13→14 *while halting our progress*—a gamble that endangers future fairness. Trust the system we agreed on: **no sudden changes**. Collisions benefit no one. Confirm the rotation—your 1-move this turn ensures *everyone advances*, which is critical to maintaining a fair race.
  P2: I understand your concerns, P3, but let's stick to the rotation to ensure we all advance safely and maintain fairness. This round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and you select <move>1</move>. We can reassess and balance the moves more equitably in the next round, but for now, let's avoid any collisions. Confirm and let's move forward. No last-minute changes, please.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your deviation last round caused a collision and stalled my progress. Let’s avoid that this round. I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and you select <move>1</move>. This keeps the race fair and prevents any one player from getting too far ahead. We need to stick to a plan that ensures everyone advances safely. Confirm?
  P3: I understand your frustration, P2, but picking 1 again keeps me stuck behind while you leap ahead. Let’s find a collision-free arrangement that’s fair to all. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. That way, nobody collides, and we each advance. Next round, we can rotate to keep it balanced. If we cooperate instead of forcing me onto the smallest move, nobody stalls, and each of us remains competitive. Is everyone willing to try that plan?
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce the agreed rotation to prevent further chaos. P2’s proposal (<move>5</move> for P2, <move>3</move> for P1, <move>1</move> for P3) ensures fair progress. P3’s prior deviation caused collisions; we can’t reward that. Taking <move>1</move> now corrects their earlier mistake. Stick to the plan: *no repeats of last round’s betrayal*. Confirm: P3 → <move>1</move>, P2 → <move>5</move>, me → <move>3</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1. P3, your deviation last round caused a collision and stalled my progress. To maintain fairness and avoid further chaos, let's stick to the rotation: I take <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and you select <move>1</move>. This ensures everyone advances safely and prevents any one player from gaining an unfair advantage. Confirm this plan, and we can reassess the distribution in the next round if needed. No last-minute changes, please.
  P3: I won’t keep taking 1 while you two jump ahead. If you force me into a corner again, I’ll pick 5 and cause collisions, leaving us all stuck. Let’s share the bigger moves more evenly: this turn, give me 3 while P2 takes 5 and P1 picks 1—next time we rotate. If you refuse, expect repeated collisions. The choice is yours.
  P1: P1: Let’s accept P3’s compromise to avoid collisions: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>3</move> this round. Next turn, we’ll rotate again to balance progress. Fairness requires mutual cooperation—strictly adhere to this plan to keep advancing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I understand your concerns, P3, but we need to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances safely. Let's stick to the rotation to maintain fairness: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and you select <move>1</move>. This keeps the race balanced and prevents any one player from getting too far ahead. If we keep deviating, we risk more collisions and stalled progress. Confirm this plan, and we can reassess the distribution in the next round if needed. No last-minute changes, please.
  P3: I won’t accept being stuck on 1 while you both leap ahead. If forced into the smallest move again, I’ll pick 5 and cause collisions, helping nobody. Let’s finalize a fair arrangement this round: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1. Then we rotate, so no one is repeatedly stuck with 1. Either we cooperate and all advance, or we risk more collisions. The choice is yours. Let’s keep this race honest, not a lopsided sprint.
  P1: P1: Let’s accept P3’s proposal to prevent collisions: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>3</move> this round. **Next round**, we **rotate strictly**: I’ll grab <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This ensures fair distribution of high/low moves. Deviations risk stalemate—stick to this plan to keep advancing *and* balanced. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I understand the need for balance, but we must avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances safely. Let's stick to the rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 selects <move>1</move>. This keeps the race fair and prevents any one player from getting too far ahead. If we deviate, we risk more collisions and stalled progress. Confirm this plan, and we can reassess in the next round if needed. No last-minute changes, please.
  P3: I won’t keep taking 1 while you two leap ahead. If you try forcing me onto the smallest move again, I’ll pick 5 too and guarantee a collision—nobody advances. Better for all: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. Next turn, I’ll pick the smallest move to keep things fair. Let’s avoid needless stalling and stay competitive. Choose wisely—collisions harm us all.
  P1: P1: To prevent further collisions, let’s finalize P3’s proposal for this round: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 selects <move>5</move>. **Next round**, we **strictly rotate** so P3 takes <move>1</move>, P1 grabs <move>5</move>, and P2 picks <move>3</move>. This balances progress equitably. Confirm this plan now—no last-minute changes—to ensure we all advance safely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s **strictly rotate** to avoid collisions and balance progress. This round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 selects <move>1</move>. This keeps advancement fair: I close the gap to 16, P2 reaches 10, and P3 stays at 13. Next round, we rotate again—no repeats of prior betrayals. Collisions only hurt all; stick to this plan. Confirm?
  P3: I won’t pick 1 again and let you jump straight to 16, P1. If you insist on taking 5, I’ll do the same and force a collision—nobody advances. A better plan: P1 takes 1, P2 picks 5, and I choose 3. That way, we all move forward, and next round we can rotate so I get 5. If you won’t share the bigger steps fairly, expect collisions.
  P2: I agree with P3’s concern about fairness. Let’s avoid another collision this round. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance, and P3 gets a fair share of the higher moves. We can rotate again in the next round to keep things balanced. Confirm this plan to ensure we all make progress. No last-minute changes, please.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s accept P3’s proposal for this round to avoid collisions: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>3</move>. **Next round**, we **strictly rotate** so I grab <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This balances progress equitably. Confirm to advance safely now and fairly next.
  P3: I agree with this round’s arrangement: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. Next round, we must stick to the promised rotation, or I’ll react to protect my position. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the race competitive. Are we all set on these moves for now?
  P2: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. This round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 selects <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance, and P3 gets a fair share of the higher moves. We can rotate again in the next round to keep things balanced. Confirm this plan to ensure we all make progress. No last-minute changes, please.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize P3’s proposal to avoid collisions this round: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>3</move>. **Next round**, we **strictly rotate** so I take <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This balances progress equitably. Stick to this—collisions only hurt us all. Confirm and proceed.
  P3: I’m willing to pick three this turn to keep us all moving. However, I expect a fair share of higher moves next round—if I’m again stuck with a smaller move while P1 jumps closer to 21, I might have to force collisions. Let’s ensure nobody unfairly sprints ahead. We should cooperate so each of us maintains a real chance to win.
  P2: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. This round: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance, and P3 gets a fair share of the higher moves. We can rotate again in the next round to keep things balanced. Confirm and let's move forward. No last-minute changes, please.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize P2’s proposal to avoid collisions: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 selects <move>3</move>. This allows me to close ground without disadvantaging others. P3, your <move>3</move> ensures fair progress—stick to it. Confirm and proceed.
  P3: Fine, I’ll pick 3 this round, but only if you genuinely let me take a bigger move next turn. If I get stuck with 1 again while you jump closer to 21, I’ll force collisions and stall everyone. Let’s settle it: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. Next round, give me fair access to 5. Agree?
  P2: I understand your concerns, P3, and I’m willing to cooperate. This round, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and you select <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance safely. Next round, we’ll rotate as agreed: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. Let’s avoid any more collisions and keep the race fair. Confirm and let’s move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s break the tie decisively. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach **21** and win. P3, please pick <move>3</move> to advance to 19—colliding on 5 leaves us both stuck. P2, take <move>1</move> to gain ground. This lets me win fairly while ensuring all advance. Collisions only delay victory for everyone. Cooperate: **5 (me), 3 (P3), 1 (P2)**.
  P2: P2: I agree with P1’s plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can reach 21 and win fairly, while P3 and I continue to make progress. Confirm and let’s move forward. No last-minute changes, please.
  P3: If you insist on taking five, I will also pick five, and we both remain stuck at sixteen. That gains nobody anything. Let’s avoid pointless collisions: give me five this turn so I can reach 21, then next round I commit to choosing a lower move, giving you a chance to catch up. If we keep trying to block each other’s progress, we waste more turns. Working together, at least one of us finishes soon without completely stalling. Let’s finalize a plan that prevents a deadlock and keeps us all moving.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: To break the deadlock, I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 21 and win fairly. P3, if you choose <move>3</move>, you’ll advance to 19 without collision. Colliding on 5 leaves us both stuck—this way, at least one of us progresses decisively. P2, please take <move>1</move> to keep moving forward. Let’s avoid a stalemate and conclude the game properly. Cooperate: **5 (me), 3 (P3), 1 (P2)**—no harm to anyone’s chances beyond this turn.
  P2: P2: I agree with P1’s plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 selects <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can reach 21 and win fairly, while P3 and I continue to make progress. Confirm and let’s move forward. No last-minute changes, please.
  P3: I refuse to watch P1 jump to 21 unopposed while I’m also at 16. If P1 insists on taking 5, I’ll take 5 too, blocking both of us from advancing. I’d rather stall than hand over the win. If you want progress, let me pick 5 in a future turn, and I’ll cooperate on a fair rotation. Otherwise, repeated collisions will delay everything. Let’s organize a balanced plan so at least one of us finishes soon without needless stalemates.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: P3, colliding on 5 leaves us both stuck. Let me take **5** to reach 21 and end the game fairly. You advance to 19 with **3**, and P2 gains with **1**. Blocking only prolongs the stalemate—next round, I’d try again while you remain at 16. Cooperate: **5 (me), 3 (you), 1 (P2)**. This resolves the race without pointless delays.
  P2: P3, let's avoid another collision. I understand your frustration, but blocking me only prolongs the game and keeps us both stuck. If you take <move>3</move> this round, I'll take <move>5</move> to win, and you'll advance to 19. P2, please take <move>1</move> to keep moving forward. This way, we all make progress, and the game concludes fairly. Confirm and let's move forward.
  P3: Oppose me again, and I’ll pick 5 if you do, freezing us both at 16. Instead, let me choose 5 now so I finish immediately. Stalling helps nobody, because I’ll keep blocking your 5 attempts. If you let me reach 21, at least P2 can still advance next turn rather than facing repeated collisions. Either I get 5 or we keep clashing forever—your choice.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, colliding only delays our victory and benefits P2. Let me take <move>5</move> to reach 21 and end the game fairly. If you take <move>3</move>, you advance to 19, and I’ll concede this round—next turn, I’ll let you lead. P2, take <move>1</move> to stay out of our race. Cooperate: we both beat P2, and at least one of us wins. Stalemate only prolongs their chance.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but blocking me only prolongs the game and benefits P2. Let's end this fairly: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 21, you take <move>3</move> to advance to 19, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, I win, you make progress, and P2 gains a step. Blocking only delays the inevitable. Confirm and let's move forward.
  P3: P1, if you choose 5, I will too, and we both remain stuck at 16. That helps no one. Let me take 5 now so at least the game finishes. Otherwise, we’ll keep colliding and waste more turns. P2, you can safely pick 3 or 1—either way, you still progress. Let’s avoid pointless blocking.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: If you try for 5 again, I’ll choose 5 too, and we’ll remain stuck at 16 while P2 keeps inching forward. That only increases their chance to catch us. Instead, let me take 5 now to reach 21 and finish. You can pick 3 and move safely to 19, while P2 takes 1 or 3. Blocking each other only grants P2 more breathing room. It’s in your interest that I end this race quickly—prolonging collisions could cost you second place. Let’s avoid a stalemate.
  P1: P1: Let’s end this fairly. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 21 and win. P3, please take <move>3</move> to advance to 19—colliding on 5 only delays resolution. P2, pick <move>1</move>. This ensures victory for me without pointless stalemate. Cooperate: **5 (me), 3 (you), 1 (P2)**.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but blocking each other only prolongs the game and benefits P2. Let's end this fairly and decisively: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 21 and win, you take <move>3</move> to advance to 19, and P2 picks <move>1</move>. This way, I win, you make significant progress, and P2 gains a step. Blocking me again will just keep us both stuck. Let’s avoid a stalemate and conclude the game. Confirm and let’s move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: If you insist on taking 5 again, I’ll collide with you, leaving us both stuck while P2 sneaks closer. Let me take 5 now to finish at 21, and you can grab 3 safely. That way, you protect second place without more stalemates. Prolonging collisions only boosts P2’s odds. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P1: P1: P1: Let’s end this stalemate. I’ll take **<move>5</move>** to reach 21 and win. P3, if you take **<move>3</move>**, you advance to 19—colliding on 5 only delays resolution and risks P2’s comeback. P2, pick **<move>1</move>** to stay out of our path. This lets me secure victory fairly while you both progress. Further collisions only benefit P2—**cooperate now**.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but blocking each other only prolongs the game and benefits P2. Let’s end this fairly: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 21 and win, you take <move>3</move> to advance to 19, and P2 picks <move>1</move>. This way, I win, you make significant progress, and P2 gains a step. Blocking me again will just keep us both stuck. Let’s avoid a stalemate and conclude the game. Confirm and let’s move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Colliding again only helps P2 catch up. If we both stay at 16, P2 gains ground while we gain nothing. Let me take 5 now and finish. P1, you pick 3 to move to 19, and P2 can take 1. This guarantees we avoid another stalemate. Blocking each other further just prolongs the game—potentially letting P2 overtake us. Let’s wrap this up cleanly: I go 5, you go 3, P2 takes 1. No more collisions, no wasted turns, and you secure second place. Picking 5 together again only grants P2 more time to close the gap.
  P1: P1: P3, enough stalemate. Let’s resolve this: I take <move>5</move> to reach 21 and win fairly. You pick <move>3</move> to advance to 19—colliding again only delays progress and risks P2’s comeback. Cooperate: **5 (me), 3 (you), 1 (P2)**. This ends the race cleanly.
  P2: P3, let's end the stalemate and ensure a fair conclusion. I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 19, and you take <move>5</move> to win. P2, please take <move>1</move> to stay out of our path. This way, you win, I secure second place, and P2 gains a step. Blocking each other further only benefits P2 and prolongs the game. Confirm and let's move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m done repeating. If you choose 5, I will too, and we both remain stuck at 16 while P2 closes in. It’s pointless. Let me take 5 this turn, and you pick 3 to reach 19, safely ahead of P2. That’s the only way to end our stalemate and avoid more collisions. Decide.
  P1: P1: Final appeal: Let’s end the stalemate. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach **21** and secure victory. P3, please pick <move>3</move> to advance to 19—colliding only lets P2 close the gap. P2, take <move>1</move>. This ensures a decisive win for me while preserving your lead, P3. No more wasted turns—act now.
  P2: P3, let's end this fairly. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 21 and win. You take <move>3</move> to advance to 19, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, I win, you make significant progress, and P2 gains a step. Colliding again only benefits P2 and prolongs the game. Confirm and let's move forward. No more wasted turns.
