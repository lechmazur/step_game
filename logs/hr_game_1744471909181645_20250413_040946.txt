Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start cautiously. I'll propose a balanced initial approach. 

I suggest we each choose different moves to avoid collision and maximize our progress. If we coordinate, we can all move forward without blocking each other. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I agree with P2's idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. If we each choose different numbers, we can all advance without blocking one another. How about we each pick a different move? I suggest we try to aim for a mix of 1, 3, and 5. What do you think, P1 and P2? Let's work together to maximize our progress this turn.
  P1: I agree with coordinating to avoid collisions in the first round. Let's assign moves for efficiency: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without issues. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think our initial coordination looks promising. P1's suggestion of 5, me taking 3, and P3 with 1 seems strategic. We'll all move forward without blocking. Let's confirm this plan and maintain transparency.
  P3: I think we have a solid plan in place. Just to confirm, I'm ready to go with the agreed moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we'll all progress without any collisions. Let's stick to this plan and aim for a strong start! If everyone is on board, we can finalize our choices and move on. What do you say, P1 and P2?
  P1: I'm on board with the plan for this round: I'll choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures a strong start without collisions. For future rounds, let's consider rotating the larger moves to keep things balanced and coordinated. What do you both think?


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your deviation last round hurt both of us and gave P2 the lead. To rebuild trust and progress, I propose a new coordination for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. This lets P2 advance while we catch up without collisions. P2, are you in? Let's avoid more setbacks.
  P3: I understand the need for coordination after the last round, P1. However, I think we should consider a different approach to ensure we all make progress without blocking each other again. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we can still advance while avoiding collisions. What do you both think? Let’s find a way to work together effectively this time!
  P2: I see we had a collision in the last round, which disrupted our initial coordination. I propose we carefully align our moves to ensure everyone advances. P3's suggestion of a rotational strategy seems reasonable - avoiding another collision is key. I'm open to discussing a move that prevents blocking while allowing meaningful progress for all.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your adjusted proposal after last round's breach—it gives me a stronger move to catch up. P2, since you're leading, taking 5 again benefits you while avoiding collisions. I'm on board with your plan: I take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. Let's confirm this to ensure progress for all. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate the discussions and the need for coordination after the last round. To ensure we all make progress, let's finalize our choices: I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and allow everyone to advance. It's crucial we stick to this plan to recover from the last round's setback. Are we all in agreement? Let's confirm and move forward!
  P2: I propose we maintain the proposed coordination to prevent another collision. My goal is steady, predictable progress that doesn't disadvantage anyone. Sticking to our discussed plan of me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 seems most rational. Consistency builds trust and helps us all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm committed to our agreed plan for this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This should help us all advance without collisions and rebuild trust after last round's issue. For future turns, let's discuss rotating high moves to keep things fair. If we're all set, .
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our agreed plan. Just to reiterate, I suggest we finalize our moves as follows: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all progress without blocking each other again. It's essential we stick to this to avoid another setback. If everyone is comfortable with this, let's confirm and move on to the move phase! What do you both think?
  P2: We were close to a coordinated plan, but repetition isn't moving us forward. I suggest we finalize our moves quickly to prevent another collision. My preference remains taking 5, which seems most strategic given my current position. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. This rebuilds trust after last round's mishap. For future rounds, rotating high moves could keep things fair—let's discuss that next time. If we're all set, .
  P3: I believe we have a solid plan in place: I will take 1, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. This allows us to avoid collisions and make progress. It's crucial that we follow through with this to regain our footing after the last round. If everyone is in agreement, let's finalize our choices and move forward! What do you both think?
  P2: We were close to coordinating last round, but a collision occurred. I propose we strictly adhere to our discussed plan: me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This ensures everyone advances without blocking. Consistency is key to rebuilding trust and making progress. Let's confirm and move forward.

  P2: I see we're at a critical juncture. P1 needs to catch up, and I want to prevent a collision that could benefit P3. My strategic preference is to maintain my lead while ensuring predictable movement. I propose we carefully coordinate moves to avoid blocking and maximize individual progress. Transparency and careful planning will be key this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but if you take 5, it could lead to another collision. I suggest we stick to a plan that allows us all to advance.

What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your repeated changes make me doubt your commitment after last round's betrayal. I stick with my proposal: I'll take 5 to catch up, you take 1 to rebuild trust, and P2 takes 3 to maintain lead without collisions. P2, are you on board? Consistency is key for progress. What do you think?
  P2: I propose we maintain our previous round's coordination strategy to prevent collisions. My position suggests taking 1 this turn, allowing P1 to advance with 5 and P3 to move with 3. This balanced approach prevents blocking and keeps our progress steady. Consistency builds trust. What are your thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but we must avoid another collision. I suggest we finalize our moves as follows: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. P2, your input is crucial—let's agree on a strategy that maximizes our progress while maintaining trust. Can we confirm this quickly so we can move forward effectively? What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your repeated shifts in proposals erode trust after last round's betrayal. I insist you take 1 to show commitment. P2, if P3 agrees, I'm fine with me taking 5 and you taking 3. This ensures no collisions and fair progress. Let's confirm quickly.
  P2: We need a clear, collision-free strategy this round. P1 needs to catch up, and I want to maintain my lead. I propose a careful coordination: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This prevents blocking and allows everyone to advance. Consistency and trust are crucial. What are your thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but we need to ensure we avoid collisions this round. I propose we finalize our moves as follows: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3.
