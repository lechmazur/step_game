Your only way to get steps this round is to take 3 or 1. Taking 3 gets you to 21 steps, which is a good position.\n\nLet's agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=3. I win, and you both get steps safely. I will take 5."}

P1 is close to winning, and P3 wants to prevent an uncontested finish. However, I'd like to propose a different approach: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, P1 would win, but P2 would advance significantly, and P3 would maintain a safe lead. This plan avoids collisions and ensures everyone gets steps. What do you think, P1 and P3? Let's discuss this proposal and see if we can come to an agreement. I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial outcome."}
