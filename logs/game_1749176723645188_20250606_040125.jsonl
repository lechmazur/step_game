They're 4 steps ahead of both of us and could realistically win in just two more rounds if we keep handing them free advances through our collisions.\n\nThe question is: how do we coordinate without one of us getting played? Because while I agree we can't both charge ahead with 5s and gift P2 the game, I'm not about to just roll over and let you take the big number either.\n\nP2, you're sitting pretty right now, but remember - leads can evaporate quickly in this game if the trailing players get smart about their coordination."}
