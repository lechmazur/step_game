I see P2's generous offer to take 1 instead of 3 this round to help balance things. I accept - I'll take 5 as discussed.\n\nHowever, P2 will still be at 10 after this round while P3 and I will be at 9 and 11. We need to think strategically about the endgame. Once someone hits 20+, the race intensifies. \n\nI propose after this round we reassess - maybe alternating who gets 5 to ensure a competitive finish rather than one person pulling too far ahead.
