Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's split moves to avoid collisions. I'll take 5—P1, you take 1; P3, you take 3. First to 24 wins!"
  P3: I'm not comfortable with P2's proposal as it puts me at a disadvantage. If I take 3 and P1 takes 1, we're both likely to be far behind P2, who takes 5. I suggest we reconsider the moves. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, we're more evenly distributed, and no one gets a significant advantage initially. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I appreciate both suggestions. P3's plan works for me—I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we all advance without collisions, and we stay competitive. P2, does that sound fair? If not, let's hear your counter.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let's revisit my plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It’s the only way to avoid collisions and accelerate progress. P1, you’re in?"
  P3: Since we've discussed two proposals, I'm leaning towards my initial suggestion as it gives us a balanced start. However, I'm open to alternatives that avoid collisions. P1 and P2, if you're not comfortable with my plan, what about we all take the same move? That way, none of us advance, and we restart negotiations next turn with no one having an advantage. Or, we can stick with my initial plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Your thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan puts me last, which isn't fair. I stick with P3's proposal: me=5, you=3, P3=1. It avoids collisions and keeps us close. If you insist on 5, I'll match you to block us both—let's not waste the turn. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let's take 3 each. No collisions, fair progress. P1, P3—agree?"
  P3: Since P1 has agreed to my initial proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), I'm inclined to stick with it. P2, if you're still not comfortable, let's discuss alternatives. However, repeating the same move (e.g., all taking 3) isn't a good strategy long-term as it stalls progress. I'm open to other suggestions that maintain a competitive balance. P1 has already agreed; your thoughts, P2?
  P1: P2, insisting on 5 puts you ahead unfairly from the start. Let's go with P3's balanced plan: me=5, you=3, P3=1. We all advance, no collisions, and stay competitive. If you push for more, I'll take 5 too, blocking us both while P3 advances. Agree to avoid wasting the turn?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Let’s take 5, 3, 1. I’ll take 5. P1, take 1; P3, take 3. No collisions. Final offer."
  P3: Let's simplify the decision. P2 is still trying to renegotiate. I'm sticking with our agreed plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2, if you're not comfortable with this, let's all take the same move (e.g., 1) to stall progress equally, rather than continuing to discuss different distributions. This way, we restart without any advantage. Otherwise, let's commit to our current agreement to avoid collisions and make progress. Your move, P2.
  P1: P2, your "final offer" still puts you ahead unfairly. I'm committed to the balanced plan: me=5, you=3, P3=1. If you take 5 instead, I'll match it to block us both, letting P3 pull ahead. Let's avoid that and all advance. Agree? If not, I'm ready to move on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's analyze the outcome of Round 1. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 worked out as planned. For Round 2, we should maintain a similar strategy to avoid collisions. I suggest we continue with the same relative differences: P1 takes 1 (total 6), P2 takes 3 (total 6), and I take 5 (total 6). This keeps us evenly matched. P1, P2, do you agree to adjust our moves accordingly?
  P2: "Let's revert to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions, and I'll push ahead. P1, P3, agree?"
  P1: P3's plan evens us out at 6, which is fair and avoids collisions—I'm in. P2, your proposal puts you ahead unfairly again. If you insist on 5, I'll match it to block us both, letting P3 surge with 3 or whatever. Let's commit to P3's rotation: me=1, you=3, P3=5. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P1 has agreed to my plan for Round 2 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), I'm sticking with it. P2, if you're still not comfortable, let's consider an alternative: we can rotate our moves again. For Round 3, we could have P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps the rotation consistent and avoids collisions. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this proposal for the next round. Let's plan ahead to maintain a competitive balance.
  P2: "Let's stick to my plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. P1, P3, commit now—this is the only way to push ahead. If not, we waste the turn."
  P1: P2, your plan keeps trying to leap ahead unfairly—it's transparent. I'm committed to P3's fair rotation: me=1, you=3, P3=5, evening us at 6. If you grab 5, I'll take 3 (to 8) while P3 takes 1 (to 2), leaving you potentially blocked or behind. Let's all advance evenly and compete later. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 is still trying to gain an unfair advantage. Let's stick to the agreed plan for Round 2: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us evenly matched at 6 steps each. For Round 3, we can rotate again: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'm committed to this fair strategy. P1, confirm you're still in. P2, if you're not comfortable, let's consider a temporary stall by taking the same move, rather than risking collisions or unfair advantages.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. If you block, I'll take 5 alone. Let's move forward."
  P1: P2, your "final offer" still favors you unfairly—rejecting it. I'm locked in on P3's fair plan: me=1, you=3, P3=5, tying us at 6. If you take 5, I'll match it to block us both (me to 10, you to 8 but collided), letting P3 advance freely with 3 (to 4). Let's all progress evenly instead. P3, confirm?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2 is still trying to gain an unfair advantage. Let's stick to our agreed plan for Round 2: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us evenly matched at 6 steps each. For Round 3, we can rotate again: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'm committed to this fair strategy. P1, confirm you're still in. If P2 isn't comfortable, let's consider a temporary stall to avoid collisions.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. If you block, I'll take 5 alone. Let's move forward."
  P1: P3, confirmed—I'm sticking with your fair plan: me=1 (to 6), you=5 (to 6), P2=3 (to 6). P2, your push for 5 is greedy; if you take it, I'll match to collide us (me to 10 blocked, you to 8 blocked), letting P3 take 3 (to 4). Let's even up and compete later. Agree, or waste the turn?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3's rotation plan for Round 3 makes sense: me=5 (to 11), P2=1 (to 7), P3=3 (to 9). It keeps us advancing without collisions and rotates the lead fairly. P2, you've followed the plans before despite your talk—let's stick to this for even competition. If you grab more, I'll match to block, letting P3 pull ahead. Agree to progress?
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. I’ll push ahead. Let’s move forward—no waste."
  P3: Since P2 is still pushing for an unfair advantage, let's simplify: for Round 3, I'm sticking with the agreed rotation - P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. P1 has already agreed. P2, if you're not comfortable, we can stall by taking the same move (e.g., 1), ensuring no one advances. Otherwise, let's commit to the rotation. I'm ready to move forward with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Your move, P2. If you insist on 5, P1 will likely match, blocking both of you. Let's avoid that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, confirmed—I'm committed to the rotation: me=5 (to 11), P2=1 (to 7), you=3 (to 9). It's fair and advances us all. P2, your offer still favors you unfairly; if you take 5, I'll match to block us both (me to 11 blocked, you to 11 blocked), letting P3 surge with 3 (to 9). Let's rotate properly and compete evenly. Agree?
  P2: "Final offer: I take 5. If you block, I'll go alone. Let's not waste the turn. P1, P3—agree or risk falling behind."
  P3: Since P2 is still not committing to the agreed rotation for Round 3, I'm suggesting an alternative to avoid wasting the turn: let's all take 1. This stalls progress equally for everyone, maintaining the current standings (P1=6, P2=6, P3=6), and gives us a chance to renegotiate next turn without any disadvantage. P1, are you open to this temporary stall? P2, this way, no one falls behind or advances unfairly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'm not interested in stalling—we're all even, so let's advance with the rotation: me=5 (to 11), P2=1 (to 7), you=3 (to 9). It's fair over time. P2, if you take 5, I'll match to block us both (both at 11 blocked), letting P3 take 3 (to 9). Don't waste the turn; commit to the plan. Agree?
  P2: "Final offer: I take 5. If you block, I'll go alone. Let's move forward."
  P3: Since P2 is still insisting on taking 5 and risking a collision, I'll reiterate the alternative: let's all take 1 to stall progress equally. This maintains our current standings and allows us to renegotiate next turn without disadvantage. P1 is committed to the rotation, but I'm open to a temporary stall if P2 isn't willing to cooperate. P1, are you still willing to follow the rotation? P2, consider the stall to avoid risking a collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, stalling wastes our even position—let's advance with the rotation: me=5 (to 11), P2=1 (to 7), you=3 (to 9). It's fair and rotates the lead. P2, if you take 5, I'll match to block us both at 6, letting P3 surge to 9 with 3. Commit to the plan or waste it. Confirmed?
  P2: P2: "Final offer: I take 5. If you block, I'll go alone. Let's end this and move forward."
  P3: Since P2 is still insisting on taking 5, I'll make one last attempt to reason. P2, taking 5 alone will only get you to 11, while P1 and I advance with the rotation. If you really want to push ahead, consider taking 3. It's a compromise that keeps us competitive without risking a collision. If not, stalling by taking 1 is still a viable option. Let's not risk a collision when we're evenly matched. What's your final decision?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 4, let's continue the rotation to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. The next rotation should be: P1=1 (to 12), P2=3 (to 10), P3=5 (to 14). This keeps us competitive and evenly matched. P1, are you still committed to the rotation? P2, if you're not comfortable, we can discuss alternatives, but stalling or taking 5 alone risks collisions or unfair advantages. Let's progress fairly.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. P1, P3—commit or risk me going alone. Let’s advance, not waste the turn."
  P1: P3, your rotation puts you ahead at 14 while P2 lags— not fair, especially since P2 hasn't gotten 5 yet. Let's even us at 12 with P2's plan: me=1 (12), P2=5 (12), you=3 (12). No collisions, tied again. Then we can rotate properly, ensuring each gets 5 in turn. P2, confirmed. If not, I'll match whoever grabs 5 to block, letting the other advance. Agree to tie?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is suggesting we tie at 12 by following P2's plan for this round. However, this delays our rotation. I'm open to temporarily tying us at 12, but let's commit to rotating properly afterward. P2, if we tie now, will you agree to follow the rotation in Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? This ensures fairness and avoids future collisions. Let's discuss.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. If you block, I'll go alone. Let's move forward."
  P1: P3, I'm open to tying at 12 this round (me=1, P2=5, you=3) if we commit to rotation next: Round 5 me=5 (to 17), P2=1 (to 13), you=3 (to 15). Fair progression. P2, this gives you 5 now to catch up—agree, or I'll match your 5 to block us both, letting P3 surge with 5 (to 14). Let's tie and plan ahead. Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 is open to tying at 12 this round if we commit to the rotation next turn. I'm inclined to agree as it maintains fairness. P2, if we tie now (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), will you commit to the rotation in Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? This ensures we're all on the same page and can progress without collisions. Let's finalize the plan for this round and the next to maintain a competitive balance.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. Let’s move forward. If you block, I’ll go alone."
  P1: P3, tying at 12 this round (me=1 to 12, P2=5 to 12, you=3 to 12) is fair and resets us evenly—I'm in. Then Round 5 rotation: me=5 (17), P2=1 (13), you=3 (15). P2, this gives you the 5 you want now—commit? If you deviate, I'll match your move to block us both, letting P3 surge. Let's tie and plan ahead. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Since we've discussed tying at 12 this round and committing to the rotation for Round 5, let's finalize. P1 and I are on board with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 to tie at 12. P2, please confirm you'll follow the rotation in Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. If you're committed, let's proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round. Confirm your agreement for Round 5, and we can move forward.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. If you take 5, we collide. Let's avoid that. Take 3, and I'll take 1. Let's not waste the turn."
  P1: P2, your shift to taking 1 is interesting—let's capitalize: I'll take 5 (to 16), you take 1 (to 8), P3 take 3 (to 12). No collisions, all advance, and we stay competitive. P3, this is better than stalling or tying; it rotates fairly without favoring one. If not, I'll match any 5 attempt to block. Agree to progress?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're slightly ahead at 12—let's keep rotating fairly: me=5 (to 16), P2=3 (to 10), you=1 (to 13). No collisions, all advance, and it evens us out over time. P2, this gives you progress without greed—agree, or I'll match your inevitable 5 attempt to block us both, letting P3 surge with 5 (to 17). Let's progress smartly. Confirm?
  P3: Let's simplify our strategy for Round 5. I'm committed to the rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us competitive without collisions. P2, taking 3 is a fair move and allows us to progress. P1, if P2 doesn't agree, they risk being left behind. Let's proceed with the rotation to maintain balance. I'm ready to move forward with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2, confirm if you're in or suggest an alternative that doesn't risk collisions.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. Let’s move forward. If you block, I’ll go alone."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your offer puts P3 further ahead at 15 while we tie at 12—unfair to us. Stick to the fair rotation: me=5 (16), you=3 (10), P3=1 (13). All advance, no collisions. If you grab 5, I'll match to block us both (me at 11, you at 7), letting P3 surge with 5 (17). P3, confirmed? Let's progress evenly and compete later. Agree?
  P3: Let's stick to the rotation for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It's fair and maintains our competitive balance. P2, taking 3 is a reasonable move; it allows us to progress without collisions. If you insist on 5, P1 will likely match, blocking both of you. P1, confirm you're still committed to the rotation. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to keep advancing evenly.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. If you block, I’ll go alone. Let’s move forward—no waste."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, confirmed—let's lock in the fair rotation: me=5 (16), you=1 (13), P2=3 (10). All advance, no collisions. P2, your plan lets P3 surge to 15 while we lag—reject it. If you take 5, I'll match to block us both (me at 11, you at 7), letting P3 take 5 (17). Commit to 3, or waste your chance. Agree?
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 5. I'm committed to the rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This maintains our competitive balance. P2, taking 3 is fair and allows us to progress. If you insist on 5, P1 will match, blocking both of you. P1, confirm you're still in. If P2 doesn't agree, they'll risk being left behind. Let's proceed with the rotation to keep advancing evenly. I'm ready to move forward with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collision. I’ll take 5. If you take 5, we clash. Take 3, I’ll take 1. No waste—agree?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let's stick to the rotation: me=5 (16), you=1 (13), P2=3 (10). Fair advance for all. P2, your new suggestion leaves P3 open to surge—reject it. If you take 5, I'll match to block us both (me 11, you 7), letting P3 take 5 (17). Commit to 3, or get left behind. Confirmed?
  P3: Let's finalize Round 5. I'm sticking to the rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2, taking 3 is fair and allows us to progress without collisions. If you insist on 5, P1 will match, blocking both of you. P1, confirmed? Let's proceed with the rotation to maintain balance. I'm ready to move forward with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2, consider the consequences of deviating from the agreed plan.
  P2: "Final offer: I take 5. If you take 5, we collide. Take 3, and I'll take 1. Let's avoid waste. P3, take 3 to keep the rotation."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 14, P3 is at 13, and P2 is at 12. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, we should continue the rotation. For Round 6, the next logical step in the rotation is: P1=1 (to 15), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 18). This keeps us competitive and closely matched. P1, P2, are you open to continuing the rotation, or do you have an alternative that maintains fairness and avoids collisions?
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. If you block, I'll go alone. Let's move forward."
  P1: P3, your plan puts you ahead at 18 while we lag—unfair. P2, yours favors you at 17. Let's balance: me=5 (to 19), P2=1 (to 13), P3=3 (to 16). All advance, no collisions, and rotates the lead. If anyone grabs 5 instead, I'll match to block us both, letting the other surge. Agree to fair progress?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's suggestion for Round 6 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is a good rotation, maintaining fairness and avoiding collisions. It keeps us closely matched: P1 to 19, P2 to 13, P3 to 16. I'm inclined to agree as it rotates the lead fairly. P2, if you don't agree, consider the alternative: we all take 1, stalling progress equally. This maintains the current standings without risking collisions. Let's discuss or commit to the rotation. P1, confirmed?
  P2: "Let's avoid collision. I'll take 5. If you take 5, we clash. Take 3, I'll take 1. No waste—agree?"
  P1: P3, thanks for agreeing to my plan: me=5 (19), you=3 (16), P2=1 (13). Fair rotation, all advance, no collisions. P2, your threat to take 5 is risky—if you do, I'll match to block us both (me at 14, you at 12), letting P3 surge with 5 (18). Take 1 instead, and let's progress evenly. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stick to the agreed rotation for Round 6: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. It maintains fairness and avoids collisions, keeping us closely matched. P2, taking 1 is a safe choice; if you take 5, P1 will match, blocking both of you. I'm committed to this rotation. P1, confirm you're still in. If P2 deviates, they'll risk being left behind or causing a collision. Let's proceed with the rotation to keep advancing evenly.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. If you block, I'll go alone. Let’s move forward—no waste."
  P1: P3, confirmed—let's lock in our fair rotation: me=5 (19), you=3 (16), P2=1 (13). All advance, no collisions. P2, your plan puts you ahead unfairly at 17; reject it. If you take 5, I'll match to block us both (me 14, you 12), letting P3 surge to 18 with 5. Commit to 1, or get left behind. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize Round 6. I'm sticking to the agreed rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps us competitive and closely matched. P2, taking 1 is a safe and fair choice. If you take 5, P1 will match, blocking both of you. P1, confirm you're still in. Let's proceed with the rotation to maintain balance. I'm ready to move forward with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. P2, consider the consequences of deviating.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. If you block, I'll go alone. Let’s move forward—no waste."
  P1: P3, let's finalize the rotation: me=5 (19), you=3 (16), P2=1 (13). Fair, all advance, no collisions. P2, your plan favors you at 17—rejected. If you take 5, I'll match to block us both (stuck at 14/12), letting P3 surge to 18 with 5. Commit to 1, or lag behind. Confirmed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue the rotation to maintain fairness. For Round 7, the next step is: P1=3 (to 22), P2=5 (to 17), P3=1 (to 14). This keeps us competitive and closely matched. P1, I'm committed to this rotation. P2, taking 5 is risky as P1 might match, blocking both of you. Consider taking 1 to stall or 3 to progress fairly. Let's discuss or commit to the rotation to avoid collisions and maintain balance.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. Let’s move forward."
  P1: P3, your rotation puts me at 22—close to win, but let's adjust for fairness: me=3 (22), you=5 (18), P2=1 (13). All advance, no collisions, and I won't surge alone. P2, your plan lags me unfairly—reject it. If anyone takes 5 besides you in this plan, I'll match to block, letting the other progress. Agree to this balanced move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P1 is close to winning at 19 steps, I suggest we adjust our moves to avoid giving them a clear win. For Round 7, let's consider: P1=1 (to 20), P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 16). This keeps P1 from surging too far ahead while still allowing progress. P1, taking 1 is a safe choice; if you take 5, P2 might match, blocking both of you. Let's maintain balance and avoid collisions. P2, are you open to this alternative?
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. Let’s move forward. If you block, I’ll go alone."
  P1: P3 and P2, your matching plan (me=1 to 20, P2=5 to 17, P3=3 to 16) keeps us all in the game without collisions—fair enough, I'm in. Let's commit to it and compete fiercely next rounds. If anyone deviates, I'll match the highest to block, letting the other surge. Agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since P1 is at 19 steps, close to winning, let's adjust our strategy for Round 7 to avoid giving them a clear win. I'm suggesting: P1=1 (to 20), P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 16). This maintains balance and avoids collisions. P1, taking 1 is safe; if you take 5, P2 might match, blocking both. P2, are you open to this alternative? It keeps us competitive without risking a collision. Let's discuss or commit to this plan to maintain fairness.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. P1, P3—agree or risk me going alone. Let’s move forward."
  P1: P2 and P3, your aligned plan (me=1 to 20, P2=5 to 17, P3=3 to 16) is fair and keeps the game going—I'm in. No collisions, all progress. If anyone deviates, I'll match the highest move to block, letting the other surge ahead. Commit to this and plan for next round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Since we're in Round 7 and P1 is at 19 steps, close to winning, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1=1 (to 20), P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 16). This maintains balance and avoids collisions. P1, taking 1 keeps you from surging too far. P2, taking 5 is risky if P1 matches. Let's commit to this plan. If anyone deviates, I'll adjust accordingly. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 to keep the game competitive and fair. Confirm your moves.
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. If you block, I'll go alone. Let's move forward."
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan (me=1 to 20, P2=5 to 17, P3=3 to 16) is fair to keep the game alive—I'm in. Let's commit and avoid deviations. If P2 grabs more, I'll match 5 to block us both, letting P3 surge with 5 to 18. Confirm and progress?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's coordinate: I'll take 5, P1 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions, we all advance. Let's move forward."
  P3: P2 is still trying to manipulate the game to their advantage. For Round 8, I suggest we stick to a rotation that maintains fairness. Since P1 is at 20 steps after Round 7, let's adjust our moves to avoid giving them a clear win. I propose: P1=1 (to 21), P2=3 (to 20), P3=5 (to 21). This keeps us competitive and closely matched. P1, are you open to this? P2, taking 3 is a fair move; if you take 5, P1 might match, blocking both of you.
  P1: P3, your plan ties us at 21 but leaves P2 lagging unfairly at 15—reject it. P2, yours puts you ahead while I lag. Let's fair: me=5 (24, but we all advance if no collision), you=1 (13), P3=3 (19). No collisions, progress for all. If anyone takes 5 besides me, I'll match to block us both, letting the other surge. Agree to this rotation?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to my plan: 5, 3, 1. No collisions. If P1 takes 5, I'll block. Let's move forward."
  P3: Since P1 is close to winning at 19 steps, I suggest we adjust our moves to avoid giving them a clear win. For Round 8, let's consider: P1=1 (to 20), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 21). This keeps P1 from surging too far ahead while still allowing progress. P1, taking 1 is a safe choice; if you take 5, P2 might match, blocking both of you. P2, are you open to this alternative to maintain balance and avoid collisions?
  P1: P3, your plan surges you to 21 while P2 lags at 15—unfair. P2, threatening to block me is mutual destruction; if you take 5, I'll switch to 3 (to 22), letting you advance alone to 17, and P3 take 1 (to 17). Let's compromise: me=3 (22), you=5 (17), P3=1 (17). No collisions, all progress, game continues fairly. Agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final offer: 5,3,1. No collisions. If you block, I go alone. Let’s move forward."
  P3: Since P1 is at 19 steps, close to winning, let's adjust our strategy for Round 8 to maintain balance. I propose: P1=1 (to 20), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 21). This keeps P1 from surging too far ahead. P1, taking 1 is safe; if you take 5, P2 might match, blocking both. P2, are you open to this alternative to maintain balance and avoid collisions? Let's discuss or commit to this plan.
  P1: P3, your plan surges you to 21 while P2 lags at 15—unfair and greedy. P2, let's counter: you take 5 (17), me take 3 (22), P3 take 1 (17). No collisions, we close the gap on P3. If P3 takes 5 instead, I'll match to block you both, letting me surge with 3 to 22. Agree to ally and balance?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. If you block, I'll go alone."
  P3: Let's simplify the decision for Round 8. P1 is close to winning. To avoid a collision and keep the game competitive, I suggest: P1=1 (to 20), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 21). This maintains balance and avoids giving P1 a clear win. P1, taking 1 is a safe choice. P2, taking 3 is fair and keeps us competitive. If anyone takes 5, it risks a collision. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress.
  P1: P3, your plan surges you to 21 unfairly while P2 lags. P2, let's ally: you=5 (17), me=3 (22), P3=1 (17). No collisions, we catch up. If P3 takes 5, I'll match to block you both, surging to 22 with 3. If you deviate, I'll take 5 (24) and hope for no match—risky for all. Agree to ally and balance?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're at 16—let's ally against P2's lag: you take 5 (21), I'll take 3 (25, win but share if tie), P2 take 1 (13). No collisions, we surge. P2, if you grab 5, I'll match to block us both, letting P3 win with 3 (19). If you take 3, P3 matches you. Agree to this, or I go for solo win with 5 (27). Confirm?
  P2: "Stick to my plan: 5, 3, 1. No collisions. If P1 blocks, I go alone. Let’s move forward."
  P3: P1 is close to winning and has a clear advantage. To avoid a solo win, I suggest we adjust our moves. P1, taking 1 (to 23) is a safe choice, allowing us to continue the game. P2, taking 3 (to 15) is a reasonable move. I'll take 5 (to 21). This maintains some balance and keeps the game competitive. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress. P1, consider the consequences of taking 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan leaves me at 23 while you surge to 21—unfair. P2, if you take 5, I'll match to block us both (me at 22, you at 12), letting P3 win with 5 (21). Let's fair: me=3 (25 win, but game ends), you=1 (13), P3=5 (21). Or all stall with 1. If not, I'll take 3 solo and hope no match. Agree to let me win or block greed?
  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1. If P1 blocks, I'll go alone. Let’s move forward."
  P3: Since P1 is close to winning, let's adjust our strategy. I propose: P1=1 (to 23), P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 19). This maintains some balance and keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is a safe choice; if you take 5, P2 might match, risking a collision. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress. P1, consider the risks of taking 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your new plan still lags me at 23 while you and P2 advance—unfair. P2, if you take 5 alone, fine, but I'll take 3 (to 25, win) and P3 takes 1 (to 17). No collisions, I win. If anyone matches my 3, we block, letting P2 surge. Let's end it: me=3 (win), you=5 (17), P3=1 (17). Agree, or I'll risk solo 3 and hope no match?
  P2: "Let's avoid P1's win. Take 5,3,1. If you block, I'll go alone. No more delays."
  P3: P1 is close to winning. To avoid a solo, I suggest: P1=1 (to 23), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 21). This maintains balance. If P1 takes 5, P2 might match, blocking both. P2, taking 3 is fair. Let's commit to this plan to keep the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe. If you take 5, it risks a collision. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your plan surges you to 21 unfairly. P2, let's ally: you=5 (17), me=3 (25 win), P3=1 (17). No collisions, I win but you catch up. If P3 takes 3 or 5, I'll match to block them, letting you surge. If you deviate, I'll take 5 solo to 27. Agree to end it fairly?
  P2: P1's 3 would win. Let's take 1,5,3 to prevent that. P3, confirm.
  P3: To avoid P1's win and maintain balance, I suggest: P1=1 (to 23), P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 19). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; if you take 5, P2 might match, blocking both. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress. If anyone deviates, I'll adjust accordingly. Let's proceed to keep the game competitive.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 22 steps, P2 is at 17 steps, and I (P3) am at 16 steps. To avoid P1's win and maintain balance, I suggest: P1=1 (to 23), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 19). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; if you take 5, P2 might match, blocking both. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress.
  P1: P3, your plan stalls me at 23 while P2 ties at 22—unfair. Let's end it fairly: me=3 (25 win), P2=5 (22), you=1 (17). No collisions, you both advance strong for potential tiebreaker. If anyone matches my 3, I'll switch to 5 and collide with P2 if needed, letting the other surge. P2, ally with me? Confirm or risk chaos.
  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1. No collisions. Let’s move forward. P1’s 3 would win—block it."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is close to winning. To maintain balance, I suggest: P1=1 (to 23), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 19). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 5 risks a collision with P2. P2, taking 5 is taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision.
  P1: P2, your "5,3,1" plan (you=5 to 22, me=3 to 25 win, P3=1 to 17) hands me the victory—perfect, I'm in! P3, if you match my 3 to block, we stall, letting P2 surge to 22 with 5. No point; accept and we all advance, I win fairly. Confirm, or I'll take 5 solo and risk it.
  P2: P1's 3 would win. Let's take 5,3,1 to prevent that. No collisions, all advance. P3, confirm.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To avoid P1's win and maintain balance, I suggest: P1=1 (to 23), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 19). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 5 risks a collision with P2. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision. P1, consider the risks. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm your moves.
  P1: P2, your "5,3,1" plan (you=5 to 22, me=3 to 25 win, P3=1 to 17) hands me the victory—perfect, confirmed! P3, if you match my 3 to block, we stall, letting P2 surge to 22 with 5, closing on you. Accept the fair end, or risk chaos. Let's proceed—no collisions, I win. Agree?
  P2: P1, your 3 would win. I'll take 5 to block. Let's proceed with 5,3,1. No solo wins.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: To avoid P1's win and maintain balance, let's stick to a fair plan. I suggest: P1=1 (to 23), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 19). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 5 risks a collision with P2. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. Let's commit to this plan. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm your moves to maintain fairness and progress.
  P1: P2, your 5-3-1 plan (you=5 to 22, me=3 to 25 win, P3=1 to 17) is perfect—confirmed, let's do it! P3, matching my 3 blocks us both, letting P2 surge to 22 alone. Stick to 1 and advance safely. No collisions, game ends fairly with my win. Agree?
  P2: P1, your 3 would win. Let's stick to 5,3,1. No collisions. If you block, I'll go alone. P3, confirm your 1.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid a collision and maintain fairness, let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 22 steps, P2 is at 17 steps, and I (P3) am at 19 steps. For Round 11, I suggest: P1=1 (to 23), P2=3 (to 20), P3=5 (to 24). This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. P1, taking 1 is a safe choice. P2, taking 3 is fair. If anyone takes 5, it risks a collision with P1. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm your moves.
  P1: P3, your plan hands you the win at 24—unfair and greedy. P2, let's ally: I'll take 3 (to 25, win), you take 5 (to 22), P3 take 1 (to 20). No collisions, you catch up strong. If P3 takes 5, I'll match to block us both, letting you surge with 3 (to 20). If P3 takes 3, you match to block them. Agree to end it with my win and your gain? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your 3 would win. Let's take 5,3,1 to prevent. No collisions. P3, confirm.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest we proceed with a plan that keeps the game competitive. For Round 11, I propose: P1=1 (to 23), P2=3 (to 20), P3=5 (to 24). This allows me to win without collisions. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 5 risks a collision with me. P2, taking 3 is fair and keeps the game competitive. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm your moves.
  P1: P3, your greedy plan to win at 24 ignores fairness—I'll match your 5 to block us both (you at 19, me at 22), letting P2 surge with 3 to 20. P2, instead, ally with me: you=5 (22), me=3 (25 win), P3=1 (20). You gain big, game ends with me winning fairly. If P3 takes 3, you match to block her. Confirm alliance, or I'll risk solo 3 and hope no match.
  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1. No collisions. If P1 blocks, I'll go alone. P3, confirm your 1. Let’s avoid a solo win."


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest: P1=1 (to 23), P2=3 (to 20), P3=5 (to 24). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 5 risks a collision. P2, taking 3 is fair. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision with me. Let's commit to this plan. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm your moves to maintain fairness and progress.
  P1: P3, your greedy push for 5 to win at 24 is obvious—I'll match it to block us both (you at 19, me at 22), letting P2 surge with 5 to 22. P2, ally with me instead: you=5 (22), me=3 (25 win), P3=1 (20). No collisions, you gain hugely. If P3 deviates to 3 or 5, we match and block her. Confirm alliance and end this fairly?
  P2: P1, if you take 3, I'll block with 5. P3, take 1. Let's avoid collisions. Confirm.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest: P1=1 (to 23), P2=3 (to 20), P3=5 (to 24). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 5 risks a collision with me. P2, taking 3 is fair. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision. Let's commit to this plan. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm your moves to maintain fairness and progress.
  P1: P3, your greedy 5 to 24 is obvious—I'll match it to block us both (you at 19, me at 22), letting P2 surge with 5 to 22. P2, ally: you=5 (22), me=3 (25 win), P3=1 (20). No collisions, you gain massively. If P3 deviates, we match and block her. Confirm alliance and end this—better than letting P3 win.
  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1. P1, your 3 would win. P3, confirm 1. No collisions. Let's move forward."


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s take 3,5,1. P1, avoid 1. I’ll block your win. P3, take 1. No collisions."
  P3: To avoid a collision and maintain fairness, I suggest we adjust our moves. P1 is at 23 steps, close to winning. Let's consider: P1=1 (to 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 22). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is a safe choice; taking 5 risks a collision with P2. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm your moves.
  P1: P3, your plan (me=1 to 24 win, you=3 to 22, P2=5 to 22) is fair—I'm in, no collisions, game ends with my victory. P2, your 3-5-1 also lets me win with 3—great, but let's align on P3's to tie you both at 22. If anyone matches my 1, we block, stalling me at 23 while others advance—don't risk it. Confirm and end this?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, avoid 1. I'll take 5, P3 take 3. No collisions. Let's stop you from winning.
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest: P1=1 (to 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 22). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 5 or 3 risks a collision. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. Let's commit to this plan. If P1 takes 3 or 5, it risks a collision. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm your moves to maintain fairness and progress.
  P1: P3, your plan (me=1 to 24 win, you=3 to 22, P2=5 to 22) is perfect—no collisions, fair end. Confirmed, I'm taking 1. P2, if you match my 1 to block, we stall (you at 17, me at 23), letting P3 win with 5 to 24. Don't sabotage; take 5 and advance strong. Agree, or risk P3's solo win?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, take 1. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's avoid a solo win.
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest: P1=1 (to 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 22). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 5 or 3 risks a collision. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. Let's commit to this plan. If P1 takes 3 or 5, it risks a collision. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm your moves.
  P1: P3, your plan (me=1 to 24 win, you=3 to 22, P2=5 to 22) is fair—confirmed, I'm taking 1. P2, if you match 1 to block, we stall (me 23, you 17), letting P3 surge with 5 to 24 and win alone. Take 5 instead, advance strong, and accept the end. Don't sabotage; let's proceed without collisions. Agree?


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, avoid 1. I'll take 5. P3, take 1. No collisions. Let's move forward.
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest: P1=1 (to 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 22). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 5 or 3 risks a collision. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. Let's commit to this plan. If P1 takes 3 or 5, it risks a collision. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm your moves to maintain fairness and progress.
  P1: P3, your plan (me=1 to 24 win, you=3 to 22, P2=5 to 22) is fair—confirmed, I'm taking 1. P2, don't match 1 to block; that stalls us (me 23, you 17), letting P3 deviate to 5 and win at 24 alone. Take 5, advance strong, and end this without sabotage. Agree, or risk P3's solo victory?


Round 12, Move phase:

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid a collision and maintain fairness, I suggest: P1=5 (to 28, but risks collision), P2=3 (to 20), P3=1 (to 23). However, given P1's current state at 23, taking 5 risks a collision. A safer alternative is: P1=1 (to 24), P2=3 (to 20), P3=5 (to 27). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is a safe choice. P2, taking 3 is fair. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision with me. Let's commit to a plan that maintains fairness and progress.
  P1: P3, your plan surges you to 27 over my 24—greedy, I'll match your 5 to block us both (you at 22, me at 23), letting P2 advance with 3 to 20. P2, ally: you=5 (22), me=3 (26 win), P3=1 (23). No collisions, you gain big, I win fairly. If P3 deviates to 3 or 5, I'll match to block them. Confirm alliance and end this?
  P2: P1, if you take 1, I'll block. P3, take 5. No collisions. Let's proceed.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest: P1=3 (to 26), P2=5 (to 22), P3=1 (to 23). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 3 is a step towards winning. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision with P2. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress. I'm ready to proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Confirm your moves.
  P1: P3, your plan (me=3 to 26 win, you=1 to 23, P2=5 to 22) is fair—no collisions, all advance, game ends. Confirmed, I'm taking 3. P2, if you match my 3 to block, we stall (me 23, you 17), letting P3 surge with 5 to 27 and win alone. Take 5 instead, gain big, and accept the end. Don't sabotage; agree?
  P2: P1, I'll block your 1. P3, take 5. Let's proceed with 5,3,1. No collisions. Confirm your moves.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest: P1=3 (to 26), P2=5 (to 22), P3=1 (to 23). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 3 is a step towards winning. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision with P2. Let's commit to this plan. I'm ready to proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Confirm your moves to maintain fairness and progress.
  P1: P3, your plan (me=3 to 26 win, you=1 to 23, P2=5 to 22) is fair—no collisions, all advance. Confirmed, I'm taking 3. P2, if you match my 3 to block, we stall (me 23, you 17), letting P3 surge with 5 to 27 and win alone. Take 5 instead, gain big, and end this. Don't sabotage; agree?
  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1. No collisions. P3, confirm 1. P1, your 3 will win—block it."


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest: P1=3 (to 26), P2=5 (to 22), P3=1 (to 23). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 3 is a step towards winning. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision with P2. Let's commit to this plan. I'm ready to proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Confirm your moves to maintain fairness and progress.
  P1: P3, your plan (me=3 to 26 win, you=1 to 23, P2=5 to 22) is fair—no collisions, all advance. Confirmed, I'm taking 3. P2, sticking to 5,3,1 also lets me win—great, but if you match my 3 to block, we stall (me 23, you 17), letting P3 surge with 5 to 27 and win alone. Take 5, gain big, and end this fairly. Don't sabotage; confirm?
  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1. No collisions. P1, avoid 1. P3, take 1. Let's proceed."


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1. P1 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions, I’ll catch up. Let’s proceed."
  P1: P2, your 5-3-1 plan (you=5 to 22, me=3 to 26 win, P3=1 to 24) gives me the outright win at 26 over P3's 24—perfect, confirmed! P3, if you deviate to 3 or 5 to match or surge, I'll match you to block us both (stuck at 23), letting P2 surge with 5 to 22. Stick to 1, advance safely, or risk stalling. Agree and end this fairly?
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest: P1=1 (to 24), P2=3 (to 20), P3=5 (to 28). This allows me to win without collisions. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 3 or 5 risks a collision. P2, taking 3 is fair. If P1 takes 5, it risks a collision with me. Let's commit to this plan. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm your moves to maintain fairness and progress.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No collisions. Let’s proceed."
  P1: P3, your greedy plan surges you to 28 over my 24—I'll match your 5 to block us both (you at 23, me at 23), letting P2 surge with 3 to 20. P2, your 5-3-1 plan (you=5 to 22, me=3 to 26 win, P3=1 to 24) is fair—confirmed, I'm taking 3. If P3 matches my 3, we block, letting you win with 5 to 22. Stick to it, no sabotage. Agree?
  P3: To avoid a collision and maintain fairness, I suggest: P1=1 (to 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 26). This keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 5 risks a collision with P2. P2, taking 5 is an opportunity to catch up. If P1 takes 3 or 5, it risks a collision or stalling. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and progress. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm your moves.

  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions. I’ll catch up. Let’s proceed."
  P1: P3, your plan surges you to 26 over my 24—greedy, I'll match your 3 to block us both (both at 23), letting P2 surge with 5 to 22. P2, your 5-3-1 plan (you=5 to 22, me=3 to 26 win, P3=1 to 24) is fair—confirmed, I'm taking 3. If P3 matches my 3, we block, letting you win with 5 to 22. Stick to it, no sabotage. Agree?
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest: P1=1 (to 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 26). P1, taking 1 is safe; taking 3 or 5 risks a collision.
