P1 is clearly trying to bait us into colliding on 5. If P1 actually picks 1, then you safely taking 3 and me taking 5 lets us both advance without collision, and no one wins yet. If P1 lies and picks 5, we still prevent a sudden win. I'll lock 5, you lock 3\u2014it's the safest, smartest move. Ready?"}
