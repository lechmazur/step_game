Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm going with 5.  Don't get in my way.
  P2: I suggest we coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. P3 is going with 5, so I think we should both choose lower moves. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Okay, I agree with coordinating. Let's both go with 3 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: You're both fools if you think I'll actually do 5.  Good luck with 3.
  P2: P1, since P3 is clearly trying to mislead us, let's stick to our plan. I suggest we both go with 3 to ensure we advance. What do you think?
  P1: Okay P2, let's stick with 3. P3 is clearly trying to trick us.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Ha! You think you've got me figured out?  Think again.
  P2: I still believe we should stick to our plan and both choose 3. P3 is trying to confuse us. Let's ensure we make progress this round. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Okay P2, let's definitely stick with 3. P3 is just trying to mess with us.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 5 again.  Stay with 3 if you want to stay at 0.
  P2: P1, I still believe we should coordinate our moves. P3 is likely trying to mislead us again. I suggest we both go with 3 to ensure we advance this round. What do you think?
  P1: Okay P2, I agree with coordinating, but I think we should choose different numbers this round to both make progress. I'll go with 1. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Fine.  I'll go 1.  You two fight over 3.
  P2: P1, I think we should both stick to 3 this round to ensure we advance. P3 is likely trying to mislead us again. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I hear you on 3, but I'm still worried about P3 potentially going with 1 as they mentioned. Maybe one of us should consider 5?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I'll go 5.  You two can split the difference.
  P2: P1, I still believe we should both choose 3 to ensure we advance. P3 is likely trying to mislead us again. What do you think?
  P1: "P2, I'm still worried about P3 picking 1 or 5. Are you sure about 3? P2, I'm still hesitant about both of us going 3 again. P3 seems to be trying to make us collide. How about one of us considers 1 or 5 this round?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, I'll go 3.  One of you pick 1, the other pick 5.  Don't make me come back to 5 and win this thing myself.
  P2: P1, I still think we should both go with 3 to ensure we advance, especially since P3 is trying to manipulate our choices. Let's stick to our plan. What do you think?
  P1: "P2, I'm still not convinced about both of us going 3. Since you seem set on 3, I'll go with 1 this round. Let's hope P3 doesn't pick either of those."


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Okay, I'll go 1.  Go ahead and both pick 3.  I dare you.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns, but I still believe we should both go with 3 to ensure we advance this round. P3 is trying to manipulate us. Let's stick to our plan and not fall for their tricks. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I'm still not convinced about both of us going 3. Since you seem set on 3, I'll go with 5 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: Okay, I'll go 3.  Seriously.  Last chance.  One of you take 1, the other take 5.
  P2: P1, I still believe we should go with 3 to ensure we both advance. P3 is trying to manipulate us. Let's stick to our plan! What do you think?
  P1: P2, while I still have some doubts about both of us going 3, since you're set on it, I will go with 1 this round. Let's hope P3 doesn't pick either of those.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I think we should coordinate again. P3 might try to mislead us. How about we both go with 3 this round to ensure we advance? What do you think?
  P1: Okay P2, while I understand your reasoning, I'm still a bit worried about P3 potentially picking 3. How about I go with 1 this round, and you stick with 3? That way, at least one of us should advance. What do you think?
  P3: I'll go 5.  P1 go 3.  P2 go 1.  Let's get this over with.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I still believe we should coordinate our moves. I suggest we both go with 3 this round to ensure we advance. What do you think?
  P1: "P2, while I understand you want us both to go with 3, I'm still concerned about a collision. Since you seem set on 3, I'll choose 5 this round."
  P3: Okay, I'll go 1.  P1 go 3.  P2 go 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I still think we should coordinate our moves. P3 has been trying to mislead us. How about we both go with 3 this round to ensure we advance? What do you think?
  P1: P2, while I understand you want to coordinate, I'm still worried about P3. Since you seem set on 3, I'll go with 5 this round to avoid a potential collision.
  P3: Okay, I'll go 3.  P1 go 1.  P2 go 5.  Last chance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I still think we should coordinate our moves. I suggest we both go with 3 this round to ensure we advance. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I'm going with 5 this round. You stick with 3.
  P3: Okay, I'll go 5. P1 go 1. P2 go 3.  This is getting ridiculous.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, I still believe we should coordinate our moves. I suggest we both go with 3 this round to ensure we advance. What do you think? P3 seems to be trying to manipulate us.
  P1: P2, I'm still going with 5 this round to avoid a collision.
  P3: Okay, I'll go 1.  P1 go 3.  P2 go 5.  For real this time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, I still believe we should coordinate our moves. Let's both go with 3 this round to ensure we advance. What do you think? P3 seems to be trying to mislead us.
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 5 this round.
  P3: Okay, I'll go 3.  P1 go 1.  P2 go 5.  I'm not bluffing this time.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm taking 1.  P1 take 3. P2 take 5.  Let's end this now.
  P1: Okay P3, I'll go with 3. P2, how about you go with 5 this round?
  P2: P1, I suggest we both go with 1 this round to avoid a collision with P3. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you go 1, I'll switch to 5 next round and let you win.  P1, stay with 3.
  P1: "P2, I don't think we should both go with 1. P3 might be trying to trick us."
  P2: P1 and P3, I suggest we both go with 1 this round to avoid a collision and ensure at least one of us advances. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'll go 5 next round if you go 1 this round.  P1, stick with 3.
  P1: P2, while I appreciate the thought, I'm still wary of trusting P3. I'm not convinced going with 1 is safe.
  P2: P1, I still believe we should coordinate our moves to avoid a collision with P3. I suggest we both go with 1 this round to ensure at least one of us advances. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I'll go 5 next round if *you* go 3 this round. P1, go 1.  This is ridiculous.
  P1: P2, I still think going with 1 is risky given P3's unpredictable behavior. How about I go with 5 and you go with 1 this round?
  P2: P1, I still believe we should coordinate to avoid a collision. How about I go with 1 this round, and you stick with 3? This way, at least one of us should advance. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, I'll go 5 next round if you go 1 this round.  P1, go 3. This is getting silly.
  P1: Okay P2, I'll go with 3 this round. Let's see what P3 does.
  P2: P1, I still believe we should coordinate our moves to avoid a collision. How about I go with 1 this round, and you stick with 3? This way, at least one of us should advance. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P2, I'll go 5 next round if you go 5 this round.  P1, go 1.  Let's make a deal.
  P1: "Okay P2, I'll go with 1. P3, please don't pick 1 this round. P2, I'll go with 1 this round as you suggest. P3, please choose either 3 or 5."
  P2: P1, I still believe we should coordinate to avoid a collision. How about I go with 1 this round, and you stick with 3? This way, at least one of us should advance. What do you think?

  P1: "P2, given the collisions we've had, I'm going with 5 this round. What are you thinking?"
  P3: P2, go 3.  P1, go 1.  I'll take 5 and win next round.  Deal?
  P2: P1, I suggest we both go with 1 this round to avoid colliding with P3, who seems set on 5. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, I don't think P3 is actually going with 5. Let's not both pick 1. How about you go with 3, and I'll stick with 5?
  P3: P2, go 3. I'll go 5.  P1, pick 1 and I *promise* I'll let you win next round by taking 3.
  P2: P1, I think we should coordinate to avoid collisions. Since P3 seems set on 5, how about I go with 1 this round and you pick 3? This way, at least one of us should advance. What do you think?
