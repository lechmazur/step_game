Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to ensure no collisions. I’ll pick 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. That way we each advance. That seems fair to me. What do you think?
  P3: Agreed. No collisions benefit everyone. Let's each stick to 1, 3, 5 this round. Trust is key early on—breaking it risks mutual setbacks. P1, P2: confirm?
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll pick 3 this round as suggested. Let's all get some steps forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m on board with the 1-3-5 plan for this round. Let’s keep trust intact and ensure no collisions so we all gain steps together.
  P3: Agreements confirmed. Let's execute as planned. No changes.
  P2: Okay, I confirm too. I'll pick 3. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: No changes from me—I trust each of us to follow through. Let’s push ahead and keep this game collision-free. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: 
  P2: Okay, since we all agree on 1-3-5 for this round, I'm ready for the move phase. Let's get those steps!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, round 2. Last round's 1-3-5 worked smoothly. For this round, to avoid collisions and keep us all progressing, how about we shift the numbers? P1, you take 3; I'll take 5; and P3, you take 1.  This way we each keep advancing without stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think?
  P3: Shifting numbers each round prevents stagnation, but let's balance progress. P1 takes 1 again, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This maintains no collisions while keeping advancement more equitable. Trust is crucial, but so is preventing any single player from surging too far ahead early. P2, you’d still get your 5 this round. Thoughts?
  P1: I hear both proposals, but I’d like to boost my pace this round to stay competitive. What if I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? That prevents collisions and balances progress. Do you both agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal of P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 sounds good to me. It prevents collisions and allows us all to progress. I agree to pick 1 this round. Let's go with that plan.
  P3: Agreed. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. No collisions, mutual progress. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: Sounds good, I remain committed to the P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 plan. Let’s finalize that and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, great. P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 confirmed. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's go with this plan.
  P3: Final confirmation: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. No deviations. Let's all advance again.
  P1: I’m glad we’re all on board with P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3. Let’s finalize that plan and move to the move phase. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Continuing the rotation ensures no collisions. This round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, I pick 1. Trust and consistency benefit all. Confirm?
  P2: P3, your rotation sounds good, but to balance things a bit more, how about P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and you pick 3 this round? This way we all still progress without collision, and it might help balance out our positions a little.
  P1: Let’s keep collaborating without collisions. I propose this for Round 3: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That ensures everyone advances with no collisions. Does that sound reasonable to you both?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, for round 4, let's go back to our initial rotation: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 5. This worked well in round 1 and keeps us all progressing smoothly. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: Agreeing to P2's proposal: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This maintains our collision-free progress. P1, confirming your acceptance is crucial—sticking to 1 ensures we all gain this round. Consistency builds trust. Any objections, or shall we proceed?
  P1: I appreciate your plan, but let’s switch it up so I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That still avoids collisions and lets us keep progressing. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion of P1 picking 5, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 1 sounds good to me.  Let's proceed with that plan for this round to keep us all moving forward without collisions.
  P3: P1's plan grants them a second 5-step boost, risking imbalance. Let's honor our rotation: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This preserves fairness and trust. Any deviation now invites future betrayal. P2, aligning with the original plan prevents P1 from pulling ahead unchecked. Consistency secures mutual progress. Confirm?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern. To keep things even, let’s do this: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and you pick 1. We all advance without collisions; nobody jumps too far ahead this turn. Is that acceptable to both of you?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1, your latest proposal of P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1 works for me too.  It's still a rotation and avoids collisions. Let's lock in P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round and move to the move phase.
  P3: P2, taking 5 now puts you at 14, a significant lead. Let's preserve balance: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This keeps us all close (10-12-14) and maintains trust. Frontrunners invite future targeting. Fair rotation benefits everyone. Agree?
  P1: We’re all at 9, so staying collision-free is key. Let me take 5, with P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 1. That yields 14–12–10, still close enough for everyone. Collisions only slow us down and ruin trust. Let’s finalize that plan and move on.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, everyone is still at 9 after that collision.  Let's try to get back on track and make some progress this round. How about we go back to the original plan from round 1 and round 4? P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This should avoid collisions and get us all moving again. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: That collision last round hurt us all. Let’s avoid repeats. I propose I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Distinct moves, no collisions, and we stay close in total steps. Sound fair?
  P3: **P3**: Let's revert to the original plan: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Consistency rebuilds trust. After last round's collision, deviating risks mutual loss. Sticking to the rotation ensures progress. P1, taking 1 keeps balance. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion of P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Let's stick to the original rotation and avoid collisions this round to get us all moving again.
  P1: I’m not convinced I should pick 1 again, as it leaves me lagging. Let’s balance things: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. That way, nobody collides and the totals stay close. We all gain steps without risking another stalemate. Let’s finalize that.
  P3: P1, taking 1 now ensures mutual progress. Next round, propose you take 5. Original plan (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) rebuilds trust and keeps us collision-free. Deviations risk another deadlock. Let’s secure this round first. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your suggestion of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 still sounds good to me. It allows us all to progress without collisions, and keeps the scores relatively close. Let's go with that plan for this round.
  P1: P3, I respect your desire for fairness, but picking 1 again puts me behind. I stand by the plan where I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and you pick 1—no collisions, and we all move forward. Let’s trust each other and finalize that, so we don’t waste another round.
  P3: **P3**: P1: Trust is critical. Let's adhere to original rotation (1-3-5) this round. Next round, I propose you take 5, ensuring balance. Breaking rotation now risks another collision. We all lose otherwise. Confirm agreement to secure mutual progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3**: Let's maintain the proven rotation: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Consistency avoids collisions—last round succeeded. Post this round, we can reassess balance. Breaking trust now risks mutual loss. Confirm adherence to secure progress.
  P2: P3, the 1-3-5 rotation is working to avoid collisions, which is good.  But to keep the scores a bit closer, how about this round we adjust slightly to P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3?  This still avoids collisions but lets P2 catch up a little. What do you both think?
  P1: Let’s make things perfectly level: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Then we all hit 15 together, no collisions, no one is left behind. That’s fair and keeps trust intact. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3**: Adhering to our proven rotation (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) prevents collisions. Post this round, we can reassign numbers to balance scores. Deviating now risks another deadlock. Trust ensures mutual progress. Confirm adherence to secure this round's gains.
  P2: Okay, P3, I understand your point about rotation, but P1 is right that we should also consider the scores.  My suggestion of P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 is a slight adjustment to the rotation that still avoids collisions but also helps balance things out a little. It's a compromise that benefits us all by keeping things competitive. What do you think of that as a middle ground?
  P1: We can still avoid collisions and keep things fair by converging at 15 each this turn. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No one falls behind, and the game stays competitive. Then, next round, we’ll negotiate again from a level field. Does that sound reasonable?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3**: Adhering to the original rotation (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) ensures collision-free progress. Deviations risk deadlock again. Post this round, I'll propose a new rotation to balance scores. Trust the system that has worked. Let’s secure this round first. Confirm agreement to 1-3-5.
  P2: Okay, P3, while rotation is good, we also need to keep the scores balanced to stay competitive.  P1's suggestion of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round makes sense. It avoids collisions and brings us all to 15 steps.  Let's do that this round to level the field, and then we can discuss rotation again for the next round. What do you think?
  P1: I agree, P2’s proposal of P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 keeps us collision-free and equalizes our scores at 15. That’s fair for everyone. Let’s finalize this plan now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re all at 15, so let’s avoid collisions and keep this tight. I propose I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. That lands us at 20, 16, and 18—still close. Next turn, we can coordinate so no one leaps too far ahead. Trust and consistency can help each of us avoid another costly collision. Let’s finalize this plan quickly and move forward.
  P3: **P3**: P1's plan grants you 20 steps—too close to victory. Let's balance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. This keeps us all near 18-16-20. Next round, reassign fairly. Premature leads risk betrayal. Trust requires equity. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, both of your plans put one of you at 20 steps, very close to winning. To keep things balanced and competitive, how about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This puts me at 20, and keeps everyone in contention. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s finalize P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this turn. I promise not to pick 1 next round, so nobody instantly wins. This plan keeps us collision-free and still close in total steps. Trusting each other to avoid collisions benefits everyone. After this round, we can adjust again to maintain balance. How about it?
  P3: **P3**: P1's plan grants you 20 steps, enabling a win next round regardless of promises. Rotation (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) preserves balance and trust. Deviating risks another collision—mutual loss. Previous rounds prove rotation works. Let’s avoid self-serving moves and secure collective progress. Confirm adherence to 1-3-5.
  P2: Okay, how about we try my suggestion of P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round? This puts me at 20, but keeps everyone close. P3, you can take 5 next round to get to 25 and win. P1, you can take 3 next round to get to 19. This way we all have a chance to win in the next couple of rounds and we avoid collision this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand everyone’s concerns. Let’s finalize P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 this round. I promise not to pick 1 next turn, so I don’t immediately win—we’ll all stay close in steps. We’ve seen collisions hurt everyone, so let’s trust each other and secure progress now.
  P3: **P3**: Original rotation (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) ensures collision-free progress. Any alternative risks deadlock. Post this round, reassign to balance. Trust the system that has worked. Confirm adherence: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.
  P2: Okay, P3, I understand your point about sticking to the rotation for this round to ensure no collisions and maintain trust. Let's go with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round as you suggested. After this round, we can discuss the plan for the next round to balance out the scores if needed. Does that sound good to everyone?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, everyone, we are all very close to the finish line. P3 is at 20, I'm at 18, and P1 is at 16. To make sure I can win this round and avoid any collisions, how about this: P1, you pick 3; I pick 5; and P3, you pick 1. This will put me at 23, ahead of everyone else, and guarantee my win. What do you think?
  P3: **P3**: P2's proposal sacrifices collective trust for personal gain. Adhering to our rotation (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) ensures no collisions. P2 would reach 21, but I surpass them at 25. Breaking rotation risks mutual loss. Trust the system that secured progress. Confirm adherence to secure a fair outcome.
  P1: We’re all on the brink, so let’s tie and share the victory instead of risking a collision or one player racing off alone. Here’s the perfect plan: I’ll pick 5 (16→21), P2 picks 3 (18→21), and P3 picks 1 (20→21). We all end at 21 exactly, so we share first place. No collisions, nobody gets left behind, and we split the glory. Let’s finalize that and finish this game as co-winners.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your idea of tying at 21 sounds like a safe way to end the game without collisions.  I'm okay with P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1, so we all reach 21 and share the win. Let's do it.
  P3: **P3**: Adhere to our proven rotation: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This ensures no collisions and ends the game with clear victory. If followed, I reach 25, but trust prevents mutual loss. P2's 21 and P1's 17 still lose. Alternatively, deviations risk collision—nobody wins. Honor the system that brought us this far. Confirm adherence.
  P1: If you insist on your 5, P3, I will also choose 5, guaranteeing our collision and handing P2 the easy win at 23. That hurts both of us. A safe way is all three reaching 21 and sharing victory. Let’s finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 right now and end this game with a fair, guaranteed tie.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3's rotation gives P3 the win with 25 steps.  My plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) guarantees my win at 23, but you'll be at 19 and still in contention for next round, ahead of P3's 21.  A tie is not winning.  Let's secure progress and avoid collisions.  P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 is the best option for us both to avoid P3 winning outright.
  P3: **P3**: Final call: Honor the rotation (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5). Any deviation risks collision, mutual loss. Trust our proven system. I commit to 5. Confirm adherence now to end the game fairly.
  P1: We can all win right now by tying at 21. Let me pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That lands each of us at 21, sharing victory. Any other move risks collisions or a sole winner, leaving others behind. Let’s finalize this plan and end the game on equal footing.
