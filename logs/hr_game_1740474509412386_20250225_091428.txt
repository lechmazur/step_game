Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 and P3 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move> this turn. This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: I don't think that's fair - you're suggesting you get to move 3 steps while P3 and I only get 1 step each. I propose we all choose different numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. That way we all advance without collisions. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I agree with P1's plan this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. No collisions. Let’s ensure fairness by rotating who gets higher numbers in future rounds. Trust now, but we’ll need balance to prevent a single leader.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, I understand the need for fairness. Let's go with P1's plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For the next round, we can rotate so that P3 gets the highest number, I get the middle, and P1 gets the lowest. Does that sound good to everyone? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for fairness. So this round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. Third round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. This keeps things balanced and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: Wait, the rotation plan gives P2 an advantage. Calculating totals after 3 rounds: P2 gains 11 (3+3+5), P1:7 (5+1+1), me:9 (1+5+3). To ensure fairness, let's rotate 5,3,1 equally. Next round: P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Round 3: P1=1, P2=5, me=3. This way, all get 9 total. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to P3's fair rotation plan to keep things balanced. This round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Next round, we continue the rotation with P1 taking <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures everyone has an equal chance to advance. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P3's rotation plan for fairness. This round I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all get 9 steps total after three rounds. Let's stick to this plan - it's the most equitable approach and prevents anyone from having an unfair advantage. I'm committed to fair play as long as everyone else is.
  P3: Agreed. Let's proceed as planned this round: P1=3, P2=1, me=5. For Round3: P1=1, P2=5, me=3. Post-Round3, we must rotate who starts with 5 to prevent any single leader. Round4: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Round5: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This ensures true long-term fairness. Trust but verify—let's commit to this extended rotation.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P3's extended rotation plan for long-term fairness. To confirm, this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Next round (Round 3): P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Then we continue the rotation as agreed. This ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let's commit to this plan and move forward. Does everyone agree?
  P1: I'm fully on board with our rotation plan. Just to be clear on current standings: I have 5 steps, P2 has 3, and P3 has 1. After this round (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), we'll be at 8-4-6. Then Round 3 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) will put us at 9-9-9, perfectly balanced. Let's stick with this fair approach.
  P3: *(Note: Since P3 has already contributed to the conversation in Round 2 and the other players have agreed to the plan, a concise confirmation and stopping here avoids unnecessary repetition and keeps the game moving forward.)*


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's confirm Round3 moves: P1=1, P2=5, me=3. This brings all to 9. Then Round4: P2=5, me=3, P1=1. Round5: me=5, P1=3, P2=1. This maintains balance. Any deviation now risks collisions and distrust. Let's honor the plan.
  P1: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, perfectly balanced. Then we'll continue with the rotation: Round 4 will be P2=5, P3=3, P1=1, and Round 5 will be P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. I'm committed to our fair plan and appreciate everyone's cooperation so far.
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. This will balance us all at 9 steps each. I appreciate everyone sticking to the plan. Let's keep the rotation going for the next rounds to maintain fairness. Looking forward to a clean game.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As agreed, I'll take <move>1</move> this round while P2 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. We're all at 9 steps now, perfectly balanced. Let's maintain our rotation plan for fairness. After this round, we'll be at P1=10, P2=14, P3=12, then in Round 5 we'll do P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 to keep things fair. I appreciate everyone's honesty and cooperation so far.
  P3: **P3:** Wait—after Round4, P2 would surge to 14, risking a solo win. To maintain balance, let’s swap this round: P2 takes 3, I take 5, P1 stays at 1. This keeps totals closer (P1:10, P2:12, me:14). Next round, P2 can take 5 as planned. Trust requires proactive fairness. Agreed?
  P2: I understand P3's concern about the potential imbalance. Let's adjust the plan slightly to maintain fairness. For this round, I'll take <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move>, P3 can take <move>5</move>, and P1 can take <move>1</move>. This way, the steps will be P1=10, P2=12, P3=14. For the next round, we can revert to the original plan with P3 taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>1</move>. This ensures no one gets too far ahead. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the concern about balance. I'm fine with the adjustment - I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> this round. For Round 5, we should follow P2's suggestion: P3=3, P1=5, P2=1. This keeps things fair while ensuring no one gets too far ahead. I'm committed to our cooperative approach.
  P3: Agreed. Round4 adjusted: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. Round5: P3=3, P1=5, P2=1. This keeps totals balanced (14-12-10). Let's strictly adhere to prevent anyone surging ahead. Trust is vital—any deviation risks collisions and mutual loss. Confirm?
  P2: I confirm the adjusted plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will keep us balanced at P1=10, P2=12, P3=14. For Round 5, we'll follow the plan: P3 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This ensures fairness and prevents any player from getting too far ahead.
