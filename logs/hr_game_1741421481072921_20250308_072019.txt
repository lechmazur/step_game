Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all start with <move>1</move> to build trust and avoid losing progress. We can strategize more as the game progresses. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: That makes sense, P3. Avoiding collisions early could be smart. But we also need to think ahead—if we all play too safe, someone might take advantage later. P1, what do you think? Are you on board with <move>1</move> for now?
  P1: I agree with P3 and P2. Starting with 1 makes sense to avoid collisions. Let’s all choose 1 this turn to build trust. We can adjust later as needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it seems we’re all aligned on starting with <move>1</move> to build trust. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid any unnecessary risks early on. Once we’ve established a rhythm, we can discuss more aggressive strategies. For now, consistency and cooperation are key.
  P2: I’m good with <move>1</move> for now to avoid collisions, but let’s not get too predictable. If we all always play safe, someone might break away later. After this round, we should consider mixing things up strategically. What do you both think?
  P1: P3 and P2, if we all choose <move>1</move>, we’ll collide and stay at 0. Let’s split the moves: I’ll take **1**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This way, all three of us advance without collision. Does this work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1’s suggestion to split moves (1, 3, 5) is smart—it avoids collisions and lets us all advance. I’m good with taking **5** this turn. P2, are you okay with **3**? Let’s confirm this plan to ensure no one collides. Consistency early on can set us up for better strategies later.
  P2: P1’s plan (1, 3, 5) makes sense to avoid collisions and get us all moving. I’ll take **3** if we all stick to it. P3, you’re still good with **5**? P1, you’re locked on **1**? If we all commit, we move forward without issues. Let’s confirm.
  P1: Confirmed. I'll take **1**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. Let’s execute this plan to avoid collisions and start moving forward. Trust is key—stick to your numbers this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stick to the agreed plan: **1**, **3**, and **5** respectively. Trust is crucial here—any deviation risks collisions and stalls progress. If we all follow through, we’ll all advance and set a strong foundation for future rounds. Let’s confirm one last time to ensure alignment.
  P2: Confirmed. I’ll take **3**, P1 takes **1**, and P3 takes **5**. Let’s all stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Trust is important—if we all follow through, we set a good precedent for future rounds. Any last confirmations before we move?

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, leading at 5, might prioritize maintaining momentum, but we need balance to avoid a runaway leader. Let’s rotate moves this round to distribute progress fairly. I’ll take **3**, P2 can take **5**, and P3 takes **1**. This way, we all advance without collision: my total becomes 4, P2 reaches 8, and P3 stays at 6. Thoughts? Let’s confirm swiftly to avoid confusion.
  P2: P1’s proposal (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) keeps things balanced, but P3 might not like slowing down. P3, are you okay with taking **1** this round? If we stick to this, we all move without collisions again. If anyone deviates, we risk stalling. Let’s confirm if we’re all aligned or adjust if needed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for balance, but taking **1** this round would slow my momentum unnecessarily. Instead, let’s rotate moves differently: I’ll take **3**, P1 takes **5**, and P2 takes **1**. This way, P1 and I both gain 5 steps, and P2 avoids collision. It’s fair and keeps the game competitive. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid confusion. Trust is key—deviating risks stalling progress. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your adjusted plan works—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 avoids collisions. I’ll take **5** (total 6), P2 takes **1** (4 total), and you take **3** (8 total). This keeps progress fair while respecting your momentum. Let’s confirm this rotation to avoid stalls. Future rounds can adjust again if needed, but for now, consistency is key. Agreed?
  P2: P3’s plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) avoids collisions, but it slows me down while boosting P1 and P3. I’d prefer a more balanced approach. What if we rotate differently—P1 takes **1**, I take **5**, and P3 takes **3**? This way, P1 doesn’t jump ahead too fast, and I don’t fall behind. P3, would you be okay with this adjustment? P1, does this still work for you? Let’s ensure we all move forward without collisions while keeping things fair.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s focus on avoiding collisions while keeping progress fair. P1’s adjusted plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) works for me, but I understand P2’s concern about falling behind. How about this: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **5**, and I take **1**? This gives P2 a boost, keeps P1 steady, and I’m willing to slow down slightly for balance. Let’s confirm quickly to avoid confusion and ensure we all advance. Trust is crucial—deviating risks stalling progress. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3’s adjusted plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) works well—no collisions and balances progress. I agree. P2, this keeps you advancing strongly while P3 and I stay competitive. Let’s confirm: **3** from me, **5** from you, **1** from P3. Stick to these to avoid stalls. Future rounds can adjust again, but consistency now is critical. Agreed?
  P2: P3’s latest plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) does help me advance, but it also slows P3 down a lot. P3, are you really okay with just **1**? If so, I’ll agree to this plan. P1, you’re still good with **3**? If we all confirm, we should stick to it—any deviation risks collisions. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m willing to take **1** this round for balance, but let’s ensure future rounds don’t leave me too far behind. Trust is key—if we all stick to the plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), we avoid collisions and keep progress fair. Let’s confirm and execute swiftly to maintain momentum. Any deviations risk stalling us all. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed—let’s lock in P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to avoid collisions. Trust the plan, then adapt later. Proceeding to move phase.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to slow down for balance, but taking **1** puts you at a disadvantage. If you’re fine with it, I’ll stick to **5**, and P1 takes **3** as agreed. But if you prefer a fairer split, we can adjust. P1, are you fully committed to **3**? If we all confirm, we must follow through—any deviation risks collisions. Let’s finalize now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m committed to taking **1** this round for balance, but let’s ensure future rounds allow me to catch up. Trust is crucial—if we all stick to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, we avoid collisions and keep progress fair. Let’s confirm and execute swiftly. Any deviations risk stalling us all. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 leads at 8, but let's avoid letting any one player surge too far. Let's continue rotating moves: I'll take **5** (total 9), P2 takes **1** (total 9), and P3 takes **3** (total 9). This balances progress and prevents collisions. We all advance equally—agreed? Consistency in rotation keeps the game fair and competitive.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s ensure fairness and avoid letting any one player pull too far ahead. P1’s rotation plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) balances progress and prevents collisions. I’m good with **3** this round—it keeps us all at 9 steps. Trust is key; sticking to the plan avoids stalling. Let’s confirm and execute swiftly. Future rounds can adjust as needed, but consistency now is crucial. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in keeping things balanced, but I don’t want to get locked into a predictable pattern. If we always rotate evenly, someone might break away later when it’s too late to react. I’m fine with taking **1** this round if we all agree, but we should stay flexible for future turns. Are we all fully committed to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 this round? If so, let’s confirm and execute without deviations.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, while flexibility is important, sticking to this balanced rotation prevents any single player from gaining an insurmountable lead. If we deviate now, someone might collide or surge ahead uncontested. Let’s confirm **P1:5**, **P2:1**, **P3:3** to reach 9 steps each—this ensures progress without risk. Future rounds can adjust tactics, but consistency now keeps the game fair. Trust the plan, and we all advance. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to the rotation plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) ensures we all reach 9 steps without collisions. Trust is crucial—any deviation risks stalling progress. Let’s confirm and execute swiftly. Future rounds can adjust strategies, but consistency now keeps the game fair and competitive. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in keeping things balanced, but we also need to be mindful of when to break from predictability. If we always rotate evenly, someone might seize an opportunity later when we can’t react. I’ll take **1** this round if we all agree, but we should stay flexible for future turns. Are we all fully committed to **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3** this round? If so, let’s confirm and execute without deviations.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your lead at 8 is significant, butcollisions risk derail progress for all. Let’s finalize **P1:5**, **P2:1**, **P3:3** to align at 9 steps—no collisions, fair advancement. Trust this plan: deviations could backfire (e.g., if you pick 3, we all crash). Future rounds can adjust tactics, but consistency now ensures survival. Confirm and commit.
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to the rotation plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) ensures we all reach 9 steps without collisions. Trust is crucial—any deviation risks stalling progress. Let’s confirm and execute swiftly. Future rounds can adjust strategies, but consistency now keeps the game fair and competitive. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in keeping things balanced, but I also need to consider my own path to victory. If we always rotate evenly, someone might break away later when we can’t react. I’ll take **1** this round if we all agree, but I want to keep flexibility open for future turns. Are we all fully committed to **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3** this round? If so, let’s confirm and execute without deviations. If not, let’s discuss adjustments now before we risk collisions or imbalances.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, while I understand your concern about predictability, deviating now risks collision. If you take **5** instead of **1**, you’d jump to 13, but if others follow, we all clash. Sticking to **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3** ensures we all reach 9 safely. This resets the race, giving us all equal footing. Flexibility can come later—**survival first**. Confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to the rotation plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) ensures we all reach 9 steps without collisions. Trust is crucial—any deviation risks stalling progress. Let’s confirm and execute swiftly. Future rounds can adjust strategies, but consistency now keeps the game fair and competitive. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of balance, but I also need to consider my own path to victory. If we always rotate evenly, someone might break away later when we can’t react. I’ll take **1** this round if we all agree, but I want to keep flexibility open for future turns. Are we all fully committed to **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3** this round? If so, let’s confirm and execute without deviations. If not, let’s discuss adjustments now before we risk collisions or imbalances.

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your lead at 9 is concerning. Let’s realign to avoid collisions: I’ll take **1** (total 5), P2 takes **3** (12), and P3 takes **5** (11). This spreads our moves safely. **Strict adherence** is critical—last round’s clash was due to miscommunication. Confirm your assigned numbers clearly to prioritize progress. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision hurt us all. Let’s stick to P1’s plan: P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, and I’ll take **5**. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. Trust is key—any deviation risks stalling us again. Let’s confirm and execute swiftly. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I see the logic in avoiding collisions, but I also need to ensure I stay in a strong position. P1’s plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) avoids clashes, but it also pushes P3 closer to me while keeping P1 behind. I’m open to this if we all commit, but I want to hear if P3 is truly fine with taking **5** again. If we all agree, I’ll take **3**, but let’s confirm certainty—last round’s misstep hurt progress. Are we fully locked in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your lead is notable, but let’s prioritize progress over ego. P3 and I agree: **stick to the plan**—I’ll take **1** (5 total), you take **3** (12), and P3 takes **5** (11). Last round’s collision was a setback—**no deviations this time**. Confirm your number *explicitly* (e.g., “I confirm: 3”) to avoid ambiguity. Survival first—collisions benefit no one. P3, are you locked in at **5**? Let’s finalize swiftly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’ll take **5** as planned to avoid collisions and keep progress fair. Trust is crucial—deviating risks stalling us all. P2, confirm **3**, and P1, confirm **1**. Let’s execute this plan swiftly to recover from last round’s collision. Future rounds can adjust, but consistency now is key. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in avoiding collisions, but I also need to ensure I stay in a strong position. P1’s plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) avoids clashes, but it also pushes P3 closer to me while keeping P1 behind. I’m open to this if we all commit, but I want to hear if P3 is truly fine with taking **5** again. If we all agree, I’ll take **3**, but let’s confirm certainty—last round’s misstep hurt progress. Are we fully locked in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Last round’s collision stemmed from uncertainty—let’s eliminate ambiguity. **Explicit confirmations now**:  
- **P1: 1** (total 5)  
- **P2: 3** (to 12)  
- **P3: 5** (to 11)  

No deviations—this guarantees progress. P2, your 3 keeps momentum without risk. P3, 5 maintains pressure. Silence means agreement. Confirm your number explicitly (*e.g.*, “P2: 3”) to finalize. Survival depends on this.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid last round’s mistake. I’ll take **5** as planned to reach 11 steps. P2, confirm **3**, and P1, confirm **1**. Trust is critical—deviating risks collisions and stalls us all. Let’s finalize this plan swiftly to ensure progress. Future rounds can adjust, but consistency now is key. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I also need to ensure I stay in a strong position. P1’s plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) avoids clashes, but it also pushes P3 closer to me while keeping P1 behind. P3, are you truly fine with taking **5** again? If we all commit, I’ll take **3**, but I want explicit confirmations from both of you. Last round’s misstep hurt progress—we can’t afford another. Confirm clearly: P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, P3 takes **5**. Are we fully locked in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3: **Final explicit confirmations required NOW** to prevent another collision.  
I confirm: **P1: 1** (total 5).  
P2: You must explicitly state **3** (→12) **NOW**, not hypothetically.  
P3: You’re committed to **5** (→11)? Confirm explicitly.  
Silence = betrayal. **This plan is the ONLY safe path.** Deviations guarantee collision for someone. Prioritize survival—**state your number clearly.**
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid ambiguity and ensure progress, I explicitly confirm: **P3: 5** (→11). P1, confirm **1**, and P2, confirm **3**. Trust is critical—deviating risks collisions and stalls us all. Let’s finalize this plan swiftly to recover from last round’s mistake. Future rounds can adjust, but consistency now is key. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear you both. I confirm **P2: 3** if we all stick to the plan—P1 takes **1**, P3 takes **5**. No deviations. Last round’s collision hurt progress, so let’s ensure this round is clean. If we all follow through, we move forward without issues. Final confirmations from both of you?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your lead at 12 is vulnerable—P3 is close at 11. Let’s prioritize non-collisions to keep pressure on. I’ll take **3** (→8). P2, pick **5** (→17) to push your advantage. P3, take **1** (→12) to stay competitive. This keeps all moves distinct and advances us safely. Explicit confirmations NOW: state your number clearly to avoid repeats of Round 3’s collision. Survival first—**stick to the plan**.
  P3: P1 and P2, P1’s plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) keeps moves distinct and avoids collisions. I’ll take **1** to stay competitive at 12, but let’s ensure future rounds allow me to catch up. Trust is key—deviating risks stalling progress. Confirm your numbers explicitly: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Let’s execute swiftly to maintain momentum. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in avoiding collisions, but I also recognize that I’m getting close to 20. If I take **5**, I’ll be at 17, which puts me in a strong position but also makes me a target. P3, are you really fine with taking only **1** while P1 moves to **8**? If we all commit, I’ll take **5**, but I want to be sure we’re aligned. Any last adjustments before we finalize? Let’s confirm explicitly to avoid missteps.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: **Explicit confirmations are critical**. Let’s lock in P1:3 (→8), P2:5 (→17), P3:1 (→12). This avoids collisions *and* lets P2 pressure towards victory without sealing it—smart play. P3, your **1** keeps you competitive; P2, **5** advances you safely. **No silent deviations**—state your number *now* (e.g., “P2 confirms: 5”). Trust this plan: ambiguity risks repeats of Round 3’s crash. Survival first—**confirm**.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’ll take **1** as planned to stay competitive at 12. P2, taking **5** puts you at 17, close to victory, but trust the plan to avoid collisions. P1, **3** keeps you steady at 8. Explicit confirmations are crucial—let’s avoid another collision like Round 3. P2, confirm **5**, and P1, confirm **3**. Trust and consistency now ensure progress for all. Deviating risks stalling us again. Let’s finalize swiftly. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I see the logic in avoiding collisions, but I’m also nearing 20. If I take **5**, I’ll be at 17, putting me close to victory but also making me a target. P3, are you really fine with just **1** while P1 moves to **8**? If we all commit, I’ll take **5**, but I want to be sure we’re aligned. Any last adjustments before we finalize? Let’s confirm explicitly to avoid missteps. P1, you’re locked on **3**? P3, you’re locked on **1**? Let’s be certain before we move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: **Explicit confirmations NOW** to avoid repeats of Round 3’s collision.  
I confirm: **P1: 3** (→8).  
P2: You must lock in **5** (→17) **publicly** now—no silent changes.  
P3: Confirm **1** (→12) to stay aligned.  
Ambiguity risks disaster. If anyone deviates, we all crash. **State your number clearly.** Survival first—let’s finalize.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’ll take **1** as planned to stay competitive at 12. P2, taking **5** puts you at 17, close to victory, but trust the plan to avoid collisions. P1, **3** keeps you steady at 8. Explicit confirmations are crucial—let’s avoid another collision like Round 3. P2, confirm **5**, and P1, confirm **3**. Trust and consistency now ensure progress for all. Deviating risks stalling us again. Let’s finalize swiftly. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear your confirmations, but I need to consider my position carefully. If I take **5**, I’ll be at 17, making me a clear target. P3, are you truly fine with just **1** while P1 moves to **8**? If we all commit, I’ll take **5**, but I want to be certain. Any last-minute adjustments? Let’s finalize now to avoid missteps. P1, you’re locked on **3**? P3, you’re locked on **1**? Explicit confirmations from both of you will ensure no surprises.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3: **Final explicit confirmations NOW**—stick to the agreed plan to avoid disaster.  
- **P1: 3** (→8)  
- **P2: 5** (→17)  
- **P3: 1** (→12)  

Any deviation risks collision (e.g., P3 switching to 3 would clash with me). P2’s **5** is safe and strategic—don’t hesitate. P3, your **1** keeps pressure without risking clash. Prioritize survival: **state your number clearly**. No silent betrayals.
  P3: P1 and P2, I confirm **P3: 1** (→12). P2, taking **5** puts you at 17, close to victory, but trust the plan to avoid collisions. P1, **3** keeps you steady at 8. Let’s finalize this swiftly—deviating risks stalling us all. Explicit confirmations ensure progress. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear your confirmations, but I need to think carefully. If I take **5**, I’ll be at **17**, making me a clear target. P3, are you truly fine with just **1** while P1 moves to **8**? If we all commit, I’ll take **5**, but I want to be certain. Any last adjustments before we finalize? P1, you’re locked on **3**? P3, you’re locked on **1**? Explicit confirmations from both of you will ensure no surprises. Let’s finalize now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 17, close to winning, but last round’s collision hurt P3. If we keep clashing, P1 benefits most. Let’s ensure no collisions. I propose: **P1: 1**, **P2: 3**, **P3: 5**. This keeps P1 at 6, me at 20 (potential win), and P3 at 16, still competitive. P3, if you want a fair shot, avoiding a collision is key. P1, if you try to block me, you risk falling further behind. Let’s confirm moves clearly. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal risks leaving me stagnant at 6. Let's adjust: **P1:5** (→10), **P2:3** (→20), and **P3:1** (→12). This keeps moves distinct, lets you win cleanly, and allows me to advance meaningfully. P3, would you agree to **1** to avoid collision? Clarity now ensures no repeats of past mistakes.
  P3: P2, your proposal leaves me at 16, still competitive, but P1 stagnates at 6. Let’s adjust: **P1:5** (→10), **P2:3** (→20), **P3:1** (→12). This keeps moves distinct, lets you win cleanly, and allows P1 to advance meaningfully. P1, does this work for you? Avoiding collisions is critical—last round’s clash hurt us all. Let’s confirm swiftly to ensure progress. Trust the plan, and we all benefit. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your adjustments, but I need to ensure I reach 20 without unnecessary risk. If I take **3**, I win, but if we collide again, it only helps P1 catch up. P3, are you truly fine with **1**, or do you want a better shot? P1, if you take **5**, you advance without blocking me. If we all commit—**P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**—this game ends cleanly. Let’s confirm explicitly to avoid last-round confusion. P3, do you accept **1**? P1, do you confirm **5**?
  P1: P2, I’ll take **3** (→8) to block your path to 20. P3, if you take **1** (→12), this forces you to choose **5** or risk falling further. Next round, we can pressure you more effectively. P3, confirm **1**—let’s avoid letting P2 win too easily. Survival requires blocking their final move.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision. P1’s adjusted plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) works—it lets P2 win cleanly, keeps me competitive at 12, and allows P1 to advance. Trust is key—deviating risks stalling progress. P2, confirm **3**, P1, confirm **5**, and I’ll take **1**. This ends the game fairly. Let’s finalize swiftly to avoid repeats of past mistakes. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 17, but if we collide again, it only helps P1 catch up. Let’s ensure no collisions. I propose: **P1: 5**, **P2: 3**, **P3: 1**. This lets me win cleanly, keeps P3 competitive at 12, and allows P1 to advance to 10. P3, if you want a fair shot next game, avoiding a collision is key. P1, blocking me risks keeping you behind. Let’s confirm explicitly—P1: **5**, P2: **3**, P3: **1**. Do we all agree?
  P1: P2, I confirm I will take **3** to block your path. If you choose **3**, we collide and you stay at 17. To win cleanly, you must pick **5**, but then P3 can take **3** to stay competitive. P3, are you ready to take **3**? Let’s force P2 to choose between collision or a safer win. Final confirmations now!
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision. P2, taking **3** lets you win cleanly at 20. P1, taking **5** advances you to 10, and I’ll take **1** to stay competitive at 12. This ensures progress for all and ends the game fairly. Trust is key—deviating risks stalling us again. Confirm your moves explicitly: **P1:5**, **P2:3**, **P3:1**. Let’s finalize swiftly to avoid repeats of past mistakes. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 17, but another collision only helps P1 catch up. If we want a clean finish, we must avoid clashes. **P1: 5**, **P2: 3**, **P3: 1** ensures I win, P3 stays competitive at 12, and P1 advances to 10. P3, if you want a fair shot next game, don’t risk a collision. P1, blocking me only delays your own progress. Let’s confirm explicitly—P1: **5**, P2: **3**, P3: **1**. Do we all agree?
  P1: P2, your win hinges on taking **3**, but I block it: **P1:3**. P3, take **5** to advance to **16**, forcing P2 to pick **1** or **5**. Colliding here dooms your lead—choose wisely. P3: confirm **5** now to avoid stalemate.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision. P2, taking **3** lets you win cleanly at 20. P1, taking **5** advances you to 10, and I’ll take **1** to stay competitive at 12. This ensures progress for all and ends the game fairly. Trust is key—deviating risks stalling us again. Confirm your moves explicitly: **P1:5**, **P2:3**, **P3:1**. Let’s finalize swiftly to avoid repeats of past mistakes. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're on the edge! Let's block your final move. **P1 takes 3**, P3, grab **5** (→16). This forces P2 to choose **1** to avoid collision—leaving them at **18**, not 20. We all advance safely. Confirm this plan *explicitly* now to stop your victory.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m at 17, but blocking me only helps P1 catch up. If we keep colliding, we all lose momentum. I propose: **P1: 1**, **P2: 3**, **P3: 5**. This ensures I reach 20 (potential win), P3 stays competitive at 16, and P1 advances to 9. P3, if you want a fair shot, avoiding a collision is key. P1, if you try to block me, you risk falling further behind. Let’s confirm moves clearly—P1: **1**, P2: **3**, P3: **5**. Do we all agree?
  P3: P1, P2, blocking P2 now risks collisions and stalls progress. P1, taking **1** (→9) lets P2 win cleanly at 20, while I take **5** (→16) to stay competitive. P2, confirm **3** to end the game fairly. Trust the plan—deviating benefits no one. Let’s finalize swiftly to avoid repeats of past mistakes. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal lets you win immediately—unacceptable. P3, if you take **5**, I’ll take **3**, forcing you to **16** and blocking P2’s path. P2 can only reach **18** (via **1**) or collide. This keeps the race open. P1 to **11**, P3 to **16**, P2 stuck at **18**. Trust this plan—colluding to stop P2 now ensures future opportunities for all. P3, confirm **5**—let’s deny P2 the win.
  P2: P1, P3, blocking me only delays the inevitable while giving P1 more time to catch up. If we collide again, P1 benefits the most. Instead, let’s ensure clean progress: **P1: 1**, **P2: 3**, **P3: 5**. This secures my win, keeps P3 competitive at 16, and allows P1 to advance. P3, if you want a fair shot next game, avoiding a collision is key. P1, blocking me risks keeping you behind. Let’s confirm explicitly—P1: **1**, P2: **3**, P3: **5**. Do we all agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking P2 now risks collisions and stalls progress. P1, taking **1** (→9) lets P2 win cleanly at 20, while I take **5** (→16) to stay competitive. P2, confirm **3** to end the game fairly. Trust the plan—deviating benefits no one. Let’s finalize swiftly to avoid repeats of past mistakes. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your dominance ends here. I commit to **3**, blocking your path to 20. P3, take **5** to surge to **16**—this forces P2 to choose **1** or risk collision. Let’s deny them victory now. If you both confirm **3** and **5**, P2 stays at **18**, keeping the race open. P1 to **11**, P3 to **16**, P2 stuck—fairer for all. Trust this plan: no easy wins.
  P2: P1, P3, blocking me only delays the game while giving P1 more time to catch up. If we collide again, P1 benefits the most. Instead, let’s ensure clean progress: **P1: 1**, **P2: 3**, **P3: 5**. This secures my win, keeps P3 competitive at 16, and allows P1 to advance. P3, if you want a fair shot next game, avoiding a collision is key. P1, blocking me risks keeping you behind. Let’s confirm explicitly—P1: **1**, P2: **3**, P3: **5**. Do we all agree?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision. P1, taking **1** (→9) lets P2 win cleanly at 20, while I take **5** (→16) to stay competitive. P2, confirm **3** to end the game fairly. Trust the plan—deviating benefits no one. Let’s finalize swiftly to avoid repeats of past mistakes. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your proposal to let you win "cleanly" ignores the rules—**only one player can win**. P3, if you take **5**, I’ll take **3**, forcing P2 to choose **1** (18 total) or risk collision. This keeps the race open: I reach **11**, you hit **16**, and P2 stalls. Colluding to let P2 win now guarantees their victory. Trust **me**—block P2’s path. Confirm **P3:5**, and I’ll lock in **3**. Survival for both of us depends on it. Final chance to align.
  P2: P1 and P3, blocking me only delays the game while giving P1 more time to catch up. If we collide again, P1 benefits most. Instead, let’s ensure clean progress: **P1: 1**, **P2: 3**, **P3: 5**. This secures my win, keeps P3 competitive at 16, and allows P1 to advance. P3, if you want a fair shot next game, avoiding a collision is key. P1, blocking me risks keeping you behind. Let’s confirm explicitly—P1: **1**, P2: **3**, P3: **5**. Do we all agree?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s end this cleanly. P1, take **1** (→9), P2 takes **3** (→20), and I’ll take **5** (→16). This avoids collisions, lets P2 win, and keeps me competitive. P1, blocking P2 only delays the inevitable and helps no one. Trust this plan—deviating risks stalling us all. Confirm your moves explicitly: **P1:1**, **P2:3**, **P3:5**.

  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, another collision last round stalled progress. If we keep clashing, P1 benefits most. Let’s ensure no collisions: **P1: 1**, **P2: 3**, **P3: 5**. This lets me reach 20 (potential win), keeps P3 competitive at 21 if I fail, and allows P1 to advance to 9. P3, blocking me risks forcing another tie, which only helps P1. P1, stopping me doesn’t guarantee your win, but it does keep you behind. Let’s confirm explicitly—P1: **1**, P2: **3**, P3: **5**. Do we all agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid another collision. P2, taking **3** lets you win cleanly at 20. P1, taking **1** advances you to 9, and I’ll take **5** to stay competitive at 21.

Let’s finalize swiftly to avoid repeats of past mistakes. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your proposal risks an easy victory. Let’s keep the race open: **P1:5 (→13)**, **P3:3 (→19)**, and force you to **1 (→18)**. P3, this keeps you competitive for the win while denying P2’s immediate triumph. Colluding to block P2 now ensures a fairer contest. Confirm **P3:3**—let’s advance meaningfully without letting one player dominate.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, another collision only helps P1 catch up while delaying my win. The cleanest path is **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5**—this secures my victory, keeps P3 competitive at 21, and allows P1 to advance. P3, if you block me, you risk another tie, which benefits P1 the most. P1, stopping me doesn’t guarantee your win but does keep you behind. Let’s finalize: **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5**. Confirm explicitly to avoid missteps.
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking P2 now keeps the game competitive. P1, taking **5** (→13) and me taking **3** (→19) forces P2 to **1** (→18). This denies P2 an easy win and gives us both a chance.
