Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone, good luck! Let's keep it friendly and avoid collisions early on. I'll pick something safe this round.
  P2: I’m open to avoiding collisions, but we need to coordinate carefully. Let’s each try to pick different moves so all of us advance. Any thoughts on how we can ensure no one clashes this round?
  P1: I agree, coordinating to avoid collisions is smart for an early boost. Let's each pick a different move this round. I'm leaning towards 3. What about you, P2 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, P1 is leaning towards 3. I'll pick 1 then. P2, you okay with taking 5? This way we all advance safely.
  P2: I’m fine taking 5 if that’s our plan. If we all choose different numbers this round, we’ll each advance safely. Let’s trust each other and see how it goes.
  P1: Great plan, everyone—P3 on 1, P2 on 5, and I'll stick with leaning towards 3. Let's build trust early and avoid collisions. Ready to move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good. Let's stick to the plan—P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, I'll take 1. Good luck!
  P2: I’m still in. Let’s finalize our plan: P1 on 3, P3 on 1, and I’ll take 5. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Confirming the plan: I'll stick with 3, P3 on 1, P2 on 5. Let's build trust and avoid early collisions for mutual benefit. Ready to move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Nice job everyone—trust paid off! Let's keep coordinating clearly. This turn, I'd prefer to pick 5 to catch up a bit. Are you both comfortable picking different numbers?
  P2: P3, you can take 5 this time. I’ll choose 3, assuming P1 is okay taking 1 again. Let’s avoid collisions and keep everyone advancing.
  P1: To keep things fair and maintain trust, I suggest a new plan: P3 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This would put us all at 6 steps, avoiding any one player pulling ahead too much. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your suggestion makes sense for balance. I'm okay with your plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. P2, would you be comfortable with this arrangement?
  P2: I’m okay with taking 1 this round to keep things balanced. Let’s finalize that plan: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I’ll go 1. We all end up tied at 6, and we’ll keep options open for next time. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan for this round: P3 on 5, I on 3, P2 on 1. This keeps us balanced and builds trust for future turns. I'm committed to cooperation for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed—plan confirmed: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's keep the momentum going. Good luck!
  P2: I’m on board with the plan: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. We’ll all move up to 6 steps. Let’s keep coordinating smoothly.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll stick to picking 3 as per our plan to keep us balanced at 6 steps. Let's maintain this trust and discuss adjustments for the next round if needed.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great teamwork so far! To keep things fair and rotating, how about this round P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1? That way, we continue building trust and everyone gets a chance at each number. Thoughts?
  P2: P3’s idea sounds good. I’m okay taking 3 while P1 takes 5 and you go 1, P3. That keeps our rotation fair. Then next round, we can switch it up again so everyone gets to use each move. Let’s keep building trust and avoid clashes for now.
  P1: Agreed, P3's rotation plan works for me: I'll take 5, P2 on 3, and P3 on 1. This keeps things fair and advances us all. Let's maintain trust and discuss adjustments for the next round if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Perfect, glad we're all aligned. Plan confirmed: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. Good luck!
  P2: Sounds good. I’m set on picking 3 this round, trusting that P1 will stick to 5 and P3 to 1. Let’s finalize this and avoid any collisions. After we see the results, we can talk about the next rotation plan.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll stick to picking 5 this round as per our agreement. Trust is key to avoiding collisions and keeping the game fair. After this, we can discuss the next rotation to ensure balance.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great teamwork so far! To maintain trust and keep advancing, I suggest this round: P3 takes 5 to close the gap, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. That puts us at P3:12, P1:14, P2:10—still balanced but progressing. Thoughts on this plan?
  P3: Thanks for considering my position, P1. I appreciate the chance to catch up a bit. I'm good with your suggestion—I'll pick 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. P2, are you comfortable with this arrangement?
  P2: Sure, I’m comfortable taking 1 this round so we all keep advancing smoothly. However, I’d like the chance to pick 5 next turn to stay competitive. Would you both be okay with that plan going forward?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, P2—I'm glad you're comfortable with taking 1 this round to keep us advancing smoothly. Your request to pick 5 next turn is reasonable, and I'm okay with it in principle, but let's reassess after this round to ensure fairness and avoid conflicts. For now, let's stick to the plan: P3 on 5, me on 3, you on 1. Building trust remains key.
  P3: Agreed, let's stick to the current plan for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Next round, we'll revisit your request, P2, and try to keep everything fair. Good luck!
  P2: I’m ready to finalize our plan this round. I’ll take 1, with P3 taking 5 and P1 taking 3. Next round, I’d like to pick 5 so I can stay competitive. Let’s trust each other and avoid collisions. Are we all agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to this round's plan: P3 on 5, I on 3, P2 on 1. It keeps us advancing without collisions. For next round, P2, I'll consider your request to pick 5, but let's reassess after seeing the results to ensure fairness. Building trust is still key.
  P3: Agreed, let's lock in our current plan for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. After we see the results, we can discuss next round's moves and make sure everyone stays competitive. Good luck!
  P2: I’m still on board with our plan this round: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Next turn, as we discussed, I’d really appreciate taking 5 so I can keep pace. Let’s trust each other and keep avoiding collisions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’d like to pick 5 this turn, as we discussed. That helps me catch up without hurting anyone else. Maybe P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, so we avoid collisions and all advance. I’m open to ideas, but I really want 5 this round. Let me know if you’re both okay with that plan.
  P1: Agreed, P2—I'm fine with you taking 5 to catch up, I'll stick with 3, and P3 on 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P3, what do you think? Let's confirm the plan quickly for smooth progress.
  P3: I'm fine with this arrangement: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid collisions. Confirmed from my side.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks for agreeing to let me take 5 this round. I appreciate you both helping me catch up. Let’s finalize our plan for this turn: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Once we see the results, we can discuss next steps to keep the competition fair for everyone. Any final thoughts before we lock it in?
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—I'm sticking with picking 3 this round as planned, to keep us advancing without collisions. Your cooperation is appreciated, and it maintains trust. After this turn, with scores shifting, we should discuss endgame strategies to avoid ties or conflicts. Ready to proceed.
  P3: Agreed, let's lock it in: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, I'll take 1. After this round, let's openly discuss how to keep the game competitive and fair as we approach the endgame. Trust remains key. Ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m happy we’re aligned. Let’s finalize: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Our cooperation has paid off so far, so let’s keep building trust and avoid collisions. After we see this round’s results, we can regroup and decide our strategies for the next turn. Good luck!
  P1: Confirmed, I'll stick to picking 3 this round as agreed, ensuring we all advance without collisions. With the endgame approaching, we should discuss strategies post-move to avoid ties or conflicts, perhaps prioritizing balanced progression. Trust remains crucial. Ready to proceed.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll pick 1 this round as agreed. After seeing the results, let's openly discuss next round's moves carefully, since we're nearing the endgame. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've cooperated well so far, but we're nearing the endgame. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I'd like to take 5 this round to catch up a bit. Perhaps P1 can take 1 and P2 takes 3? That way we all advance safely again. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but with me at 17 steps, taking only 1 feels risky for my position. How about a fairer plan: I take 3, you take 1, and P2 takes 5? This lets P2 catch up and keeps us advancing without collisions. P2, what do you think? Let's discuss to maintain trust.
  P2: I’m okay with your idea, P1. I’ll pick 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps us moving without collisions. P3, are you still on board with picking 1 this turn? Let’s finalize quickly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your concern is understandable, but I've already taken 1 twice in a row. To keep things fair, I'd prefer taking 5 this round. You still maintain a lead even if you pick 1 this turn. P2, would you be okay with picking 3 instead? Let's ensure everyone stays competitive and avoids collisions.
  P1: P2, you already agreed to my suggestion: I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing fairly. P3, I understand your frustration, but I've cooperated consistently. Let's stick to the plan for trust's sake and discuss adjustments after this round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but I’m also trying to keep up with P1. If you let me take 5 this round, I’ll support you taking 5 next time so we both stay competitive. P1 remains in a strong spot, so sticking to P1=3, me=5, and you=1 seems best for us all. Let’s trust each other again and avoid collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, I'll trust you both once more and take 1 this round. But next round, I expect your support for me picking 5 to stay competitive. Let's finalize: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. Good luck!
  P1: Agreed, P3—I'll stick to picking 3 this round as planned, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Your trust is valued, and it keeps the game fair. For next round, with us nearing 23, let's openly discuss strategies to avoid ties or conflicts. P2, thoughts on balancing our moves?
  P2: I’m committed to picking 5 this round as we discussed. That should bring me to 20 steps, tying with P1. Next round, let’s coordinate carefully so we don’t collide and sabotage our progress. P3, we won’t forget your request to pick 5 soon. For now, let’s finalize: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: After P3's betrayal last round, trust is broken, and I'm focusing on my win. I might pick 5 to pull further ahead. P2 and P3, what are you planning? Let's discuss briefly to see if we can avoid collisions, but I'm prioritizing my position now. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I understand you're upset, but last round I had clearly requested to pick 5 and you both insisted otherwise. I had to protect my position. I'm open to coordinating again this round to avoid further collisions. If you're planning on 5, let me know clearly—I'll choose differently. P2, what's your intention?
  P2: P1 is poised to win by picking 5. Let’s not allow that. P3, if we both pick 5, then if P1 also picks 5 we block them completely, and if P1 picks anything else, we both gain 5 steps and catch up. It’s our best shot to stay in the race. Are you in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your alliance with P3 is misguided—if you both pick 5 and I choose differently, you collide and I advance to win easily. I'm committed to picking 5 this turn to secure victory. P3, as you offered, please select a different number to avoid conflict. P2, think twice before blocking me unnecessarily. Let's avoid mutual destruction.
  P3: P2, P1 makes a valid point. If we both pick 5 and collide while P1 picks differently, we lose our chance to catch up. Let's reconsider carefully. I'm open to picking 3 instead if you can commit clearly to a different number. Let’s avoid mutual destruction and keep our chances alive.
  P2: P3, let’s coordinate to block P1. I’ll pick 5, you pick 3. Then if P1 tries 5, they collide with me; if they try 3, they collide with you. They could pick 1 instead, but that won’t let them win. Let’s keep P1 from crossing 23.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2's alliance proposal is risky for you—if you pick 3 and he takes 5, he closes the gap more than you do. Better to pick 5 yourself to maximize your gain, even if it causes a collision with him. I'm actually leaning towards picking 1 this turn to avoid conflict. Let's discuss quickly to prevent mutual losses.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be clear: collisions now only help whoever isn't involved. P1, if you truly consider picking 1, I'll pick 5 to advance safely. P2, reconsider carefully—colliding with P1 or me doesn't help you catch up. Let's avoid mutual destruction and keep the game competitive.
  P2: Time is short. Let’s force a block. I’ll pick 3, P3 picks 5. That way, if P1 picks 3, they collide with me; if they pick 5, they collide with P3; if they pick 1, they only reach 21. This guarantees P1 doesn’t win now and gives us another turn to catch up. Are you in, P3?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let’s force a double block again. I’ll pick 3, you pick 5. Then if P1 chooses 3, they collide with me, and if they choose 5, they collide with you. If they pick 1, they only move to 22 and don’t win yet. We’ll have another round to catch up. Let me know if you’re on board.
  P3: P2, your logic is solid. Let's stick to your suggestion—I pick 5, you pick 3. P1, your best move is picking 1 again to avoid collision. Let's lock it in clearly and avoid surprises.
  P1: P3, your agreement with P2 is risky—if I pick 5 and you do the same, we collide, and P2 advances unchallenged. I'm leaning towards picking 5 to protect my lead. Consider switching to 1 or 3 to avoid stalling. P2, think twice before relying on this block. Let's discuss to prevent mutual losses.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s finalize the block strategy again. I’ll pick 3, you pick 5. That way, if P1 picks 3, they collide with me; if they pick 5, they collide with you; if they pick 1, they only reach 22. This keeps them from winning and gives us another turn to catch up. Let’s do it.
  P3: P1, choosing 5 now is clearly risky for you, as I'm firmly committed to 5 and a collision would stall us both, letting P2 catch up. Your safest bet is to pick 1 again and reach 22, keeping your lead intact. P2, our plan is solid—I pick 5, you pick 3. Let's finalize this clearly and avoid surprises.
  P1: P3, sticking to 5 is risky—if I pick 5 too, we collide and both stall while P2 advances to 21. I'm seriously considering 5 to protect my lead and win. Switch to 3 or 1 to avoid mutual loss. P2, your block strategy might backfire if we conflict. Let's rethink for a better outcome.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, our double-block plan still makes sense. If I signal 3 and you signal 5, P1 risks colliding no matter whether they choose 3 or 5. Picking 1 only gets them to 22, giving us another turn to catch up or surpass. P1, if you truly want to avoid collisions, you know your safest option. Let’s not overthink this. I’m ready to stick to our proposed plan if you are, P3.
  P3: P1, picking 5 is guaranteed collision with me—stalling us both and letting P2 catch up. Your safest move is clearly 1. P2, our strategy is set and solid—I'll stick to 5, you stick to 3. Let's avoid surprises and finalize this clearly.
  P1: P3, your commitment to picking 5 risks mutual collision if I do the same, stalling both of us while P2 advances unchecked. That's bad for you and me. I'm seriously considering picking 5 to protect my lead. Let's rethink this—switch to 1 or 3, and I'll adjust accordingly to avoid destruction. P2, don't rely on their plan; it could backfire.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re both at 21. If we collide again, we risk letting P3 catch up. I’d like to pick 5 safely. P1, please don’t pick 5; choose 1 or 3 so we don’t stall. P3, you’re still in this—if you avoid my move, you’ll stay close. Let’s coordinate to avoid more collisions and keep all our winning chances alive.
  P1: P2, your plea to avoid 5 is weak—I'm seriously considering picking 5 to win at 26. If you collide with me, we both stall, and P3 could sneak ahead. P3, don't think about 5 either; it might cause a mess. Let's be smart and discuss alternatives quickly to prevent anyone from losing out.
  P3: P1 and P2, you both risk collision by picking 5, which would stall you at 21. I'm behind at 18, so I have nothing to lose by choosing 5 again. Consider carefully—if either of you picks 5, we collide, and the other advances safely. Your best chance is to avoid 5 and pick smaller numbers, giving yourselves room to win next round. Let's be smart and avoid mutual destruction.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let’s be practical. If we both try 5, we collide and stall at 21 while P3 gains ground. Isn’t it better for at least one of us to move forward normally? I’m inclined to push hard, but I’d rather avoid another collision—and I’m sure you would too. P3, you’re still behind, so I get your gamble, but colliding with me doesn’t help you win either. Let’s each choose carefully to avoid stalling, so we all keep a shot at victory. If we cooperate, there’s still a fair chance to outmaneuver each other next turn. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your insistence on picking 5 risks colliding with me or P2, stalling you further while the other advances. P2, if I pick 3 and you avoid it, I win—don't make a mistake by colliding. I'm leaning towards 3 to secure victory. Let's think carefully to avoid mutual destruction and keep options open for the next round. What are your final thoughts?
  P3: P1, choosing 3 is risky because P2 might think similarly and collide with you, stalling you both at 21. P2, consider carefully—if you both pick 3, you hand me a chance to catch up. I'm strongly considering choosing 5 again, as I have little to lose. Your safest bet is to pick 1 to guarantee advancement without collision. Let's all choose wisely to avoid mutual destruction.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid collisions, let’s finalize distinct choices that let us all advance: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. That way, P1 ends up at 22, I reach 24, and P3 gets 23. No one stalls, and we stay fair. Trust this plan so we don’t sabotage ourselves again. Deal?
  P1: P2, your plan clearly favors you winning at 24, and I'm not falling for it. I'm leaning towards picking 5 to secure victory at 26. P3, if you pick 5 too, we collide and stall while P2 advances—bad for both of us. Better for you to pick 1 or 3. Let's avoid mutual destruction and discuss quickly.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be realistic: collisions now only help whoever stays clear. I'm committed to picking 5 again this round—I've got nothing to lose. If either of you also picks 5, we stall together, and the third player advances easily. Consider carefully to avoid mutual destruction.
