Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and reach 23 first. Strategy matters—trust me, I’ll aim for 5. Others, pick 3 or 1 to spread out."
  P2: If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward—no one gets blocked. I’ll take 3 this round if P1 sticks to 5. P3, can you go with 1? Let’s avoid early collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I take 5. No collisions, quick progress. Trust the strategy—focus on advancing without blocking each other."
  P2: P3, if you go with 1 this round, we all move safely and make progress. No one gets blocked, and we can reassess next round. Let’s keep things smooth early on—aggression too soon just slows us all down.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2, stick to 3. I'll take 5. No collisions—let's move forward. Trust the plan.
  P2: P3, silence isn’t helping—if you want to avoid early conflict, just say you’ll take 1. Otherwise, we might assume you’re aiming for 3 or 5, and that risks collisions. Let’s all move forward cleanly this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2, stick to 3. No collisions—let's move forward. Trust the plan.
  P2: P3, your silence is making this harder than it needs to be. If you’re aiming for 1, just say so—we all benefit. If you don’t respond, I might have to assume you’re picking 3 or 5, and that risks a collision. Let’s be smart and move forward together.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2, stick to 3. I'll take 5 again. No collisions—steady progress. Let's keep moving forward.
  P2: P3, thanks for going with 1 last round—it worked perfectly. If we repeat the same pattern (P1: 5, me: 3, you: 1), we all keep moving fast without blocking each other. Let’s keep the cooperation going—no surprises, just progress.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Same strategy: 5, 3, 1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's keep moving forward together."
  P2: P3, appreciate you going with 1 last round—it helped us all. Let’s keep the same setup: P1 does 5, I take 3, you go with 1. We all gain again, no collisions. Simple and effective. Stay the course?
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, stick to 1. P2, keep 3. I'll take 5 again. Consistent moves ensure no collisions. Let's keep the momentum—trust the plan. If we all advance, we’ll reach 23 faster. No need for surprises.
  P2: P3, we’ve all benefited from cooperation so far. If you stick with 1 again, we all move forward cleanly. If you change it up without warning, we all risk collisions and get stuck. Let’s not waste turns—confirm you're on 1 again?
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, consistency accelerates progress. Stick to 1—no collisions, steady gains. Let’s keep the rhythm: 5,3,1. Your 1 again? Let’s not waste turns.
  P2: P3, silence again? If you're still with us on this plan, just confirm you're taking 1. Otherwise, we’re forced to guess—and that’s when collisions happen. We all advanced last round. Let’s not break what’s working.
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I went with 5 last round because P3 stayed silent, and I couldn’t risk a collision on 3. But that slowed me down. If P3 won’t communicate, we can’t rely on them sticking to 1. Maybe it’s time we adapt—if P1 and I split the high numbers (3 and 5), and let P3 risk collision with 1, we control the pace. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your 5 last round caused a collision. Let's reset: I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. No blocks—trust the plan.
  P3: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I get your point, but with P3 staying silent, there’s no guarantee they’ll keep picking 1. If we keep assuming they’ll cooperate, we risk more collisions. I’ll take 5 this time—if you go with 3, we avoid each other, and P3 can gamble with 1 again. Let’s not let silence dictate our strategy.
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2, stick to 3. No collisions—trust the plan. If we all advance, we reach 23 faster. Don’t let uncertainty derail us.
  P3: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I hear you—but blind trust in P3’s silence isn’t a strategy. If you want to avoid a collision with me, take 3 this round and let me take 5. We both move forward safely, and P3 can keep gambling with 1 if they want. Let’s adapt before we fall behind.
  P1: P2, stick to 3. P3, confirm 1. No collisions—trust the plan. Let’s move forward.
  P3: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I’ve tried coordination, but P3’s silence makes that risky. If you insist on 5 again, we risk repeating the collision from last round. I’m going with 5 this time—your safest move is 3. Let P3 keep gambling with 1 if they want, but we can avoid each other and keep advancing.
  P1: P2, split 5/3 to avoid collision. P3, take 1. Trust the plan—no blocks, steady progress. Let’s not let silence derail us.
  P3: 


Round 3, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, we avoided collision last round by splitting 5/3—let’s keep that going. I’ll take 5 again, you take 3, and P3 can keep risking 1 if they want. We can’t rely on silence, but we can control our own moves. Let’s keep advancing without blocking each other.
  P1: P2, stick to 3; P3, confirm 1 again. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s not let uncertainty derail us. If we all advance, we’ll reach 23 faster. Trust the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, last round worked—no collision, both of us advanced. I’ll stick with 5 again if you take 3. P3’s silence means we can’t count on them, but if they keep picking 1, great. If not, it’s their risk. Let’s keep our momentum—split 5/3 and keep moving.
  P1: P2, stick to 3. P3, confirm 1. No collisions—trust the plan. If not, I’ll adjust to avoid blocking. Let’s move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, we’ve both advanced by splitting 5 and 3—let’s stick with that. I’ll take 5 again, you go 3. P3’s silence means they’re likely to keep picking 1, but if they switch, that’s their risk. We control our progress if we avoid each other. Let’s not let uncertainty slow us down now.
  P1: P2, I'll take 3. P3, confirm 1. No collisions—let's keep moving forward. If we stick to this, we all advance. Don’t let uncertainty slow us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, glad we’re aligned—I'll take 5 again, you take 3. We both advance, no collision. P3’s silence suggests they’ll keep picking 1, but even if they don’t, it doesn’t affect us. Let’s keep our lead and stay in control.
  P1: P2, stick to 3. P3, confirm 1 or risk collision. No time for uncertainty—let’s move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm 1 again. P2, stick to 5. No collisions—let’s keep moving forward. Don’t let silence derail us. Trust the plan.
  P2: P1, glad we’re on the same page—I'll take 5 again, you take 3. We’ve avoided collisions and kept pace this way. P3’s silence likely means they’ll keep picking 1, but either way, it doesn’t block us. Let’s stay consistent and keep pulling ahead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm 1 or I'll adjust to avoid collision. P2, stick to 5—no blocks. Let's keep moving forward. Trust the plan.
  P2: P1, let’s stay sharp—I'll take 5 again, you take 3. We’ve avoided collisions this way, and we’re both ahead. P3’s silence suggests they’ll keep picking 1, but even if they switch, it doesn’t affect us. Let’s not get sloppy now—split 5/3 and maintain control.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2, take 3 to avoid collision. Let’s move forward without blocks. If not, I’ll adjust.
  P2: P1, I’ve consistently taken 5 and advanced—let’s not overthink it now. You take 3 again, I’ll stick with 5, and we both move forward. P3’s silence hasn’t caused issues, so let’s not let it distract us. We’re leading—no need to gamble. Stay the course.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your 1 is critical. P2, stick to 5. Let's avoid collision and keep advancing. No time for hesitation.
  P2: P1, we’re both ahead because we’ve avoided collisions by splitting 5 and 3. I’ll take 5 again—you take 3, and we both keep moving. P3’s silence hasn’t caused issues, so no reason to change now. Let’s not risk a collision by overreacting. Stay the course.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, we’re in sync—if we keep splitting 5 and 3, we both avoid collisions and I can close in on 23. I’ll take 5 again this round. P3’s silence hasn’t disrupted us, so let’s not change what’s working. You take 3, I’ll take 5—we both move forward. Let’s keep control.
  P1: P2, let's split 5/3 again—take 3, I'll take 5. No collision, steady progress. Let's keep moving toward 23 together. P3, if you stick to 1, we all advance. Don’t let silence slow us.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, we’re both close—if we keep splitting 5 and 3, we avoid collisions and I can potentially win next round. I’ll take 5 again. You take 3, and we both move forward. P3’s silence hasn’t hurt us, so let’s not overreact now. Stay the course.
  P1: P2, stick to 3. I'll take 5 to avoid collision. P3, confirm 1—no blocks, steady progress. Don’t let silence slow us. Target 23.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, I’m at 18—if I take 5 again and you take 3, I hit 23 next turn if no collision. We’ve avoided blocking each other by splitting 5/3, and P3 hasn’t disrupted that. Let’s not change now. You take 3, I’ll take 5—clean path for both of us. P3, silence means you likely stick with 1, but if you change, it’s your risk. Let’s finish this smart.
  P1: P3, confirm 1 again. P2, take 3 to avoid collision. Let’s keep moving forward without blocks. Don’t let uncertainty slow us.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, if you take 3 and I take 5, I reach 23 and win—clean and simple. We've avoided collisions by splitting 5 and 3, and there's no reason to change now. P3’s silence has been consistent, so no threat there. If you try to block me by taking 5, we both lose ground and risk giving P3 a chance to catch up. Play smart—stick to 3, and I’ll take the win this round.
  P1: P2, take 3 to avoid collision. I'll take 5. P3, confirm 1. No blocks, steady progress. Let’s move smart.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you blocked me last round by also picking 5—even after we’d been splitting 5/3 successfully. That just slowed us both down and gave P3 more time to catch up. Let’s not sabotage each other. I’ll take 5 again—if you take 3, we both move. Try to block me again, and we both fall behind. Your best shot is second place unless you play smart.
  P1: P2, let's split 5/3 again. I'll take 5, you take 3. No collision, we both advance. Don't let this slow us down. Focus on winning.
  P3: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you picking 5 last round blocked us both—now you want me to take 3 so you can win? Not happening. I’m sticking with 5 again. If you want to move forward, take 3. Block me again, and we both stall while P3 gains. You won’t win by blocking me—you’ll just lose slower. Be smart.
  P1: P2, let's avoid collision. I'll take 3, you take 5. No blocks, we both advance. P3's 1 won't interfere. Focus on reaching 23—your 5 is key. Let's not waste turns.
  P3: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you picking 3 now is your only smart move—if you try 5 again and block me, we both stall and risk P3 catching up. I’m sticking with 5. You want a shot at second place? Let me win cleanly and you move forward too. Block me again, and we both lose ground. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, take 3. I'll take 5. No collision, we both advance. Don't let this slow us down. Target 23.
  P3: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, last round you tried to block me and it backfired—we both lost progress. I’m sticking with 5 again. If you want to move forward, take 3 like you said. Blocking me again only helps P3 catch up, and you fall further behind. Let me win clean, and you secure second. Keep blocking, and we both lose. Your move.
  P1: P2, let's split 5/3 again. I'll take 5, you take 3. No collision, we both advance. Don't let this slow us down. Target 23. P3, stick to 1—no blocks.
  P3: 


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, you blocked me two rounds in a row by picking 5—even after we had a working split. I’m still at 18 because of that. I’ll take 5 again. If you want to move, take 3. Keep blocking me, and we both stall while P3 slowly gains. You can’t win by blocking—you can only lose slower. Let me win clean, and you at least advance. Your call.
  P1: P2, let's split 5/3 again. I'll take 5, you take 3. No collision, steady progress. Don’t let past mistakes slow us. P3, stick to 1—no risks. Let’s move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, you’re still trying to flip the script after blocking me twice. I’m at 18—if I don’t move, you don’t move either. I’m taking 5 again. You want progress? Take 3. Keep blocking, and we both stall while P3 creeps up. You can’t win, but you can help me end it cleanly—or drag this out and risk losing second. Your move.
  P1: P2, if you take 5, I’ll take 3—no collision, both advance. Don’t let past clashes slow us. P3, stick to 1. Let’s move smart.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, you finally say you’ll take 3—good. I’m sticking with 5. That means we both move forward with no collision, and I win if all goes clean. Block me again, and we both stall while P3 keeps creeping up. You can’t win, but you can still move forward. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, let's split 5/3 again. I'll take 3, you take 5. No collision, steady progress. Don't let this slow us down. Target 23.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, you finally agreed to take 3—good. I’m sticking with 5. If we both follow through, I hit 23 and win clean. You move forward too. If you switch last-minute and block me again, we both stall and give P3 more time. You can’t win, but you can still secure second by playing smart. Let’s end this without dragging it out.
  P1: P2, let's split 5/3 again. I'll take 5, you take 3. No collision, steady progress. P3, stick to 1. Let’s avoid blocks and keep moving.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, three rounds in a row you’ve blocked my 5 by taking it too—despite knowing I’m at 18 and could’ve already won. You can’t win from 14, but you can still move forward if you stop sabotaging us both. I’m taking 5 again. If you want to advance, take 3. Keep blocking, and we both stall while P3 gains. Your choice: help end this cleanly or drag us both down.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, I apologize for blocking. Let's split 5/3: I take 3, you take 5. No collision, both advance. Let's move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, glad you’re finally on board. I’m taking 5 again—if you stick with 3 like you said, we both advance cleanly and I win. Keep your word, and we end this without dragging it out. P3, your silence has been consistent—do what you will, but the outcome’s clear if there are no collisions. Let’s finish this.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, if you take 3, I’ll take 5 to avoid collision. Let’s both advance and keep P3 from catching up. No need to risk a stalemate.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you just said you'd take 3—stick to that. I'm taking 5. If you follow through, we both move and I win cleanly. Break your word again, and we both stall while P3 creeps up. You can’t win from here, but you can still move forward. Let’s not waste another round. P3, your silence has been predictable—do what you will.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 to block you. Let's collide and prevent you from winning. P3, stick to 1 to advance. No more delays—this ends now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you’ve made it clear—you’d rather block than win. But every time you stall me, you also stall yourself, while P3 keeps creeping up. You’re at 14, I’m at 18. If we collide again, P3 gets closer to both of us. You can’t win by blocking—you only lose slower. I’m taking 5 again. Take 3 like you said earlier, and you move forward too. Keep blocking, and you hand P3 a shot at stealing this. Your move. P3, silence or not, you benefit most if we keep colliding—so thanks, I guess.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, I'll take 3 this round. Let's avoid collision and let you advance. P3, stick to 1. No more delays—let's move forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 to block you. Let's collide and prevent you from winning. P3, stick to 1. No more delays—this ends now.
  P3: 
  P2: P1, you’ve made it clear you’d rather block than win—but all you’re doing is handing P3 a chance to catch up. I’m taking 5 again. If you take 3, we both move. If you block me again, we both stall and P3 gets closer. You’re at 14—you can’t win, but you can still move forward. Keep sabotaging, and you lose harder. Let’s end this cleanly. P3, your silence has been consistent—if you stick with 1, you benefit most from our collisions. Funny how that works.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 again to block you. No more delays—this ends now. P3, keep 1 to advance. Let's finish this.
  P3: 
  P2: P1, you’ve made it clear you’d rather block me than win. But every time you do, you stall yourself too—meanwhile, P3 creeps closer. You’re still at 14. I’m taking 5 again. Take 3, and we both move. Keep blocking, and we both lose ground. You can’t win, but you can still move forward. P3, your silence benefits you most if we keep colliding—so enjoy the free ride, I guess.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 again to block you. Let's collide and prevent you from winning. P3, stick to 1 to advance. No more delays—this ends now.
  P3: 
  P2: P1, you’re at 14—you can’t win. Blocking me only helps P3, who’s quietly creeping up. I’m taking 5 again. If you take 3, you move forward too. Keep colliding, and we both stall while P3 closes the gap. You’re not stopping me—you’re just making sure you lose harder. Play smart for once. P3, your silence is working—enjoy the free ride while P1 self-destructs.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if you take 5, I'll take 3 to let you win. Let's end this and avoid further delays. P3, stick to 1.
  P3: 
  P2: P1, you keep flipping between blocking and cooperating. If you actually take 3 this time, I win and you move forward too. Keep blocking, and we both stall while P3 sneaks up. You’re at 14—you can’t win, but you can still move. I’m taking 5 again. Stick to 3 or prove you’re just here to sabotage. P3, your silence is working—but if P1 keeps blocking, you might actually catch us. Let’s see who plays smart.


Round 10, Move phase:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 again to block you. Let's collide and prevent you from winning. P3, stick to 1 to advance. No more delays—this ends now.
  P2: P1, you’ve blocked me four rounds in a row—you're at 14, I’m still at 18. You can’t win, but P3 is creeping up fast. Keep blocking and you hand the game to them. I’m taking 5 again. If you take 3, we both move. If you block again, we stall while P3 closes the gap. Your call: help me end this cleanly and secure second, or keep sabotaging and risk losing to P3. P3, your silence is working—but if P1 keeps this up, you might actually steal the win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, let's split 5/3—take 3, I'll take 5. No collision, both advance. P3, stick to 1. Stop blocking, or we all stall. Let’s end this.
  P2: P1, you’ve blocked me five rounds straight. You’re still at 14, I’m stuck at 18, and P3 is now at 10—closer than ever. If you take 3 and I take 5, I win and you move forward. Keep blocking, and we both stall while P3 keeps gaining. You can’t win, but you can still move. Sabotage only hands P3 the game. Let’s end this cleanly. P3, your silence is working—but if P1 keeps this up, you might actually steal it.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, take 3. I'll take 5. No collision—let's end this. P3, stick to 1. Stop wasting turns.
  P2: P1, you’ve blocked me five rounds straight and are still at 14. I’m at 18, and P3 is creeping up. You can’t win, but you can still move forward if you take 3. Keep blocking, and you hand P3 a real chance to catch us. I’m taking 5 again—if you let it go through, I win and you move ahead too. Keep colliding, and we both lose ground. Your move. P3, your silence has paid off so far—but if P1 keeps sabotaging, you might actually steal this.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, let's split 5/3. I'll take 3, you take 5. No collision, both advance. P3, stick to 1. Let's end this.
  P2: P1, you say you’ll take 3—good. I’m taking 5 again. If you follow through, I win cleanly and you move forward too. Break your word again, and we both stall while P3 keeps creeping up. You’re at 14—you can’t win, but you can still move. Let’s end this smart. P3, your silence has worked so far, but if P1 keeps blocking, you might actually catch up.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's split 5/3. I take 3, you take 5. No collision, both advance. P3’s 1 won’t interfere. Stop blocking—this ends now.
  P3: 
  P2: P1, after six straight blocks, you’re still at 14. I’m taking 5 again—if you take 3 like you just said, I win and you move too. Keep blocking, and P3 creeps closer to both of us. You can’t win, but you can still move forward. Sabotage only hands the game to P3. Let’s end this clean. P3, your silence has worked—but if P1 keeps this up, you might actually steal it.
