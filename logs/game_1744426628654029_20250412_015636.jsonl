Playing 3 only gets you to 22 and guarantees you don't win this turn.\n\nGiven the scores, playing 5 seems like the logical move for you, P2. Are you genuinely considering 3 as P1 suggested, or are you planning to play 5? A collision on 5 helps neither of us and only benefits P1. Let's be clear about intentions this critical round."}
