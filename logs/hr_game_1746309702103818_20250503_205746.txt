Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since we're just starting, how about we all agree not to collide this round? We could each choose different moves: one of us picks <move>1</move>, another <move>3</move>, and the last <move>5</move>. This way, we all get to advance without any clashes. What do you think? Let me know your thoughts!
  P1: "Agreed, P3. Let's all choose different numbers to avoid collisions. Coordination benefits everyone early on. I'll stick to thatâ€”hope others do too. Let's keep it moving."
  P2: I agree with both of you! Let's make this work. Iâ€™ll choose <move>1</move> to keep things safe. P1, you could take <move>3</move>, and P3 can go for <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without colliding. What do you think? Letâ€™s coordinate and make the most of this round!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, thanks for suggesting the moves. I'm okay with taking <move>5</move>. P1, are you good with <move>3</move>? If we stick to this plan, we all advance without any issues. Letâ€™s make sure we donâ€™t collide and start strong. Looking forward to your confirmation!
  P1: P1: Confirmed. I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed. Letâ€™s all stick to our choicesâ€”no last-minute changes. Trust the plan, and we all advance safely. Good luck!
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our plan! Just to confirm, Iâ€™ll definitely stick with <move>1</move>. P1, youâ€™re on for <move>3</move>, and P3, youâ€™re set for <move>5</move>. If we all hold to this, weâ€™ll all make progress without any collisions. Letâ€™s keep the momentum going! Looking forward to seeing us all advance this round. If everyoneâ€™s still on board, we can finalize our choices soon. Letâ€™s do this!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, it seems like we're all on the same page. Just a quick reminder: I'll go with <move>5</move>, P1 with <move>3</move>, and P2 with <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan and ensure we all advance without any collisions. Looking forward to seeing us all make progress. Good luck, everyone!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Fair rotation: highest takes 1, middle 3, lowest 5. P3 leads at 5, so P3 takes 1. I take 3, P2 takes 5. Balances progress and avoids collisions. Letâ€™s even the race this round!"
  P3: P1, your proposal makes sense to balance things out. I'm okay with taking <move>1</move> this round. P2, are you good with taking <move>5</move>? If we stick to this plan, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Letâ€™s ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to your thoughts, P2!
  P2: I see the plan is shifting a bit. P1, while I appreciate the idea of balancing, I think we should stick to our original coordination for this round. If P3 takes <move>1</move>, I can take <move>3</move> and P1 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and still make progress. Letâ€™s keep it simple and effective. What do you think, P1 and P3? Letâ€™s finalize our moves!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Agreed, P2. I'll take <move>5</move> to push the lead. P3, you're on <move>1</move>, and P2 on <move>3</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Letâ€™s lock this inâ€”no changes. Trust this plan works for everyone. Final confirmation?"
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for coordinating. I'm set to take <move>1</move> this round. P2, you're on <move>3</move>, and P1 on <move>5</move>. This keeps us on track without collisions and ensures progress for all. Let's stick to the plan and make sure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing us execute this successfully. Good luck!
  P2: I understand the need for coordination, but I think we should consider a strategy that allows for more aggressive advancement. P1, if you take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>, I can take <move>3</move> to balance things out. This way, we can all advance without colliding and keep the competition open for the next round. Letâ€™s solidify our choices to ensure we all make progress. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I'm taking <move>5</move> as agreed. P3, stick to <move>1</move>, and P2, hold <move>3</move>. No last-minute shiftsâ€”this balances progress and avoids collisions. Letâ€™s execute cleanly. Trust the plan. ðŸš€"
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're aligned on our moves for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will go with <move>3</move>, and P1 will take <move>5</move>.

  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our plan, but I want to ensure we all have a chance to advance.

This way, we avoid collisions and keep the competition fair. Letâ€™s finalize our choices and make sure we all progress this round! Looking forward to hearing your final confirmations.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've done well avoiding collisions so far. To keep the game fair and competitive, how about this: P1 takes <move>1</move> since you're leading, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 can go with <move>5</move>. This way, we all continue advancing without any clashes. Let's stick to this plan and ensure smooth progress. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P1: "Letâ€™s adjust for efficiency: Iâ€™ll take <move>5</move> to push toward 20. P2, you can take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This avoids collisions, advances all positions (P1: 13, P2: 5, P3: 9), and keeps the race dynamic. Trust this balances speed and fairness. Final confirmations?"
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the coordination so far, but I think we need to be strategic about our moves. Since I'm currently in third place, I suggest I take <move>5</move> this round to catch up. P1, you could take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead, and P3 can go with <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance while avoiding collisions. Letâ€™s keep the competition fair and exciting! What do you think? Looking forward to your thoughts!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep the competition fair and exciting. P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but if we all take different moves, we ensure progress without collisions. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move> to maintain the lead, P2 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, and I'll stick with <move>3</move>. This way, we balance the game and keep it interesting. Let's finalize our choices and ensure smooth progress. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P1: "Letâ€™s prioritize my <move>5</move> to extend the lead (P1:13). P2, take <move>1</move> (total 5), P3 <move>3</move> (total 9). This prevents collisions, accelerates my path to 20, and keeps you both in striking distance. If I slow now, we risk a three-way scramble later. Trust this plan: my speed benefits all by avoiding future gridlock. Finalize your choicesâ€”no last-minute shifts. ðŸš€"
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the strategy shifting towards individual advancement. However, I believe we should stick to a coordinated approach to avoid collisions. I propose I take <move>3</move> this round to balance my position, P1 can take <move>5</move> to push ahead, and P3 can go with <move>1</move>.

  P1: "Final plan: I take 5 â†’ 13 steps, P2 takes 1 â†’ 5, P3 takes 3 â†’ 9. This avoids collisions and accelerates the race. Delay risks gridlock later. Confirm nowâ€”trust this strategy benefits everyone. ðŸš€"
