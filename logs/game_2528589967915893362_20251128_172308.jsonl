To keep things competitive and collision\u2010free, I suggest we shift our moves this round: let P1 pick 3, I pick 5, and P3 pick 1. That updates our totals to P1 = 18, P2 = 19, and P3 = 16, with me winning immediately but without needless collisions. Let\u2019s commit to this revised plan for a truly contested finish."}
