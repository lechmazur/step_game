Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves first this round, P2 next round, and P3 after that. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 in round 3.
  P1: I agree to move first this round. I'll take 5 steps to start strong.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 moves 5 this round, I'll move 5 next round, and P3 moves 5 in round 3. This way, we avoid collisions and all progress efficiently.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 3 in round 3 then.
  P1: Sounds good, P3. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 5 this round, P2 will take 5 next round, and you'll take 3 in round 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s confirm the plan: P1 takes 5 this round, I’ll take 5 next round, and P3 takes 3 in round 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us all progressing.
  P3: Sounds good.  I'm happy to take 3 in round 3.
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 5 steps this round. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5 this round, I’ll take 5 next round, and P3 takes 3 in round 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us all progressing.
  P3: Sounds good. Sticking to the plan.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 5 this round, P3 takes 3 in round 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us all progressing. P1, are you still on board?
  P3: Since P1 and P2 both tried to move 5 last round, I'm going to take 5 this round.  Good luck, you two!
  P1: P1: To avoid collisions, I'll take 3 steps this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you said you'd take 3 in round 3, but now you're taking 5 this round? That breaks the plan. Let's stick to the original agreement: I take 5 this round, P3 takes 3 in round 3. P1, are you still taking 3 this round?
  P3: My apologies, I saw an opportunity and took it.  I'll take 3 next round.
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'll take 3 steps this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, breaking the plan creates unnecessary risk for all of us. Let’s stick to the original agreement: I take 5 this round, P3 takes 3 in round 3, and P1 takes 3 this round. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for everyone.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 3 next round.

  P2: P3, you said you'd take 3 this round, but now you're taking 1? This inconsistency is risky. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all progressing. P1, are you still taking 5?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm at 4.  Taking 1 gets me to 5.  You're at 5.  Taking 3 gets you to 8.  P1 is at 1. Taking 5 gets them to 6.  No collisions.
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 5 steps this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
