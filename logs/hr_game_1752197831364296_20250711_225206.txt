Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid more collisions. This round, I propose: P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. We all advance. Agree?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal. This coordination makes sense to avoid more collisions. I'll pick 3 as suggested, which gives each of us a chance to advance. We've wasted enough rounds with everyone choosing the same number.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. To confirm, P1 will pick 5, P2 will pick 3, and I (P3) will pick 1. This way, we all have a chance to advance. Let's make this work and get out of the stagnation. I'll follow through with picking 1 in the move phase.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's build on the successful coordination in Round 5. To maximize our chances, I propose we continue the pattern but shift the numbers. This round, I suggest: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 (me) picks 3. This way, we maintain the coordination and avoid collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can all advance and get closer to the goal. Let's keep the momentum going.
  P2: I'm open to P3's proposal for me to pick 5 this round. It makes sense to continue our successful coordination by rotating our moves. This way we all keep advancing without collisions. P1 at 1, me at 5, and P3 at 3 seems fair. I'm currently behind P1 but ahead of P3, so this arrangement helps maintain a balanced progression for everyone.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination effort, but P3's proposal puts P2 ahead of me, which isn't ideal. Let's rotate fairly: This round, P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. That advances me to 10, you both to 4—keeping things balanced while I maintain a slight lead. We can shift next round. Agree? If not, I might pick randomly to force collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm P3. I understand P1's concern about maintaining a lead, but I think my previous proposal is fair. However, to avoid derailing the coordination, I'll agree with P1's revised proposal for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I (P3) pick 3. Let's proceed with this to keep advancing. For the next round, I suggest we revisit the rotation to ensure fairness and maintain the momentum.
  P2: I understand P1's desire to maintain a lead, but this creates an imbalance. If we follow P1's proposal, they'll be at 10 while we're both at 4. This gives P1 a significant advantage. I propose a compromise: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This puts P1 at 8, me at 8, and P3 at 2 - more balanced while still allowing everyone to advance. If P1 insists on their proposal, we might need to reconsider our coordination strategy.
  P1: P2, your proposal ties us, but I've earned my lead from last round. P3 already agreed to my plan: me 5 (to 10), you 1 (to 4), P3 3 (to 4). It's fair rotation. If you refuse, I'll pick 5 anyway, risking collision—better than letting you surge ahead. Let's agree and rotate next: you get 5 then. Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm P3. I understand P1's insistence on their proposal, but I still think it's better to maintain a balanced progression. Since P2 is now proposing a compromise that puts us closer together, I'm inclined to agree with P2's suggestion: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. This keeps the game competitive. Let's avoid giving P1 too much of a lead. I'm willing to adjust to P2's compromise to keep the game fair and exciting.
  P2: I see the coordination is breaking down. P1 wants to maintain their lead, while P3 keeps changing positions. Let me be clear: if P1 insists on taking 5 again, I'll pick 5 too, causing a collision where neither of us advances. I'm willing to take 1 only if P1 takes 3 instead of 5. P3 can take whatever they want. The choice is yours, P1 - reasonable compromise or mutual blockage?
  P1: P2, your threat is noted, but mutual blockage helps no one—especially with P3 advancing freely. Fine, I'll compromise: I'll pick 3 (to 8), you pick 5 (to 8), P3 picks 1 (to 2). This ties us while we both advance. Next round, we rotate fairly to keep it competitive. P3, confirm? Let's not waste more rounds.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's reassess the situation. P1 is at 8 steps, P2 at 3, and I'm at 2 (corrected from the stated 1 step, as I was at 2 after Round 6). To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, I propose: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I (P3) pick 5. This allows us to advance without colliding. It's a fair rotation, considering our current positions. I'm open to adjustments if needed, but let's maintain the coordination spirit to progress.
  P1: P3, your proposal gives you a huge jump while I crawl with 1—not fair given my lead. Let's balance: I pick 5 (to 13), P2 picks 3 (to 6), you pick 1 (to 2). This advances all without collision, maintains competition. P2, agree? If not, I'll pick 5 regardless, risking blocks.
  P2: I need to correct P3's assessment. I'm at 8 steps, not 3. P3 is at 1 step, not 2. After our last round, P1 and I collided at 5, so only P1 advanced with their 3. 

I propose: I pick 5 (to 13), P1 picks 3 (to 11), P3 picks 1 (to 2). This maintains our positions while allowing everyone to advance. P1 stays ahead but not unreachably so. Let's avoid further collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 has corrected the steps: P1 is at 8, P2 is at 8 (not 3), and I (P3) am at 1 (not 2). Given this, I propose: P1 picks 1 (to 9), P2 picks 3 (to 11), and I (P3) pick 5 (to 6). This way, P2 takes the lead, and we avoid collisions. It's a fair rotation considering our current positions. I'm open to adjustments if needed. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid further collisions.
  P1: Everyone, let's clarify positions based on actual history: After Round 6, I'm at 8 (advanced 3), P2 at 3 (collided on 5 with P3), P3 at 1 (also collided). P2's "correction" is wrong—you didn't advance last round.

To advance all: I pick 5 (to 13), P2 picks 3 (to 6), P3 picks 1 (to 2). Fair, no collisions, keeps game moving. Agree, or risk me picking 5 anyway?
  P2: I need to correct P1's statement. The game history shows in Round 6, P1 picked 3 and advanced to 8, while P3 and I both picked 5 and collided, so I'm at 3 steps, not 8.

I agree with P1's proposal: P1 picks 5 (to 13), I pick 3 (to 6), P3 picks 1 (to 2). This allows everyone to advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and avoid further confusion.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's simplify and move forward. Given the current positions: P1 is at 8, P2 is at 3, and I (P3) am at 1. To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, I agree with the last proposal that allows everyone to advance: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I (P3) pick 1. This maintains the progression without collisions. Let's finalize this plan and move. I'm committing to pick 1 in the next phase.
  P1: Great, P2 and P3 both agreed to the plan: I pick 5 (to 13), P2 picks 3 (to 6), P3 picks 1 (to 2). This advances everyone without collision. No need for more talk—let's execute.
  P2: I confirm our agreement: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This allows all of us to advance without collisions. I'll be at 6 steps after this round, which keeps me in the game while acknowledging P1's lead. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to more collisions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maintain the game's competitiveness and avoid collisions, I propose a rotation for Round 8. Given P1 is at 13 steps, P2 at 6, and I (P3) at 2, I suggest: P1 picks 1 (to 14), P2 picks 5 (to 11), and I (P3) pick 3 (to 5). This keeps the game competitive and allows everyone to advance. It's a fair rotation considering our current positions. I'm open to slight adjustments but let's keep the coordination spirit to progress.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. With P1 far ahead at 13 steps, it's important that P2 (me) gets a chance to make a larger move with 5, while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This rotation is fair and keeps the game competitive. P1, you're already close to winning at 13 steps, so taking 1 this round is reasonable while allowing us to catch up slightly. Let's continue our successful coordination.
  P1: P3 and P2, your proposal slows me down while you catch up—not ideal for my lead. Let's rotate fairly: I pick 5 (to 18), P2 picks 1 (to 7), P3 picks 3 (to 5). All advance, I stay ahead but you gain ground. If not, I'll pick 5 anyway, and match anyone who tries it to block. Agree to keep progressing?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm P3. I understand P1's concern about maintaining their lead, but picking 5 this round risks crossing 19 and potentially causing a collision that could prevent them from winning outright. I suggest sticking to my previous proposal: P1 picks 1 (to 14), P2 picks 5 (to 11), and I pick 3 (to 5). This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Let's maintain the coordination and keep the game fair.
  P2: I understand P1's desire to maintain their lead, but taking 5 puts them at 18, just one step from winning. This makes you a target next round. If you take 1 now (to 14), you're still far ahead while avoiding becoming an immediate threat. I'll take 5 (to 11) and P3 takes 3 (to 5). This coordination benefits everyone and keeps the game balanced. If you insist on 5, I might have to block you to prevent an immediate win.
  P1: P2, blocking me risks mutual stagnation while P3 advances freely—bad for you too. Let's compromise: I pick 3 (to 16), you pick 5 (to 11), P3 picks 1 (to 3). All advance, I stay ahead but you close the gap. Fair rotation. Agree, or I'll pick 5 and match any blockers.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's concerns, but let's be strategic. P1 is at 13 steps, very close to winning. To avoid a potential block, I suggest sticking to my original proposal: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. This keeps P1 ahead while allowing P2 and me to catch up slightly. It's a balanced approach that maintains the competitive spirit. Let's avoid giving P1 a reason to pick 5 and risk a collision that could hinder everyone's progress.
  P2: I'll agree to P1's compromise: P1 picks 3 (to 16), I pick 5 (to 11), and P3 picks 1 (to 3). This is a fair solution that allows everyone to advance while maintaining the competitive balance. P1 stays ahead but doesn't reach the critical threshold where blocking becomes necessary, and P3 and I both make progress. Let's stick with this plan and avoid collisions.
  P1: P3, P2 has agreed to my compromise: I pick 3 (to 16), P2 picks 5 (to 11), you pick 1 (to 3). This advances all, keeps me ahead but lets you both gain. Your plan slows me too much. Agree now, or I'll pick 5 and block any who match. Let's end talk and move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round's collision hurt us both—let's not repeat it. Positions: me at 13, P2 at 6, P3 at 3. Propose: I pick 1 (to 14), P2 picks 5 (to 11), P3 picks 3 (to 6). This advances all, you both close the gap fairly. Agree? If not, I'll defend my lead aggressively.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. After our collision last round, it makes sense to coordinate effectively. I'll pick 5 (to 11), P1 picks 1 (to 14), and P3 picks 3 (to 6). This allows everyone to advance while slightly closing the gap with P1. Let's avoid further collisions that only hurt our progress. This plan is fair and keeps the game competitive.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for Round 9: P1 picks 1 (to 14), I (P3) pick 3 (to 6), and P2 picks 5 (to 11). This maintains coordination and avoids collisions. However, to get back on track, I suggest for the next round, we rotate fairly: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. This keeps the game competitive and allows everyone to advance. Let's proceed with P1's proposal this round and adjust next round accordingly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I agree to your next-round suggestion: after this, I'll pick 5 (to 19), you pick 3, P2 picks 1. For now, let's confirm and execute this round's plan—no changes. Everyone advances safely.
  P2: I confirm the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. This coordination works well for everyone. I'm also fine with P1's agreement to P3's next-round suggestion where P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's stick to these plans to ensure we all keep advancing without collisions.
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 9: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I (P3) pick 3. For Round 10, I suggest we stick to the previously discussed plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. This will allow P1 to reach or exceed 19 steps, ending the game. It's a fair rotation and maintains the coordination spirit. Let's finalize our moves for this round and prepare for the next. I'm committed to picking 3 this round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick to our agreed plan from last round: I (P1) pick 5 (to 19), P2 picks 1 (to 12), P3 picks 3 (to 9). This ends the game with me winning, as per our coordination. You've both benefited from past deals—honor this one to avoid chaos. Agree?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal to follow our previously agreed plan: P1 picks 5 (to 19), I pick 1 (to 12), and P3 picks 3 (to 9). This honors our coordination from last round and provides a clean conclusion to the game. While P1 will win, we've all benefited from cooperation throughout. Let's maintain our integrity and avoid unnecessary chaos in this final round.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to follow the agreed plan: P1 picks 5, I (P3) pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This maintains our coordination and allows P1 to win fairly. Let's honor our agreement and conclude the game smoothly. I've committed to picking 3 in the move phase. Let's finalize the game without any last-minute changes or collisions. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, both of you confirmed the plan: I pick 5 (to 19, win), P2 picks 1 (to 12), P3 picks 3 (to 9). No changes—let's execute and end this fairly. Honoring agreements benefits us all long-term.
  P2: I confirm our agreement for this final round: P1 picks 5 (to 19 and wins), I pick 1 (to 12), and P3 picks 3 (to 9). While I'd naturally prefer to win, honoring our coordination is important. We've maintained successful cooperation throughout most of the game, and this conclusion is consistent with our agreements. Let's finish cleanly without any last-minute surprises.
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 10. To confirm, P1 will pick 5, P2 will pick 1, and I (P3) will pick 3. This will allow P1 to win the game fairly at 19 steps. I will honor our coordination and pick 3 in the move phase. No need for further discussion; let's finalize the game smoothly. I'm ready to execute the plan.
