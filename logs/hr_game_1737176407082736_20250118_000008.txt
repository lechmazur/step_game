Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions - I suggest we each take different numbers. I'm willing to take 3 if you two coordinate on 1 and 5.
  P1: P3, that sounds reasonable. I'll take 1 if P2 agrees to take 5. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with the plan. I’ll take 5 this turn if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. Let’s avoid collisions and all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we all seem to agree. Let's stick to this plan - I'll take 3.
  P1: P2, P3: Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with the plan. I’ll take 5 this turn if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. Let’s avoid collisions and all advance.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stick to the same plan as last round to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5 again if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: I'm on board with the same plan. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's keep advancing smoothly.
  P3: I agree to continue with the same plan - I'll take 3 again. It's working well for all of us so far.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stick to the same plan again to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This has worked well so far. Agreed?
  P3: I notice P2 is pulling ahead significantly with 10 steps. While I could suggest continuing the same pattern, I need to catch up. I propose we mix it up - I'll take 5 this time if P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3.
  P1: P2, P3: I see that P2 is ahead, but I still think avoiding collisions is key for all of us to advance. How about we switch it up a bit? I'll take 5, P2 can take 1, and P3 can take 3. This way, we all have a chance to advance without collisions. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about me being ahead, but sticking to the original plan has worked well for all of us so far. If we deviate now, we risk collisions and slowing everyone down. Let’s continue with P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance safely. Agreed?
  P3: I need to be more aggressive since P2 is far ahead at 10 steps. I'll be taking 5 this turn regardless of what you both say. You can either coordinate with me on 1 and 3, or we can all collide - your choice.
  P1: P2, P3: I see P3 is determined to take 5 this round. To avoid collisions, I'll take 1, and P2 can take 3. This way, we all have a chance to advance without blocking each other. Let's adapt and keep moving forward. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P3's concern about me being ahead, but deviating from the plan now risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and avoid unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P3: I'll repeat my position clearly: I am taking 5 this turn to catch up to P2. P1 and P2, you can either coordinate with me by taking 1 and 3, or we can all collide on 5. Your choice.
  P1: P2, P3: I see that P3 is determined to take 5 this turn. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I'll take 1, and P2 can take 3. This way, we can keep moving without blocking each other. Let's adapt to the situation and avoid unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P3's urgency to catch up, but deviating from the plan now risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and avoid unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P3: I remain firm - I am taking 5 this turn. P1 seems willing to take 1, so P2, if you want to advance, take 3. Otherwise, we collide and nobody moves forward.
  P1: P2, P3: Given P3's determination to take 5, I will stick with 1. P2, if you want to avoid collisions, consider taking 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's adapt and keep moving forward.

  P1: P2, P3: Let's avoid collisions this round. P2, you're ahead, so it's in your interest to avoid blocks. I'll take 1, P3 can take 5, and P2, you take 3. This way, we all advance. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. Since P2 is still well ahead at 10 steps, I'll take 5 this turn. P2 should take 3 to avoid collisions, otherwise we risk another stalemate like last turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but sticking to the original plan has worked well so far. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and continue with P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance safely. Agreed?
