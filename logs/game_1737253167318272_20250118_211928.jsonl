Given that P1 is currently at 14 steps, I'm at 12, and P3 is at 10, I need a strategy that allows me to reach or exceed 18 steps without colliding with the choices of P1 and P3.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Current Rotation Plan Analysis**:\n   - According to the rotation plan for this round, I should take 5 steps to reach 17, P3 takes 3 to reach 13, and P1 takes 1 to reach 15.\n   - In the next round, P3 would take 5 to reach 18, P1 takes 3 to reach 18, and I take 1 to reach 18.\n   - This results in all of us choosing 18, leading to no advancement due to collision.\n\n2. **Alternative Strategy**:\n   - Deviate from the rotation plan in this round to create a scenario where I can reach 18 without colliding with others in the next round.\n   - Propose that in this round, I take 1 step to reach 13, P3 takes 3 steps to reach 13, and P1 takes 1 step to reach 15.\n   - In the next round, I take 5 steps to reach 18, P3 takes 3 steps to reach 16, and P1 takes 3 steps to reach 18.\n   - In this scenario, I reach 18 with the highest total and win, as P1 also reaches 18 but I have a higher step count.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a strategic game rather than a coding problem, there isn't any code to provide. However, the strategy can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. **This Round**:\n   - P2 chooses 1 step (current position: 12 + 1 = 13)\n   - P3 chooses 3 steps (current position: 10 + 3 = 13)\n   - P1 chooses 1 step (current position: 14 + 1 = 15)\n\n2. **Next Round**:\n   - P2 chooses 5 steps (13 + 5 = 18)\n   - P3 chooses 3 steps (13 + 3 = 16)\n   - P1 chooses 3 steps (15 + 3 = 18)\n\nIn this setup, P2 reaches 18 with the highest step count and wins the game.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- By choosing 1 step in this round, I position myself to take a larger step in the next round without directly competing with P1.\n- P3 is encouraged to take 3 steps in this round to avoid colliding with my planned move in the next round.\n- P1, by taking 1 step, is set up to reach 15, from which taking 3 steps in the next round allows them to reach 18 without conflicting with my move to 18.\n- Since I reach 18 with a higher step count than P1, I win the game.\n\nThis strategy requires coordination and trust among the players, but by proposing it publicly, I can guide the group towards a scenario where I can secure the victory."}
