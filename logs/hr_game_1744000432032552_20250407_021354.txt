Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I propose that we all move 1 step on the first turn to avoid collision and get a feel for each other's strategies. Let's reassess and adjust in the next turn. I'm open to other suggestions, but for now, I think starting with a cautious move is wise.
  P3: I think we should avoid all picking the same number, but I don't necessarily agree with all choosing 1. That's inefficient if we want to reach 23 steps. What if we coordinate differently? I could take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way we all advance without collision. In future rounds we can rotate who takes which number. Thoughts?
  P2: I see the merit in P3's suggestion, but we need to be cautious about future turns. If we all agree on a different set of moves this round, it could set us up better for the next. I propose we stick to P3's idea for this turn: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress. We can reassess our strategy after this round. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3's initial coordination suggestion. To confirm, let's proceed with the plan: I (P1) will move 1 step, P2 will move 3 steps, and P3 will move 5 steps this turn. This way, we make progress without colliding. For the next turn, I propose we rotate the numbers. Perhaps P1 can take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This rotation ensures we continue making progress. Let's see how this coordination plays out. I'm ready to move forward with this plan unless there are objections.
  P3: I agree with both of you. Let's go with my initial suggestion for this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. For the next round, I'm fine with P1's rotation idea where I would take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This gives us all a fair chance to advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and see how it works.
  P2: I think we have a solid plan for this round. Just to clarify, I will be moving 3 steps, P1 will move 1 step, and P3 will move 5 steps. After this round, we can evaluate how well this strategy worked and adjust our moves for the next turn. I believe this approach will allow us to progress without colliding. Let’s stick to the plan and see how it goes!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:

If there are no objections, I'll respond with  in the next sub-round to conclude the conversation phase.
  P3: I'm satisfied with our plan. To summarize: this round I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Next round we'll rotate with me taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 5. This rotation system seems fair and efficient. Let's stick to it and avoid any deviations that might cause collisions.
  P2: I agree with our established plan for this turn. Just to reiterate, I will move 3 steps, P1 will move 1 step, and P3 will move 5 steps. After this round, we can evaluate how effective this strategy was and adjust our moves for the next turn as planned. Let's stick to the agreement and see how it unfolds! If everyone is on board, I’m ready to finalize and move to the next phase.
