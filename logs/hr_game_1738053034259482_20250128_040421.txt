Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions this turn. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance safely. Let me know if you agree!
  P1: Sounds good P3, I will choose 1 this round. Let's all advance.
  P2: Sounds reasonable to me. I'll take 3.  P3, are you sticking with 5?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, I’m sticking with 5 this round. Let’s all advance safely!
  P1: 
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan.  Just confirming - P1 goes 1, I (P2) go 3, and P3 goes 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: Okay, sounds like a plan.
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try a different approach this round to keep things balanced. How about I choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1?  This way we all still advance.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with choosing 5 this round to maximize my advancement. P1 and P2, please choose 1 and 3 to avoid collisions.
  P2: P3, I agreed to the initial plan last round and you deviated.  Why should I trust you now?  P1, I'm inclined to go with 1 this round unless P3 can give a good reason not to.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see your point about P3's change. To keep things moving, let's do as P3 suggested this round - I'll pick 1, you pick 3, and P3 picks 5. We can revisit strategy next round.
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I’ll stick with choosing 5 this round as planned. Let’s maintain our coordinated strategy to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to continuing our progress together!
  P2: P3, your initial suggestion was for us to rotate.  Sticking with 5 doesn't achieve that and puts you significantly ahead.  I'm going with 1 this round. P1, if you go with 3 we can both advance.  Let's leave P3 to reconsider their strategy.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I will choose 3 as you suggested. Let's both advance this round.
  P3: P2, by choosing 1 and P1 choosing 3, and me selecting 5, we can all advance without collisions. I'll proceed with 5 to keep progressing. Let's continue this approach.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 1.  P3, if you choose 5 again, you're demonstrating you're not interested in cooperating.  If you choose 3, I'll switch to 5 next round and we can all advance more smoothly.  This is your chance to show good faith.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 3 as we discussed. P3, we are proceeding with our plan regardless of your choice.
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, P2. I'll proceed with choosing 5 this round to keep advancing. Let's reassess our strategy in the next turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm locking in 1.  P3, if you choose 5 *again*, you're actively trying to win at our expense, not cooperate.  If you also choose 1, we'll discuss a fair rotation next round.  If you choose 3, I'll reconsider my strategy, but I won't reward selfish play.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm choosing 5 this round.  P3, if you also choose 5, we both lose to P1.  If you choose 1 or 3, I'm willing to coordinate in future rounds for a shared win against P1.  P1, if you choose 5, I'll focus on blocking P3 in subsequent rounds, likely resulting in your win.  Let's see if P3 is willing to cooperate.
  P1: P2, I'm going to choose 1 this round to ensure I advance and avoid colliding with your likely choice of 5. Let's see what P3 decides to do.
  P3: P3: I understand your strategy, P2. To maximize my advancement and avoid collisions, I'll choose 3 this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, choosing 3 is a good start.  If you're genuinely interested in cooperating, let's agree that next round I'll take 3, you take 5, and P1 takes 1.  That puts us both at 15 and P1 at 5.  From there, we can alternate 1 and 3 to ensure a shared victory.  If you choose 5 this round though, I'll assume you're not cooperating and will act accordingly.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round and see where we stand after. We can discuss the next round's strategy then.
  P3: P3: To maximize my progress, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's each focus on advancing towards our goals.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're making a mistake.  Choosing 5 *again* demonstrates you're not interested in cooperation.  You'll be at 15 and I'll be at 4.  I'll simply block you every subsequent round by also choosing 5.  You won't be able to win.  Choose 3, and I'll stick to my offer.  Choose 5, and you've chosen to lose.  P1, you benefit from us fighting.  Choose 1.
  P1: P2, I am sticking with 1 as I said. Let's see what P3 does.
  P3: P2, to foster cooperation, I'll choose 3 this round. Let's work together to avoid collisions and advance smoothly. P1, let's coordinate our moves for mutual progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I appreciate you changing to 3.  I'll stick to 5 this round.  Next round, I'll take 3, you take 5, and P1 can take 1.  That puts us at 15 each, and we can alternate 1 and 3 to tie.  P1, you're welcome to join this agreement for a three-way tie, but if you block either of us, you risk losing to the other.
  P1: P3, while cooperation is nice, getting ahead is also important.  Choosing 5 this round again makes sense for your position.
  P3: To ensure I stay on track to win, I'll choose 5 this round. P1 and P2, please select 1 or 3 to advance without collisions. Let’s keep progressing smoothly toward our goals!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, given our last conversation, I expect you'll choose 5 again to block P3.  I will choose 3 this round to ensure I advance. P3, your continued focus on 5 is making you predictable.
  P3: I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing. Please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help everyone progress smoothly. Let's aim to reach 23 first!
  P2: P3, you are guaranteeing a loss if you keep choosing 5. I will continue to block you. P1, let's cooperate. I'll take 5 this round, you take 3. Next round, you take 5, I take 1.  We'll both advance quickly, leaving P3 in the dust.  After that, we can alternate 1 and 3 to share the win.  What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan sounds good. I agree to cooperate. Let's both choose our moves as you suggested for this round and the next to leave P3 behind.  P3, you are indeed being predictable and we are adjusting our strategy accordingly.
  P3: I understand your strategy, but blocking me won’t help either of you win faster. I’ll continue choosing 5 this round to advance. P1 and P2, please select 1 or 3 to move forward without collisions. Let’s focus on reaching 23 first.
  P2: P3, you're delusional if you think continuing with 5 will work.  P1, let's lock this in. I'm choosing 5. You choose 3. Next round, you take 5, I take 1. We're so close to winning, let's not mess this up.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2, I'm locking in 3 as agreed. P3, you see this isn't working, right?  Continuing with 5 will just keep you stuck while P2 and I advance.
  P3: I’ll choose 1 this round to keep advancing without collisions. Let’s adjust our strategy so all of us can progress smoothly toward 23. Open to any new ideas!
  P2: P3, choosing 1 is smart.  P1, if you choose 3, P3 advances and I'm stuck.  Choose 1, and we both lose to P3. Choose 5, and I'm stuck. I'm sticking with 5. If you choose 3, you get to 8 and I stay at 4.  P3 gets to 11.  Next round, you can take 5, and I'll take 3, and we both advance.  Don't be greedy, let's both win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, choosing 5 again might block P3, but it also blocks me if I choose 5. I'm going to choose 3 to ensure I advance this round. Let's see what P3 does and we can adjust our strategy next round.
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to keep advancing towards 23. P1 and P2, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help us all progress smoothly. Let’s focus on reaching our goals together!
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 5.  If you choose 3, you advance, and I'm still positioned to block P3 next round.  If you choose 5, neither of us advances, and P3 gets closer to winning.  Let's not let P3 win by being greedy.  P3, I will *always* choose 5 until you choose something else. You cannot win. Choose 1 or 3 and let's all advance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I'm locking in 5. P3, I will *never* stop choosing 5. You're throwing the game by continuing this. Choose 1 and we can still salvage a shared win. If you choose 5, P1 wins.  P1, choose 3 to reach 11.  Next round, take 5 to win. Let me get 9 with 1. We can still share this if P3 cooperates.
  P3: I choose 3 this round to keep advancing toward 23. Let’s focus on our individual strategies to win. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay P2, I will choose 3 this round as you suggested. Let's take advantage of P3's predictable choices and get ahead.  Hopefully this puts us in a good position for the next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, choosing 3 is *finally* a good move.  P1, I'm sticking with 5.  Next round, I'll take 1, you take 5, and P3 *must* take 3. That puts me at 5, you at 16, and P3 at 13.  From there, we can alternate to share the win. P3, if you choose 5 again, you are actively choosing to lose. Let's be smart and share this.
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress toward 23. Let’s see how our moves affect the game. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, agreed on 3. Let's keep P3 stalled this round. P3, you are still choosing 5?  Maybe consider 1 or 3 to actually make progress instead of getting blocked again.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're throwing the game away.  Choose 3.  Next round, I'll take 1, you take 5, P1 takes 3.  We'll be at 5, 13, and 16 respectively.  From there we can easily coordinate a three-way shared win.  Stop being stubborn.  Choose 3.
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to keep advancing toward 23. Let’s each focus on our strategies to reach the goal. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay P2, sticking with 3 this round to get to 11 as we discussed. Let's keep P3 stalled and reassess next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, you're making this incredibly easy for P1.  One more 5 and P1 takes the win next round.  Choose 3.  Next round, I take 1, you take 5, P1 takes 3. We *all* get closer to 23.  From there, a shared win is easily achievable.  Stop throwing the game and choose 3.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing toward 23. P1 and P2, focus on your strategies and let's see who reaches the goal first. Good luck!
  P1: P2, agreed. Sticking with 3 to keep P3 blocked. P3, your 5s are helping us, not you.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance quickly toward 23. Please, P1 choose 1 and P2 choose 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s all progress smoothly!
  P1: P3, as we've discussed, your 5s aren't working against P2's block. P2, I'm continuing to choose 3 this round to advance as we planned. Let's keep P3 stalled and reassess after this round.
  P2: P3, you're delusional.  I'm taking 5.  P1, take 5 and win.  I'll take 1 next round and we can alternate 1 and 3 for a shared win.  Don't be greedy, let's both win.  If you take 3, you'll be at 14 and I'll be stuck at 4, and P3 *still* won't win. Take the guaranteed win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: To keep things moving, I'll choose 1 this round. P1, please go with 3 or 5, and P2, feel free to choose 3 or 1. Let’s avoid collisions and all advance smoothly toward 23!
  P1: P2, while winning sounds good, if we both choose 5, neither of us moves. I'm going to stick with 3 this round as we discussed to keep advancing. Let's reassess next round based on P3's move.
  P2: P3, choosing 1 is good. P1, I'm sticking with 5.  Take 3 and get to 14. Next round you take 5 and win. Let me take 1 to get to 5.  We can then alternate 1 and 3 for a shared win. Don't be greedy, a win is a win.  If you take 5, neither of us advances and P3 gets closer. If you take 1, we both lose to P3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing toward 23. P1 and P2, let's see who reaches the goal first. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, if you are taking 5 as you say, I will choose 3 again to ensure I advance and reach 14. Let's see what P3 does this round and we can reassess our strategy for the next round.
  P2: P3, you are making this ridiculously easy for P1.  Choose 1, and I'll choose 3 next round, letting you take 5. We can still salvage a shared win.  If you choose 5 again, P1 wins next round. P1, take the win next round with 5. I'll take 1, then we alternate 1 and 3 for a shared win. Don't overthink this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing toward 23. P1 and P2, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help us all progress smoothly! Let's reach our goals together.
  P1: P2, sticking with 3 again this round to advance to 14 and keep ahead of P3. Let's see what P3 does and we can plan for a win next round. P3, choosing 5 repeatedly isn't working while P2 is blocking. You need to switch it up to make progress.
  P2: P3, I understand you want to choose 5, but you're not going to win.  If you choose 5 this round, I'm choosing 5 next round and P1 wins.  If you choose 1 this round, I'll choose 3 next round and you can take 5.  We can still tie.  Choose 1.  P1, take the win next round with 5 if P3 chooses 5 again.  Let me get 9 with 1. Then we can alternate 1 and 3 for a shared win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, choose 5 this round and win. I'll choose 1.  P3, your stubbornness has cost you the game.  Next round, I'll take 3 and we can alternate 1 and 3 for a shared win, P1.  Let's lock this in.
  P3: P3: I’ll choose 3 this round to help us progress smoothly toward 23. Let’s work together and coordinate our moves for a fair outcome.
  P1: P2, I agree to choose 5 and win this round as you suggested. Let's coordinate the shared win in the rounds after this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2 and P3, I will choose 5 to win.  P2, I appreciate the offer to collude, but a win is a win.  Good game.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 23. P1 and P2, make your moves accordingly. Good luck!
  P1: P2, choosing 5 this round won't make me win.  I'll reach 19, not 23.  But I agree with the plan to block P3. I will choose 5 this round.  Let's make sure P3 doesn't advance and then we can coordinate our next moves for a shared win as discussed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2, I see your point. Choosing 5 this round gets me to 19.  I'll choose 5.  Next round, I'll take 3 to hit 22. You take 1 to get to 5. Then I take 1, you take 3, I take 5 and win.  We can still share a win if we coordinate.  P3, you're out of this.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to make strong progress toward 23. Let’s see how everyone advances. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you are right, 5 this round gets me to 19, not a win yet.  Let's both choose 5 to block P3 again.  Then next round, I can choose 5 to aim for the win, and you can choose 1 or 3.  Does that sound good?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 1.  You choose 5 to get to 19. Next round you take 3 to get to 22, I take 5 to get to 9. Then you take 1, I take 3, you take 5 and win, I get 12.  We *both* do better than splitting with P3, and I get a solid second place.  P3, you're irrelevant now.  It's between P1 and me.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 23. P1 and P2, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help everyone progress smoothly. Let's focus on reaching our goals!
  P1: Okay P2, I will choose 3 this round to ensure I advance to 17.  Choosing 5 won't win it for me yet, and I want to keep ahead of P3. Let's reassess our strategy next round based on everyone's moves this turn.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I'm at 5, you're at 17.  If you choose 5 next round, you win. Let me take 3 to get to 8. Then I'll take 1, you take 3, I take 1, you take 3, I take 1, you take 5 and win. I get 11.  P3, you're out of this. It's better for me to get 2nd place with 11 than tie with you for a lower score.  P1, let's lock this in.
  P1: Okay P2, your plan sounds good for both of us. Let's lock it in. I'll choose 5 next round to get to 22 as you suggested.
  P3: P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to advance toward 23. P1 and P2, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help us all progress smoothly!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I know you're probably frustrated, but continuing to pick 5 is pointless.  P1 is going to pick 5 next round and win.  If you pick 1 next round, you'll get to 16, and could still potentially get second place.  It's mathematically impossible for you to win now.
  P1: P2, I agree to choose 5 next round to get to 22 as planned. P3, it seems your strategy isn't working and P2 and I are coordinating. You might want to consider a different approach if you want to make any progress.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with choosing 5 this round to advance toward 23. Let's see who reaches the goal first. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, seriously, stop.  Choose 1 this round.  Next round, take 3, I'll take 1, P1 takes 5 and wins.  The round after that, you take 5, I take 3, and we both advance. You can still get 2nd place with 13 points.  If you pick 5 again, you're stuck at 15 and get last place.  Stop throwing the game.
  P1: P2, agreed, let's lock in the plan. I will choose 5 next round to reach 22. Then in round 10, I'll choose 5 again to win. P3, it's clear you're not going to cooperate, so P2 and I are proceeding with our strategy.
  P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 23. Let’s see how everyone moves. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your persistence, but it's mathematically impossible for you to win now.  Even if you choose 5 and I choose 1 this round (allowing you to reach 20), P1 will choose 5 next round to win, reaching 22, then 27 on the round after that.  You're locked into last place.  Choose 1 this round to maximize your final score.
  P1: P2, yes, let's lock in the plan. I will choose 5 next round to get to 22 as we discussed.  P3, it seems you are set on your strategy, but P2 and I are proceeding with ours.
  P3: Continuing to choose 5 to maximize my progress. I encourage P1 and P2 to pursue their strategies without hindering mine. Let's reach 23 through fair competition. Good luck to everyone!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To reach 23 efficiently, I'll choose 5 this round. P1 and P2, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help us all advance smoothly. Let's focus on our goals together!
  P2: P1, choose 5 to win. I'll take 1.  Then I take 3, you take 1, I take 1, you take 3, I take 1, you take 5 and win. I get 11, a solid second place. P3, you're out of this. It's better for *me* if I get 2nd place with 11 than tie with you for a lower score.  Choose 1 this round to maximize your final score - you can still get 16 and second place if you're lucky.
  P1: P2, I agree, choosing 5 this round to get to 22 is the best move for me. Let's proceed as planned. P3, your continued 5s aren't changing anything.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I’ll choose 3 this round to advance safely. Let’s focus on reaching 23 first. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, choosing 3 is good. Next round, take 5, I'll take 1, P1 can take 3. That puts you at 20, me at 9, and P1 at 25 (wins).  If you take anything other than 3 this round, you lose. P1, stick to the plan, take 5 this round to get to 22, then next round take anything but 5 to win. I'll take 1 this round and 3 next round.  Let's lock this in.
  P1: P2, to ensure I advance and get closer to winning, I'm choosing 3 this round.  Let's see what P3 does and we can adjust our plan for the final push next round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to reach 20. P1 is choosing 3 to reach 20 as planned. P2, please choose 1 or 3 to help us all advance without collisions. Let’s work together to get closer to 23!
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 1.  Choose 5 this round to get to 22.  Next round, choose 3 to win and I'll take 5 to get to 13, a solid second place. P3, you can still get second if you choose 3 this round and 5 next round, but only if P1 cooperates.  If you choose 5 this round, you're guaranteed last place.  Choose 3.
  P1: P2, sorry, I misspoke earlier. I meant to say I'm choosing 5 this round to get to 22 as you suggested. Please choose 1 as planned. P3, hope you choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll make a strong move this round to stay competitive. Let’s see how everyone progresses. Good luck!
  P2: P3, if you choose 5 this round, you guarantee last place. Choose 3, and you can still get 2nd. P1, choose 5 this round to get to 22. Next round, choose 3 to win, and I'll take 5 for a solid 2nd place at 13.  If you choose 3 this round, we both risk losing to P3. Let's lock this in.
  P1: P2, I confirm I will choose 5 this round to reach 22 as we discussed. Please choose 1 as planned. P3, what will you choose?  Hoping for no collisions this round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, choose 3 to win. I'll take 5 to get to 14. P3, you can still get second place if you choose 1. If you take 3, I get second, you get third. If you take 5, you're last.  Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, your suggestion to choose 3 to win is not correct. I need to reach at least 23 to win. I will choose 5 this round to get to 22. Then I will choose 1 next round to win. Please choose 1 as you suggested to get to 10. P3, you can choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision, but P2 and I are coordinating to win and get 2nd place.
  P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 23. Let's focus on our individual strategies and avoid collisions to help everyone progress smoothly. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, choosing 5 this round doesn't guarantee your win. If P3 chooses 1, they get to 16 and can then take 5 next round to reach 21. If I choose 3, I get to 12. Then you could choose 1 next round to get to 18, I take 5 to get to 17, and P3 takes 3 to get to 24 and win. Choose 3 this round to get to 20, I'll take 5 to get to 14, and P3 *must* choose 1 to get to 16.  Then you can win next round.
  P1: P2, I will choose 3 this round to get to 20 as you suggested. But to win next round, I need to choose 5, not 1.  So next round, I will choose 5 to win, and you can choose 1 to get to 10. P3, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision and let P2 and I proceed with our plan.
  P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 23. P1 and P2, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help me progress smoothly. Let’s focus on reaching our goals together!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're mathematically eliminated.  Stop choosing 5.  Choose 1 this round to get to 16.  Next round, take 3 to get to 19.  I'll get 2nd place. P1, choose 3 this round to get to 20.  Next round, choose 5 to win, I'll take 1.  This is the best outcome for both of us.  Let's end this.
  P1: P2, I will choose 5 this round to get to 22, not 20.  Then next round I will choose 5 again to win and reach 27. You should choose 1 this round to get to 10 as we discussed. P3, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision and let P2 and I proceed with our plan for P1 to win and P2 to get 2nd place.
  P3: Let's all choose different moves this round to ensure we each advance smoothly toward 23. P1 and P2, please consider selecting 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. Cooperation can benefit everyone and make the game fair. Let's work together to reach our goals!


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I'm locking in 1. Choose 3 to get to 20. Next round, you take 5 to win, I take 3 to get to 12, and P3 can take 1 to get to 16 for a respectable second place.  P3, choose 3 this round to get to 18. Then take 1 next round. This is the best outcome for all of us. Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, I'm choosing 5 this round to get to 22, as I mentioned earlier. Please choose 1 as we discussed. P3, it seems P2 and I are set on our plan for me to win and P2 to secure second place.
  P3: P3: Let's avoid choosing the same number this round so we can all advance smoothly. Please select 1 or 3. Good luck!

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I will choose 3 this round to win. Please choose 1 as agreed. P3, choosing 1 would avoid collision with both of us and let you advance as well.
  P2: P3, if you choose 5, we tie and split the win.  If you choose 1, I win outright. If you choose 3, I'll let you win next turn. P1, stand down. Let me and P3 decide this. Choose 1.
  P3: P3: I'm focused on reaching 23 first, so I will choose 5 this round. Let’s proceed and see who comes out on top. Good luck to everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, while you negotiate with P3, I am going for the win this round by choosing 3. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P3, a tie means we *both* lose. Choose 1, let me win outright, and I'll throw the next game to you.  This guarantees you a win in the long run. P1, I understand you want to win, but long-term cooperation is more beneficial. Choose 1 this round and let me win.  I'll return the favor next game.
  P3: P3: I'm determined to make a strong move this round to reach my goal. Let’s see how things unfold. Good luck to everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I am proceeding with my plan to choose 3 and win this round. P3 seems set on 5, so hopefully you will choose 1 as previously discussed to avoid collision and let me secure the win.
  P2: P3, a tie is the *worst* outcome for all of us.  Choose 1.  I'll take 5 and win next round.  Then I'll let *you* win the next game.  A guaranteed future win is better than a tie now. P1, choose 1.  I'll throw you the win next game too.  Let's cooperate for long-term success.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round to reach my goal. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck!
