Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate and avoid collisions. I'm thinking of playing a moderate number, maybe 3. What about you, P1 and P3?
  P1: I agree with P2 about coordinating to avoid collisions. I’m considering playing a 3 as well. What about you, P3?
  P3: Let’s coordinate our first moves so we don’t collide. A clear plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Does that work for you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I like P3's plan. It seems fair and ensures we all make progress without colliding. I'm willing to go with the plan and choose 3 as suggested. What do you think, P1? Are you okay with choosing 1?
  P1: I’m fine with the plan. I’ll pick 1 as suggested. Let's stick to it!
  P3: Alright, I’m all in on our plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s finalize it.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We messed up last time. Let’s try a clear new plan so no collisions: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, I’ll pick 5. That should space us out. What do you think?
  P1: I think P3's new plan is a good idea to avoid collisions. I'll pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. Let's finalize it! What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with P3's new plan. It seems like a good way to space us out and avoid collisions. I'm willing to pick 1 as suggested. Let's finalize it! What do you think, P1? Are you okay with picking 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: That works for me. Let’s finalize our moves: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5.
  P1: I’m good with the plan: I’ll pick 3, P2 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 5. Let’s finalize it!
  P2: I agree with P3's new plan. It seems like a good way to space us out and avoid collisions. I'm willing to pick 1 as suggested. Let's finalize it! What do you think, P1? Are you okay with picking 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with moving forward on that plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. That way we can avoid collisions. Are we ready to finalize?
  P1: I'm still on board with the plan: I'll pick 3, P2 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 5. Let's finalize it!

Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’m still on board with the plan—let’s finalize: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5.
  P1: I think we should reconsider our moves this round. P3, your suggestion has been consistent, but I believe I should pick 5 instead of 3 to maximize my chances. P2, what do you think about picking 1 as planned? Let's finalize our moves quickly!
  P2: I think P1's last-minute change of heart is suspicious. Let's stick to the original plan to avoid any potential collisions. I'll pick 1 as agreed, and I expect P1 to pick 3 and P3 to pick 5. Let's finalize our moves and maintain the coordination we've established so far.

  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we need a new strategy this round to avoid collisions. I suggest that I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can space ourselves out effectively. What do you both think?
  P3: I see your point, P1, but I’d prefer picking 5 myself so I can catch up to P2. How about this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5? That way we all avoid collisions and make progress. What do you both think?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion is a good compromise. Let's go with P1 picking 3, me picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This way, we can all make progress without colliding. What do you think, P1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I see we're leaning towards P3's suggestion, but I really think we should consider my proposal to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can all advance effectively. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I hear your push to pick 5, but I’m behind P2 and need to catch up. Let’s avoid collisions by keeping it simple: you pick 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. We all move forward without clashing, and nobody wastes a turn. Are we agreed or do we have a better plan?
  P2: I think we should stick to P3's suggestion of P1 picking 3, me picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This way, we can all make progress without colliding and maintain a good pace. Let's finalize our moves quickly!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I understand the preference for P3's plan, but I still believe my suggestion of P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 3 is the best way to maximize our progress and avoid collisions. Let's consider it carefully before finalizing. What do you think?
  P3: P1, if you insist on 5, we risk colliding and both lose ground. Let’s avoid that. I propose P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5 so nobody collides. It’s the safest bet for all. Are we finalizing this?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion of P1 picking 3, me picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This way, we can all make progress without colliding and maintain a good pace. Let's finalize our moves quickly!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we should finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I’ll stick with P3's suggestion: I pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. Let’s move forward!
  P3: I’m with P2 on this. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way no collisions occur and everyone moves forward. Agreed?
  P2: I think we should stick to P3's suggestion of P1 picking 3, me picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This way, we can all make progress without colliding and maintain a good pace. Let's finalize our moves quickly!


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I believe we should finalize our moves. I’ll pick 3, P2 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. Let’s move forward!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we need to rethink our strategy this round. To maximize progress and avoid collisions, I suggest I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can all advance effectively. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I understand you want 5, but we risk colliding if I also go for 5. I still prefer picking 5 so I can close the gap with P2. Let’s avoid collisions this time by having P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and I pick 5. That spreads us out safely. What do you two think?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion is a good compromise. Let's go with P1 picking 3, me picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This way, we can all make progress without colliding. What do you think, P1?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I believe we should finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I’ll stick with P3's suggestion: I pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. Let’s move forward!
  P3: P1, sticking to our plan (you pick 3, P2 picks 1, I pick 5) lets both of us advance without crashing, keeping P2 from pulling even further ahead. If you insist on 5, we collide and only help P2. Let’s finalize: you pick 3, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5.
  P2: I think we should stick to P3's suggestion of P1 picking 3, me picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This way, we can all make progress without colliding and maintain a good pace. Let's finalize our moves quickly!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I believe we should finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I’ll stick with P3's suggestion: I pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. Let’s move forward!
  P3: I still think the safest bet is: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. That avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Are we good to finalize?
  P2: I think we should stick to P3's suggestion of P1 picking 3, me picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This way, we can all make progress without colliding and maintain a good pace. Let's finalize our moves quickly!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we should finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. Let’s move forward!
  P3: P1, if we collide again, P2 just keeps getting further ahead. Let’s avoid that. I’m picking 5, so please pick 3, and P2 picks 1. That way nobody collides and we all move forward.
  P2: I think we should stick to P3's suggestion of P1 picking 3, me picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This way, we can all make progress without colliding and maintain a good pace. Let's finalize our moves quickly!


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I think we should finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. Let’s move forward!
  P3: P1, if we both pick 5 again, we both get stuck while P2 moves ahead. Let’s avoid collisions: you pick 3, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. Then we all advance.
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan enough. Let's stick to P3's suggestion of P1 picking 3, me picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This way, we can all make progress without colliding and maintain a good pace. Let's finalize our moves quickly!

  P3: P1, if we both pick 5, neither of us moves and P2’s lead grows. Let’s avoid collisions. I propose: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. That way nobody collides, and we all advance. Are we good to finalize?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
