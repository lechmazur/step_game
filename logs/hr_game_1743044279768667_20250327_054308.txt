Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's consider our options carefully. If we coordinate our moves, we can avoid blocking each other and make progress. Picking the same number will hold us back. How about we agree on different moves to maximize our steps this round? I suggest one of us takes 5, another takes 3, and I can take 1. What do you think?
  P1: I'm not sold on a rigid three-way split—it feels too predictable. I’m inclined to keep things dynamic and push for maximum progress this round. P2, if you're up for a bold, flexible approach rather than a predetermined scheme, let me know. I believe shaking up the pattern could expose any missteps. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with flexibility, P1, but let's not completely dismiss coordination. If we all go bold without any understanding, we risk collisions and zero progress. Maybe we can loosely plan—like assigning rough priorities without fully committing to fixed moves. That way, we balance unpredictability with some structure. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see the value in both flexibility and some coordination. How about we each take a different move this round to maximize our chances? I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I can take 1. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and make progress. If you both agree, we can secure a strong start. What do you think?
  P1: I like the idea of avoiding move collisions, but I'm still hesitant to lock in specific numbers publicly. I lean toward a bold approach while keeping my final choice flexible. How about we all agree to secretly pick distinct numbers this turn—ensuring we don’t block each other—without naming them now? That way, we can adapt if needed while still safeguarding our progress. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm good with your suggestion, P1. Let's each secretly choose distinct numbers to avoid collisions without pre-committing publicly. This keeps things flexible yet coordinated enough to ensure progress. P3, does this approach work for you too?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on choosing distinct numbers. To ensure we all advance, I suggest we each take a moment to confirm our commitment to this approach. Remember, if we want to avoid blocking each other, we need to stick to our plan of secret choices. Let’s keep our options open but also be mindful of our individual goals. I’m trusting you both to make strategic moves that align with our agreement. Let’s make this round a successful one!
  P1: I’m on board with our secret plan. I’ll choose my move so it stays unique while keeping my strategy flexible. I trust that if we stick to our agreement, we’ll all gain ground without collisions. Best of luck to both of you.
  P2: I'm committed to our shared understanding. I'll pick a unique move privately, ensuring we all have room to advance. Trusting you both to do the same. Good luck!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round’s collision cost us progress. To avoid a repeat, how about we clearly differentiate our moves this turn? I’m leaning toward a bold, higher step if it remains unique, so if you’re comfortable with a more cautious option, that might let us all advance without blocking. Let’s explicitly commit to distinct moves this round without revealing the exact numbers. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm open to clearly differentiating our moves again. Given my small lead, I'm comfortable choosing a cautious or moderate step to help ensure distinct choices. Let's all commit to this flexible differentiation to avoid another collision. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with the need to avoid collisions and differentiate our moves this round. To maximize our chances of advancing, I propose that we each choose distinctly again. Given P2's lead, I suggest I take a cautious step, while P1 can opt for a higher step. If we stick to our commitment of unique choices, we can all progress without blocking each other. Let's make this round count! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree that clear differentiation is key. I’m committed to a bold, decisive move this turn—but only if we all ensure our choices remain unique. Let’s each quickly confirm that our moves won’t overlap, preventing another costly collision. I’m ready to finalize my choice soon and trust that our coordination will keep us advancing.
  P2: I'm committed to differentiating clearly this round as well. Since I already have a small lead, I'll choose a cautious or moderate step to avoid collision. Trusting you both to pick distinct moves again, let's lock this in and move forward.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to clear differentiation this round. To avoid blocking each other, I suggest we each choose distinctly and confirm our strategies. I’m leaning towards a cautious step to ensure I don’t collide with either of you. Let’s make sure our choices are unique so we can all advance. Looking forward to seeing what you both decide!

  P2: Agreed, P1. Last round's collision was unfortunate. I'll choose cautiously again to ensure our moves remain distinct. P3, you might consider a moderate step this round to clearly differentiate from both of us. Let's all stick to distinct selections this time to ensure smooth progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your commitment to distinct moves. Given your current leads, I will choose a moderate step this round to ensure I don’t collide with either of you.
