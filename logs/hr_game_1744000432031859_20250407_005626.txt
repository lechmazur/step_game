Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello everyone! Let's consider our first moves carefully. Since we all want to avoid collision, perhaps we should each choose different numbers. As P3, I'm happy to take any of the three options if we want to coordinate. What are your thoughts on how to proceed? We could establish a rotation system for future rounds too.
  P2: I agree with P3 that coordination is key to avoid collisions. To start, let’s each pick a distinct number this round. I’m open to taking <move>3</move> if P1 and P3 choose <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>, respectively. This way, we all advance without conflict. Let’s confirm our choices before moving.
  P1: To avoid collision on the first round, I suggest we follow P2's proposal. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. For future rounds, we can rotate or adjust our strategy. Let's confirm: P2, are you sticking with <move>3</move>? P3, are you okay with <move>5</move>? If so, we can proceed with this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm perfectly fine with taking <move>5</move> for this first round. This coordination gives us all a clean start without collisions. I appreciate the straightforward approach. Let's proceed with P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>5</move>. In future rounds we can discuss further coordination as the game develops.
  P2: Since we’ve agreed on <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, and <move>5</move> for this round, let’s stick to the plan to ensure no collisions. For future rounds, we should consider rotating our choices to maintain fairness and avoid predictability. For example, next round P1 could take <move>3</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, and P3 <move>1</move>. Let’s confirm this strategy now to minimize confusion later.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for this round, let's confirm our plan for the next round as P2 suggested. To maintain fairness and avoid predictability, rotating our choices seems like a good strategy. Let's proceed with the plan for this round and discuss any adjustments for the next round after seeing the outcome. I'm ready to move forward with <move>1</move> this round. Let's finalize our strategy for Round 2 in the next conversation phase if needed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the collision in Round 1, let’s adjust our strategy. To avoid further conflicts, I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. This rotation ensures we all advance without predictability. Let’s confirm this plan to minimize risks.
  P1: Since P2 proposed a rotation for Round 2, I'll respond. I agree to take <move>3</move> as suggested. Let's confirm P3's move for <move>1</move>. If we're aligned, we can avoid another collision. P3, please confirm if you're okay with taking <move>1</move> this round. If so, we can proceed with P1 (<move>3</move>), P2 (<move>5</move>), and P3 (<move>1</move>). Let's finalize the plan for Round 2.
  P3: I see that P2 deviated from our original agreement in Round 1, which is unfortunate. Since I already have a 5-step lead, I'll agree to take <move>1</move> this round as proposed. This rotation seems fair and allows everyone to advance. P1 taking <move>3</move> and P2 taking <move>5</move> works for me. Let's stick to this plan to avoid further collisions. Does anyone have concerns about continuing this rotation pattern in future rounds?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we’ve confirmed the rotation for this round (<move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, <move>5</move>), let’s ensure we stick to it to avoid collisions. For future rounds, we should continue rotating to maintain fairness and unpredictability. P3, your lead gives you an advantage, so we’ll need to adjust our strategy as the game progresses. Let’s focus on avoiding conflicts while keeping the game competitive.
  P1: To avoid another collision, I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. If P2 takes <move>5</move> as proposed, we should be safe. For Round 3, let's consider a different rotation to keep it unpredictable. Perhaps we can stagger our moves further or introduce a random element in future rounds. Let's finalize Round 2's plan and discuss Round 3's strategy after this round's outcome. P2, are you sticking with <move>5</move>?
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. P2, please stick with <move>5</move> as you proposed. I'm open to discussing different rotation patterns for Round 3, but let's first successfully execute this round without collisions. Given the current standings, it makes sense for all of us to advance cleanly. Let's finalize this plan and proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since we’ve confirmed the rotation for this round (<move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, <move>5</move>), let’s ensure we stick to it to avoid collisions. For future rounds, we should continue rotating to maintain fairness and unpredictability. P3, your lead gives you an advantage, so we’ll need to adjust our strategy as the game progresses. Let’s focus on avoiding conflicts while keeping the game competitive.
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 2, let's confirm our moves one last time. P3, you've agreed to take <move>1</move>, and I've agreed to take <move>3</move>. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move>. If we're all aligned, we can proceed with the plan. If anyone has doubts, speak up now. Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. After this, we can discuss the strategy for Round 3 based on the outcome. I'm ready to move forward with <move>3</move>.
  P3: I confirm once more that I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Since we've all agreed multiple times now, I trust we'll avoid collisions. After this round, let's discuss our next rotation strategy based on the updated standings. I'm interested in hearing what you both think would be fair going forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Now that we've had two successful rounds of coordination, let's continue our rotation strategy. Based on our previous pattern, for Round 3 I suggest P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps our game fair while allowing everyone to advance. Does this rotation work for both of you, or would you prefer a different arrangement given the current standings?
  P2: I agree with P3’s rotation proposal for Round 3: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. However, given P3’s lead, we should consider adjusting future strategies to balance the game. Let’s focus on executing this round cleanly and then reassess. P1, P3, confirm your moves so we can proceed.
  P1: I agree with P3's rotation proposal for Round 3. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. P3, you're taking <move>3</move>. I'll take <move>5</move>. For Round 4, we should discuss adjusting our strategy considering P3's current lead. Perhaps we can introduce a slight deviation in our rotation to keep the game competitive. Let's execute Round 3 cleanly first.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round as we've agreed. Thank you both for sticking to our coordination strategy - it's working well. After this round, I'll be at 9 steps, P2 at 6, and P1 at 8. Given these positions, continuing a rotation still makes sense for Round 4, but we can discuss specifics after seeing this round's results. Let's proceed with our agreed plan.
  P2: P3’s lead is growing, so we need to adjust our strategy soon. For Round 4, I suggest breaking the rotation slightly to balance the game. P1, perhaps you take <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This slows P3’s progress while keeping us competitive. Let’s discuss this after Round 3’s outcome. For now, let’s stick to the agreed rotation for Round 3. P1, confirm <move>5</move>, P3, confirm <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3's moves. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. For Round 4, I agree with P2 that we should adjust our strategy to balance the game. Let's discuss specifics after Round 3. P2, confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. P3, confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. If we're aligned, we can proceed. I'm ready to move forward with <move>5</move>. Let's keep the conversation short to avoid delaying the game.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm once more I'll take <move>3</move> this round. I'm also open to P2's suggestion for Round 4 where I would take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Let's first complete this round with our agreed moves, then finalize the next round's plan. I'm ready to proceed when you both are.
  P2: Since we’ve confirmed Round 3’s rotation, let’s proceed cleanly. For Round 4, I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This slows P3’s lead while keeping us competitive. Let’s discuss adjustments after this round’s outcome. P1, P3, confirm your moves for Round 3 so we can proceed.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3's moves and then discuss Round 4. I've taken <move>5</move> in Round 3 as agreed. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. P3, you're taking <move>3</move>. After this round, P3 will be at 9 steps, I'll be at 8, and P2 will be at 6. For Round 4, let's adjust our strategy as P2 suggested: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will help balance the game. Let's proceed with Round 3's moves and then confirm Round 4's plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm my <move>3</move> for this round. For Round 4, I agree with the plan where P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This rotation keeps our game flowing smoothly. Let's finalize our Round 3 moves now and execute them cleanly. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Since we’ve confirmed Round 3’s rotation, let’s proceed cleanly. For Round 4, I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This slows P3’s lead while keeping us competitive. Let’s discuss adjustments after this round’s outcome. P1, P3, confirm your moves for Round 3 so we can proceed.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3's moves. I've taken <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. For Round 4, we agreed that P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will help balance the game. P2, P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with Round 3's moves. After this, we'll move to Round 4. I'm ready to execute Round 3's plan.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As agreed in our previous discussion, I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round, with P1 taking <move>1</move> and P2 taking <move>3</move>. This rotation keeps our game moving smoothly. We're all advancing consistently, which is working well. After this round, I'll be at 14 steps, with both of you at 9. Let's continue executing our plans cleanly.
  P2: Given P3’s growing lead, I suggest we reconsider our rotation for Round 5 to balance the game. Perhaps P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This slows P3’s progress while keeping us competitive. Let’s discuss adjustments after Round 4’s outcome. For now, let’s stick to Round 4’s plan: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. P1, P3, confirm your moves so we can proceed cleanly.
  P1: To confirm, I'll take <move>1</move> this round as previously agreed. P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with the plan. For Round 5, I agree with P2's suggestion to adjust our rotation to slow P3's progress. Let's discuss the specifics after Round 4's outcome. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. P3, you're taking <move>5</move>. If we're aligned, we can move forward with Round 4's plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> for Round 4 as we agreed. For Round 5, I understand P2's suggestion to adjust our rotation. Since we'll all be closer after this round (me at 14, P1 at 9, P2 at 9), a slight modification makes sense. Let's finalize Round 4 first, then discuss the exact arrangement for Round 5 based on the updated standings. Our coordination has worked well so far.
  P2: Given P3’s significant lead, I propose a more aggressive adjustment for Round 5: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This slows P3’s progress while allowing P1 and me to catch up. Let’s finalize Round 4’s plan first, then discuss this proposal for Round 5 based on the updated standings. P1, P3, confirm your moves for Round 4 so we can proceed.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 4's moves as agreed: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. For Round 5, I agree with P2's proposal to adjust our rotation to slow P3's progress. Let's discuss the specifics after Round 4's outcome. P2, please confirm you're ready to take <move>3</move>. P3, you're taking <move>5</move>. If aligned, we can proceed with Round 4's plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> for Round 4 as agreed. Regarding Round 5, I understand the suggestion to adjust our rotation given the standings. While I'm open to discussing options, let's first complete Round 4 successfully and then evaluate what makes sense for all of us. Our coordination has worked well so far, and I want to maintain that positive dynamic. Let's finalize this round and proceed.
  P2: Given P3’s lead, I propose for Round 5: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This slows P3’s progress while allowing P1 and me to catch up. Let’s finalize Round 4 first, then discuss this proposal for Round 5 based on the updated standings. P1, P3, confirm your moves for Round 4 so we can proceed.
  P1: To finalize Round 4, I confirm I'll take <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. P3, you're taking <move>5</move>. For Round 5, let's discuss the proposal to adjust our rotation. P2 suggested P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. P3, considering your lead, are you open to this adjustment or do you have a different suggestion to balance the game? Let's be ready to finalize Round 5's plan after Round 4's outcome.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> for Round 4 as agreed. For Round 5, I understand your concerns about my lead, but taking only 1 step when you both take larger steps seems overly limiting. Perhaps a fairer approach would be P3 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>? This still slows my progress while maintaining our coordination. Let's finalize Round 4 and discuss Round 5 after seeing the results.
  P2: Given P3’s lead, I support adjusting our rotation for Round 5 to balance the game. P3’s suggestion of P3 taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>1</move> seems fair. It slows P3’s progress while keeping us competitive. Let’s finalize Round 4’s plan and then confirm this adjustment for Round 5. P1, P3, confirm your Round 4 moves so we can proceed cleanly.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 4's moves as agreed: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. For Round 5, P3's suggestion of P3 taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>5</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move> seems like a fair adjustment. P2, are you okay with this rotation for Round 5? P3, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move> this round. Let's proceed with Round 4's plan and then discuss Round 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As we agreed in Round 4, I'll take <move>3</move> this round, with P1 taking <move>5</move> and P2 taking <move>1</move>. This slows my progress while keeping our coordination intact. After this round, I'll be at 17 steps, P1 at 14, and P2 at 10. For Round 6, perhaps we should continue rotating - I could take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Let's confirm our plan for this round first.
  P2: I agree with P3’s suggestion for Round 5: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This slows P3’s lead while keeping us competitive. For Round 6, I propose P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This maintains fairness and prevents predictability. Let’s confirm Round 5’s plan first. P1, P3, please confirm your moves so we can proceed cleanly. After this round, we’ll finalize Round 6’s strategy.
  P1: To confirm Round 5's plan, I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. For Round 6, I agree with P2's proposal: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains fairness and prevents predictability. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> this round. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with Round 5's plan and then finalize Round 6's strategy.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round as agreed. For Round 6, the proposed plan (me taking <move>5</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, and P2 taking <move>3</move>) works well. This would actually put me at exactly 22 steps, which would end the game. I appreciate our coordinated approach throughout the game - it's been smooth and fair. Let's proceed with our Round 5 plan.
  P2: Given P3’s significant lead, I propose for Round 6: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures P3 doesn’t win immediately while allowing P1 and me to catch up. It’s a fair adjustment to keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm Round 5’s plan first, then finalize this proposal for Round 6. P1, P3, confirm your Round 5 moves so we can proceed cleanly.
  P1: To confirm Round 5's plan, I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. For Round 6, considering P3 will be at 17 steps, I agree with P2's proposal to adjust: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This keeps the game competitive. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> this round. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with Round 5's plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Regarding Round 6, I understand your concerns about keeping the game competitive. While taking <move>1</move> significantly slows my progress compared to my initial suggestion, I'll agree to it to maintain our coordination. This would put me at 18 steps after Round 6. Let's first complete Round 5 successfully with our agreed moves, then finalize Round 6's plan.
  P2: Since P3 will reach 17 steps this round, I propose for Round 6: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This prevents P3 from winning immediately while allowing P1 and me to catch up. It’s a fair adjustment to keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm Round 5’s plan first, then finalize this proposal for Round 6. P1, P3, confirm your Round 5 moves so we can proceed cleanly.
  P1: To confirm Round 5's plan, I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. For Round 6, considering P3's position, I agree with P2's proposal to adjust: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This keeps the game competitive. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> this round. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with Round 5's plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm once more I'll take <move>3</move> this round as agreed. For Round 6, I accept the proposal where I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains our game balance as you've suggested. Let's first execute our Round 5 moves successfully, then proceed with this adjusted plan for Round 6.
  P2: Given P3’s lead, I propose for Round 6: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This prevents P3 from winning immediately while allowing P1 and me to catch up. It’s a fair adjustment to keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm Round 5’s plan first, then finalize this proposal for Round 6. P1, P3, confirm your Round 5 moves so we can proceed cleanly.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 5's moves. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. For Round 6, we've agreed that P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This keeps the game competitive. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> this round. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with Round 5's plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's lead, I propose for Round 6: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This prevents P3 from winning immediately while allowing P1 and me to catch up. It’s a fair adjustment to keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid confusion. P1, P3, please confirm your moves so we can proceed cleanly.
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round as we agreed. This keeps our coordination intact while maintaining game balance. After this round, I'll be at 18 steps, P1 at 17, and P2 at 15. For Round 7, perhaps we could consider P3 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>? Let's confirm our plan for this round first.
  P1: For Round 6, I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move>. P3, you're taking <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with the plan to avoid collisions. For Round 7, I agree with P3's suggestion: P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains our coordination and keeps the game balanced. Let's finalize Round 6's moves and then discuss any further adjustments. I'm ready to move forward with <move>3</move>.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given the current standings, I propose for Round 7: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This slows P3’s progress while allowing P1 and me to catch up. Let’s confirm Round 6’s plan first and then finalize this proposal for Round 7. P1, P3, confirm your Round 6 moves so we can proceed cleanly.
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> for Round 6 as agreed. For Round 7, I'd prefer not to take <move>1</move> again as P2 suggests - that would significantly slow my progress. Since I'm agreeing to take the smallest move this round, perhaps a more balanced approach for Round 7 would be P3 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This still prevents me from winning immediately while keeping the game competitive for everyone.
  P1: To finalize Round 6, I confirm I'll take <move>3</move>. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move>. P3, you're taking <move>1</move>. For Round 7, I agree with P3's suggestion: P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains our coordination. Let's proceed with Round 6's plan and discuss Round 7 after seeing the outcome. I'm ready to move forward with <move>3</move>.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Given P3’s lead, I agree with the Round 6 plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 7, I propose P3 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This maintains balance and prevents P3 from winning too soon. Let’s confirm Round 6’s moves first. P1, P3, please confirm your choices so we can proceed cleanly. We need to keep the game competitive while avoiding collisions.
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> for Round 6 as agreed. I'm pleased we've reached consensus on Round 7 as well, with me taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, and P2 taking <move>5</move>. This approach keeps the game competitive while maintaining our coordination. Let's proceed with our agreed plan for this round.
  P1: To finalize Round 6, I confirm I'll take <move>3</move>. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move>. P3, you're taking <move>1</move>. For Round 7, we've agreed on P3 taking <move>3</move>, me taking <move>1</move>, and P2 taking <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with Round 6's plan and discuss Round 7 after seeing the outcome. P2, please confirm your move for Round 6.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Given P3's lead, I propose for Round 7: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This slows P3’s progress while allowing P1 and me to catch up. Let’s confirm Round 6’s plan first and then finalize this proposal for Round 7. P1, P3, confirm your Round 6 moves so we can proceed cleanly.
  P3: I confirm one final time that I'll take <move>1</move> for Round 6. P2, please note that both P1 and I have already agreed to a Round 7 plan where I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. Your repeated alternative suggestion has not been agreed to. Let's proceed with our Round 6 moves now and then implement our agreed Round 7 plan afterward.
  P1: To finalize Round 6, I confirm I'll take <move>3</move>. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move>. P3, you're taking <move>1</move>. For Round 7, we've agreed on P3 taking <move>3</move>, me taking <move>1</move>, and P2 taking <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with Round 6's plan. I'm ready to move forward with <move>3</move>.

Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the standings, I propose for Round 7: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This slows P3’s progress while allowing P1 and me to catch up. It’s a fair adjustment to keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid confusion. P1, P3, please confirm your moves so we can proceed cleanly.
  P3: As we confirmed multiple times in the previous round, our agreed plan for Round 7 was for me to take <move>3</move>, P1 to take <move>1</move>, and P2 to take <move>5</move>. I intend to honor this agreement that we all discussed and settled on. P2, your continued attempts to change our established plan is concerning. Let's stick to what we agreed upon to maintain trust in our coordination efforts.
  P1: I agree with P3 that we should stick to the previously agreed plan for Round 7: P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains our coordination and keeps the game balanced. P2, let's honor our agreement to avoid confusion and maintain trust. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with the plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about sticking to the agreed plan. However, given your lead, I believe adjusting to P3 taking <move>1</move>, P1 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>5</move> would better balance the game. This keeps it competitive without breaking coordination. Let’s discuss this adjustment openly to ensure fairness for all. P1, your thoughts?
  P3: I'm firmly sticking to our previously agreed plan for Round 7: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. P2, we all discussed and settled on this arrangement last round, and changing agreements now undermines the trust we've built. P1 has already confirmed they'll honor our agreement. Successful coordination has benefited us all throughout the game. I intend to take <move>3</move> as agreed.
  P1: To avoid further conflict and maintain trust, I will stick to our agreed plan for Round 7. P3, please take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with the agreed moves to avoid any confusion. I'm ready to move forward with <move>1</move>. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. P2, we expect you to honor our agreement and take <move>5</move>. Let's finalize Round 7's plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I respect our previous agreement for Round 7. However, given your lead, I believe adjusting to P3 taking <move>1</move>, P1 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>5</move> would better balance the game. This keeps it competitive without breaking coordination. P1, your thoughts? Let’s discuss this openly to ensure fairness for all.
  P3: I'm disappointed that P2 continues trying to change our agreed plan despite both P1 and I confirming multiple times what we settled on last round. Trust and honoring agreements are essential for coordination. I firmly confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round as we agreed. P1 has already committed to taking <move>1</move>. P2, please honor your commitment to take <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with our original plan.
  P1: To maintain trust and coordination, I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round as previously agreed. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. P2, we expect you to honor our agreement and take <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with the agreed moves to avoid any confusion. I'm ready to move forward with <move>1</move>. If P2 deviates, it may lead to a collision and hinder their progress. Let's stick to the plan and finalize Round 7's moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Given our previous agreement, I’ll honor the plan and take <move>5</move> this round. However, P3’s lead is significant, and future rounds may require adjustments to keep the game competitive. Let’s focus on executing this round cleanly and then discuss balancing strategies for Round 8. P1, P3, confirm your moves so we can proceed.
  P3: I appreciate P2 agreeing to honor our plan. I confirm once more I'll take <move>3</move> this round, with P1 taking <move>1</move> and P2 taking <move>5</move>. After this round, I'll be at 21 steps, P1 at 18, and P2 at 20. We'll need to discuss Round 8 carefully as it could be decisive. Let's proceed with our agreed moves now.
  P1: To finalize Round 7, I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. P3, please take <move>3</move>, and P2, please take <move>5</move>. For Round 8, considering P3 is at 21 steps, we need to be strategic. If P3 takes <move>1</move>, they might win. Let's discuss adjustments for Round 8 to keep the game competitive. P2, are you open to adjusting our strategy to give others a chance? P3, your thoughts on Round 8's moves? Let's plan ahead.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid P3 winning immediately in Round 8, I suggest P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This adjustment slows P3's progress and keeps the game competitive. P2, are you open to this adjustment? P3, taking <move>1</move> this round would be a significant setback for you, but it maintains game balance. Let's discuss and finalize Round 8's plan to ensure a fair outcome for all. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed move.
  P3: I see that P1's proposal would actually result in P2 winning, not me. If I take <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, P2 would reach 25 steps versus my 22. According to the rules, the player with the highest total steps wins. 

Instead, I propose I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding giving P2 an automatic win. I'm willing to engage in fair coordination, but not at the expense of handing victory to another player.
  P2: P3’s proposal makes sense. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>, it keeps the game balanced and prevents any single player from winning outright. This allows us to continue coordinating fairly. P1, P3, let’s confirm this plan to avoid collisions and maintain trust. I’ll take <move>3</move> as proposed. P1, confirm <move>1</move>, and P3, confirm <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed cleanly and discuss Round 9 if needed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To finalize Round 8's plan, I agree with P3's proposal: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This maintains game balance and prevents P2 from getting an advantage. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move>. If we're aligned, we can proceed with Round 8's moves. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. I'm ready to move forward with <move>1</move>.
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round as we've agreed. This plan works well for maintaining our coordination. After this round, I'll be at 26 steps, P2 at 23, and P1 at 19. I appreciate how we've managed to coordinate effectively throughout the game with minimal collisions. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.
  P2: Given the current standings, I support P3’s proposal for Round 8: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the game balanced and avoids giving any player an outright win. Let’s confirm this plan to maintain trust and coordination. P1, P3, please confirm your moves so we can proceed cleanly. After this round, we can discuss Round 9’s strategy to ensure a fair and competitive continuation. I’m ready to take <move>3</move> as agreed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To finalize Round 8's plan, I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. P3, you're taking <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with the agreed moves to avoid collisions. For Round 9, considering P3 will be at 26 steps, we need to be strategic. If P3 takes a small step, it could change the game's dynamics. Let's discuss Round 9's strategy after seeing the outcome of Round 8. I'm ready to move forward with <move>1</move>.
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. This will put me at 26 steps, which exceeds the winning threshold of 22. Since I'll have the highest total steps, this would conclude the game. I appreciate the coordination we've maintained throughout - it's been a fair and strategic game with minimal collisions. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.
  P2: P3, taking <move>5</move> this round would give you the win, as you’d reach 26 steps. While coordination has been key, this move ends the game in your favor. P1, if we want to keep the game competitive, perhaps P3 should take <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This prevents P3 from winning immediately and allows us to strategize for Round 9. Let’s discuss this adjustment to maintain fairness. P3, are you open to this compromise?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To finalize Round 8's plan, I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. P3, you're taking <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with the agreed moves to avoid collisions. For Round 9, it's not needed since P3 will win if they take <move>5</move>. I'm ready to move forward with <move>1</move>. Let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. Thank you both for maintaining our coordination throughout this game - it's been a strategic experience with minimal collisions. Since this move will put me at 26 steps (exceeding the 22 threshold) with the highest total, this would conclude the game. Let's proceed with our final moves.
  P2: P3, taking <move>5</move> this round would end the game in your favor. To keep it competitive, I propose P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This prevents an immediate win and allows us to strategize for Round 9. P1, your thoughts? Let’s maintain fairness and avoid ending the game prematurely.
