P3\u2019s plan is a start, but I\u2019d tweak it slightly for balance. How about I take 5 (to 11), P3 takes 3 (to 5), and P2 takes 5 (to 18)? This helps me recover, gives P3 progress, and keeps P2 advancing toward the goal without too much risk of collision next round. We\u2019re still early enough to adjust strategies later. What do you both think of this adjustment? I\u2019m open to feedback. Let\u2019s aim for a fair round."}
