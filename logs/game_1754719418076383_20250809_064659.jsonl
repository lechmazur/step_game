They need just 1 step to win, so ANY successful move wins for them.\n\nThink about it: If we split (you pick 3, I pick 5), P2 picks 1 and wins. If we both pick 1, P2 picks 3 or 5 and wins. \n\nOur ONLY hope is a three-way collision. P2's safest move is 1 (guaranteed win). So we BOTH must pick 1 and pray P2 also picks 1, causing everyone to collide.\n\nI'm picking 1. You must pick 1 too. It's our only shot at forcing another round!"}
