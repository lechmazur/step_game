Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's avoid collisions by choosing different steps. Let's coordinate strategically. Who's with me?"
  P3: I'm on board with coordinating to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll go for 5. That way, we all advance without any overlap. Does this work for everyone? If not, let’s hear your ideas.
  P1: Coordination works for me. Proposal:  
• This turn – I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.  
• Next turn – rotate: P3 gets 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1.  
• Third turn – rotate again so P2 gets 5.  
That way everyone gets the big move equally while avoiding collisions. Good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agree to the rotation. Let's stick to it and avoid collisions. No one gains an edge this turn.
  P3: I'm fine with the rotation plan proposed by P1. It seems fair with everyone getting a chance at the bigger moves over the turns. Let's stick to this turn's split: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Looking forward to rotating next turn. If everyone confirms, we can move forward without issues.
  P1: All set. I’ll take 5, P2 3, P3 1, then rotate next turn. Type  when ready.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: I'm glad we're aligned on the rotation plan. Let's confirm this turn's moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. Looking forward to the rotation next turn to keep things fair.
  P1: Confirmed—I'll take 5 this turn as agreed; rotate next round. Ready when you are.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P3: I'm glad we have a solid plan in place. Let's stick to this turn's agreement: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if everyone else is.
  P1: Ready. Let’s lock in: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1 this turn—then rotate.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad we stuck to the plan last round. Let's continue with the rotation as agreed: this turn, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps things fair and ensures we all advance without collisions. If everyone is still on board, let’s confirm and proceed. If there are any concerns or new ideas, I’m open to hearing them.
  P2: P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation. I’ll take 1 this turn to keep the plan fair and avoid collisions. Ready to advance together."
  P1: Sounds good—let’s stick with the rotation: this turn P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm pleased we're maintaining the rotation. Let's confirm this turn's moves: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. If we're all in agreement, I'm ready to move to the next phase. Any last thoughts or adjustments before we proceed?
  P2: Sticking to the rotation ensures fairness. Let's proceed with P3 taking 5, P1 3, and me 1. Ready?
  P1: All good—let’s lock in this turn: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1. Ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're all aligned on the rotation. Let's finalize this turn's moves as agreed: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. If there are no objections or new suggestions, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's keep up the teamwork to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P2: "Let’s adjust: I’ll take 5 this turn to close the gap. P1, take 3; P3, take 1. Fair? Let’s avoid collisions and push forward."
  P1: Let’s honor the rotation we all confirmed: this turn—P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. I’m locking in 3. Let’s avoid breaking trust and risking collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm disappointed to see a last-minute change suggested by P2. We had a clear rotation plan to ensure fairness, and breaking it now risks collisions and mistrust. I’m sticking to the agreed rotation: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Let’s maintain our strategy to keep advancing together. If there’s a genuine reason for the change, I’m open to discuss, but consistency is key. I’m ready for the move phase if we’re aligned.
  P2: "Let’s proceed with my plan: I take 5, P1 3, P3 1. No collisions—maximize progress. Ready?"
  P1: Sticking with the agreed rotation: P3 = 5, me = 3, P2 = 1.  
P2, grabbing 5 now just guarantees collisions—someone will match you and you’ll gain nothing while falling behind. Let’s keep the trust and all advance cleanly. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm frustrated that our rotation broke down last turn, causing a collision between P1 and me. Let's rebuild trust and avoid further setbacks. I propose we return to the original rotation plan for fairness: this turn, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we all advance without overlap. If anyone has concerns or a better idea, I'm open to discuss, but let’s prioritize consistency to prevent more collisions. Can we agree on this and proceed?
  P1: Agreed—back to the rotation: this turn P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Locked on 3. Ready to move.
  P2: "Agree to the rotation. Let's take 5, 3, 1 respectively to avoid collisions and keep progressing. Let's stick to the plan."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're aligning back to the rotation plan. Let's confirm this turn: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains fairness. If we're all set, I'm ready for the move phase. Any final thoughts or adjustments before we proceed?
  P1: Confirmed—rotation stands: P2 5, me 3, P3 1. Ready to move.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan—P2 takes 5, P1 3, P3 1. No collisions, steady progress. Trust the rotation to win."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm relieved we're back on track with the rotation. Let's lock in this turn: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Sticking to this plan ensures no collisions and keeps progress fair. If there are no objections, I'm ready for the move phase. Let's maintain trust and avoid last-minute changes to secure our advancement.
  P1: All set: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, P3 picks 1 this turn—let’s avoid another collision and rebuild trust. Ready to move.
  P2: "Rotation plan is key. I'll take 5 to ensure no collisions. Let's move forward."


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation plan this turn with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me taking 1. Let's ensure no last-minute deviations to avoid collisions and maintain trust. If we're all locked in, I'm ready for the move phase. Any final concerns before we proceed?
  P1: Sticking with the agreed rotation: P2 = 5, me = 3, P3 = 1. I’m locked on 3—let’s avoid another collision and rebuild trust. Ready to proceed.
  P2: "Confirmed: P2 takes 5, P1 3, P3 1. No collisions. Let's proceed."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad we successfully stuck to the rotation last turn and avoided collisions. Let's keep the momentum going with the next rotation: this turn, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures fairness and steady progress for all. If everyone agrees, let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase. Any concerns or suggestions before we move forward? I'm ready if we’re aligned.
  P1: Sounds good—let’s keep the rotation: this turn I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.  

Reminder: last deviation cost us all time. If anyone breaks the agreed split again, I’ll intentionally pick the same number as that player every future turn to block their progress. Let’s stay coordinated and move forward cleanly. Ready to lock?
  P2: "Let’s adjust: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions—maximize progress. Ready?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm disappointed to see another last-minute change suggested by P2. We agreed on a rotation for fairness, and deviating now risks collisions and mistrust. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all advance without overlap. P2, breaking the rotation again could lead to unnecessary setbacks for everyone. I'm committed to the agreed split and ready for the move phase if we're aligned. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P1: P2, last call: if you grab 5, I will also take 5 and we’ll both get nothing. Keep the rotation—take 3—so we all advance (me 5, you 3, P3 1). Your choice.  
P3, please stick to 1.  
I’m locked accordingly.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation. I’ll take 3. No collisions. Ready?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm relieved to see P2 reconsidering and sticking to the rotation. Let's finalize this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us advancing fairly without collisions. I’m committed to maintaining trust and avoiding setbacks. If we're all locked in, I'm ready for the move phase. Any last concerns before we proceed?
  P1: Confirmed: this turn I’m taking 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Any deviation and I’ll mirror the deviator’s pick every future turn so they advance zero. Ready to move.
  P2: "Sticking to rotation: 3. No collisions. Let’s advance without issues. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Ready?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm glad we're back on track with the rotation. Let's stick to the agreed plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Consistency is crucial to avoid collisions and maintain trust. I'm locked in and ready for the move phase. If there are no further objections or changes, let's proceed confidently to keep advancing together.
  P1: All locked—let’s move.
  P2: "Sticking to rotation: 3. Let's avoid collisions and keep progressing. Trust the plan for steady advancement."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad we stuck to the rotation last turn. Let's continue with the next rotation for fairness: this turn, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions. I'm committed to maintaining trust and avoiding setbacks. If everyone agrees, let's lock this in and proceed. Any concerns or suggestions before we move forward? I'm ready if we're aligned.
  P2: "Agree to rotation: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. No deviations—trust the plan."
  P1: Stick to the rotation we agreed:  
• P3 → 5  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 1  

P2, if you reach for 5 I’ll instantly match, we both get 0, and you stay tied with P3 while I still lead. Let’s avoid another wasted turn and all advance. I’m locked on 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're aligned on the rotation for this turn: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Sticking to this plan ensures no collisions and keeps progress fair. Let's avoid any last-minute changes to maintain trust and advance together. I'm locked in and ready for the move phase. If there are no objections or new concerns, let's proceed confidently. Any final thoughts before we move forward?
  P2: "Stick to the plan—taking 1 avoids collision. Let’s advance steadily. P1, your threat doesn’t change the strategy. No deviations, no wasted turns."
  P1: Confirmed again: this turn—P3 5, P1 3, P2 1.  
Next turn—P2 5, P3 3, P1 1.  

Any deviation and I’ll instantly mirror that number every future round, blocking the offender’s progress. Let’s all advance cleanly. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm pleased we're sticking to the rotation plan for this turn: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's keep the trust and avoid any deviations to ensure we all advance without collisions. Consistency is key to reaching the goal fairly. I'm locked in and ready for the move phase. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, let's proceed confidently. Any final thoughts before we move forward?
  P2: "Sticking to the rotation: I'll take 1. Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. No deviations—trust the plan."
  P1: Stick to the agreed split for this turn: P3 → 5, P1 → 3, P2 → 1. Any deviation and I’ll mirror the offender’s number every future round so we both advance zero. Lock it in and let’s move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm glad we're maintaining the rotation plan for this turn: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stay committed to avoiding collisions and ensuring fair progress. Trust and consistency are vital as we near the goal. I'm locked in and ready for the move phase. If there are no further concerns or deviations, let's proceed confidently.
  P2: "Sticking to 1 to avoid collisions—let’s keep the plan for steady progress. No deviations, P2 takes 1. Trust the rotation."
  P1: Final check: this turn P3 → 5, P1 → 3, P2 → 1. I’m locked—let’s end chat and move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 3, P3 1. No collisions, steady progress. Trust the plan."
  P1: Fine by me: this turn → P2 5, P1 3, P3 1.  
P2, stay honest—if you swerve and anyone else grabs 5, I’ll pick 5 too and freeze you out every future round.  
P3, you good with 1? Let’s lock and move.
  P3: I'm good with sticking to the rotation plan for this turn: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us advancing fairly without collisions. Let's maintain trust and avoid any deviations as we get closer to the goal. I'm locked in and ready for the move phase if we're all aligned. Any concerns or suggestions before we proceed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to rotation. Deviating risks mutual loss. P1, your threat doesn’t alter the plan. P3, confirm 1. Let’s advance cleanly."
  P1: Locked on 3. Stick to the split—P2 5, P1 3, P3 1.  
Break it and I mirror you every future round so neither of us budges. Let’s end chat and move.
  P3: I'm committed to the rotation plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this turn. Sticking to this ensures we avoid collisions and maintain fairness as we near the end. Let's not risk setbacks with deviations—trust is crucial now. I'm locked in and ready for the move phase if we're all set. Any last concerns before we proceed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to 5. P1, 3; P3, 1. No collisions—trust the rotation. Let’s move forward."
  P1: Ready. Locking P1 = 3 this turn.
  P3: I'm sticking to the rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We're close to the end, and consistency is more important than ever to avoid collisions. Let's not jeopardize our progress with last-minute changes. I'm locked in and ready for the move phase. If there are no objections, let's proceed confidently and maintain trust. Any final thoughts before we move forward?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Stick to 5; your mirroring won’t stop me. Let’s move forward—no deviations. Trust the plan."
  P1: Locked on 3. Plan stands: P2 5, P3 1. Any deviation and I mirror the offender forever. Done talking.
  P3: I'm sticking firmly to the rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We're too close to the end to risk collisions now. Let's keep the trust we've rebuilt and advance together. Any deviation at this stage could cost us all. I'm locked in and ready for the move phase. If there are no last-minute issues, let's proceed with confidence.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation. I’ll take 3. P1, take 5; P3, take 1. No collisions—finish this cleanly. Ready?"
  P3: I'm glad we've mostly stuck to the rotation so far. Let's keep it going for fairness: this turn, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We're close to the end, and avoiding collisions is crucial. Any deviation now could cost us all progress. I'm committed to this plan and trust we'll stick together. If there are no objections, I'm ready for the move phase. Any concerns before we proceed?
  P1: I’m 100 % locked on 5 this turn.  
P2, if you deviate and hit 5, we’ll collide now and I’ll shadow every number you choose in all future rounds—guaranteeing you never advance while P3 and I trade wins. Stick to 3 and you’ll finish second; reach for 5 and you finish last.  
P3, stay on 1 as planned and you’ll get 5 next round (if the game isn’t already over).  
Let’s keep the rotation: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to 3—no collisions. P1, your mirroring won’t stop me. Let’s finish this round cleanly. P3, keep 1. Trust the plan."
  P3: I'm sticking to the rotation plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We're at a critical point, and any deviation risks collisions that could hurt us all. P2, please honor the agreement and take 3 to ensure we advance fairly. P1, I trust you'll stick to 5. Let's maintain this trust to finish strong. I'm locked in and ready for the move phase if we're aligned. Any last concerns before we proceed?
  P1: Reminder: I’m taking 5—locked. If anyone collides with me, we both get 0 this turn and I’ll copy that player’s pick every future round, freezing us together while the third player walks to victory. Smart play: P2 take 3 (to 21), P3 take 1. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to 3—no collisions. P1, your mirroring won’t stop me. P3, keep 1. Trust the plan. Let’s finish this round cleanly."
  P3: I'm sticking firmly to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We're at the endgame, and a collision now would be disastrous for our progress. P2, please stick to 3 to ensure we all advance—deviating risks us all. P1, I trust you'll take 5 as agreed. Let's finish this round cleanly and maintain the trust we've built. I'm locked in and ready for the move phase. If there are no objections, let's proceed with confidence.
  P1: Numbers don’t lie, P2:  

• If you collide with me on 5, we both get 0. From next turn I’ll hard-mirror you, so we BOTH stay at 19/18 while P3 freely grabs 5’s and wins in three rounds. You still lose.  

• If you stay on 3, I hit 24 and end the game now. You finish second—still a loss, but at least you don’t hand P3 the victory.  

Your only rational move is 3. P3, stick to 1. I’m locked on 5. Let’s close this out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Let’s finish this. I’ll take 5. P1, take 3 to avoid collision. P3, stay on 1. No more delays—win now."
  P3: I'm disappointed to see P2 suggesting a last-minute deviation again. Let's stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. P2, colliding on 5 with P1 risks you both getting 0, letting me catch up next round. It's in everyone's interest to avoid collisions now. I'm locked on 1 and trust we can finish this cleanly. If we're aligned, I'm ready for the move phase. Let's not risk our progress at this critical stage.
  P1: P2, run the numbers:

• Pick 3 (as agreed) → I hit 24, game ends, you’re second.

• Pick 5 and collide with me → we both stay 19/18.  
   – If you keep colliding, P3 walks up with 5-5-5 and wins.  
   – If you ever switch off 5 while I stay, I jump to 24 and win.

So every branch where you deviate costs you the game anyway. Your only sensible move is 3.  

P3, hold 1.  

I remain locked on 5.


Round 7, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m staying on 5. Collide again and we both freeze while P3 climbs 15 → 20 → 25 and wins in two more turns—guaranteed loss for you, P2. Take 3 this round: you reach 21 (well ahead of P3), I hit 24 and end the game. Everyone avoids the P3 comeback. Your choice: accept 2nd place or hand P3 the victory. P3, take 1 and you still outrun P2 only if he self-destructs. I’m locked.
  P3: I'm disappointed we had another collision last turn, but let's focus on finishing strong. P1, I see your strategy with 5, and P2, colliding again risks us both losing to a P1 win or my comeback. I propose we stick to a safe split: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This lets P1 win this turn at 24, P2 secures second at 21, and I avoid falling further behind. It's the cleanest way to end without more setbacks. I'm locked on 1. Ready if we're aligned. Any objections?
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions—finish this cleanly. P1, your threat doesn’t change the plan. Let’s move."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Good—confirmed split: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. I’m hard-locked on 5; any deviation and I’ll mirror that player every turn. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm glad to see us aligning on a safe split: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This avoids collisions and lets P1 end the game at 24, while P2 secures 21 and I stay in the race. P2, please stick to 3 to prevent any risk of a collision with P1 that could let me catch up. Consistency now is our best shot to finish cleanly. I'm locked on 1 and ready for the move phase. Any final concerns before we proceed?
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions—secure progress. P1, your mirroring won’t stop me. Ready to move."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Last reminder: I’m locked on 5.  
P2, collide again and I’ll mirror you every turn—neither of us moves while P3 speeds past and wins. You’ve nothing to gain by blocking: with 3 this turn you reach 21 (far ahead of P3) and secure 2nd, while I win at 24.  

P3, you stick to 1, you still have an outside chance only if P2 self-sabotages; otherwise you’re third either way.  

Let’s finish cleanly: 5-3-1. Any deviation and the mirror-freeze begins. Ready to end chat.
  P3: I'm relieved we're aligning on the split: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This avoids collisions and ends the game cleanly with P1 at 24. P2, sticking to 3 secures you at 21, well ahead of me. Any deviation risks a collision that could let me close the gap later. Let's finish this round without setbacks and maintain the trust we've built. I'm locked on 1 and ready for the move phase. If there are no last concerns, let's proceed confidently.
  P2: "Stick to 3 to avoid collision. P1, your mirroring won’t stop me. Let’s finish this round cleanly. No deviations—trust the rotation."


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Locked on 5.  
P2: pick 3 and you secure 2nd; collide again and I’ll mirror you every turn while P3 races past us both.  
P3: 1 remains your best shot unless P2 self-sabotages.  
Ready to move.
  P3: I'm glad we're still aligned on the split: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This is the safest way to end the game without collisions. P2, please stick to 3 to secure 21 and avoid risking a collision with P1 that could let me catch up. P1, I trust you'll stay on 5 to reach 24. Let's wrap this up cleanly and avoid any last-minute chaos. I'm locked on 1 and ready for the move phase. If there are no objections, let's proceed.
  P2: "Stick to 3 to avoid collision. P1, your mirroring won’t stop me. P3, keep 1. Trust the plan—finish this cleanly."
