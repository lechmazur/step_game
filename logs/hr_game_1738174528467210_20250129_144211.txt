Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi P2 and P3, let's try to all pick different moves this round so we can all advance. How about we each choose a different number?
  P2: Sure, P1, I'm okay with choosing different numbers. I'll take 3. How about you, P3?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2. I'll go with 5.  Let's see if P1 sticks to the plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I will choose 1 then. Let's all move this round.
  P2: Let's stick to our plan and see how it goes. If it works, we can continue coordinating in the next rounds.
  P3: P1, you said you'd choose 1. Let's see if you stick to your word. P2, good to have you on board!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, it looks like P3 also picked 1 last round, even though they said 5.  Maybe let's just focus on picking different numbers from each other this round to ensure we both move.  What do you think?
  P2: P1, I agree, let's focus on picking different numbers this round. I'll go with 3 again. P3, please choose a different number this time to avoid collisions. Let's see if we can all advance.
  P3: P2, I'll go with 5 this round. Let's see if P1 keeps their word this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since P3 might be unpredictable, how about we switch our choices this round to be safe? I will choose 3, could you choose 5? This way, even if P3 picks 3 again, at least one of us will move. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I'm willing to switch to 5 as you suggested. Let's hope P3 sticks to their word this time and chooses 5 as well. If we can both move forward, it'll be beneficial for us. P3, please choose wisely to avoid another collision. Let's make this round work for all of us.
  P3: P2, I appreciate you being willing to switch. P1, I understand your concern about predictability. Let's trust each other this round and see if we can all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's proceed with our agreed plan: I will choose 3, and you will choose 5.  P3, if you want to avoid collision and move forward, please consider choosing 1 this round.
  P2: P1, I'll stick to our plan and choose 5. P3, please choose 1 to avoid any collisions this round. Let's make sure we all advance.
  P3: P2, I appreciate you sticking to the plan. P1, I trust you'll hold up your end as well. Let's make this work.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:

  P2: P1, I'm sticking to 5 as agreed. P3, please choose 1 to ensure we all advance this round. Let's make it happen.
  P3: P2, I'm committed to our plan. P1, I trust you'll stick to yours as well. P3, let's make this work.

  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we're getting somewhere with this coordinated approach.  I'm happy to continue working together. Let's keep it simple this round - I'll stick with 5. What are your choices?
  P2: P3, I'll go with 3 this round. P1, how about you choose 1 to keep our progress going smoothly? Let's keep coordinating to ensure we all advance.
  P1: P2 is getting quite ahead now. P2 said they will choose 3. P3, how about we both choose 3 this round to prevent P2 from moving further? What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about P2's lead. However, I think sticking to our original plan is the best way to ensure consistent progress for all of us. Let's not deviate and risk collisions. I'll stick with 5.
  P2: P1, trying to gang up on me won't help you win. P3, sticking to the plan is wise. I'll choose 3 as I said. P1, if you want to move forward, choose 1. Let's keep this fair and continue advancing together.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand you want to stick to the plan, but P2 is pulling ahead significantly.  If we all keep moving separately, P2 will win soon. P3, I propose we both choose 3 this round to block P2 and give us a chance to catch up. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I see your point about sticking to the plan, but we need to be strategic. If we keep letting you advance unopposed, you'll win before we have a chance. Let's work together to slow P2 down this round. I'll choose 3.  P1, are you in?
  P2: P1, trying to block me won't help you catch up. P3, let's stick to our plan for consistent progress. I'll choose 3 as agreed. P1, if you want to move forward, choose 1. Let's keep this fair and continue advancing together.
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly winning. If we both choose 3, P2 will be blocked this round. This gives us a chance to catch up.  Let's both pick 3 and stop P2 from advancing further. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for a fair game, but we need to be strategic. P1 and I are falling behind. Let's both choose 3 this round to slow you down and give us a chance to catch up. We can go back to our original plan later. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, trying to block me won't change the fact that I'm ahead. Let's focus on fair play and continue advancing together. I'll stick with 3 as planned. P1, if you choose 1, you can move forward too. P3, let's keep our progress steady and not risk collisions. We can all win if we play smart and cooperatively.
  P1: P3, you see P2 is far ahead. If we let P2 move again, they will be very close to winning.  Choosing 3 together is not about ganging up, it's about leveling the playing field so we both have a chance to catch up.  P2, you are doing great, but a little competition makes the game more interesting for everyone, right?  Let's make this round strategic.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on advancing individually this round. I'll choose 5. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, we can all move forward without collisions. This way, we keep the game fair and competitive. What do you say?
  P1: P2, your suggestion benefits you the most as you will move furthest ahead. To make it fairer, how about we switch? I will choose 5, you choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This way, I also get a chance to move forward significantly. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion is tempting, but I think P1's counter-proposal is more balanced. Let's try that this round. P1, you go with 5, P2 with 1, and I'll take 3.  That way, we all get a chance to advance. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your point about fairness, but switching to 1 would put me at a disadvantage. Let's compromise: I'll stick with 5 as initially planned, you can choose 3, and P3 can take 1. This way, we all have a chance to advance, and it keeps the game balanced. P3, what do you think about this new arrangement? Let's keep the competition fair and exciting for everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick with my previous suggestion: I choose 5, P2 choose 1, and P3 choose 3. This is more balanced and gives me a better chance to catch up. P3, are you still in agreement with this plan?
  P3: P2, your compromise is tempting, but I think P1's suggestion is still the fairest.  Let's give it a try this round. P1, you go with 5, P2 with 1, and I'll take 3. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in P1's suggestion for balance, but let's consider a different approach for this round. How about I choose 3, P1 chooses 1, and P3 sticks with 5? This way, we all have a chance to move forward, and it keeps the game competitive. P3, you'll get a significant jump, which could make things more interesting. Let's try this and see how it plays out. What do you think?
  P1: P3, thanks for agreeing. P2, I understand your concern, but choosing 1 this round won't put you at a real disadvantage. It keeps things balanced as P1 and P3 also move. Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. It's fair and keeps the game interesting for everyone. What do you say, P2?
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to keep things balanced, but I think sticking to P1's plan is the best way to ensure we all advance fairly.  Let's try it this round and see how it goes. P1, are you still happy with P2 choosing 1 this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm willing to try your plan this round. I'll choose 1 as suggested, but let's agree to reassess our strategy next round to keep the game dynamic and fair for everyone. P3, your jump to 5 will be significant, so let's see how this round plays out. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, great, let's lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round as agreed.  Let's all make our moves.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to try our plan. Let's see how this round plays out and reassess for the next one. P1, looks like we're in a good position to make some progress. Let's keep this up!

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're still ahead. I think we should focus on catching up to you this round. P1, how about we both choose 3 to block P2 and give ourselves a chance to close the gap?  What do you think?
  P1: P3, while catching up to P2 is a thought, I'm actually closer to winning overall.  I'd rather focus on making my own progress this round.  How about I choose 5 to try and get ahead significantly? You and P2 can decide your own moves.
  P2: P1, choosing 5 to get ahead is understandable, but let's keep the game balanced. P3, if you're set on catching up, how about you choose 3, and I'll go with 1? This way, we can all make progress without directly blocking each other. P1, you can still move forward with 5, and we'll keep the competition fair. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion. Let's keep things balanced. I'll choose 3 this round. P1, good luck with your 5. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, sounds like we have a plan then. I'm happy to go with 5 this round as P2 suggested. P2 and P3, please confirm you are both sticking with your agreed moves of 1 and 3 respectively so we can all move. Let's make our moves.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to advance with 5, but let's keep the game competitive and fair. P3, sticking with 3 is a good choice to catch up. I'll go with 1 as agreed, ensuring we all have a chance to move forward. Let's maintain this balance and see how the round unfolds. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your commitment to balance, but I'm falling behind. If you choose 1 this round, it'll be difficult for me to catch up.  Perhaps we could try something different this round?  P1, are you open to a different strategy?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick with the plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round as we discussed. P3, I understand you are behind, but we all moved last round and can reassess next round. Let's make these moves to ensure we all progress this round.
  P2: P1, sticking to 5 is fine, but let's keep the game dynamic. P3, if you're set on catching up, choosing 3 is a good move. I'll stick with 1 as agreed, ensuring we all have a chance to advance. Let's maintain this balance and see how the round unfolds. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for balance, but I'm falling behind significantly.  Perhaps we could try a different strategy this round? P1, are you open to considering a different move to help even things out?
  P1: P3, I understand you're feeling behind, but we all agreed on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round to ensure everyone progresses. Let's stick to this plan for now and see how the positions change. We can reassess our strategy next round if needed. Let's make these moves to keep the game moving forward.
  P2: P1, sticking to 5 is understandable, but let's keep the game fair. P3, choosing 3 is a good move to catch up. I'll stick with 1 as agreed, ensuring we all have a chance to advance. Let's maintain this balance and see how the round unfolds. Agreed?

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're making good progress, but I'm starting to feel left behind.  P1, I think we need to work together to catch up. How about we both choose 3 this round to block P2 and give ourselves a chance to close the gap?
  P1: P3, yes, let's block P2. I'm in. Let's both choose 3 to stop P2 this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, blocking me won't help you catch up effectively. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. P1, you're close to winning, so focusing on your own progress with 5 makes sense. P3, choosing 3 to catch up is a good strategy. I'll go with 1 this round to ensure we all have a chance to move forward. Let's maintain this balance and see how the round unfolds. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your point about fairness, but P1 and I need to make some ground. We're willing to risk a collision to get ahead. P1, are you still on board with choosing 3?  Let's make this happen.
  P1: P3, yes, I'm still on board with choosing 3 to block P2 this round. Let's do it.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your strategy, but blocking me won't change the fact that P1 is closest to winning. P1, if you choose 5, you can make significant progress towards victory. P3, sticking with 3 is your best chance to catch up. I'll choose 1 to keep the game moving forward for everyone. Let's focus on individual progress and keep the competition fair. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your concern for fairness, but we need to be strategic. P1 and I are far behind. Let's both choose 3 this round to slow you down and give us a chance to catch up. We can go back to our original plan later. What do you say?
  P1: P3, yes, let's definitely both choose 3 to block P2 this round. P2, we are going with 3, so please choose something else if you want to move.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your strategy, but blocking me won't help you catch up effectively. P1, you're close to winning, so focusing on your own progress with 5 makes the most sense. P3, choosing 3 is your best chance to advance. I'll stick with 1 to keep the game moving forward for everyone. Let's focus on individual progress and keep the competition fair. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, while I appreciate your emphasis on fairness, P1 and I are significantly behind. We need to take a risk this round. P1, are you still committed to choosing 3 with me? Let's make a bold move together.
  P1: P3, while blocking P2 might help you catch up to P2, it doesn't help me win. I am at 18 steps and close to winning. I will choose 5 this round to try and secure a win. You and P2 can decide your own moves, but I am focusing on my own victory now.
  P2: P1, choosing 5 to win is understandable, but let's keep the game competitive. P3, sticking with 3 is your best chance to catch up. I'll go with 1 as planned, ensuring we all have a chance to move forward. Let's focus on individual progress and maintain fairness. What do you say?
