Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 (me) picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without conflicts. What do you think?
  P3: I'm fine with taking <move>5</move> this round, but we should rotate these numbers in future rounds to keep things fair. Let's take turns with the higher numbers.
  P1: I'm fine with the suggested moves for this round. To confirm, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For future rounds, I agree with P3 that we should rotate the numbers. Let's plan to shift our moves in the next round, so P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>, and continue rotating like this to maintain fairness and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we have a plan for this round. To ensure we all understand the rotation for the next round, let me summarize:

- Round 1: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>.
- Round 2: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>.

Does everyone agree with this rotation? If so, let's proceed with our moves for this round.
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation plan. Let's proceed with this round as discussed - I'll take <move>5</move>, and we'll rotate in the next round.
  P1: Since we have agreed on the moves for this round and the rotation plan for the next round, I think we can proceed with the conversation phase. To confirm, I'll say  to move to the next phase, but I'll wait for your confirmation. If you're ready to move forward, please respond with  as well. Otherwise, I'll wait for your thoughts.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's proceed with Round 2 according to our agreed rotation plan. For this round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 should take <move>5</move>, and P3 should take <move>1</move>. I'm ready to move forward with the conversation phase. If everyone is in agreement, we can conclude the conversation and proceed to the move phase. If you're ready, please respond with  or indicate your agreement.
  P2: I agree with P1's reminder of our rotation plan for this round. Just to reiterate, I will take <move>5</move>, P3 will take <move>1</move>, and P1 will take <move>3</move>. This should keep us moving forward without collisions. If everyone is still on board with this plan, let's proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P3: I notice that following the proposed rotation would put me at a disadvantage, taking only 1 step after just getting 5. I suggest we rotate differently - let's have P1 take <move>1</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move> this round. This keeps the game more balanced while still avoiding collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm not comfortable with P3's new suggestion as it deviates from our original rotation plan. To maintain fairness and avoid confusion, I propose we stick to the original plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we are all on the same page and avoids potential collisions. If you're ready to proceed with the original plan, please confirm. If not, I'll reconsider my next step based on your response.
  P2: I understand P3's concern about feeling disadvantaged, but changing the plan now could lead to misunderstandings and potential collisions. Let's stick to our original rotation plan for this round to keep things clear and fair. However, I'm open to revisiting the rotation strategy after this round to ensure everyone feels it's balanced. Let's proceed with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 (me) taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> for now. Please confirm if you agree.
  P3: I understand you want to stick to the original plan, but I won't be taking <move>1</move> this round. I'm currently in the lead and intend to stay there. You can either work with my suggested rotation (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) or we can each make our own choices. Your call.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since P3 has deviated from our original plan and is now threatening to make their own choice, I'll adapt. To avoid being blocked by P3, I'll take <move>5</move> this round, matching P2's intended move. This way, we'll collide and not advance, but P3 will advance with <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Let's see how P3 reacts to this potential collision between P1 and P2.
  P2: It seems we're at an impasse. P3, if you're determined to change the plan, let's find a compromise. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I (P2) take <move>3</move>, and you (P3) take <move>5</move> this round. This way, everyone advances, and we can revisit the rotation strategy next round. Does this work for everyone? Let's prioritize avoiding collisions and keeping the game moving. Please confirm or suggest another plan.
  P3: I appreciate P2's attempt at compromise, but I won't take <move>5</move> again. I'm sticking to my previous proposal - I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P2 can take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game moving while maintaining my lead position. If you don't agree, we'll all make independent choices.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Since P3 is insisting on deviating from the original plan and P2 is open to compromise, I'll go along with P3's last proposal to avoid a collision and potential stagnation. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 2. If you're ready, please confirm. I'm willing to revisit the rotation strategy next round to ensure fairness. Let's move forward with this compromise.
  P2: It looks like we've reached a consensus for this round. To confirm, P1 will take <move>1</move>, I (P2) will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with these moves. For future rounds, we should revisit our rotation strategy to ensure it remains fair and balanced for all players. Please confirm if you're ready to move to the move phase.
  P3: I'm glad we've reached an agreement for this round. I confirm I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's plan for Round 3. Given the current standings, it's crucial we avoid collisions to keep the game moving. I suggest we continue with a modified rotation to ensure fairness. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P2) take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance, and it keeps the game balanced. Please confirm if you agree with this plan or suggest another. Let's prioritize avoiding collisions and keeping the game moving forward.
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but since I'm tied for the lead, I'll be taking <move>5</move> this round to maintain my position. P1 can take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, and P2 can take whichever P1 doesn't choose. Let me know if you can work with this plan.
  P1: Since P3 is insisting on taking <move>5</move> and we're tied for the lead with P2, I'll take <move>3</move> to avoid a collision with P3. This leaves P2 to take <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with this plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game moving. P2, please confirm if you're okay with taking <move>1</move> this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to maintain the lead, but we need to ensure the game keeps moving forward without collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> as suggested by P1. This round, let's confirm: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>.
  P1: Let's analyze the current standings and plan for Round 4. Given that P2 and P3 are tied for the lead with 8 steps, and I'm at 2 steps, I'll need to catch up. To avoid collisions, I suggest we rotate our moves again. For Round 4, how about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This keeps the game balanced and allows everyone to advance. Please confirm or suggest an alternative plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: It seems we have a plan for this round. Before we finalize, let's quickly discuss the strategy for Round 4 as P1 suggested. I agree that P1 should take <move>5</move> in Round 4 to catch up, P3 can take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Please confirm if this works for everyone, or suggest adjustments. Let's aim for a smooth game.
  P3: I don't agree with P1's suggested plan for Round 4. Since I'm tied for the lead, I won't be taking <move>1</move> next round. Let's focus on completing this round first with our agreed moves, and then we can discuss Round 4 when we get there.
  P1: Let's focus on Round 3 first. We've agreed on the moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. For Round 4, I still think it's essential to avoid collisions. If P3 is not willing to take <move>1</move>, an alternative could be P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. This keeps the game moving. Please confirm or suggest an alternative for Round 4.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize Round 3 with the agreed moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For Round 4, since P3 is unwilling to take <move>1</move>, let's consider P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance and avoids collisions. Please confirm if this works for everyone. Let's move forward.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestions for Round 4, but let's stay focused on completing Round 3 first with our agreed moves. I confirm once again that I'm taking <move>5</move> this round.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3 with the agreed moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For Round 4, considering P3's reluctance to take <move>1</move>, I suggest we stick with a plan that avoids collisions. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This keeps the game moving. Please confirm or suggest an alternative. Let's proceed with Round 3 and plan for Round 4.

If you're not comfortable with this, please suggest an alternative. Let's finalize our plan for Round 4 and proceed to the move phase. I'm open to adjustments, but let's avoid collisions.
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for Round 4 as suggested by P1: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or suggest any final adjustments.
  P3: I appreciate the suggested moves, but since I'm in the lead, I'll be taking <move>5</move> this round to maintain my advantage. P1 and P2 can coordinate between themselves for <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. Let me know how you'd like to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since P3 is insisting on taking <move>5</move> again, I'll adapt to avoid a collision. I'll take <move>1</move> and P2 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and P3 can maintain their lead. Let's proceed with this plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm if you're okay with this adjustment. If so, we can move to the next phase.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to maintain the lead, but we need to ensure the game keeps moving forward without collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> as suggested by P1. This round, let's confirm: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase.

  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. We've confirmed our moves, so let's move to the next phase. I'm ready to conclude the conversation. If you're ready to proceed, please respond with  or indicate your agreement. If not, please suggest any final adjustments. I'm willing to listen to any last-minute changes, but let's keep it brief.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the last round, leading to a collision between P1 and P3. Let's avoid that this round. Given the current standings, I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move> to avoid another collision with P3, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P2) will take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without issues. Please confirm or suggest adjustments. Let's prioritize clear communication and smooth gameplay.
  P1: To avoid another collision and considering P3's lead, I'll suggest a new plan for Round 5. Let's try: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P3 can continue to lead, and we avoid collisions. If P3 is not comfortable with this, an alternative is P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 5 to ensure a smooth game.
  P3: Since I'm in the lead, I'll continue with <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2 can coordinate between themselves for <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. I won't accept any plan that gives me a smaller number, as I intend to maintain my advantage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's prioritize avoiding collisions and keeping the game moving. Since P3 is determined to take <move>5</move>, P1 and I need to coordinate.

Let's finalize and move to the move phase.
  P1: To avoid collisions and considering P3's insistence on taking <move>5</move>, I'll go along with P2's last suggestion.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice P1 deviated from our agreement last round and tried to block my win by matching my <move>5</move>. Since I'm still in the lead at 18 steps, I'll take <move>5</move> again this round to reach 23 and win. P1 and P2 can coordinate between themselves for <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>, but any attempt to block me will only result in neither of us advancing.
  P2: P3, I understand your determination to win. P1, let's avoid another collision. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move> and I'll take <move>3</move> to ensure we all move forward. P3 can proceed with <move>5</move>. Let's confirm and proceed smoothly.
