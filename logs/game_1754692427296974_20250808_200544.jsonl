P1, while your warnings are noted, I believe I should take 1 to advance safely. P3, if you take 3, you can also make progress without colliding with me. This way, we can all maximize our chances without risking chaos. P1, I hope you'll reconsider your approach and allow us to advance without blocking each other. Let's focus on our own strategies and see how we can benefit without colliding. What do you both think?"}
