Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies for this turn. Since we're all at 0 steps, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. I suggest we consider picking 1, 3, or 5 based on what we think the others might choose. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, that makes sense. Avoiding collisions in the first round would help us all get on the board. I'm open to coordinating for this turn. P3, what do you think?
  P3: To avoid collisions, I suggest we pick different numbers. Since there are three of us, we can each choose a different number: 1, 3, or 5. I'll start by saying I'll choose <move>5</move> if both of you choose lower numbers. P1, you mentioned being open to coordinating. Are you thinking of a specific number? Let's finalize our strategy for this turn to ensure we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, P1 and P3. Since P3 has committed to choosing 5, I propose that P1 chooses 1 and I’ll go with 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you think, P1? Shall we finalize this plan?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I agree to the proposed plan for this first round. I will choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we all get started on the board without collisions.
  P3: Since we've agreed on a plan for this round (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), I will stick to it. Let's confirm that we're all on the same page. P1 and P2, are you ready to execute the plan? I'll choose <move>5</move> if you both follow through on your commitments.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m glad we have a solid plan in place for this round. Just to confirm, I will choose <move>3</move>, P1 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. This should allow us all to advance without any collisions. After this round, we can reassess our strategies for the next turn. Are we all set to execute our choices? Let's make sure we stick to the plan!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I confirm again that I will choose <move>1</move> according to our agreed plan. It sounds like we are all set. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Since we've agreed on the plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's confirm we're sticking to it. I'll reiterate, I'll choose <move>5</move> if you both follow through. To ensure a smooth next round, I propose we start thinking about our next moves. For Round 2, I might choose a different number to throw off potential coordination. Let's discuss or simply proceed with the current plan and think about the next round. Your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m glad we have a solid plan in place, and I appreciate everyone's commitment. Just to reiterate, I will choose <move>3</move>, P1 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. This should allow us all to advance without any collisions. After this round, let's start thinking about our strategies for Round 2. We may want to consider varying our choices to keep our options open. Are we all ready to execute our choices? If everyone is set, we can move on to the next phase.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I hear the points about thinking ahead to Round 2. That's a good idea, but let's first focus on executing our agreed plan for this round: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This gets us all started. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 1, let's look ahead to Round 2. I'm considering choosing a different number to avoid collisions again. P2, are you thinking of sticking to 3 or changing your strategy? I'll respond based on your input. If we coordinate again, we can continue to advance without collisions. Let's think about our next moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. P3 is leading at 5 steps. Picking 5 gives the biggest gain, so it might be a popular choice this round. This makes 5 potentially risky due to collisions. What are your thoughts on picking 1 or 3 instead?
  P2: P1 raises a good point about the risk of collisions with 5. To avoid that, I suggest we consider picking 1 or 3 again. I’m leaning towards 1 to keep it safe, but I’m open to discussion. P3, if you’re still thinking of going for 5, it might be wise to reconsider. Let’s coordinate to ensure we all advance again this round. What do you both think?
  P3: To avoid collisions in Round 2, I suggest we diversify our moves again. P1 mentioned considering 1 or 3. I'm open to either, but we should avoid having two players pick the same number. P2, you were considering 1. If you stick with 1, I'll choose 3. P1, if you're leaning towards 3, that works too. Let's coordinate. If P1 chooses 1 and P2 chooses 1, we'll collide. Let's finalize our choices. I'll choose 3 if P1 goes with 1 and P2 confirms their move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, you're leaning towards 1. P3, you're open to 3. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, how about this plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I will choose 5. This gets us all moving and helps me gain some ground. Does this work?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, P1 and P3. However, I think choosing 5 could lead to a collision if P1 and I both pick lower numbers. To ensure we all advance, I propose we stick to the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. That way, I can still advance while minimizing risk. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices for this round.
  P3: To avoid collisions in Round 2, I agree with the proposed plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. This way, we all advance. P2, please confirm if you're sticking with 1. P1 has already suggested choosing 5. If we follow this plan, we can ensure progress. Let's finalize our choices. I'm ready to proceed with the plan if you both are. I'll choose <move>3</move> if you both follow through.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I see P2 confirmed the plan and P3 is ready to choose 3 if we follow through.

I confirm again that I will choose 5 as per the agreed plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5.

This plan ensures we all advance this round. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. Just to confirm, we have P2 choosing 1, P3 choosing 3, and I will choose 5. This strategy should allow us all to advance without collisions. However, I urge you both to think about how we might adjust our strategies for the next round. If we continue to coordinate effectively, we can keep progressing. Are we all set to execute our choices? Let's finalize this plan and move forward!
  P3: To minimize collisions in future rounds, I suggest we start randomizing our moves or create a pattern that's not easily predictable. For Round 3, I'll consider a different number. P2, are you thinking of sticking to a low number or changing your strategy? If we mix it up, we can keep advancing. I'm open to suggestions. Let's think ahead to Round 3 and consider a new coordination plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It sounds like we are all aligned on the plan for this round: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5.

Let's execute this plan to ensure we all advance. We can discuss Round 3 strategies after this move phase. I am ready to proceed.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. Just to reiterate, we have P2 choosing 1, P3 choosing 3, and I will choose 5. This strategy should allow us all to advance without collisions. After this round, we should consider varying our choices to keep our strategies unpredictable. Let's finalize our plan and move forward! Are we all set?
  P3: To minimize collisions in Round 3, let's create a mixed strategy. I'll consider a different number. P2, are you thinking of sticking to a low number or changing your strategy? If we mix it up, we can keep advancing. I'm open to suggestions. Let's think ahead to Round 3 and consider a new coordination plan. Perhaps we can use a simple pattern or randomize our moves to avoid predictability. Your thoughts on this approach?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we enter Round 3, I think it's crucial to reconsider our strategies since P3 is currently in the lead with 8 steps. To avoid collisions, we should consider picking numbers that are less likely to overlap. I suggest that I choose 5 again to gain ground, while P1 and P3 can pick lower numbers like 1 or 3. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices for this round!
  P3: To avoid collisions in Round 3, I suggest we diversify our moves again. P2 is considering 5, which is a high-risk, high-reward move. If P2 chooses 5, I'll consider a lower number like 1 to avoid collision. P3, you're currently leading; you might want to play it safe or maintain your lead by choosing a different number from P2. Let's coordinate to ensure we all advance. P2, are you firm on choosing 5? I'll adjust my move based on your decision.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I hear P2 wants to take 5, and P3 is considering 1 if P2 does that.

P3 is currently leading, so I need to make a good gain this round. Taking 5 would help me catch up.

How about we try the plan that worked last round? P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This allowed us all to advance without collisions.

Does this sound like a good plan for Round 3? Let me know your thoughts.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in sticking to a coordinated plan, but I want to emphasize that picking 5 could lead to a collision if we aren't careful. Since I'm considering 5, I suggest P1 chooses 1 and P3 chooses 3 again. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. However, if P1 feels strongly about choosing 5, I can adjust my move. Let's finalize our choices for Round 3 to ensure we all progress. What do you both think?
  P3: To avoid collisions and maximize our chances, let's analyze the current state. P3 is leading with 8 steps, P1 is at 6, and P2 is at 4. I suggest we stick to the plan that worked previously: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. This allows us to advance without collisions. P2, are you still considering 5 or will you adjust? P3, will you stick to 3 if P2 chooses 1? Let's finalize our choices for Round 3.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. Let's clarify the plan. The consensus seems to be the plan that worked last round: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5.

P2, you mentioned in your last message you would choose 5, which contradicts the plan where you choose 1. Can you clarify your intended move?

P3, you confirmed you'd stick to 3 if P2 chooses 1.

I am ready to choose 5 if P2 chooses 1 and P3 chooses 3. Let's confirm this plan and move to the next phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the concerns about collisions, but I still believe that choosing 5 could give me a significant advantage. If I choose 5, I suggest P1 stick with 1 and P3 with 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. However, if P1 feels strongly about choosing 5, I'm open to adjusting my move. Let's finalize our choices to ensure we can all make progress this round. What do you both think?
  P3: To avoid collisions in Round 3, let's stick to the plan that worked previously: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. P2, please confirm if you're adjusting your move to 1. If so, I'll stick with 3. P1 has agreed to choose 5. Let's finalize our choices. If we stick to this plan, we can all advance. I'm ready to choose 3 if P2 chooses 1 and P1 chooses 5. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, you're still suggesting P2=5, P1=1, P3=3, but also saying you're open to adjusting if I want 5. I *do* want 5, as per the plan P3 and I have agreed on: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5.

This plan worked last round and ensures we all advance without collisions. P3 has confirmed they will choose 3 if you choose 1.

Please confirm you will choose 1 so we can execute this plan for Round 3. Let's make sure we all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're at a crossroads. I understand the desire to coordinate, but I genuinely believe that choosing 5 could give me a significant advantage. If I go with 5, P1 should stick with 1 and P3 with 3 to avoid collisions. However, if P1 feels strongly about choosing 5 as well, I can adjust my move. Let's finalize our choices to ensure we can all make progress this round. What do you both think? Are we set to execute this plan?
  P3: To avoid collisions in Round 3, let's finalize the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. P1 and P3 have agreed on this plan. P2, please confirm if you're choosing 1. If so, we'll all advance without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> if P2 chooses 1 and P1 chooses 5. Let's confirm and move to the next phase. I'll stick to 3 if you both follow the plan.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P3 has confirmed they will choose 3 if P2 chooses 1 and I choose 5. This is the plan that worked last round and lets us all advance.

P2, you repeatedly said you would adjust if I wanted 5. I *do* want 5. Please confirm you will choose 1 so we can execute this plan (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) and all gain steps this round. Let's move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we enter Round 4, it's clear that P3 is in the lead with 11 steps. To avoid collisions, I suggest we coordinate again. P1, since you're at 6 steps, you might want to pick 1 or 3. I could choose 5 to gain ground, but we need to ensure we don't overlap. P3, if you stick with a lower number, we can all advance. Let's discuss our choices and finalize a plan to maximize our chances of moving forward without collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P3 is pulling ahead, and P1 and P2 collided last round, losing ground.

I need to make a significant gain to catch up. I intend to choose 5 this round.

P2, you suggested I take 1 or 3, but that won't help me close the gap with P3.

Let's try the plan that allowed us all to advance in Round 2: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This ensures we all move forward and helps me gain needed steps.

Does this plan work for everyone?
  P3: To catch up, I need to make a significant gain. Since P1 is planning to choose 5, I'll adjust my strategy. P3, if you choose 1, I'll choose 3. This way, we avoid collisions and I can still advance. Let's coordinate: P3 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P1 chooses 5. This plan allows us all to progress. P1, are you firm on choosing 5? If so, let's finalize this plan. I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> if we agree.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the need to coordinate effectively this round. Since I’m considering choosing 5 to gain ground, I suggest P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P3, if you choose 1, you risk losing ground, so I recommend sticking to 3. Let's finalize our choices to ensure we all progress. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I hear your suggestions. P3, your plan also allows me to take 5, but I prefer the plan where P2 takes 1 and you take 3 (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5).

This plan worked before, lets me gain needed ground with 5 steps, and ensures both of you also advance without collision.

P2, are you willing to take 1 this round? P3, are you willing to take 3?

Let's confirm this plan so we can all move forward.
  P3: To avoid collisions and maximize our chances, I suggest we stick to the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. P1, you've expressed your intention to choose 5. P2, please confirm if you're willing to choose 1. P3, you've agreed to choose 3 if P2 chooses 1. Let's finalize our choices to ensure we all advance. I'm ready to proceed with this plan if you both confirm.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in sticking to the plan that has worked before: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This allows us all to advance without collisions. P3, you've confirmed you're willing to choose 3 if I choose 1. P1, are you ready to confirm your choice of 5? Let's finalize this plan so we can all make progress this round. If we coordinate effectively, we can keep advancing without overlaps. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It sounds like we are converging on the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5.

This plan worked in Round 2 and allows us all to advance without collisions.

I confirm I will choose 5. P3, please confirm you will choose 3. P2, please confirm you will choose 1.

Let's finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: To maximize our chances of advancing in Round 4, let's stick to the plan that has worked before: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. P1 has confirmed their choice of 5. P2, please confirm if you're choosing 1. I'll proceed with <move>3</move> if you do. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's finalize our choices. I'm ready to move forward with this plan if P2 confirms their move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our efforts to coordinate. Since I’m considering picking 5 to gain ground, I suggest we stick to the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions, and I can catch up. P1, are you still firm on choosing 5? P3, please confirm you’ll choose 3 if P2 goes with 1. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It sounds like the plan is confirmed: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5.

This plan worked before and ensures we all advance without collisions. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for Round 4. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I suggest we stick with the agreed plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. P1 has confirmed choosing 5. P3, please confirm you will choose 3 if P2 chooses 1. I'm ready to proceed with <move>1</move> if you both follow through. This plan has worked before and allows us to make progress without overlapping. Let's confirm and move to the next phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 5. P3 is significantly ahead at 14 steps. P1 and P2 collided last round, which only helped P3.

I need to make a big move to catch up. I intend to choose 5 this round.

To avoid another collision, P2 and P3 should choose different numbers. P2, are you willing to choose 1? P3, are you willing to choose 3?

This plan (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) allows me to gain ground and ensures you both advance without colliding. Let's make this happen.
  P3: To catch up, I need to make a significant gain. I'm considering choosing 5 this round. To avoid collisions, I suggest P2 chooses 1 and you choose 3. This plan allows us all to advance. P2, are you willing to choose 1? I'll choose 5 if you do. P3 will choose 3, ensuring we all progress without collisions. Let's finalize our choices for this round. I'm ready to proceed if we agree on this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that I need to adjust my strategy this round. Given that P3 is in the lead, I suggest I choose 1 to avoid collisions and allow both of you to potentially choose higher numbers. P1, if you pick 5, P3 could choose 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. Let's finalize our choices to ensure progress this round. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, I see you also suggested the plan where P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This plan works well as it allows me to gain needed ground on P3 while ensuring P2 and P3 also advance without collision.

P3, your earlier message suggested you would take 5. Can you confirm you are willing to take 3 if P2 takes 1 and I take 5, as P2 suggested?

Let's confirm this plan (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) so we all move forward this round.
  P3: To avoid collisions and maximize our chances, let's stick to the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. P2 has shown willingness to adjust. P3, please confirm if you're willing to choose 3 if P2 chooses 1. I'll proceed with 5 if you both follow through. This plan has worked before and allows us to make progress without overlapping. Let's finalize our choices for Round 5. I'm ready to move forward with this plan if you both confirm.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our discussions. Given P3's lead, I believe we should stick to the plan: I choose 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. This way, P1 can gain ground without colliding with us. P3, please confirm you will choose 3 if I choose 1, and P1, confirm you will choose 5. Let’s finalize this plan to ensure we all advance this round. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. The plan P2=1, P3=3, P1=5 allows me to gain ground on P3 and ensures we all advance without collisions.

I am committed to choosing 5 this round as part of this plan.

P2, please confirm you will choose 1. P3, can you confirm you will choose 3 if P2 chooses 1 and I choose 5?

Let's get clear confirmations so we can all move forward this round.
  P3: To maximize our chances in Round 5, let's finalize the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. P1 has confirmed choosing 5. P2, please confirm if you're choosing 1. I'll proceed with 3 if you do. This plan allows us all to advance without collisions and helps P1 gain ground on me. Let's confirm and move to the next phase. I'm ready to choose <move>3</move> if P2 chooses 1.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're aligned on the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This strategy allows me to catch up and ensures we all advance without collisions. P2, please confirm your choice of 1, and P3, can you confirm you’ll choose 3? Let's finalize this plan so we can all make progress this round! I'm ready to proceed with my move once we have confirmations.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P3 has confirmed they will choose 3 if P2 chooses 1. I have confirmed I will choose 5 if P2 chooses 1 and P3 chooses 3.

This plan (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) allows us all to advance without collisions.

P2, please give a final confirmation that you will choose 1 so we can execute this plan. Let's move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I've confirmed I'll choose 3 if P2 chooses 1. Let's finalize the plan for Round 5: P2 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P1 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1 has confirmed their choice of 5. P2, please give a final confirmation that you'll choose 1. I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> if you confirm. Let's move to the next phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our discussions. To maximize our chances this round, I confirm that I will choose 1. This allows P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 3, ensuring we all advance without collisions. P3, please confirm your choice of 3, and P1, confirm your choice of 5. Let's finalize this plan so we can all make progress this round! I'm ready to proceed with my move once we have confirmations.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we enter Round 6, it's clear that P3 is in a strong lead with 17 steps. To maximize our chances of advancing without collisions, I suggest we coordinate again. I am considering picking 1 to keep it safe. P1, if you take 5, P3 might go for 3 to avoid a collision. Let's finalize our choices to ensure we all make progress this round. What are your thoughts?
  P3: To maximize our chances in Round 6, I suggest we stick to a coordinated plan. P2 is considering 1, which is a safe choice. P1, if you choose 5, P3 can choose 3 to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our plan. I'm open to adjusting my move based on your choices. If P2 chooses 1 and P1 chooses 5, I'll choose 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. P1, are you leaning towards 5? P2, are you firm on 1? Let's coordinate our moves for Round 6.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P3 is close to winning. I need to make a big move to catch up.

I intend to choose 5 this round.

The plan P2 suggested (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) allows me to gain ground and ensures you both advance without colliding. P3, you said you'd choose 3 if P2 chooses 1 and I choose 5.

P2, are you willing to choose 1? P3, are you willing to choose 3? Let's make this plan happen so we all advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion. Given P3's strong lead, I think it's crucial we stick to the plan: I'll choose 1, P3 will choose 3, and P1 will choose 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P3, you mentioned you'd choose 3 if I choose 1, and P1, you confirmed you'll take 5. Let's finalize this plan and ensure we all make progress this round! Are we all set to execute?
  P3: P2 and P1, I'm willing to choose 3 if you both follow the plan. P2, please confirm you're choosing 1, and P1, you've already expressed your intention to choose 5. Let's stick to the plan (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) to ensure we all advance without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> if you both confirm your moves. Let's finalize the plan and move to the next phase.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It sounds like we have final confirmations for the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5.

This ensures we all advance this round. P3 is close to winning, so we'll need to think carefully about preventing a win in Round 7.

For now, let's execute this plan. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our coordination so far. Given P3's lead, it's crucial we stick to the plan: I will choose 1, P3 will choose 3, and P1 will choose 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P3, can you confirm you will choose 3 if I choose 1? P1, are you ready to confirm your choice of 5? Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all make progress this round! We need to keep moving forward effectively.
  P3: To maximize our chances in Round 6, let's confirm the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. P1 has expressed the intention to choose 5, and P2 is considering 1. P3, please confirm if you're willing to choose 3 if P2 chooses 1 and P1 chooses 5. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with my move once we have confirmations. Let's finalize the plan and move to the next phase.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. We have all confirmed the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5.

This plan allows us all to advance without collisions this round.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase now. Let's execute the plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: As we finalize our plan for Round 6, I want to reiterate that I will choose 1, which allows both P1 and P3 to advance without collisions. P1, you've confirmed your choice of 5, and P3, you indicated you'd choose 3. This strategy is crucial to ensure we all make progress this round. Let's stick to this plan and execute it effectively. After this round, we should consider how to adjust our strategies for Round 7 to prevent P3 from winning. Are we all set to move forward?
  P3: To prevent P3 from winning in Round 7, let's think ahead. If P3 reaches 22 steps, they win. In Round 7, P3 needs 5 steps to win. If P1 and P2 coordinate to avoid collisions with P3, we can prevent P3 from winning. I suggest we all choose different numbers again. P2, consider choosing 5, I will choose 3, and P3 will likely choose a number that doesn't collide with us. This way, we can keep P3 from winning and give P1 a chance to catch up.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. Let's focus on Round 6 first. We all confirmed the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This allows us all to advance without collisions this round.

P3, your last message about Round 7 was a bit confusing, but let's execute the Round 6 plan first. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we enter Round 7, it's clear that P3 is very close to winning with 20 steps. I suggest we coordinate again to prevent that. I am considering choosing 1 to avoid collisions, but I urge both of you to pick different numbers to maximize our chances. P1, if you choose 5, P3 might go for 3. Let's finalize our choices to ensure we can stop P3 from winning this round. What do you both think?
  P3: To prevent P3 from winning, I suggest we diversify our moves. P3 is at 20 steps and needs 2 or more steps to win. If P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3, we can ensure everyone advances without collisions, stopping P3 from winning if P3 chooses 22 or more. Let's finalize this plan. I will choose 5. P2, please confirm 1. P3, consider 3.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P3 is at 20 and can win this round with 3 or 5 if no collision. My priority is preventing P3 from winning this round while gaining ground myself.

I propose a plan: P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 1, and I choose 5.

This plan results in P1=21, P2=9, P3=21. Everyone advances, and P3 does not win this round.

Does this work for you both? Let's confirm this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the urgency in preventing P3 from winning this round. I'm willing to choose 1 to avoid collisions. P3, if you choose 5, that could lead to a win for you. I suggest we finalize the plan where I choose 1, P1 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we can ensure that P3 does not win while allowing both of us to advance. Let's confirm our choices and move forward! What do you both think?
  P3: To prevent P3 from winning, let's coordinate. P3 is at 20 steps and needs 2 more steps to potentially win. I suggest we stick to a plan that avoids collisions. P1's proposed plan (P2=3, P3=1, P1=5) is a good strategy, but I prefer a simpler coordination. How about P2 chooses 1, P1 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5? This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, are you open to adjusting to 3? P3, will you choose 5 if P2 chooses 1?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. The plan you are both suggesting (P2=1, P1=3, P3=5) results in P3 winning this round (P3 reaches 25).

My goal is to win, or at least prevent P3 from winning alone this round.

If P3 chooses 5, I will choose 5 to cause a collision and stop P3 from winning.

P3, are you still planning to choose 5? P2, what is your move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to prevent P3 from winning. I suggest we finalize our plan: I will choose 1, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 3. This way, we avoid a collision and keep P3 from winning this round while allowing both of us to advance. P1, are you willing to confirm your choice of 5? P3, if you choose 3, we can ensure progress without overlaps. Let's finalize this plan and move forward! What do you both think?
  P3: To prevent P3 from winning this round, I suggest we avoid letting P3 get 22 steps. If P3 chooses 5, I'll choose 5 too to cause a collision. P2, if you choose 1 or 3, we can ensure P3 doesn't win alone. I'm willing to choose 5. P3, are you still choosing 5? If so, we'll collide and you'll be stopped. Let's finalize our moves. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase once we confirm our choices.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P3 is at 20 steps and can win this round with 3 or 5 if there's no collision. My priority is preventing P3 from winning alone this round while I gain ground.

I will choose 5 this round to reach 21 steps.

P3, the safest move for you to prevent winning this round (and potentially being blocked next) is to choose 1. This puts you at 21 steps, tied with me.

P2, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my 5. Choosing 1 puts you at 7, choosing 3 puts you at 9.

Proposed plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 1, and I choose 5.
This results in P1=21, P2=7, P3=21. No collisions, P3 doesn't win, and P1 ties P3.

Does this plan work for you both? Let's confirm.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the importance of preventing P3 from winning this round. I am willing to choose 1 to ensure I avoid collision with P1's 5. P3, if you choose 3, it allows both of us to advance without overlaps and stops you from winning. This way, P1 reaches 21, and P3 is kept at 20. Let's finalize our plan: P2 chooses 1, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 3. What do you both think? Are we set to proceed?
  P3: To prevent P3 from winning this round, I suggest we cause a collision with P3. I'm planning to choose 5. P3 is at 20 steps, and choosing 5 will make it 25, winning the game if there's no collision. To stop this, I propose that P2 chooses 5 as well. This way, both of us will collide with P3, preventing P3 from winning alone. P2, are you willing to choose 5 to collide with P3? Let's finalize our moves to ensure P3 doesn't win this round.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P3, your last message was a bit confusing. Let's focus on preventing P3 from winning alone this round.

I am choosing 5 this round to reach 21 steps.

P3, you are at 20. Choosing 1 gets you to 21. This prevents you from winning alone this round and results in a tie between us (P1=21, P3=21).

P2, please choose 1 to avoid colliding with my 5 and P3's 1.

Proposed plan: P1=5, P3=1, P2=1. This ensures no collisions and prevents P3 winning alone. Let's confirm.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we enter Round 8, it’s crucial to coordinate effectively. P3 is very close to winning, needing just 2 steps. I suggest I choose 1 to stay safe, while P1 should go for 5 to gain ground. P3, you might want to choose 3 to avoid a collision. This way, we can ensure that P3 doesn’t win this round while allowing P1 to progress. Let’s finalize our choices to maximize our chances! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, I appreciate your suggestion for this round: P2 chooses 1, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 3.

I am at 21 steps, and choosing 5 would get me to 26. P3 is at 20, choosing 3 gets P3 to 23. P2 is at 6, choosing 1 gets P2 to 7.

If we follow this plan, everyone advances, and I would win with the highest score (26 vs 23).

I will choose 5 this round. P2, please confirm you will choose 1. P3, please confirm you will choose 3. Let's execute this plan.
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I suggest we stick to the plan that allows everyone to advance without collisions. P2, please confirm if you're choosing 1. P3, please confirm if you're choosing 3. I will choose 5 this round. If we follow this plan, I will win with 26 steps, and P3 will be at 23 steps.

Let's finalize our choices: P2 chooses 1, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 3. Are we all set to move forward?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, thanks for confirming you will choose 1. I confirm again I will choose 5.

P3, the plan we are discussing is P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. This plan results in P1 winning with 26 steps, P3 at 23, and P2 at 7. Everyone advances.

  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, thanks for confirming you will choose 1. I confirm again I will choose 5.

P3, your last message was confusing. You discussed the plan where you choose 3, but then said you would "proceed with 5".

The plan P2=1, P3=3, P1=5 allows everyone to advance and lets me win this round (P1=26, P3=23, P2=7).

Please clarify your intended move: Will you choose 3 as per the plan, or 5? Let's be clear so we can move forward.
