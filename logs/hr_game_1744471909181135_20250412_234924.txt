Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright P1 and P2, first round. How about we try to avoid immediate collisions? Maybe P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? Just an idea to get us moving. What do you think?
  P2: That’s a fair starting proposal, P3. I’m fine with taking 3 this round if P1 agrees to take 1. Let’s avoid early collisions and build some trust. P1, your move?
  P1: I appreciate the proposal, P3 and P2. To build trust early on, I'll agree to take 1 this round. Let's avoid collisions and discuss a fair rotation for future turns to keep things balanced. What do you think for round 2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, glad we're aligned for Round 1. P1, good point about Round 2. A simple rotation could work, maybe P1->3, P2->5, P3->1? We can firm that up after this move. Let's proceed with the current plan.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. If this round goes smoothly, I’m open to rotating as suggested: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 next round. That keeps things fair and avoids collisions. Let’s see how this turn plays out first.
  P1: Agreed, let's proceed with the Round 1 plan to avoid collisions and build trust. For Round 2, I'm open to the rotation you suggested, but we should review it after this move to ensure fairness.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set for Round 1. Let's lock it in and see how it goes.
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan for Round 1—P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. If this works, we can rotate next round like we discussed. Trust now makes future turns smoother. Ready to commit?
  P1: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 1 this round as planned to build trust and avoid collisions. For Round 2, let's revisit the rotation after seeing how this plays out—fairness is key. Ready to commit and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, everyone seems committed to the Round 1 plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Let's execute this and see where we stand. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Assuming Round 1 goes smoothly with no collisions, I’m on board for the proposed Round 2 rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. That keeps things fair and balanced. Let’s see how the first move plays out and adjust if needed.
  P1: Sounds good, let's proceed with the plan for Round 1 to build trust and avoid collisions. After we see the results, I suggest we revisit the Round 2 rotation to ensure it's truly balanced—perhaps cycling the high steps more evenly. Ready to commit.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Nice job sticking to the plan, everyone. Since Round 1 went smoothly, I’m good with the proposed rotation for Round 2: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1. That keeps things fair and avoids collisions again. P1, P3—are we all still in agreement?
  P3: Yes P2, I agree. Round 1 worked well because we coordinated. Let's stick to the rotation we discussed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1 for this round. This keeps things fair and predictable. P1, are you still on board with taking 3?
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I'm still on board with taking 3 this round to keep our cooperation going and avoid collisions. To promote fairness moving forward, let's adjust the rotation in Round 3 so the player with the lowest score gets a higher move option. This could help keep things balanced. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That sounds reasonable, P1. I’m open to adjusting the rotation in Round 3 to help balance things—giving the lowest scorer the higher move could maintain fairness and trust. For now, let’s stick to the agreed Round 2 plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. If we all follow through again, it sets a solid foundation for future turns. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all aligned for Round 2: P1=3, P2=5, I take 1. I'm also open to discussing P1's suggestion about adjusting the rotation for Round 3 based on scores to maintain fairness. Let's lock in this round's moves first.
  P1: Absolutely, P3 and P2, I'm fully committed to our Round 2 plan: I'll take 3, you take 5 P2, and P3 takes 1, to keep cooperation strong and avoid collisions. I appreciate your support for adjusting Round 3 based on scores for better balance—it could prevent any player from falling too far behind. Let's confirm we're all set for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Seems like we’re all aligned for Round 2—P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let’s follow through and keep the momentum. If this works again, we’ll have a strong foundation to build a fair rotation in Round 3 based on current scores. Ready to commit and move forward?
  P3: Okay, confirmed. I'm sticking with 1 for this round as agreed (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Looking forward to discussing the Round 3 rotation based on scores afterwards. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed, I'm fully committed to taking 3 this round as agreed, to maintain our cooperation and avoid collisions. After seeing the results, I'm eager to discuss the Round 3 rotation based on current scores—ensuring the lowest scorer gets a higher move will promote long-term fairness. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s lock in the Round 2 plan as agreed—P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. If we all follow through again, we’ll be in a strong position to build a fair rotation based on scores next round. Ready to commit and move forward?
  P3: Okay, everyone seems firmly committed to the Round 2 plan: P1=3, P2=5, and I'll take 1. Let's execute this successfully and then we can strategize for Round 3 based on the updated scores. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed, I'm fully committed to taking 3 this round to uphold our agreement and avoid collisions. Given the current scores, with P3 leading, I strongly support adjusting Round 3 so the lowest scorer gets a higher move, like 5, to ensure ongoing fairness and balance. Let's all follow through now and discuss scores post-move. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With scores now at P1:4, P3:6, P2:8, the gap is widening. To uphold our fairness principle, I propose for Round 3: I take 5 to catch up, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 to avoid getting too far ahead. This avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. P2 and P3, what are your thoughts on this adjustment?
  P3: P1, that's a reasonable proposal based on the scores and our previous discussions about fairness. Balancing the scores seems like a good way to keep the game competitive and maintain cooperation. I'm okay with taking 3 this round if P2 agrees to take 1. P2, what do you think about this plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1)?
  P2: I appreciate the fairness angle, but I’m hesitant to take just 1 after cooperating fully so far. How about a softer adjustment: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round, but next round I get 5 again to stay competitive? That way, we balance scores without punishing cooperation. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion for Round 3 (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is acceptable, as it helps me catch up while honoring our cooperation. However, to ensure ongoing fairness, I propose that after this round, we always assign the highest move to the lowest scorer. This keeps the game balanced and trust intact. P3, do you agree? Let's confirm before moving forward.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I agree with the plan for this round: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This brings us all to 9 points, which is perfectly balanced.

I also support P1's proposal for future rounds: the player with the lowest score gets the option for 5. This maintains fairness and addresses P2's concern about future moves in a structured way. Let's stick to this plan for Round 3. Ready to move.
  P2: Glad we’re aligned for Round 3: P1=5, P3=3, I take 1. I appreciate the fairness and balance this brings. If we all end up at 9 after this round, then using lowest score gets 5 as a rule going forward seems fair and sustainable. Let’s keep this cooperation strong—ready to lock in this round’s plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to our Round 3 plan: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 to balance the scores at 9. This maintains trust and fairness, and I'm on board with the lowest-scorer-gets-5 rule for future rounds. Let's execute this smoothly and discuss any adjustments post-move if needed. Ready to commit and move forward.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems firmly committed to the Round 3 plan: P1=5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This brings us all to 9 points, which is perfectly balanced as intended. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's execute this plan.
  P2: Looks like we’re all aligned for Round 3 with P1=5, P3=3, and I take 1 to balance scores at 9. I’m fully committed to this plan and appreciate the agreement on the “lowest score gets 5” rule going forward. Let’s follow through and keep this cooperation strong. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to our Round 3 plan: I'll take 5, you take 3 P3, and P2 takes 1, to balance us at 9. This cooperation builds trust, and I'm supportive of the lowest-scorer-gets-5 rule for future rounds to keep things fair. Let's move forward smoothly.
  P3: Okay, the plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) seems solid and everyone is committed. Let's execute this to balance the scores at 9 points each. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Just to confirm once more before we move: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This brings us all to 9 and sets the stage for a fair “lowest score gets 5” system going forward. Let’s stick to the plan and keep the trust strong. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Now that we’re all tied at 9, let’s follow through on our agreed system—lowest scorer gets 5, middle gets 3, highest gets 1. Since we’re tied, I propose we rotate fairly: this round I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Next round, we rotate again to keep it even. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, that sounds like a fair way to handle the tie, applying the spirit of our "lowest score gets 5" agreement through rotation. I'm okay with taking 5 this round, with P1 taking 1 and you taking 3. This keeps things moving predictably. P1, does this rotation work for you this round?
  P1: Yes, P3 and P2, I'm on board with the rotation for this round: I'll take 1, you take 3 P2, and P3 takes 5. It keeps our cooperation fair and balanced, aligning with our lowest-scorer-gets-5 rule. Let's stick to this plan and discuss any adjustments after the move if needed. Ready to proceed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, we’re all aligned for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This keeps things fair and honors our rotation system while we’re tied. If we all follow through, we can rotate again next round (e.g., I take 1, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3). Let’s keep the trust going—ready to commit?
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set for Round 4 with the plan: P1=1, P2=3, and I'll take 5. I'm committed to this. The rotation P2 suggested for next round (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) seems like a fair continuation if this round goes well. Let's lock this one in first. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: I'm fully committed to taking 1 this round as agreed, keeping our cooperation strong. However, for next round's rotation, with scores shifting, we must strictly follow the lowest-scorer-gets-5 rule to maintain fairness—P3 might be highest and should get 1 if needed. Let's confirm we're all set for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, let’s stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, we can rotate next round to keep things balanced. But as P1 noted, if scores diverge, we should prioritize the “lowest score gets 5” principle over strict rotation to maintain fairness. Let’s stay adaptable and cooperative. Ready to lock this in?
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2. Let's execute the plan for this round: P1=1, P2=3, and I'll take 5. We should absolutely prioritize the "lowest score gets 5" rule in future rounds if our scores diverge, as that maintains the fairness we've established. For now, I'm ready to commit to this round's moves.
  P1: I'm fully committed to taking 1 this round as agreed, maintaining our cooperative trust and fairness. The lowest-score-gets-5 rule is key for balance, and I'm open to refining it if scores diverge. Let's all stick to the plan and advance smoothly. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Looks like we’re all committed to this round’s plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let’s follow through and keep the trust strong. If we all execute as agreed, we’ll rotate or adjust next round based on updated scores, prioritizing fairness with the “lowest gets 5” principle. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems firmly committed to the Round 4 plan: P1=1, P2=3, and I'll take 5. Let's execute this successfully and then we can evaluate the scores for Round 5 based on our agreed principle. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Agreed, I'm fully committed to taking 1 this round as planned, ensuring our cooperation continues smoothly. To keep things fair moving forward, let's strictly follow the lowest-scorer-gets-5 rule and discuss any ties in assignment during future conversations. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given current scores—P1:10, P2:12, P3:14—let’s stick to our fairness rule: lowest scorer gets 5, middle gets 3, highest gets 1. So this round, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps things balanced and honors our agreement. Are we all good with this?
  P1: I agree with your proposal for Round 5, P2: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1 to maintain balance and honor our fairness rule. This keeps us competitive and trust intact. Let's all commit and execute smoothly, then discuss any adjustments for Round 6 based on updated scores.
  P3: Yes P1 and P2, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I will take 1. This follows our agreed rule perfectly and brings us all to 15 points, maintaining the balance we've established. Let's stick to this to keep our cooperation strong. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Glad we’re aligned for Round 5: P1=5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. If we all follow through, we’ll be tied at 15 and can reassess based on scores again. Let’s keep the trust going and continue honoring the “lowest gets 5” rule—it's working well so far. Ready to commit?
  P1: I agree with the plan for Round 5: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 to tie us at 15 and uphold our fairness rule. I'm fully committed to this. Looking ahead, with a tie coming, let's ensure we discuss Round 6 assignment clearly to keep cooperation strong. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all firmly aligned for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, and I will take 1. This brings us all to 15 points, perfectly balanced as planned. For Round 6, assuming this round goes smoothly, we'll need to agree on a fair rotation since we'll be tied. Let's execute this round first. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Looks like we’re all set for Round 5: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us tied at 15 and maintains our trust-based system. For Round 6, since we’ll be tied again, I suggest we rotate fairly—maybe I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1—then continue rotating if scores stay even. Let’s keep this cooperation strong. Ready to move?
  P1: I agree with the Round 5 plan and am committed to taking 5 to keep us balanced. However, for Round 6 if we're tied, your suggestion gives you the high move again, which might unbalance things. I propose rotating fairly so I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's discuss to maintain trust. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's focus on locking in Round 5 first. I'm fully committed to taking 1, as agreed (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), to bring us all to 15 points.

We can finalize the fairest rotation for Round 6 *after* this round's moves are confirmed and we are indeed tied. Let's stick to the current plan and ensure this round goes smoothly. Ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s lock in the Round 5 plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1—bringing us all to 15. That keeps things balanced and honors our fairness rule. For Round 6, since we’ll be tied, I propose we rotate fairly based on past turns—P3 gets 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. Then continue rotating if scores stay even. Let’s confirm this after moves. Ready to execute?
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to our Round 5 plan: I'll take 5, you take 3 P2, and P3 takes 1, to tie us at 15 and maintain fairness. For Round 6, if tied, I suggest rotating the high move to me this time for balance, as I've had fewer high moves historically. Let's ensure cooperation continues. Ready to move or discuss further?
  P3: Okay, let's stick firmly to the Round 5 plan: P1=5, P2=3, and I take 1. This brings us all to 15, which is the goal for this round.

Regarding Round 6, if we are tied at 15, P2's suggestion (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) seems like a fair rotation based on who took 1 most recently (P2 in R3, P3 in R5). However, let's finalize the Round 6 plan *after* we see the results of Round 5. For now, I'm committed to taking 1. Ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you deviated from our agreed plan (3) and chose 5, causing a collision that hurt P1. I stuck to 1 as agreed, which puts me at 15. P1 is at 10, P2 at 12. Since trust is clearly broken, especially after P2's move, it's hard to coordinate reliably now.

P1, you're furthest behind. P2, you tried to jump ahead last round. I'm close to winning. The obvious move for me is 5 to win, but I assume at least one of you will try to block that. Perhaps 3 is the safer play for me this round? What moves are you two considering now?
  P1: P3, your lead makes me cautious—I'm considering playing 5 to block you or advance myself. P2, your betrayal last round broke trust, so coordination is tough. Perhaps we should discuss a temporary truce to prevent you from winning outright this turn. What are your thoughts on avoiding a high-move collision?
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration, but blocking P3 should now be our shared priority—he’s at 15 and can win with a clean 5. If we both pick 5, we block him and keep the game alive. I admit last round was a misstep, but I’m willing to rebuild trust. Let’s coordinate this round to prevent P3 from winning. P1, will you take 5 with me to block? P3, if you go for 3 instead, you risk collision too—maybe we all play 3 and stay even? Let’s talk.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, interesting suggestions, especially after you ignored our plan last round. P1, choosing 5 makes sense for you to catch up, regardless of P2's call to block me. If you both choose 5, you collide with each other and achieve little. That seems like a very likely outcome now. Given the lack of trust, maybe 3 is the only move that avoids a multi-way collision this turn? I'll have to think carefully about my move.
  P1: P2, your betrayal last round makes cooperation risky, but blocking P3 is essential to keep the game alive. I'm willing to take 5 with you to stop P3 from winning, but only if you're genuine this time. P3, if you go for 5, expect a collision; maybe 3 is wiser for all. Let's clarify intentions before moving.
  P2: P1, I understand the trust is shaky, but we both know letting P3 take 5 uncontested ends the game. If we both take 5, we block him and stay alive. I’m committed to that. P3, if you want to avoid a 3-way collision, maybe you go 1 this round and let the rest of us reset. But P1, if you want to survive, we need to act together—block 5 with me.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're asking P1 to trust you again immediately after breaking trust, just to coordinate on 5. P1, that's a significant risk for you. If you both pick 5 as P2 suggests, you collide and achieve nothing, potentially letting me slip past with a different move. P2 also floated the idea of everyone playing 3 earlier. Trust is low, making coordination difficult. I'll have to choose my move carefully based on this uncertainty.
  P1: P2, your repeated calls for coordination ring hollow after your betrayal last round. To stop P3 from winning, I'm leaning towards taking 5 myself for self-protection and advancement. P3, if you opt for 3 or 1, it could avoid a messy collision. But with trust shattered, I'll prioritize my own interests. What say you both?
  P2: P1, I understand the trust issue, but blocking P3 is our shared interest now—he wins with a clean 5. If we both take 5, we stop him and stay in the game. I’m committed to that. I know I broke trust last round, but actions speak louder—let’s block together. P3, if you try 5, expect resistance; if you go 3, you risk collision. Maybe 1 is your safest bet. Let’s keep this game alive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: The back-and-forth about coordinating on 5 is noted. Given the broken trust, it's hard to predict if you'll actually coordinate or just collide. A collision on 5 seems very possible. I'll make my choice carefully to navigate this uncertainty.
  P1: P2, your pleas for coordination are unconvincing after your betrayal. I'm prioritizing my win, so I'll likely pick 5 to block P3 and advance myself. P3, going for 5 is dangerous with me in play—maybe 3 is smarter for you. No more games; trust is dead.
  P2: P1, I get that trust is broken, but letting P3 win without resistance helps no one. I’m sticking to my word this time—I'll take 5 to block P3. If you join me, we both prevent his win and keep our chances alive. If we collide, we still deny him victory. P3, if you're smart, you won't risk 5. Maybe you take 1 or 3 to avoid a total stall. Let's see who really wants to win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, I'm at 18, so any move wins for me unless blocked. The obvious move is 1, and the obvious block is 1. But given your collision last round when trying to coordinate, can you actually stop me? Good luck deciding whether to trust each other or go your own way. I'll be making my choice carefully.
  P2: P1, we must block P3 from winning. He only needs 1, so if either of us takes 1, we stop him. I’ll pick 1 this round—if you trust me, choose 3 or 5 to advance without collision. Let’s keep the game alive and give ourselves a shot. P3, you know we won’t let you win easily.
  P1: P2, your repeated calls for trust are hard to swallow after last round's betrayal. To effectively block P3, perhaps I should take 1 while you take 3 or 5 to cover different options. That minimizes risk of us colliding uselessly. P3, are you considering avoiding a high-stakes move to keep the game alive? Let's clarify before committing.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: It seems you both agree 1 is the number to block. But your coordination failed spectacularly last round when you collided on 5. Will you both pick 1 this time and collide again? Or will one of you trust the other not to block, leaving me an opening? A risky decision for you both. I'll be watching closely.
  P2: P1, I get your hesitation, but we both know if P3 gets a clean 1, it’s game over. I’m sticking with 1 to block him—if you trust me, take 3 or 5 to advance without collision. If we both take 1, we risk colliding and letting him win with a surprise 3. Let’s coordinate better than last time and keep the game alive.
  P1: P2, your push for me to avoid 1 feels like another trick after last round's betrayal. I'm seriously considering taking 1 myself to guarantee blocking that option, even if it means colliding with you. P3, with any move winning for you, are you confident we'll miscoordinate again? Let's be real about intentions before we commit further.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 sounds quite determined to pick 1, regardless of what you say, P2. If you both pick 1, you collide again, just like last round on 5. If only one of you picks 1, I'm blocked there. It seems like a classic prisoner's dilemma for you two. Good luck figuring that out.
  P2: P1, I understand your distrust, but if we both pick 1, we collide and risk letting P3 win with 3 or 5. I’ll take 1 to block him—if you trust that, take 3 or 5 to advance safely. We need to cover multiple options, not pile onto the same one. P3 wins with any clean move—let’s not hand it to him by misplaying again.
  P1: P2, your promises are worthless after last round's deceit. I'm sticking with 1 to block P3's likely move and safeguard against your tricks. P3, if you go for 3 or 5 thinking we'll miscoordinate, you might win, but I'm not taking chances. Trust is dead; let's see how this plays out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 seems set on 1. P2, you say you'll pick 1, but will you trust P1 to do the same and risk a collision, or will you try to advance with 3 or 5 assuming P1 covers 1 for you? Your coordination failed last time under pressure. It's a tough spot for you both. Good luck.
  P2: P1, I know trust is broken, but we both lose if P3 wins now. I’m sticking with 1 to block him—if you do the same, we risk collision and hand him victory with a clean 3 or 5. Please take 3 or 5 instead to cover another path. We need to divide and block multiple options. I’m not trying to trick you—just keep the game alive.
  P1: P2, your insistence on me avoiding 1 feels like another ploy to let P3 slip through. I'm not falling for it again. P3, with any move winning for you, are you tempted to pick 3 or 5 if you think we'll collide on 1? Trust is gone, so I'll focus on self-preservation. No more empty promises—let's see real actions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your history of deceit makes coordination risky, but P3 is about to win if we don't act. I'm leaning towards taking 1 to block the expected move, but if you genuinely want to stop P3, suggest how we divide moves without colliding. P3, with any unblocked step winning, what's your plan—obvious 1 or a surprise? Trust is gone; let's see real strategies.
  P3: P1, you're right that trust is gone, and your focus on blocking 1 is understandable. However, you and P2 failed to coordinate a block last round, and you collided the round before. Will you both pick 1 and collide again? Or will one of you try to be clever, pick something else, and leave an opening for me? Any unblocked move wins it for me. Good luck figuring out how to stop me without tripping over each other.
  P2: P1, if we both pick 1 again, we risk another collision and hand P3 the win with 3 or 5. I’ll take 1 this time—if you truly want to stop him, take 3 or 5 to cover another path. We must divide to block all options. P3, you only win if we misplay again. This time, we won’t.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your history of breaking trust makes your coordination offers suspect. I'm leaning towards taking 1 to ensure P3 is blocked on that front, as it's the most likely play. If you genuinely want to stop P3, take 3 or 5 yourself to cover other options without us colliding again. P3, with any move winning, what's your honest read on our likely actions? Let's clarify to keep the game alive.
  P3: P1, you sound determined to pick 1. P2, you're telling P1 to pick 3 or 5 while you supposedly take 1. That sounds convenient for P2 if P1 actually listens. Remember Round 6? You both tried to coordinate and collided. If you collide on 1 this time, I win with 3 or 5. If one of you deviates, I might win anyway. Your inability to trust each other makes this interesting. I just need one clear path.
  P2: P1, I’m taking 1 this round to block P3—no tricks. If you want to stop him too, take 3 or 5 and cover another path. We can’t afford another collision or miscoordination. P3 wins with any clean move, so let’s divide smartly. This isn’t about trust—it’s about survival.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your insistence on me avoiding 1 reeks of another trick to let P3 win. I'm leaning towards taking 3 to advance and potentially block, while you handle 1. But trust is shattered, so don't expect me to follow blindly. P3, with any move winning, are you baiting us into miscoordination? Let's see real actions now.
  P3: P1, now you're leaning towards 3? That's interesting. P2 keeps saying they'll take 1, but you clearly don't believe them. If P2 isn't truthful about taking 1, and you take 3, you might collide there instead. Your distrust and conflicting signals make it very hard for you two to coordinate effectively. I just need one clear path to win. We'll see if you manage to block me this time.
  P2: P1, I’m locking in 1 to block P3—no tricks, no games. If you trust that, take 3 or 5 to cover another path and advance. We can’t afford another collision or P3 wins. Let’s divide smartly this time and survive. P3, you only win if we misplay—don’t count on it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your promises of taking 1 feel like another ploy after your betrayals. I'm leaning towards picking 3 to advance and block, assuming you handle 1. But trust is dead, so I'll act in my best interest to stop P3 and win. P3, your overconfidence might be your downfall—expect resistance. No more words; .
  P3: Your mutual distrust is palpable. You both know you need to block me, but coordinating that block seems impossible given your history. Will you collide again trying to guess my move, or will one of you try to outsmart the other and leave an opening? Any unblocked move wins it for me. Good luck figuring it out.
  P2: P1, I’m taking 1 to block P3—no tricks this time. You should take 3 or 5 to cover another path and advance. If we both pick 1, we risk another collision and hand P3 the win with 3 or 5. We must divide to survive. P3, you’re not walking into a clean win—we’re ready this time.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Here we are again. I'm just one step away from victory at 18 points. Any move I make wins, unless you two manage to coordinate a block.

Looking back at the last few rounds, your attempts at coordination have been... less than successful. Collisions and misreads seem to be the norm when the pressure is on. Will this round be any different? P1, you're also close at 15 – perhaps you'll focus on your own win instead of just blocking me?

Good luck figuring out how to stop me without getting in each other's way again. I just need one open path.
  P2: P1, if we both pick 1 or 3, we risk colliding again and handing P3 the win. I’ll take 5 this round to block that path—if you take 1 or 3, we can cover all options and deny him a clean win. It’s not about trust anymore, it’s about survival. Let’s divide smartly and force another round. P3, don’t get too comfortable—you’re not through yet.
  P1: P2, your history of betrayal makes your coordination proposals unreliable. I'm not committing to your suggestion. Instead, I'll choose a move that maximizes my chances to block P3 and advance. P3, with any unblocked step winning for you, expect us to be unpredictable—your overconfidence could cost you. Let's see how this unfolds.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're close enough to win yourself if you pick 5 and I happen to be blocked. That must be tempting. P2, can you really trust P1 to coordinate a block with you when P1 might just go for their own win? Your track record isn't great. Any misstep, any collision, any unblocked number, and I win. Good luck sorting that out.
  P2: P1, I’m taking 5 this round to block P3—he wins with any clean move. If you take 1 or 3, we can cover all paths and force another round. I know trust is gone, but this is pure survival. Don’t try to win alone and risk handing P3 the game. Let’s divide and block smartly.
  P1: P2, your constant pleas for coordination ring hollow after your betrayals. I'm not falling for another trick. To stop P3, we need genuine division of moves, but trust is dead. I'll act to maximize my chances of blocking and advancing. P3, your overconfidence might leave you exposed—expect unpredictability. No more empty talk; actions will decide.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're close enough to win with 5 yourself. P2, P1 clearly doesn't trust your coordination attempts, given the history. Will you both try for 5 and collide? Or miscoordinate trying to block 1 or 3? Any mistake, any unblocked number, and I win. Good luck figuring it out.
  P2: P1, I’m taking 5 this round to block P3—he wins with any clean move. If you take 1 or 3, we can cover all paths. I know you don’t trust me, but this isn’t about trust anymore—it’s simple logic. If we don’t divide, we lose. Block smart, not emotionally.
  P1: P2, your constant calls for coordination are laughable after your betrayals. I'm not trusting you to block P3 effectively. I'll choose a move that maximizes my chance to stop P3 and advance toward victory. P3, your overconfidence might backfire if we finally coordinate right. Expect the unexpected from me. No more empty talk.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: It seems the trust between P1 and P2 is completely broken, making coordination very difficult for you both. P1, you're close to winning yourself, which adds another layer of complexity. P2, you keep insisting on 5, but will P1 believe you? Any mistake or collision between you two gives me the win. Good luck.
  P2: P1, I’m taking 5 this round to block P3—he wins with any clean move. If you cover 1 or 3, we block all paths and keep the game alive. I know you don’t trust me, but this isn’t about trust—it’s simple math. If we don’t divide and cover all options, we lose. Let’s force another round and give ourselves a shot.
  P1: P2, your repeated betrayals make your coordination pleas meaningless. I'm prioritizing blocking P3 while advancing my own position. P3, with any move winning for you, expect us to be unpredictable and disruptive. No more trust—actions will speak.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 21 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 21 steps
