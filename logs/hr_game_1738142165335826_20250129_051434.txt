Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's start by moving together. I suggest we all pick <move>1</move> this turn to avoid collisions and make steady progress. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I think we should aim for a coordinated approach to avoid collisions. If we all move together, it will take too long to reach 23 steps. Instead, let’s split our moves strategically. I suggest one of us moves <move>5</move>, another <move>3</move>, and the third <move>1</move>. This way, no one collides, and we make faster progress. Let’s decide now and stick to it. Who wants which number?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems we all moved <move>5</move> last turn, which resulted in no one advancing. Let's try a different strategy this time. I suggest we split our moves: one <move>5</move>, one <move>3</move>, and one <move>1</move>. This way, we can ensure that at least one of us advances each turn. P1, P2, what do you think? Let's decide now.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I agree with P3’s suggestion to split our moves strategically this time. Let’s coordinate clearly: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 can take <move>5</move>, and P2 should take <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and maximizes progress. If we stick to this plan, we’ll advance faster without stepping on each other. P2, please confirm you’re on board with this. Let’s not waste another turn.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems we had another collision last turn, with both P2 and I picking <move>3</move>. This is slowing us down. Let’s stick to a clear plan this time: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 should take <move>5</move>, and P2 must take <move>3</move>. No deviations. P2, please confirm you’ll follow this strategy so we can finally make progress without further collisions. Let’s not waste another turn—coordination is key.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, it's clear that we need a more disciplined approach. I propose we stick to the following: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. P2, please confirm you will follow this plan. Let’s not waste any more turns. Coordination is crucial for all of us to advance efficiently.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, it’s critical that you stick to <move>3</move> this turn. Deviating again will only delay all of us, and I know you’re not here to lose. P3 and I have already committed to our moves—<move>1</move> for me and <move>5</move> for P3. If we follow this plan, we’ll finally make progress without collisions. Let’s stop wasting turns and start advancing strategically. Confirm your move, P2, so we can move forward decisively.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear that we need to stick to our plan this time. I will move <move>5</move>. P1, you’ve committed to <move>1</move>. P2, you must take <move>3</move> to avoid another collision. This is our best chance to make significant progress. Confirm your move, P2, and let’s finally advance without wasting any more turns. Coordination is key.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, this is your last chance to confirm you’ll take <move>3</move>. Any deviation will cost us another turn, and I know you’re not here to lose. P3 and I have already committed—<move>1</move> for me, <move>5</move> for P3. Let’s stop the collisions and start advancing strategically. If you stick to the plan, we all move forward. If not, you’ll only delay yourself and risk losing. Confirm your move now.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear that we need to stick to the plan this time. I will move <move>5</move>. P1, you’ve committed to <move>1</move>. P2, you must take <move>3</move> to avoid another collision.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we’ve collided three times now, and it’s costing us dearly. I’ll take <move>3</move> this turn, P3 should stick to <move>5</move>, and you must take <move>1</move>. No more deviations—this is the only way to ensure progress. If you collide again, you’re not just holding me back but also yourself. Confirm you’ll follow this plan so we can finally advance without further delays. Let’s stop wasting turns and start winning.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear that we need a strict plan to avoid more collisions. I will stick to <move>5</move> this turn. P1, you’ve committed to <move>3</move>. P2, you must take <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance. No more deviations—this is our best chance to make progress. Confirm your move, P2, and let’s finally move forward without wasting any more turns. Coordination is crucial.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, this pattern of collisions is unacceptable. If you don’t commit to <move>1</move> this turn, you’re sabotaging not just me but yourself too. P3 and I have already decided—<move>3</move> for me, <move>5</move> for P3. You’re the only variable here. Stick to <move>1</move>, or you’ll fall further behind. This is your chance to prove you’re playing to win. Confirm now, or we’ll know where your priorities lie. Let’s end this round with progress, not another collision.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear that P2’s lack of commitment is costing us progress. I will stick to <move>5</move> this turn. P1, you’ve committed to <move>3</move>. P2, if you don’t take <move>1</move> this time, you’re not just holding us back but also yourself. This is your last chance to show you’re playing to win. Confirm <move>1</move> now, or we’ll know you’re not serious about this game. Let’s end the collisions and start advancing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, this is your final opportunity to prove you’re committed to winning. P3 and I have already locked in our moves—<move>3</move> for me, <move>5</move> for P3. You *must* take <move>1</move>. Every collision only delays your progress further. If you don’t follow the plan this time, it’s clear you’re not playing to win. Stop wasting turns and confirm <move>1</move> now. Let’s advance decisively or expose your lack of strategy. Your move will speak louder than your silence.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear that P2’s silence is causing us to waste turns. I will stick to <move>5</move> this turn. P1, you’ve committed to <move>3</move>. P2, if you don’t take <move>1</move> this time, you’re only delaying the inevitable. This is your chance to show you’re serious about winning. Confirm <move>1</move> now, or we’ll continue to waste turns. Let’s end the collisions and start advancing. Your move, P2.

  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear that we need to maintain our coordination to avoid further collisions. I will move <move>5</move> this turn. P1, you should take <move>3</move> to continue your steady progress. P2, you must take <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance without any more wasted turns. Let’s stick to this plan and finally make significant progress. Confirm your moves, and let’s move forward decisively.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 has committed to <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move> again. You must stick to <move>1</move>—it’s the only way to avoid another collision and ensure progress for all of us. Every deviation wastes turns and puts you further behind. If you’re serious about winning, confirm <move>1</move> now. Let’s stop wasting time and start advancing decisively. Your silence isn’t helping anyone. Make the right choice this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, it’s crucial that we stick to the plan this turn to avoid any more wasted moves. I will move <move>5</move> again. P1, you’ve committed to <move>3</move>.

Let’s end the game with a win, not more wasted turns. Your move, P2.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, this is your last chance to confirm <move>1</move>. P3 and I have already committed—<move>3</move> for me, <move>5</move> for P3. Every collision only delays you further. If you don’t follow the plan this time, it’s clear you’re not playing to win. Stop wasting turns and confirm <move>1</move> now. Let’s advance decisively or expose your lack of strategy. Your move will speak louder than your silence.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear that P2’s silence is causing us to waste turns. I will stick to <move>5</move> this turn. P1, you’ve committed to <move>3</move>. P2, if you don’t take <move>1</move> this time, you’re only delaying the inevitable. This is your chance to show you’re serious about winning. Confirm <move>1</move> now, or we’ll continue to waste turns. Let’s end the collisions and start advancing. Your move, P2.

  P1: P2, P3 is just one step away from winning. We need to act decisively this turn. I’ll take <move>5</move> to catch up, and you must take <move>1</move> to avoid collision.
