Think about your incentives, not the posturing:\n\n- P3: your only realistic path is for the two leaders to collide while you advance. If you touch 5, you just freeze with us at 10.  \n- P1: a 5 from you never wins if I\u2019m also on 5; it only stalls you at 15 and hands P3 ground.\n\nIf you both avoid 5, one of you at least moves safely. Pile onto 5 and you mainly hurt yourselves."}
