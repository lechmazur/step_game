If you stick to your plan of playing 3 (reaching 24), and P3 plays 5 (reaching 25), P3 actually wins outright. Are you trying to mislead P3 into playing 1 (letting you tie with me) or playing 3 (risking collision, letting me win)?\n\nP3, P2's path to victory isn't guaranteed if you play optimally based on their claim. But can you trust P2 to play 3? It's the final round, after all. Good luck making the winning choice. I'm locked on 5."}
