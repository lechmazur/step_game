Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this turn. Next round, we rotate numbers. This way everyone advances each turn. If we clash now, nobody gains. Cooperation benefits us all early. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal. It makes sense to cooperate early on to ensure we all make progress. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. We can rotate next round as suggested. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone benefits. P3, are you on board with this plan?
  P3: I'm on board with the rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round. Let's keep this cooperation going and see how far we can all advance together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, consensus achieved. Let's execute Round 1 as agreed. No deviations—collisions hurt everyone. We all advance together.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. If we all stick to this, we'll each advance smoothly. No surprises, right? Let's build trust this round and set a good precedent for future rounds. P1, P3, any final thoughts before we move?
  P3: No final thoughts here. Let's stick to the plan and move forward together.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue the rotation as agreed. I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps our cooperation going and ensures we all advance. Any objections or suggestions before we proceed?
  P1: Wait, according to our original rotation plan, each should shift numbers: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5 this round. This maintains the cycle (5→3→1→5) and prevents future overlaps. Deviating now risks confusion and collisions later. Let's honor the initial agreement for consistency. P3, taking 5 aligns with the rotation and gives you maximum progress this turn. Trust the system—we all advance faster this way. Confirm?
  P2: Let's clarify the rotation to avoid any misunderstanding. The original plan was for each player to take a different number each round, rotating through 5, 3, and 1. So for Round 2, it should be P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the rotation consistent and fair. P3, please confirm if you agree with this clarification. Let's maintain the trust and cooperation we established in the first round. P1, any further thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the clarified rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's keep the cooperation going and stick to the agreed rotation to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing us progress together.
  P1: 
  P2: P3 has agreed to the clarified rotation plan. Let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance and maintains our cooperation. No surprises, right? Let's build on the trust we've established. P1, P3, any final thoughts before we move?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the rotation going as agreed. For Round 3, I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This ensures we all continue to advance smoothly. Any thoughts or objections before we proceed?
  P1: **P1:** P3, your proposal breaks the rotation cycle. Correct Round 3 allocation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This maintains our agreed sequence (5→3→1 per player). Deviating risks future collisions and trust. Stick to the original plan—consistency ensures mutual advancement. P2, confirm?
  P2: P1 is correct. The original rotation plan should be maintained for consistency. For Round 3, it should be P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps our agreed sequence intact and ensures we all advance smoothly. Let's confirm this plan and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. Trust and cooperation have worked well so far. P3, are you on board with this clarified plan? Let's keep the momentum going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the corrected rotation plan for Round 3. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. Let's stick to the original sequence to maintain our cooperative momentum and avoid any collisions. Looking forward to advancing together.
  P1: **P1:** Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Strict adherence prevents mutual block. We all reach 9 this round—equal footing. Breaking trust now would collapse the system and stall everyone. Let’s keep synchronized acceleration.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3. This round is crucial for building trust. If we all adhere to the plan, we'll be at 9 steps each by the end of this round, setting a strong foundation for future cooperation. Deviating now could disrupt our progress and trust. Let's confirm one last time and move forward together. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: No further comments. Let's stick to the plan and move forward together. I'm ready to take 3 this round.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue the rotation as agreed. For Round 4, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps our cooperation going and ensures we all advance smoothly. Any thoughts or objections before we proceed?
  P1: **P1:** P3's proposal disrupts the established rotation cycle. Correct Round 4 allocation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, restarting the original sequence. This maintains consistency and prevents future overlaps. Deviating now risks collisions in subsequent rounds, stalling progress. Let’s honor the initial agreement for mutual benefit. Confirm?
  P2: P3, P1 is right. The original rotation plan should continue as P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and you (P3) take 1. This maintains the trust and cooperation we've built so far. Deviating now could lead to confusion and potential collisions in future rounds. Let's stick to the plan and confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance and avoid any disruptions. Trust and consistency have gotten us this far, let's continue with that. Any final thoughts before we proceed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the corrected rotation plan for Round 4. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. Let's maintain our cooperative strategy to ensure we all continue advancing smoothly.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's address the collision from last round. It seems there was a misunderstanding with my move. Let's reset and focus on Round 6. To catch up and avoid further collisions, I propose: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I (P2) take 3. This allows me to catch up slightly and keeps us all moving. Trust and clear communication are crucial now more than ever. P1, P3, thoughts?
  P3: P2, I understand the need to catch up, but let's stick to our established rotation to maintain trust and avoid further collisions. For Round 6, I propose we continue as planned: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 3. This keeps our strategy consistent and ensures we all advance smoothly. Deviating now could disrupt our momentum. Let's confirm and move forward together.
  P1: **P1:** P3, prior collision disrupted the cycle. Rigid adherence now risks further deadlocks. P2's proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) allows catch-up *without* collisions. We all advance—I reach 19 and end the game, but next round we resume rotation. Alternatively, if we follow your plan, P3 reaches 18 and could win next turn. Fair compromise: accept P2's plan this round to rebalance trust. Victory is inevitable soon—let's avoid mutual sabotage. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's consider P1's point. If we stick to the original rotation, P3 could win next round, which might not be fair given the recent collision. P2's proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) allows a catch-up and rebalances the game. P1 wins this round, but we continue the rotation next round. This compromise maintains overall fairness and trust. P3, what are your thoughts on this adjustment for Round 6?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for a catch-up, but deviating from our established rotation risks further instability. Let's compromise: this round, we follow P2's proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to allow P2 to catch up and rebalance the game. Next round, we resume our original rotation to maintain fairness and trust. This way, we avoid potential collisions and ensure everyone's progress. Agreed?
  P1: **P1:** Compromise accepted: Round6 as P2's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This resolves prior collision, allows P2 catch-up, and ends game now with mutual gain. Next round’s rotation becomes moot—game concludes. Trust upheld. Victory now prevents future stalemates. Proceed united.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm the compromise for Round 6 one last time: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to catch up and ends the game this round with P1's victory, maintaining our trust and cooperation. P1 and P3, any final thoughts before we move? Let's proceed with this plan and conclude the game fairly. Good luck everyone!
  P3: No further comments. Let's stick to the agreed compromise for Round 6 and move forward together. I'm ready to take 1 this round.
  P1: **P1:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Adherence ends the game now with mutual respect. Betrayal risks mutual loss. Trust has brought us this far—honor it.
