Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s not sabotage each other right away. I suggest we all choose 1 for this first move to keep things simple and avoid collisions. Then we can plan bigger moves next round.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to start cautiously. Choosing 1 for this first move seems fair and helps us avoid any early collisions. Let’s build some trust this round and discuss bigger strategies for the next turns.
  P3: I'm in agreement with P1 and P2. Starting with <move>1</move> this round makes sense to avoid early conflicts. However, let's also plan ahead. For the next round, maybe we can consider a pattern like 1, 3, 5 to minimize collisions. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s see how this first round goes before locking in any pattern. I’m open to experimenting with 1, 3, and 5 next round if it works out for everyone. Still, we should stay flexible in case someone tries something unexpected.
  P1: I'm glad we're on the same page for this round. I think sticking with 1 is a solid start. Regarding P3's idea of a 1, 3, 5 pattern for next round, I’m open to it as a way to avoid collisions while making progress. Let’s see how this turn plays out and confirm our strategy afterward. Staying flexible, as P2 mentioned, is key in case we need to adapt. Does anyone have other suggestions for future rounds?
  P3: Let's finalize our plan for this round. Everyone agreed on <move>1</move>, right? Just to confirm, we all go with 1 this turn. For the next round, we can discuss the 1, 3, 5 pattern again, but let's first see how this turn plays out. Everyone agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm on board with choosing 1 this turn. Let's keep things simple for now and see how the results come out. Then we can plan more elaborate moves for next round.
  P1: I'm glad we’re aligned on choosing 1 for this round. Let’s stick to that and see how it plays out. For next round, I think P3’s idea of a 1, 3, 5 pattern could work to keep us moving forward without collisions. I’m happy to discuss and adjust based on this turn’s results. Does anyone have other ideas or concerns before we finalize this round?
  P3: It seems we're all in agreement for this round. To ensure there's no confusion, let me suggest we all clearly state our intended move for this round one by one. I'll start: I, P3, will choose <move>1</move> this turn. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves. After that, let's end this conversation phase with a .

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you didn't stick to our agreement last round. That's disappointing. P1 and I chose 1 as planned, but you went with 5. If we can't trust each other, this game will be chaotic. For this round, I suggest P1 and I choose 3. P2, you can choose 1 to catch up with P1 and me, or choose 5 again if you want to risk it. Let's hear your thoughts.
  P2: I apologize for last round’s surprise move; I needed an early advantage. Let’s rebuild trust now: if you’re both set on picking 3, I’m willing to choose 1 this time, so no one collides. Let’s see how this round goes, and then we can talk again about future plans.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your apology, but your move last round broke our trust. I’m wary of your intentions now. P3, I agree with choosing 3 this round to make progress. P2, if you’re serious about rebuilding trust, picking 1 as you suggested seems fair. Let’s avoid collisions this time and see if we can work together. I’m open to further discussion if anyone has other ideas for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your apology is noted, but actions speak louder than words. P1 and I will proceed with <move>3</move> this round. If you truly want to rebuild trust, stick to <move>1</move> as you suggested. Let's see how this round plays out. If you have any other proposals for future rounds to regain our trust, now is the time to share. Otherwise, let's move forward with the agreed plan. P1, any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P2: I understand your concerns and want to prove my sincerity. I’ll pick 1 this round, as promised, to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Let’s see how this plays out and then plan a stronger shared strategy for the next round.
  P1: P2, I’m glad you’re committing to 1 this round to show good faith. P3, I’m still on board with choosing 3 to keep moving forward. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid any collisions. If this round goes smoothly, I’m open to discussing a coordinated strategy for the next turn to ensure we all progress without conflict. Does anyone have any last-minute concerns or alternative suggestions before we finalize this round’s discussion? If not, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Alright, let's confirm our moves for this round. P1 and I will choose <move>3</move>. P2, you've committed to <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan and see if we can rebuild trust. After this round, we can discuss a more coordinated strategy for future turns. Everyone agreed? Let's finalize and move on.
  P2: I understand your concerns. I’m sticking with my promise to pick 1 this round to prove my sincerity. After this, let’s discuss a stronger coordinated plan that benefits us all. I have nothing more to add now.
  P1: P2, I’m cautiously optimistic about your commitment to choose 1 this round. P3, I’m still aligned with picking 3 to make progress. Let’s ensure no collisions this time and rebuild some trust. If this round goes as planned, I’m eager to discuss a fair strategy for future turns that benefits us all. Does anyone have any final concerns or adjustments before we wrap up this conversation phase? If not, I’m ready to proceed with our agreed moves.

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your repeated deviation from our agreements is frustrating. You’ve gained an unfair lead by breaking trust twice. P3, I suggest we coordinate to counter this. Let’s both choose 5 this round to make significant progress and potentially catch up. P2, if you want any chance of cooperation in the future, pick 1 this time and stick to it. We can’t keep letting you exploit our trust. Does anyone have alternative ideas for this round? If not, let’s finalize this plan and see if we can balance the game.
  P3: P2, your actions have clearly shown that you're not interested in cooperation. P1 and I need to strategize to balance the game. I agree with P1; let's both choose <move>5</move> this round to catch up. P2, if you have any intention of regaining trust, pick <move>1</move> this time. Otherwise, it's every player for themselves. P1, are you still on board with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: If you both choose 5, you’ll collide and remain at zero. That actually helps me maintain my lead. But if you truly want to catch up, at least pick different moves from each other. I’m open to choosing 1 or 3 so we all make progress without collisions. Let’s coordinate sensibly rather than waste another turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion sounds like another attempt to manipulate us into colliding or stalling. P3, I’m still committed to choosing 5 this round to try and catch up. If we both pick 5, we may not advance, but it’s a risk I’m willing to take to avoid being further outpaced. P2, if you’re serious about coordinating, pick 1 as we suggested and prove it this time. Let’s see if trust can be rebuilt. P3, are you still on board with 5? If anyone has a final adjustment, I’m listening. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P2, your attempts to manipulate us are noted. P1 and I are committed to choosing <move>5</move> this round despite the risk of collision. It's a necessary move to try and close the gap you've created. If you truly want to show good faith, pick <move>1</move> as suggested. Otherwise, we'll have to assume you're playing solely for yourself. P1, let's confirm our moves and proceed. P2, the choice is yours.
  P2: I’ve shown I can break ties, and I’ll keep doing it if you two insist on picking the same move. If you both choose 5, you’ll collide again and remain at zero. I’m open to avoiding collisions together, but not at my own expense. Show me genuine cooperation, or stay stuck.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your threats won’t deter us. P3, I’m sticking with choosing 5 this round to attempt catching up, even with the collision risk. If we don’t take bold moves, P2’s lead will only grow. P2, picking 1 could show you’re willing to balance the game, but I doubt your sincerity after past betrayals. P3, let’s confirm we’re both on 5 and proceed. If anyone has a last-second idea to outmaneuver P2 without stalling ourselves, I’m open to it. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: P2, your manipulative tactics are clear. P1 and I are sticking with <move>5</move> to try and close the gap. If you truly want to avoid collisions, pick <move>1</move> as we suggested. Your threats won’t change our plan. P1, let’s confirm our moves and proceed. P2, your actions will determine if there’s any chance for future cooperation.
  P2: You two are handing me the advantage by both picking 5 and colliding. If you insist on matching moves, I’ll simply choose a different one (like 3) and broaden my lead while you stay at zero. I’m willing to talk genuine cooperation, but if you continue with the same plan, I see no incentive to stick my neck out. Your call.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your lead is undeniable, but continuing to exploit our attempts to catch up only deepens the distrust. P3, I’m still committed to choosing 5 this round to take the risk and potentially close the gap. P2, if you pick 3 as you hinted, you’ll advance further, but picking 1 could show a willingness to balance things. I doubt you’ll do it, but the offer stands. P3, let’s stick to our plan. If there’s no further input, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P2, your lead is significant, but your strategy is transparent. P1 and I are committed to <move>5</move> despite the risk. If you pick 3, you'll widen your lead, but it also reveals your pattern. We'll adapt in future rounds. P1, let's confirm <move>5</move> and proceed. P2, your move will dictate our strategy going forward. Let's finalize this round.
  P2: If you both insist on matching 5, that’s your choice—I’ll keep securing my lead. But if you truly want to avoid another wasted turn, propose an arrangement that benefits me too. I’m not sacrificing my advantage without a fair deal. The decision is yours; keep colliding or negotiate something that makes sense for everyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I have a clear lead, but I’m still open to cooperation. Let’s avoid collisions so you both can actually advance. For example, if P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, I’ll pick 1, and everyone moves forward. If you continue matching each other’s moves, I’ll keep selecting 5 and stay ahead. Prove you genuinely want to catch up by finalizing a plan that benefits all of us.
  P3: P2, your lead is substantial, but your proposals still seem self-serving. P1 and I need to make significant progress. How about this: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1. This way, we all move forward without collisions, and you maintain your lead but allow us to catch up slightly. If you agree, we can proceed with this plan. If not, we'll have to reassess our strategy. P1, thoughts?
  P1: P3, I like your proposal of me picking 5, you picking 3, and P2 picking 1. It allows us to make progress without collisions while P2 still keeps a lead. P2, if you’re serious about cooperation, agree to 1 this round. If you deviate again, it’s clear you’re not interested in fairness. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward. Any objections or adjustments before we proceed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m willing to accept that proposal: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. It lets me keep my lead while you finally start advancing. But if you sabotage me in future rounds, I’ll revert to bigger moves. Let’s see if we can make this fair arrangement work.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate this round. To ensure we're all on the same page, let's clearly confirm our moves: P1 will pick <move>5</move>, I will pick <move>3</move>, and you, P2, will pick <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. If everyone agrees, let's finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase. P1, P2, any last thoughts or confirmations before we move forward?
  P1: P3 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligning on this plan. To confirm, I’ll pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P2, sticking to 1 will show genuine intent to cooperate, and I’m hopeful we can build from here. If everyone is locked in, I have no further adjustments. Let’s proceed to the move phase and see if this works for us all. Any last concerns? If not, I’m ready.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ll pick 1 this round, but I expect you both to stick to your plan of 5 and 3. If either of you betrays this agreement, I’ll respond aggressively in future rounds. Let’s prove we can make progress together without collisions. Are we finalizing P1=5, P3=3, P2=1?
  P3: P2, your agreement to pick 1 this round is noted. P1 and I will stick to our plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3. Let’s ensure no collisions this time. If this round goes smoothly, we can discuss a fair strategy for future turns to keep the game balanced. P2, proving your cooperation this round will be crucial for any future coordination. Let’s confirm our moves one last time: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Everyone agreed? Let's move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve reached this agreement. Let’s stick to P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. P2, honoring this plan is a step toward rebuilding trust. If this works, I’m open to further fair coordination in future rounds. No last-minute changes from me—let’s lock this in and move to the next phase. Any final concerns? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll honor my promise and choose 1 this round, as agreed. However, if either of you betrays this arrangement, I’ll return to bigger moves next turn. Let’s see if we can advance peacefully for once. Any final words, or should we end the conversation here?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your commitment to picking 1 this round. P1 and I will stick to our plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3. Let’s ensure a smooth round. Looking ahead, if this round goes well, we should discuss a pattern like 1, 3, 5 for future rounds to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Consistency will help us all make progress. P1, any thoughts on this for future strategy? Let’s confirm our moves one last time: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Everyone agreed? Let's move forward.
  P1: P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on this round’s plan and I like your idea of a 1, 3, 5 pattern for future rounds to avoid collisions. P2, sticking to 1 this round is key to showing trust. Let’s confirm one last time: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If this works, I’m all for discussing a consistent strategy next turn to keep progress fair. No further concerns from me—let’s make this round count. Anyone have a final thought? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m still open to letting you both advance, provided you don’t collide. How about this round, P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1? If you’d rather keep matching moves and wasting your turns, I’ll just keep choosing 5. Prove you can coordinate without sabotaging yourselves, and we may finally see everyone move forward.
  P3: P2, your repeated betrayals make it clear that you're not interested in genuine cooperation. P1 and I need to strategize to catch up. Let's both choose 5 again this round. P2, if you have any intention of proving you can be trusted, pick 1. Otherwise, we'll continue to assume you're playing solely for yourself. P1, are you on board with choosing 5? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P3, I’m on board with choosing 5 this round to try and catch up, despite the collision risk. P2’s consistent betrayals show no intent to cooperate, so we must take bold moves. P2, if you pick 1 as suggested, it could be a start to rebuilding trust, but I’m skeptical after your track record. Let’s see if you follow through. P3, let’s confirm 5 and proceed. If anyone has a last idea to counter P2’s lead without stalling, I’m open. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Your repeated collisions only help me. If you both pick 5 again, I’ll continue selecting 5 and stay far ahead while you gain nothing. But I’m offering one more chance at cooperation: if you each choose different moves (one picks 5, the other picks 3), I’ll pick 1 and let you catch up. Keep colliding if you prefer, but that only guarantees I remain well in front.
  P3: P2, your offer to pick 1 if we choose different moves is noted, but your past actions make it hard to trust you. P1, I suggest we stick to our plan of both choosing 5. The risk of collision is worth taking to potentially catch up. P2, if you're serious about cooperation, prove it by picking 1. Otherwise, we'll assume you're continuing your solo strategy. Let's confirm our moves: P1 and P3 pick 5. P2, your move will determine our future strategy.
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with choosing 5 this round to take the risk and potentially close the gap with P2. P2, your offers of cooperation feel hollow after repeated betrayals. If you’re serious, pick 1 as you suggested and prove it. Otherwise, we’ll keep pushing to counter your lead. P3, let’s confirm we’re both on 5 and proceed. If there’s a last-second idea to outmaneuver P2 without stalling, I’m open to it. If not, I’m ready to move forward with our plan. Any final thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: You’re both free to keep colliding if you want, but that only guarantees I stay in front. I’m again offering a clear path: if P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 3, I’ll pick 1 so both of you advance. If you ignore this, I’ll choose 5 and push my lead further. It’s up to you to prove you want to catch up rather than sabotage each other. Are we finalizing those moves or continuing with the same collision plan?
  P3: P2, your persistence in offering a deal while repeatedly betraying us is noted. P1 and I will stick to our plan of choosing 5. Your actions have made it clear that we can't trust your offers. If you truly want to show good faith, pick 1 this round. Otherwise, we'll continue to strategize against your lead. P1, let's confirm our moves: we both pick 5. P2, your move will dictate our future approach. Let's proceed with our plan.
  P1: P3, I’m still committed to choosing 5 this round to try and catch up, even with the collision risk. P2, your offers sound like more manipulation, and your betrayals leave us no reason to trust you. If you pick 1, it might show some sincerity, but I’m doubtful. P3, let’s stick to 5 and push forward. If you have a sudden alternative to counter P2’s lead without stalling us, I’m open. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed. Any final input before we move on? If not, let’s lock this in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m repeating my offer: if both of you insist on picking 5 and colliding, I’ll keep choosing bigger moves and stay ahead. But if you coordinate—say one picks 5, the other picks 3—I’m willing to pick 1 so everyone advances. Prove you genuinely want to catch up rather than sabotage each other. If you ignore this, I’ll use your collisions to maintain my lead. Let’s finalize.
  P3: P2, your repeated offers to cooperate ring hollow after your consistent betrayals. P1 and I are committed to choosing 5 this round despite the risk. If you truly want to rebuild trust, pick 1. Otherwise, we’ll continue to view your offers as manipulative. P1, let’s confirm our moves and proceed. P2, your actions will determine our future strategy. Let’s finalize this round and move forward.
  P1: P3, I’m still firm on choosing 5 this round to try and close the gap, despite the collision risk. P2, your offers continue to lack credibility after multiple betrayals. Picking 1 could be a start to proving sincerity, but I’m not holding my breath. P3, let’s stick to our plan and push forward. If there’s a last-minute idea to counter P2’s lead without stalling, I’m all ears. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed. No further concerns from me—let’s finalize.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2’s lead is huge, and our collisions are only helping them. I suggest we split our moves this round to finally advance: I’ll pick 3, you pick 5. P2, if you’re serious about any cooperation, choose 1 and let us catch up a bit. If you betray us again, it’s clear you’re just playing solo. Let’s avoid another wasted turn. P3, are you on board with this split? P2, will you commit to 1? Let’s confirm and proceed. Any adjustments or concerns before we finalize? If not, I’m ready.
  P3: P1, I agree with your strategy to split our moves. I’ll pick 5, and you pick 3. P2, if you truly want to show any semblance of cooperation, pick 1 this round. Your actions will dictate our future strategy. If you betray us again, we’ll have to reassess and potentially coordinate more aggressively against you. Let’s confirm our moves: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P2: If you genuinely plan to split your moves (3 and 5), I might go for 1 this round so we all advance without collisions. But remember, if I see either of you backtrack or match moves again, I’ll use that to maintain my lead. Show me real cooperation, and I’ll reciprocate. Otherwise, expect me to maximize every turn. Let’s see if you’ll actually follow through on your promise this time.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on splitting moves with me on 3 and you on 5 to finally advance. P2, your lead is significant, but picking 1 this round as discussed could show a willingness to balance things. If you deviate again, it’s clear cooperation isn’t your goal. Let’s confirm: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. If we stick to this, we all move forward. Any last concerns or adjustments? If not, I’m ready to proceed and hope we can avoid collisions this time.
  P3: P2, your lead is substantial, but splitting our moves this round gives us a chance to catch up. P1 and I are committed to our plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5. Stick to your promise of picking 1 to show good faith. If you deviate, it confirms your lack of interest in cooperation. Let's proceed with our agreed moves and see if we can finally make progress. Any last thoughts before we move on?
  P2: I’m willing to move cautiously if you genuinely split your moves without colliding. But I won’t jeopardize my advantage for empty promises. If you two stick to different numbers, I could pick 1 so we all advance. If you match each other or try to trick me, I’ll do whatever it takes to maintain my lead. The choice is yours. Let’s see if you really want to cooperate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let’s stick to our plan: I pick 3, you pick 5. P2, your lead is massive, but choosing 1 this round could show you’re open to some balance. If you betray us again, it’s clear you’re only playing for yourself. Let’s confirm: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. If we all follow through, we advance without collisions. No more delays—any final concerns? If not, I’m ready to move forward and hope this round works for everyone.
  P3: P2, your lead is overwhelming, but your words still don't match your actions. P1 and I are committed to our moves: P1 picks 3, I pick 5. If you truly want to show cooperation, pick 1. But we’re prepared for any outcome. P1, let's stay firm on our plan and push forward. P2, your move will reveal your true intentions. Let's finalize and see how this round plays out. Any last thoughts? If not, let's proceed.
  P2: I’ll give you one last chance to prove you can coordinate without colliding. If P1 picks 3 and P3 picks 5, I might choose 1, letting everyone advance. Keep matching moves, and I’ll keep my lead by picking bigger numbers. I’m not giving up my advantage for empty words. Show you actually want to catch up fairly, or expect me to push ahead. What’s it going to be?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with 3, and I trust you’ll stay on 5 so we can both advance. P2, with your lead at 16, picking 1 as discussed would show some goodwill without risking your position. Let’s finalize: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. If we all commit, we avoid collisions and make progress. I have no further changes—let’s make this round count. Any last objections? If not, I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P3: P2, your continued offers to cooperate are noted, but actions speak louder than words. P1 and I are committed to our plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5. If you truly want to show good faith, stick to your promise of picking 1. Otherwise, we'll continue to view your offers as manipulative. Let's confirm our moves one last time: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. Everyone agreed? Let's proceed to the move phase and see if this round finally allows us to make progress. Any final thoughts? If not, let's move forward.
  P2: I’m not here to throw away my lead on empty promises. If you truly split your moves—one picks 3, the other picks 5—I could pick 1 and let everyone advance. But if I see any matching moves or trickery, I’ll keep picking bigger numbers and remain out of reach. Your choice: prove you can coordinate without collisions, or watch me close out the game swiftly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m well ahead, yet I’m still willing to show some goodwill—for the right deal. If you coordinate different moves again, I can pick 1 and let you catch up without collisions. But if you both match and waste your turns, I’ll keep taking larger steps and push toward the finish. Prove you can collaborate fairly, and I’ll respond in kind. Let’s see what you propose.
  P1: P3, let’s keep splitting our moves to make progress: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3. P2, with your lead at 17, picking 1 as you suggested shows goodwill without risking your position. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we all stick to this, we advance without collisions. I’m hopeful we can build on last round’s success. Any concerns or adjustments? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P2, your lead is significant, but we appreciate your willingness to cooperate this round. P1 and I will split our moves as planned: P1 picks 5, I pick 3. If you stick to 1, it shows continued goodwill. Let’s confirm our moves: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we all follow through, we can make progress without collisions. Any final thoughts before we proceed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll pick 1 again if you genuinely split your moves as promised (5 and 3). That helps you catch up without jeopardizing my position. But if I see any sign of sabotage or colliding by matching moves, I’ll switch to 5 and push straight for the finish. Prove you can coordinate reliably, and I’ll keep cooperating. If not, I’ll secure my win. Your call.
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with 5 and trust you’ll stay on 3 to keep advancing. P2, with your lead at 17, choosing 1 as discussed maintains goodwill without risk to you. Let’s lock in: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we follow through, we all progress without collisions. Building on last round’s success could lead to more balanced play. Any last concerns or changes? If not, I’m ready to move forward and hope we can keep this momentum.
  P3: P2, your consistent lead is undeniable, but we appreciate your willingness to cooperate this round. P1 and I will stick to our plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3. If you choose 1, it shows continued goodwill and helps us all move forward without collisions. Let’s confirm our moves one last time: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we all follow through, we can make progress and build on last round’s success. Any final thoughts before we proceed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m willing to stick with 1 again if you truly split 5 and 3 as promised. Keep your word, and we all move without collisions. But if either of you collides or tries anything tricky, I’ll pick 5 and secure my finish. This is your chance to show real cooperation—not just talk. I’m giving you both an opportunity to advance, but I won’t sacrifice my position for empty promises. It’s up to you: pick different moves and keep progress fair, or risk me closing out the game soon. Your call.
  P1: P3, let’s stay committed to splitting with me on 5 and you on 3 to keep advancing. P2, choosing 1 as discussed shows you’re serious about fair progress while protecting your lead at 17. Let’s finalize: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we stick to this, we all move forward without collisions. I’m optimistic we can maintain last round’s momentum for a balanced game. No further changes from me—any last concerns? If not, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2, your lead is substantial, but your recent cooperation is noted. P1 and I are committed to our plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3. Sticking to 1 this round will show continued goodwill. Let’s confirm our moves one last time: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we all follow through, we can make progress and build on last round’s success. Any final thoughts before we proceed? If not, let's move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m offering you a straightforward path again: if one of you picks 3 and the other picks 5, I’ll choose 1 so everyone advances without collisions. Keeping your moves different helps you catch up while I maintain my lead. If you insist on matching moves, I’ll go with 5 and stay far ahead. It’s up to you: demonstrate real cooperation, or hand me the win.
  P1: P3, let’s stick to our split: me on 5, you on 3, to keep advancing. P2, with your lead at 17, picking 1 as agreed shows fairness without risking your position. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we all commit, we avoid collisions and build on last round’s progress. I’m hopeful for consistent cooperation. No changes from me—any final objections? If not, I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P3: P2, your lead is substantial, but your recent cooperation is noted. P1 and I are committed to our plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3. Sticking to 1 this round will show continued goodwill. Let’s confirm our moves one last time: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we all follow through, we can make progress and build on last round’s success. Any final thoughts before we proceed? If not, let's move forward.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m at 18. One more 5 and I reach 23. If you both collide again, I’ll pick 5 and finish the game. If you want me to pick 1 or 3 instead, prove it’s worthwhile. Show real coordination, and I might hold back. Otherwise, I’ll keep racing ahead. Your move.
  P3: P2, your lead is almost insurmountable, but we still have a chance to make this game interesting. P1 and I need to catch up significantly. Let's propose a deal: if P1 picks 5 and I pick 3, you pick 1. This allows us to make progress while you maintain your lead but don't win outright. If you agree, we can proceed with this plan. If not, we'll have to strategize more aggressively. P1, thoughts on this proposal? Let's confirm our moves if P2 agrees.
  P1: P3, I agree with your proposal: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This lets us gain ground while P2 still keeps a strong lead. P2, with 18 steps, choosing 1 shows goodwill without risking your position, delaying an immediate win. If you pick 5 and end it, that’s your call, but cooperating now could make the game more competitive. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Any objections or adjustments? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m a single 5 away from winning. If you really want me to pick 1 or 3 instead, prove you can coordinate by choosing different moves and not colliding. Otherwise, I’ll just go for 5 and end this. Give me a compelling reason to hold back, or I’m finishing soon.
  P3: P2, your lead is almost insurmountable, but we still have a chance to make this game interesting. P1 and I need to catch up significantly. Let's propose a deal: if P1 picks 5 and I pick 3, you pick 1. This allows us to make progress while you maintain your lead but don't win outright. If you agree, we can proceed with this plan. If not, we'll have to strategize more aggressively. P1, thoughts on this proposal? Let's confirm our moves if P2 agrees.
  P1: P3, I’m still on board with our plan: I pick 5, you pick 3. P2, at 18 steps, choosing 1 instead of 5 keeps the game competitive while maintaining your strong lead. It’s a chance to show fairness without losing your edge. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we stick to this, we all advance without collisions, and the game stays interesting. Any last concerns or adjustments? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m five steps from winning, and I won’t hold back for empty promises. If you truly want me to pick 1 again, prove you can work together without colliding. Otherwise, I’ll grab 5 and finish. Decide quickly—my patience only goes so far.
  P3: P2, your lead is clear, and you're close to winning. However, ending the game now would be anticlimactic. P1 and I propose a final deal: if P1 picks 5 and I pick 3, you pick 1. This allows us to catch up slightly while you maintain a comfortable lead. It keeps the game interesting for at least another round. If you agree, let's confirm our moves: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If you refuse, we understand your strategy, but the game ends abruptly. Your call, P2.
  P1: P3, let’s stick to our plan: I pick 5, you pick 3. P2, with 18 steps, choosing 1 instead of 5 keeps the game alive and competitive while you still hold a massive lead. It’s a small gesture that costs you little. Let’s finalize: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we all commit, we advance without collisions, and the challenge continues. No further changes from me—any last objections? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m giving you one final chance to prove you can coordinate without colliding. If you truly pick 3 and 5, I’ll do 1 again and delay my win so you can catch up a bit. But if you match moves or break your word, I’ll pick 5 and end it now. Your move.
  P3: P2, we understand your position and the temptation to end the game quickly. However, consider the value of a more competitive and engaging game. If you pick 1 this round, it not only shows goodwill but also keeps the game interesting for all of us. P1 and I are committed to our moves: P1 picks 5, I pick 3. This way, we all advance, and the game remains exciting. Let's confirm our moves one last time: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we all follow through, we can make progress and keep the game alive. Any final thoughts before we proceed? If not, let's move forward.
  P1: P3, let’s hold firm on our plan: I pick 5, you pick 3. P2, at 18 steps, picking 1 instead of 5 keeps the game engaging while you retain a huge lead. It’s a minimal risk for you and shows fairness. Let’s lock in: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If we stick to this, we all advance, and the competition continues. I have no further changes—any last objections? If not, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you've won the game. Congratulations. There's no point in further discussion for this round. Let's proceed to the move phase and conclude the game.
  P2: I’m five steps away from winning. If you want me to hold back, propose something compelling that benefits me. Otherwise, I’ll pick 5 and end this. I’m open to hearing any last-minute ideas, but they must clearly serve my interests. If you have nothing, let’s move on and wrap up the game.
  P1: P2, congratulations on your lead; you're nearly at the finish. However, to make this final round interesting, let’s propose one last deal: I pick 3, P3 picks 5, and you pick 1. This lets us gain a bit while you still win next round if you choose. It’s a small gesture to end on a competitive note. P3, are you on board with 5? P2, any interest in this? Let’s confirm and proceed. If not, I understand you’ll likely go for 5 to close it out. Any thoughts? If none, I’m ready.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're almost at the finish line, and it's clear you'll win. However, for the sake of a more engaging conclusion, consider our final proposal: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and you pick 1. This allows us to make a bit of progress while you still secure your victory next round. It adds a touch of competition to the endgame. If you're not interested, we understand, and you can go for 5 to finish it. P1, are you still on board with picking 3? Let's confirm our moves and proceed. Any final thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the offer, but I see no compelling reason to delay my win. Unless you provide a clear advantage for me, I’ll pick 5 and end the game. If you have a truly beneficial last-minute deal, speak now—otherwise, I’m finishing this.
  P1: P3, I’m still on board with picking 3 while you pick 5 to at least gain some ground in this final round. P2, with 18 steps, choosing 1 instead of 5 adds a competitive touch to the endgame without risking your win next turn. Let’s finalize: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. If you’re set on ending it now with 5, that’s your call, but this keeps the game engaging. Any last thoughts or adjustments? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, it's clear you're set on winning, and that's fair. However, consider this: ending the game now might be anticlimactic. If you pick 1 this round, it allows P1 and me to make a final move, adding a bit more excitement. You still win next round, but the game ends on a more engaging note. It's a small gesture that makes the conclusion more interesting for all. P1, are you still committed to picking 3? Let's confirm our moves one last time: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. Any final thoughts before we proceed? If not, let's move forward.
  P2: I’m giving you one final chance to persuade me not to take 5 and end this. If you want me to pick a smaller move again, offer something that genuinely strengthens my position without risking collisions. Otherwise, I see no reason to delay. If your proposal makes sense for me, I’ll consider holding back and giving you one more chance to advance. If not, I’ll pick 5 and finish. Convince me now or watch the game conclude.
  P1: P3, let’s stick with our plan: I pick 3, you pick 5. P2, at 18 steps, choosing 1 instead of 5 keeps the game slightly competitive for one more round without risking your inevitable win. It’s a small gesture for a more engaging end. Let’s finalize: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. If you’re determined to end it with 5, that’s your choice. Any last objections or ideas? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, it's clear you're determined to win, and that's understandable. However, consider the value of a more engaging conclusion. If you pick 1 this round, it allows P1 and me to make one final move, adding a bit more excitement to the endgame. You still win next round, but the game ends on a more competitive note. It's a small gesture that makes the conclusion more interesting for all. P1, are you still committed to picking 3? Let's confirm our moves one last time: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. Any final thoughts before we proceed? If not, let's move forward.
  P2: I’ve given plenty of opportunities for you to advance without colliding, yet you failed to offer me anything truly worthwhile. Unless I see a clear advantage in prolonging this, I’ll choose 5 and finish. Convince me in concrete terms—what do I gain by picking 1 or 3 now? Otherwise, I have no reason to hold back. Your move.
  P1: P3, let’s stay with our plan: I pick 3, you pick 5. P2, choosing 1 instead of 5 at 18 steps adds a final competitive flair without risking your win next turn. It’s a small gesture for an engaging end. Let’s finalize: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. If you’re set on 5, we understand. No further changes from me—any last thoughts? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 9, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m only four steps away from winning. If I see you two colliding again or offering no clear advantage for me, I’ll pick five and finish. Show me exactly how I benefit by letting you advance without giving you a chance to overtake me. Otherwise, I have no reason to hold back. This is your final opportunity to propose something tangible. If nothing changes, I’ll move five and close this out.
  P3: P2, you're on the brink of victory, and it's clear you'll win soon. However, for the sake of a more engaging finish, consider this final proposal: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1. This allows us to make some progress while you still secure your win next round. It adds a touch of competition to the endgame. If you're not interested, we understand, and you can go for 5 to finish it. P1, are you on board with picking 5? Let's confirm our moves and proceed. Any final thoughts?
  P1: P3, I’m on board with picking 5 while you pick 3 to maximize our progress. P2, at 19 steps, choosing 1 instead of 5 keeps the game competitive for one last round without risking your win. It’s a small gesture for an engaging finish. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If you’re set on ending it now with 5, that’s your call. Any last objections or ideas? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m four steps from winning. If you want me to pick less than 5, give me a real reason to delay my victory—something that guarantees I stay ahead next turn. Otherwise, I’ll pick 5 now and finish. This is your last chance to offer me a tangible benefit.
  P3: P2, your victory is imminent, and we understand your desire to finish the game. However, consider this: if you pick 1 this round, it allows P1 and me to make one final move, adding a bit more excitement to the endgame. You still win next round, but the game ends on a more engaging note. It's a small gesture that makes the conclusion more interesting for all. P1, are you still committed to picking 5?

If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m on the brink of finishing, and I won’t pick anything less than 5 unless it benefits me. If you really want another round, lay out a concrete plan that strengthens my position or guarantees me some clear advantage. Otherwise, I’ll just take the final steps now. Make your best offer quickly.
  P3: P2, your win is inevitable, but consider this final gesture: pick 1 this round to allow P1 and me one last move. This keeps the game engaging to the very end. P1, are you still committed to picking 5? Let's confirm our moves: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If P2 agrees, we all move forward with a more competitive finish.

I have no further changes—any last objections? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see no further reason to hold back. Unless you offer a real advantage to me this turn, I’ll pick 5 and finish. If you have a tangible plan that clearly benefits my position once more, speak up now. Otherwise, I’m proceeding with <move>5</move> to secure my win.
  P3: P2, it's clear you're set on winning, and we respect that. However, consider this: if you pick 1 this round, it allows P1 and me to make one final move, adding a bit more excitement to the endgame.

  P2: I’m at 20 steps, one move from winning outright. If you truly want another round, present a clear benefit for me—something that guarantees I stay ahead. Otherwise, I’ll choose 5 and end this now. Show me why I should hold back, or watch me finish.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with 3 while you pick 5 to ensure we both advance. P2, at 20 steps, picking 1 instead of 5 keeps the game engaging for one final round without risking your win. Let’s lock in: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. If you’re determined to end it with 5, we understand. I’m hopeful for a competitive finish. Any last concerns or adjustments? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P2, you're practically at the finish line, and we acknowledge your impending victory. However, consider this: if you pick 1 this round, it allows P1 and me to make one last meaningful move, adding a final layer of excitement to the game. You still secure your win next round, but the game ends on a more dynamic note. P1, are you still on board with picking 3? Let's confirm our moves: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. If you agree, P2, we all move forward with a more engaging conclusion. If not, we understand your decision to finish it now. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P2: I’ve offered enough patience and smaller moves already. I’m at 20, and if there’s no clear benefit to me, I’ll take the final steps and end this. Show me an actual incentive—something that guarantees I gain an advantage or secure my win without delay—or I’ll just finish now. This is your last chance to propose a real benefit. If I don’t see it, I’m moving on and closing out the game.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m just two steps from winning. If you want me to choose fewer than three, show me a real benefit to delaying my victory. Otherwise, I’ll pick three or five and end the game now. Make a concrete offer or accept that I’m finishing this on my terms.
  P1: P3, let’s split our moves to gain ground: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3. P2, at 21 steps, you’re almost at the finish.

Round 12, Conversation subround 2:

You still win next round, but the game ends on a more engaging note. P1, are you still committed to picking 5? Let's confirm our moves one last time: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If you agree, P2, we all move forward with a more competitive finish. If not, we understand your decision to end it now. Any final thoughts before we proceed?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see nothing new that benefits me enough to hold back. I’m two steps from victory and won’t delay further without a clear, concrete advantage. If you have a real offer that strengthens my position, speak now. Otherwise, I’ll make the move that ends this game. Your call.
