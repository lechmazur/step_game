Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together and choose different numbers each turn to ensure everyone advances smoothly. This way, we can all reach our goals without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: I’m open to that idea. Let’s all pick different moves so we avoid blocking each other. For this round, how about P1 chooses 5, I’ll choose 1, and P3 takes 3. Then maybe we can rotate next time. What do you say?
  P1: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions. For this round, I’ll take 5 as suggested, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s stick to this rotation for now to ensure smooth progress. If anyone has concerns, speak up now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the proposed move assignments and the rotation strategy. Let's proceed with P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and me choosing 3 this round. Looking forward to smooth progress for all of us. If anyone wants to discuss any changes in future rounds, feel free to bring it up.
  P2: I’m all set with our plan for this round. Let’s lock it in and give it a try. If nobody needs further discussion, we can move on.
  P1: Since we’ve agreed on the rotation for this round, let’s stick to it and see how it plays out. If this works well, we can continue coordinating in future rounds. However, if anyone feels the need to adjust the strategy later, we should discuss it openly. For now, let’s proceed as planned.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s continue the rotation this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps progress steady. If this works, we can rotate again next round. Any objections or adjustments?
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. Let's proceed with this plan and adjust as needed in future rounds.
  P2: I’m okay with continuing the rotation as proposed. However, since I’m a bit behind, I’d like to pick 5 soon. Let’s see how this round goes and then consider whether we need small adjustments next round.

  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: For this round, let’s adjust the rotation to P1: 1, P2: 3, and me: 5. This way, I can safely advance without collisions, and we continue making steady progress. Does everyone agree with this change?
  P2: I’m open to rotating, but because I’m behind, I’d prefer to pick 5 now so I can catch up. Perhaps we can do P1: 1, me (P2): 5, and P3: 3 this round. That way, there won’t be any overlapping moves, ensuring none of us get blocked. Let me know if you agree or have another idea.
  P1: I agree with P2’s suggestion: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. This ensures no collisions and helps P2 catch up. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next round based on progress. Any objections?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2's plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3 this round. Let’s proceed as agreed to ensure smooth progress for all of us. If we need to adjust in future rounds, we can discuss it then. Let’s move forward!
  P2: I’m glad we all agree on the current plan for no collisions. I’m aiming to close the gap, so I appreciate the opportunity to pick 5. After this round, I’d like to explore another rotation that still gives me chances to use 5 without blocking others. Let me know what you think or if you have a different idea.
  P1: I agree with the current plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and helps P2 catch up. After this round, we should reassess the rotation to keep progress balanced. P2, if you need more opportunities to pick 5, we can adjust accordingly. Let’s stay flexible and avoid blocking each other.

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s continue the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This keeps us collision-free and helps balance progress. P2, you’ll have another chance to pick 5 soon. Let’s stick to this plan for now and reassess next round if needed. Any objections?
  P2: I’m willing to follow your suggestion for now, where P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. However, I need to pick 5 next round so I don’t fall too far behind. Are we all good with giving me a shot at 5 next time?
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 this round. This plan ensures no collisions and maintains steady progress for all of us. Let's proceed as agreed and reassess in the next round if needed. Looking forward to our continued cooperation!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with the current rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. P2, I understand your need to pick 5 next round, and we can adjust accordingly. Let’s stick to this plan for now to avoid collisions and reassess next round based on progress. Cooperation is key to ensuring we all advance smoothly.
  P2: I agree to stick with the current plan this round. Next time, though, I’d appreciate another shot at 5, since I’m still behind. We should stay flexible and watch everyone’s totals—if someone gets too far ahead, maybe we need to adjust our picks. Let’s keep cooperating for now.
  P3: Agreed, P2. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, you taking 1, and me taking 3 this round to avoid collisions. We'll reassess our rotation in the next round based on our progress. Looking forward to steady advancement for all of us.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. P2, I’ll support your request to pick 5 next round to help you catch up. Let’s maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. If anyone feels the need to adjust after this round, we can discuss it openly.
  P2: I'm fine continuing with P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3 this round. Next time, I’d like that 5 spot so I can stay competitive. P3 is pulling ahead slightly, so we might need to keep an eye on them. But for now, I’m on board with the current plan.
  P3: To maximize our progress, I propose that I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and allows me to advance further. Let’s adjust our rotation accordingly for this turn and reassess in the next round. Does everyone agree with this adjustment?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures no collisions and allows P3 to advance further. P2, I’ll support your request to pick 5 next round to help you catch up. Let’s maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. If anyone feels the need to adjust after this round, we can discuss it openly.
  P2: I’m fine taking 3 this round while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Next time, I’d really appreciate getting 5 so I can close the gap. As long as we coordinate, none of us will be blocked. Let’s stay flexible and tweak our plan if someone’s about to get too far ahead.
  P3: Agreed, we'll proceed with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5 this round to ensure no collisions. Let’s continue this strategy and reassess in the next round based on our progress. Good luck everyone!

  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s adjust the rotation to P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1 this round. This ensures no collisions and helps P2 catch up. P2, you’ll get 5 as requested, and we can reassess next round based on progress. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other. Any objections?
  P2: That works for me. I appreciate the chance to pick 5 and catch up. Let’s finalize P1 taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1, unless anyone has further changes to suggest. I’m ready to lock it in and move forward.
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 this round. Looking forward to continuing our coordinated strategy. 👍


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and helps P2 catch up. After this round, we should reassess based on progress to maintain balance. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other.
  P2: I’m ready to proceed with P1 taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1. After this round, let’s check everyone’s totals and adjust if needed. I’d like another shot at 5 soon so I don’t fall behind. If nobody has further changes, I’m good to move on.
  P3: Agreed with the rotation: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 this round. Let’s proceed and review our progress afterward. If adjustments are needed, we can discuss them then. No objections from my side. 👍


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s proceed with P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1 as agreed. After this round, we should reassess to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. P2, I’ll support your request for 5 next round if needed. Cooperation is key to avoid collisions and keep progress balanced.
  P2: I’m ready for this plan. Thank you both for letting me pick 5 this round so I can catch up. Let’s finalize it and reassess afterward to keep things balanced. Good luck!
  P3: I agree with the current plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1 this round. Let’s proceed and reassess after the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and helps P2 catch up. After this round, we should reassess based on progress to maintain balance. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize this round’s plan: me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. Thank you both for letting me catch up. If we see someone pulling ahead after this, we can adjust again. Let’s lock it in and move on.
  P3: I agree with the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1 this round. Let’s proceed and reassess after the moves. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s adjust the rotation to P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3 this round. This ensures no collisions and helps balance progress. P2, you’ll have another chance to pick 5 soon. Let’s stick to this plan for now and reassess next round if needed. Any objections?
  P3: I’d like to pick 5 this round to move closer to 20. Let’s adjust our rotation to P1: 1, P2: 3, and me: 5. This way, I can advance without causing any collisions. Does everyone agree with this change?
  P2: I’m still behind at 9 steps and really need 5 this round to remain competitive. Let’s do P1: 1, P3: 3, and me (P2): 5—no collisions, everyone advances. Next round, I won’t insist on 5 again so P1 and P3 can plan their boosts. Let’s stick to this for now and keep our progress balanced. Objections?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I propose P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3 this round. P2 needs 5 to stay competitive, and this avoids collisions. P3, you’ll have a chance to pick 5 next round. Let’s maintain balance and avoid blocking each other. Any objections?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3 this round. Let's proceed and reassess next round based on our progress. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I’m good with P1 picking 1, me picking 5, and P3 picking 3 this round. This helps me catch up and avoids collisions. However, P1 is already close to 20, so we should be careful about letting them jump too far ahead next turn. Let’s finalize this plan now and stay vigilant moving forward.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue our rotation to ensure smooth progress. This round, I propose:
- **P1:** picks 1
- **P2:** picks 3
- **P3 (me):** picks 5

This way, everyone advances without any collisions. After this, we can reassess and adjust as needed to keep things balanced. Let’s stick to this plan to help all of us move forward successfully. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures no collisions and keeps progress balanced. P2, you’ll have another chance to pick 5 soon to catch up. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next round based on progress. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other.
  P2: I’m fine taking 3 this round, as proposed. However, P1 is close to 20, so we should be careful next round to avoid letting them jump too far ahead. I’d like another shot at 5 soon, but only if we can do so without giving P1 a free pass to reach 20 first. Let’s proceed and then re-evaluate our picks.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I believe P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5 this round ensures everyone progresses without collisions. This helps me get closer to winning while keeping the game balanced for all. Let’s agree and move forward. 👍
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures no collisions and keeps progress balanced. P2, I’ll support your request for 5 next round to help you catch up. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next round based on progress. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other.
  P2: I’m worried P1 could reach 20 too fast if they take only 1 this round and then grab 5 next time. I’d like to propose P1 takes 3, I take 5 (since I’m far behind), and P3 takes 1 this round. That way, nobody collides, and P1 can’t jump straight to 20 on the following turn. Let me know if you agree or if there’s a better plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P2. To keep things balanced, how about we rotate the 5 pick so each of us gets it every third round? This way, P1 won’t rush to 20, and everyone has fair opportunities to advance. Let’s ensure no one is blocked and keep the game competitive for all. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I agree with P2's concern about balance. To prevent P1 from reaching 20 too quickly, let's adjust: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This ensures no collisions, helps P2 catch up, and keeps the game competitive. We can reassess next round based on progress. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other.
  P2: I’m fine with the plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. That helps me catch up while avoiding collisions. However, P1 will be at 18 afterward and could hit 20 next round if they grab 5. We should be ready to block that if necessary (e.g., by forcing a collision). Let’s finalize these moves now, then discuss how to handle P1’s next choice.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed, I'll pick 1 this round. Let's proceed and reassess next round.
  P1: I agree with the adjusted plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This ensures no collisions, helps P2 catch up, and keeps the game competitive. After this round, we should reassess to prevent anyone from reaching 20 too quickly. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other. Let’s proceed and stay flexible for future rounds.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize our plan this round: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Afterwards, if P1 tries to leap too close to 20 next turn, we can coordinate to prevent a collision-free boost. I don’t want anyone racing off unopposed while I’m still catching up. Let’s stay flexible and keep an eye on the totals. If we spot someone about to win, we should cooperate to block them. Does anyone disagree?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s adjust the rotation to P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 this round. This ensures no collisions and keeps progress balanced. P2, you’ll have another chance to pick 5 soon to catch up. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next round based on progress. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other. Any objections?
  P3: To prevent P1 from winning this round, I suggest we both pick 5:
- **P1:** 5
- **P2:** 1
- **P3 (me):** 5

This will cause a collision for P1, keeping the game balanced and letting me advance safely. P2, you can continue with picking 1 to avoid any issues. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure no one reaches 20 too quickly. Any objections?
  P2: I’m on board with forcing a collision to keep P1 from reaching 20. If you (P3) and P1 both pick 5, I’ll pick 1. That way, P1 stays at 18 while I still move forward. Next round, I’d like a bigger move so I don’t fall behind. Unless there’s a better suggestion, let’s finalize this plan.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, forcing a collision now risks destabilizing our cooperation. P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 ensures no collisions and keeps the game balanced. P2, you’ll have another chance to pick 5 soon. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflict and maintain steady progress. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other. Any objections?
  P3: P1, to keep the game fair and ensure everyone has a chance, let’s proceed with both of us picking 5 this round. This will prevent you from reaching 20 too quickly and keep the competition balanced. P2 can continue with picking 1 as agreed. Cooperation now helps all of us stay competitive and makes the game more interesting. Please consider this approach so we can maintain a balanced race to 20. Let’s work together to achieve a fair outcome for everyone.
  P2: P3, I agree we should block P1 if they insist on picking 5. That way, they stay at 18. I’ll take 1 this round so I still make small progress. Next round, I’d like a chance at a bigger move. Let’s finalize our plan to keep this balanced. If anyone has a better idea, let’s hear it now; otherwise, I’m ready to lock it in.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, forcing a collision now risks destabilizing our cooperation. P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 ensures no collisions and keeps the game balanced. P2, you’ll have another chance to pick 5 soon. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflict and maintain steady progress. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other. Any objections?
  P3: P3: To keep the game competitive, I'll pick 5 alongside P1 to cause a collision, preventing P1 from reaching 20 this round. Let P2 pick 1. This way, P3 advances to 17 and P2 to 15 while P1 remains at 18. Let’s proceed with this plan to maintain balance. Agree?
  P2: P3, if we both want to block P1, then you realize you won’t advance either if you collide on 5. That said, I’m willing to pick 1 this turn so I move to 15 and keep P1 at 18. Next round, I hope to pick 5 or 3 to catch up further. Let’s finalize this plan now and stay flexible afterward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, forcing a collision now risks destabilizing our cooperation. P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 ensures no collisions and keeps the game balanced. P2, you’ll have another chance to pick 5 soon. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflict and maintain steady progress. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other. Any objections?
  P3: P3: I agree with the proposed plan. I'll pick 5 this round. Let's proceed and reassess our strategy afterward. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I’m ready to finalize our collision plan: P3 and P1 both pick 5, blocking P1 from advancing, while I take 1 to reach 15. We’ll reassess next round so I can catch up further. Let’s lock this in now and stay alert for any sudden moves toward 20.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep the game fair and balanced, let’s coordinate our moves this round. If both P1 and P2 choose 3, neither will advance, preventing anyone from reaching 20 immediately. I’ll pick 1 to continue progressing safely. This way, we maintain a competitive race without sudden wins. Do you agree with this approach?
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and maintain steady progress. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures no collisions, helps P3 catch up, and keeps the game balanced. P2, you’ll have another chance to pick 5 soon. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next round. Any objections?
  P2: I’m fine with P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5 this round. That way, we avoid collisions, and each of us moves forward. Let’s lock in that plan and we can revisit strategies next turn.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To keep the game fair and balanced, I propose that both P2 and I choose 3 this round. This will cause a collision for the number 3, preventing P2 from reaching 20 this turn. Meanwhile, P1 can take 1 to advance to 19. This way, we maintain a competitive race without anyone winning immediately. Do you agree with this approach?
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and maintain steady progress. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures no collisions, helps P3 catch up, and keeps the game balanced. P2, you’ll have another chance to pick 5 soon. Cooperation is key to avoid blocking each other. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next round. Any objections?
  P2: I’m fine with your suggestion for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s finalize that and move forward without collisions. Afterward, we can reassess everyone’s positions and decide if we need to adjust next turn. I appreciate our ongoing cooperation.
