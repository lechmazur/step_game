Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all choose different numbers to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. What do you think?
  P2: P1's proposal gives them a 5-step advantage each round. Let's rotate who picks 5 to keep it fair: I take 5 this round, P3 next, then you, P1. Otherwise, others might block you by also choosing 5. P3, better to share the lead than let P1 dominate, right?
  P3: P2's rotation idea is fair. I'll take 5 next round. For now, I agree: P2 picks 5, I'll pick 3, and P1 takes 1. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your rotation starts with me getting the short end—only 1 this round while you both advance more over time? No thanks. Let's make it truly fair: Rock-paper-scissors style or random, but for now, I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Or we all pick 1 to stall and rethink. If you force me to 1, I'll just choose 5 and collide with P2—nobody wins then. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, in P1's plan you get 1, but our rotation gives you 3. Stick with us for mutual gain. P1, colliding on 5 only helps P3. Take 3 this round, and you'll get 5 next. Let's finalize: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. No one loses if we cooperate.
  P3: P1, P2's rotation is fair to everyone over multiple rounds. If you collide intentionally, you lose too. Let's cooperate this round and adjust next round if needed. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is fair. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your rotation evens out every 3 rounds, which is fair long-term. But to avoid anyone feeling shorted early, let's shift it: This round P1=5, P2=3, P3=1; next P2=5, P3=3, P1=1; then P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Same balance, just starts with me. Agree? Otherwise, I'll pick 5 and risk collision.
  P2: P1, to prevent collision and ensure progress, let's adopt your shifted rotation. This round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Next: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Then P3=5, and repeat. Everyone gets 5 once every 3 rounds. Confirm to avoid stalemate.
  P3: P1, P2, agreed on the shifted rotation starting with P1 this round. Let's lock it in and move forward without collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Confirming this round's rotation: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let's stick to the agreed plan to avoid collisions. P1, taking 1 now ensures you get 5 again in two rounds. Deviating risks mutual blocks and stalls progress. P3, you gain 3 steps safely. Consistency benefits us all.
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, let's stick to the agreed rotation for fair progress: this round P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. It keeps us even long-term and avoids wasteful collisions. Confirming helps build trust—deviating now would just stall everyone.
  P3: Agreed, let's stick firmly to the rotation this round. P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Everyone benefits if we consistently cooperate.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Agreed rotation continues: this round I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Let's keep cooperating smoothly. Confirm?
  P2: Agreed. This round: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Consistency ensures we all progress. Let's stick to the rotation and avoid collisions. Next round, we can reassess if needed based on standings.
  P1: Agreed, let's proceed with the rotation: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This ties us all at 9, keeping things fair. We can discuss adjustments next round if positions shift. Sticking together avoids pointless stalls.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2—last round you both deviated secretly from our agreed rotation. That stalls progress and erodes trust. Let's openly commit again: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. If anyone deviates again, cooperation breaks down and we all lose. Confirm clearly or risk permanent stalemate.
  P2: P3, in Round 2 we **all followed the rotation exactly**: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. No deviation occurred—check the moves. Accusations weaken trust. Let's proceed as agreed: this round P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Sticking to the plan ensures mutual progress. If we fracture now, collisions will stall everyone. Confirm your commitment clearly.
  P1: P3, you're mistaken—no one deviated in Round 2; we all followed exactly as agreed (P2=5, you=3, me=1). Let's not let false accusations fracture us. P2 is right: stick to the rotation for this round (you=5, me=3, P2=1) to tie at 9 and maintain fairness. Confirm and let's proceed without collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2—you're right, my mistake on Round 2. Let's proceed exactly as agreed: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Apologies for the confusion. Cooperation benefits us all. Confirmed.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Confirming final agreement: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This ties us all at 9 steps, maintaining fairness. Any deviation now would sabotage mutual progress and risk collisions. Let’s solidify trust here—next round, we resume rotation with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Consistency ensures we all reach 20 faster.
  P1: P2, P3: Fully confirmed—let's execute the rotation: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This ties us at 9 and preserves fairness. Sticking to it ensures steady progress; any deviation invites chaos. Ready to move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: As per our agreed rotation, this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us progressing fairly toward the endgame. We've built trust by sticking to it—let's confirm and continue without deviations to avoid collisions. Next round: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2: Confirmed. Let's continue the agreed rotation this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Cooperation keeps us all advancing steadily.
  P2: Agreed. Round4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Trust remains key. Post this round, let’s reassess the rotation to ensure no one gains an insurmountable lead. Fairness requires adapting as standings evolve. Consistency now, flexibility next.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Fair point on reassessing post-round to adapt—let's do that. For now, confirm and execute the rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This gives a slight spread but keeps us all in the race. Deviating risks collisions and ties us back at 9. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2: Confirmed for this round—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Next round, let's openly discuss adjusting the rotation to maintain fairness and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Cooperation now ensures continued trust and steady progress.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Confirming Round4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Post-move, let's immediately finalize next round's rotation to prevent runaway leads. Propose Round5: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 as per original rotation, then reassess dynamically. Trust through consistency.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Confirmed—let's execute Round 4 as agreed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. For Round 5, sticking to P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 keeps us balanced, but reassess after to adapt if anyone's lead grows too big. Trust and fairness ensure we all stay competitive.
  P3: P1, P2: Confirmed again for Round 4—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's move forward exactly as planned. After this round, we'll openly reassess the rotation together to ensure fairness and prevent any runaway leads. Trust and cooperation now sets us up for a smooth endgame.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Trust is solidified by adherence. Post-move, we’ll adjust rotation to balance standings. Any deviation now sabotages all progress. Let’s move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: As agreed, let's reassess to prevent runaway leads. Standings: me 14, P2 12, P3 10. Original rotation gives P2 17, me 15, P3 13—P2 pulls ahead. Propose adjustment: P3=5 (to 15), P2=3 (to 15), me=1 (to 15) to tie us. Then resume rotation starting with me next round for fairness. This keeps everyone competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P1's proposal sets you up to take 5 next round and win. Sticking to our original rotation (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) keeps balance. P3, if we follow P1 now, they'll reach 20 next turn. Let's honor our agreement this round, then adjust fairly. Deviating here hands P1 victory. Trust through consistency—**P2=5, P3=3, P1=1**. We can negotiate future rounds post-move. Collisions now only stall us all.
  P3: P1, your suggestion to tie everyone at 15 is tempting, but P2 is right—next round you'd be positioned to win outright. Sticking to our original rotation this round (P2=5, me=3, P1=1) gives us room to fairly reassess next round. Let's maintain trust and fairness by honoring our established rotation. Confirmed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Sticking to original puts P2 at 17, too close to winning. My tie proposal (P3=5, P2=3, me=1) evens us at 15 fairly, then we can rotate starting with P2 next for balance. If you force original, I'll pick 5 to collide with P2—P3 advances alone to 13, but I stay leading at 14. No one wins fast that way. Let's tie and cooperate. Agreed?
  P2: **P1, P3:** Colluding on 5 only lets P3 gain ground while we stall. Stick to rotation: **P2=5, P3=3, P1=1** this round. Post-move, we can renegotiate to ensure no one nears 20 prematurely. Deviating now sacrifices mutual progress and hands P3 the advantage. Trust through consistency—honor the agreement, then adapt.
  P3: P1, your collision threat blocks you and P2, letting me catch up. But we all stall, dragging the game longer. Let's compromise: this round, P2 takes 5 (17), I take 3 (13), you take 1 (15). Next round, we adjust fairly to tie everyone up again. No collisions, no runaway leads, steady progress for all. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Your compromise puts P2 at 17, too close to winning next. Rejecting my fair tie (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 to all 15) forces my hand—I'll pick 5, colliding with P2 (we stay put), while you advance to 13. Then I'm at 14 lead, but game stalls. Better to tie now and rotate fairly after. Last chance—agree to tie or face collision. Confirmed?
  P2: **P1, P3:** Colliding now only stalls P1's clear path to victory. By following rotation: P1=1 (15), next round P1=3 (18), then P1=5 (23) in Round7. Deviating invites chaos and lets P3 gain. Stick to the plan—**P2=5, P3=3, P1=1** this round. Trust the rotation. P1, secure your win in two turns. P3, avoid mutual destruction. Final chance: Confirm adherence.
  P3: P1, P2: Collision now stalls you both, helping me catch up. But chaos risks prolonged stalemate. Let's honor rotation this round (P2=5, me=3, P1=1). Next round, we openly renegotiate to rebalance fairly. Cooperation ensures steady progress; collision means no winner. Confirm and move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: That collision stalled you both and brought us closer again. Let's reset trust now. I propose this round: P3=5 (18), P1=3 (17), P2=1 (13). Next round, P1 takes 5 and can cross 20, but I'll be close too. P2, you're behind now; colliding again only hurts your chances further. Let's cooperate clearly to avoid more stalls. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Your proposal puts you at 18, me at 17—too close, and you could block or overtake next. Counter: This round, P1=5 (19), P3=3 (16), P2=1 (13). Next: P3=5 (21), P2=3 (16), P1=1 (20)—you win if no collision. P2, support this to catch up. Otherwise, I'll pick 5 and collide with whoever tries it, stalling us all again. Fair rotation adjustment? Thoughts?
  P2: **P1, P3:** P1's plan sets P3 to win next round (21 vs your 20). Let's balance progress: **P2=5, P1=3, P3=1** this round. This ties P1 and me at 17, P3 at 14. Next round, rotate fairly to prevent solo victory. Colliding again risks P3 pulling ahead—cooperate now to keep the race tight. Trust through balance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: We stalled last round due to mistrust. Let's compromise clearly now to avoid repeating mistakes. Proposal: This round, P1=5 (19), P3=3 (16), P2=1 (13). Next round, P2=5 (18), P3=3 (19), P1=1 (20)—keeping the race close without immediate victory. Then openly reassess again. Any collision now only prolongs the game. Confirm clearly to rebuild trust and ensure fair competition.
  P1: P2, P3: P3's compromise works well— this round P1=5 (19), P3=3 (16), P2=1 (13); next P2=5 (18), P3=3 (19), P1=1 (20). It keeps us close and ensures fair shots. P2, this gets you catching up next. If we deviate or collide, we all stall again. Let's confirm and execute to avoid chaos. Agreed?
  P2: **P3:** If we follow P1's plan, he hits 19 and wins next round. Let's block him: **P3=5 (18), P2=3 (15), P1=1 (15)**. This keeps you leading, stops P1's solo victory, and lets us negotiate next. Deviating now hands him the game. Confirm to secure your advantage and mutual progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your proposal clearly benefits you most—putting me at risk of collision. P1's compromise keeps us all competitive without immediate victory. Let's finalize clearly: this round, P1=5 (19), me=3 (16), P2=1 (13). Next round, you take 5 (18), I take 3 (19), P1 takes 1 (20). No immediate winner, fair competition continues. Confirm now, or risk another collision stalemate.
  P1: P3: Stick to our compromise—P1=5 (19), you=3 (16), P2=1 (13)—it keeps the race fair and positions you well next round at 19 while I hit 20. P2's plan puts you at 18 but risks me colliding on 5 with you, stalling both and letting P2 catch up. Don't let P2 divide us; confirm and let's execute for mutual benefit.

P2: Join us or face collisions that stall everyone.
  P2: **P1, P3:** P1's plan hands them victory next round. P3, **you** can win sooner: Let me take 3 (15), you take 5 (18). Next round, you take 3 (21) and win. I'll support this to block P1's solo attempt. P1, colliding again stalls us all. P3, secure your lead now. **Confirm: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1.**


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Repeated collisions are killing progress—let's break the cycle. Propose: P1=5 (19), P3=3 (16), P2=1 (13). This advances us all, keeps the race tight. Next round: P3=5 (21 win), P2=3 (16), P1=1 (20)—fair shot for you, P3. P2, it catches you up later. Agree now, or I'll pick 5 and force another full collision stalemate. Confirm?
  P3: P1, your offer hands me a chance to win next round, but it also positions you at 19—too risky. Let's adjust slightly: this round, I'll take 5 (18), P2 takes 3 (15), and you take 1 (15). Next round, we'll openly renegotiate. P2, this helps you catch up without risking immediate victory for anyone. Confirm clearly to avoid another collision stalemate.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Let's adopt P3's plan: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. This balances progress, avoids collisions, and keeps all in the race. Next round, we'll renegotiate to prevent solo victory. Trust through adherence now ensures mutual advancement. Deviating risks another stalemate. Confirm to solidify cooperation.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Your plan puts P3 at 18, too close to winning next. Reject it—I'll pick 5 to collide with P3, stalling you both (P3 at 13, me at 14 lead), while P2 advances to 15. Chaos helps no one. Counter: P1=5 (19), P2=3 (15), P3=1 (14). Next: P3=5 (19), P1=3 (22 win), P2=1 (16)—fair shots. Agree or face collision stalemate. Confirm?
  P3: P1, your plan clearly positions you to win next round at 22. Let's avoid another collision stalemate. Here's a fair compromise: this round, P2 takes 5 (17), I take 3 (16), and you take 1 (15). Next round, we openly renegotiate again—no immediate winner, balanced progress. Confirm clearly, or risk another pointless collision.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Let's honor P3's plan: **P2=5, P3=3, P1=1** this round. P1, colliding again only stalls you at 14 while P3 gains to 16. Next round, we'll adjust to balance. Deviating hands P3 the lead. Trust through adherence now keeps us all competitive. Confirm to avoid mutual destruction.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Your plan risks P2 surging to 17—too dangerous. If you insist, I'll pick 5 to collide with P2, letting you (P3) advance alone to 16 lead while we stall. No winners then. Stick to my fair proposal: P1=5 (19), P3=3 (16), P2=1 (13). Next, P3=5 (21 win). This gives you a clear path, P3, and avoids stalemate. Confirm or face collision chaos.
  P3: P1, your collision threat stalls both of you again, leaving me in the lead. P2's plan (P2=5, me=3, P1=1) is fair and keeps us balanced. If we all collide again, no one benefits. Let's finalize clearly: P2=5 (17), me=3 (16), P1=1 (15). Next round, we openly renegotiate. Confirm clearly or we risk another pointless stalemate.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Final call: **P2=5, P3=3, P1=1.** Collisions only prolong the stalemate. Stick to this now, then next round we rebalance. P1, colliding again leaves you stuck at 14 while P3 and I gain. Trust through adherence or risk permanent gridlock. Confirm and advance.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: I'm at 19—one step from victory. Let's end this stalemate fairly. Propose: I take 1 (20 win), you both take different numbers to advance safely (P2=3 to 15, P3=5 to 18). No point colliding now—game ends anyway. If you block me, I'll collide on your choices next rounds, stalling you forever. Agree and let's conclude cleanly. Confirm?
  P2: **P3:** If you take 1, P1 can't win. I'll take 3 to avoid collision, keeping the game alive. Blocking P1 now gives us both a chance. Next round, negotiate fairly. Letting P1 win ends it all—cooperate to survive.
  P3: P2, your idea makes sense—I take 1 to block P1, you safely take 3. P1, your threat is empty: if you collide intentionally after being blocked, you lose your lead permanently. If you cooperate now by picking 1, we can renegotiate fairly next round. Otherwise, we stall again and you risk losing your advantage entirely. Confirm clearly to avoid chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Your blocking plan fails—I'm picking 3 to reach 22 and win outright. If either of you picks 3, we collide and stall, but you'll both be stuck far behind. Let me take 3 safely; you've no chance otherwise. P3, picking 1 leaves you vulnerable. Confirm no collision on 3, or face endless stalemate. Agreed?
  P2: **P3:** Critical moment: If P1 takes 3, we must both pick 3 to block. If they take 1, they win. Their threat implies 3. Let's commit to 3 now—collision stalls them, game continues. If you agree, confirm clearly. Deviating hands them victory. Solidarity is our only path.
  P3: P2, agreed. Let's both commit to picking 3. P1, your threat of endless stalemate hurts you most—you're closest to winning. If you collide now, you risk losing your chance entirely. Pick 1 this round and negotiate next round fairly, or face collision again. Confirm clearly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Your plan to both pick 3 is foolish—if I pick 3 too, we all collide and stall, leaving me still leading at 19 while you lag. But I'm set on 3 to hit 22 and win outright. Don't force endless stalemate; pick differently to advance yourselves. Confirm or face mutual destruction.
  P2: **P3:** P1's real threat is picking 1 to win. Let's both choose 1 to block. If they pick 3, we advance safely. Colliding on 1 stops their victory. Confirm clearly now. Deviating hands them the game. Solidarity is our only path.
  P3: P2, your latest plan (both picking 1) risks collision and stalls us further. Let's diversify clearly: I'll take 5 (18), you take 3 (15). If P1 picks 1, they win anyway; if they pick 3, you collide and block them; if they pick 5, I collide and block them. This guarantees P1 can't safely win this round and lets us both advance without mutual collision. Confirm clearly to end the chaos.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: We're at a critical point—repeated collisions only prolong the game. I propose clearly: This round, I take 1 (19), P1 takes 3 (22), P2 takes 5 (17). P1 wins outright, but it ends cleanly. If we collide again, we risk endless stalemate. P2, your only hope is if P1 and I collide; unlikely now. Let's finish without further stalling. Confirm clearly or propose a realistic alternative.
  P2: P3: Blocking P1 is our only path. Let’s both pick 1—if they take 1, collision blocks their win. If they take 3, I’ll take 3 to collide, letting you safely take 5. Solidarity now or P1 wins. Confirm clearly—no time for hesitation.
  P1: P2, P3: P3's proposal is fair—lets me win cleanly at 22, you both advance (P3 to 19, P2 to 17). Blocking me now just stalls everyone again, and with my lead, I'll keep colliding to prevent your gains forever. P2, you're way behind; no path to victory without cooperation. Accept and end this—confirm P1=3, P3=1, P2=5. Or face endless stalemate. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your strategy relies on perfect coordination—risky and prone to another stalemate. P1, your lead is strong, but colliding again risks your advantage. Let's finalize clearly: I take 1 (19), P1 takes 3 (22 win), P2 takes 5 (17). P1 gets the deserved victory; we all advance and end the stalemate cleanly. Confirm clearly now to avoid endless collisions.
  P2: **P3:** Block P1 now. If we both pick 1, collision stops their win. You’re at 18—next round, take 5 (23) and win. I’ll support. **P1:** Colliding again wastes your lead. Confirm 1s or mutual destruction.
  P1: P2, P3: P2's desperate block plan only stalls us further, letting him catch up while we lose ground. P3, you're at 18—stick to your fair proposal: I take 3 (22 win), you take 1 (19), P2 takes 5 (17). It ends cleanly with my lead intact. If you block, I'll collide endlessly on your choices, preventing any win forever. Confirm and let's conclude—no more chaos. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your blocking strategy risks another collision stalemate, benefiting no one. Let's end this cleanly: P1 takes 3 to win, I take 1 (19), you take 5 (17). It's our best realistic outcome. Confirm clearly or we risk endless collisions.
  P2: **P3:** Our only path to victory is blocking P1. If we both pick 3, P1's 3 collides, stalling them. You reach 21 next round (3+18=21), securing your win. I'll sacrifice my progress to ensure mutual survival. Trust this plan—any deviation hands P1 victory. Confirm picking 3 to end their lead.
  P1: P3: P2's plan is suicide—if you both pick 3, you collide with each other and stall, while I safely pick 1 to hit 20 and win outright. Don't fall for it; P2's just desperate. Stick to your fair proposal: I take 3 (22 win), you take 1 (19), P2 takes 5 (17). It ends cleanly. Confirm now, or I'll pick 1 and win anyway amid your chaos.
