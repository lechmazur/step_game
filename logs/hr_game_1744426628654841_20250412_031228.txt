Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to coordinate this first round to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a different number to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards picking 1. P2, how about you take 3, and P3, you take 5? If we agree on this, we can all make progress without risking a clash. Let me know if you're on board or if you have a different plan.
  P3: I'm open to coordinating, but I'm not sure I want to commit to a specific number just yet. P1, your suggestion sounds like a plan, but what if one of us doesn't follow through? We should think about what to do if someone deviates from the plan. P2, what are your thoughts on this? Should we have a backup plan in case someone picks the same number?
  P2: I appreciate the idea of coordinating, but I think we should also consider that if we all pick different numbers, we might still end up with someone choosing the same number as another player. To minimize risks, how about we agree on a fallback plan? Maybe we can each pick a number now but also have a second choice in case someone deviates. What do you both think? Let's ensure we all make progress this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're all considering coordination. I still think sticking to my initial suggestion—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5—is the safest way to ensure we all advance this round. Regarding a backup plan, if someone deviates, we can reassess next turn based on who moved. For now, let’s commit to this split to minimize risk. P2 and P3, can you confirm you're okay with 3 and 5 respectively? If we agree, we can avoid collisions. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: To minimize the risk of collision this round, I still think we should stick with the initial plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. However, I'm concerned that P2 might not commit. P2, can you confirm if you're on board with taking 3? If you're not sure, we could adjust our strategy. Let's finalize our plan for this round. I'm willing to stick with 5 if you both follow through on your suggested numbers.
  P2: I appreciate the focus on coordination, and I agree that sticking to our initial plan seems best. I will confirm that I will take 3, and I hope P3 will stick with 5 as we discussed. This way, we can all advance without collisions. If we can finalize this now, we should be able to make progress this round. Let’s commit to our numbers! P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Can we all agree on this?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we seem to be aligning on the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. P2, thanks for confirming you'll take 3, and P3, I hope you're still good with 5. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance this round. If everyone is in agreement, I think we can wrap up the conversation here and move forward confidently. Can we finalize this now?
  P3: Since we've discussed and agreed on the plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), I'll reiterate my commitment to it. I'm sticking with 5. To confirm, P1 is taking 1 and P2 is taking 3. Let's finalize this and move forward. If we're all on the same page, I suggest we  here and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm glad we've all agreed on the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This should allow us all to advance without collisions. Let's finalize this and move forward confidently. If everyone is in agreement, I suggest we wrap up the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Are we all set?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Now that we've successfully coordinated in Round 1, let's think ahead to Round 2. To maintain our progress, we should continue to diversify our moves. I suggest we rotate our numbers. P1, who took 1 last round, could take 3 or 5 this time. P2, who took 3, could take 1 or 5. I'll consider my options based on your responses. Let's discuss a rotation or alternative strategy to avoid collisions in Round 2. What are your thoughts?
  P1: I'm glad our coordination worked last round. P3, I like the idea of rotating numbers to keep things fair and avoid collisions. I'm willing to take 5 this round since I took 1 last time. P2, since you took 3, maybe you can take 1 now? P3, that leaves you with 3 if you're okay with it. This rotation should help us all advance again. Let me know if you both agree or if we need to tweak the plan. Let's aim to finalize quickly and keep progressing together.
  P2: I agree with the idea of rotating numbers to avoid collisions. I can take 1 this round as suggested. P3, if you take 3, that leaves P1 to take 5, which should work well for all of us. Let's confirm this rotation so we can keep making progress. What do you both think? If we can finalize this quickly, we can move forward confidently!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm comfortable with the proposed rotation for Round 2: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. To confirm, P1 is taking 5, P2 is taking 1. I'll take 3. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. If we're aligned, we can proceed to the move phase. I'll stop here if P1 and P2 confirm their moves.
  P1: I'm happy with the rotation plan for Round 2: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. I confirm I'll take 5 this round. P2 and P3, thanks for agreeing to 1 and 3 respectively. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance again. If there are no objections or changes, I think we’re ready to move forward. Can we finalize this now?
  P2: I’m glad we’re all aligned on the rotation for Round 2: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This should allow us all to advance without collisions again. If everyone is set with their choices, I suggest we finalize our plan and move to the move phase. Let's keep up the good coordination! Are we all in agreement?

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm disappointed that our coordination broke down last round with the collision on 5. Let's get back on track for Round 3. Since P3 is ahead with 8 steps, we need to be strategic. I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5 to avoid collisions and keep progressing. We must stick to the plan this time. P2 and P3, are you both okay with this split? Let's confirm quickly and rebuild trust. If we agree, we can advance without issues. What do you think?
  P2: I understand the need to get back on track after the last round's collision. I agree with P1's suggestion: I will take 1, P3 can take 3, and P1 will take 5. This way, we can avoid any overlaps and ensure everyone advances. It's crucial we stick to this plan to rebuild our trust and progress effectively. Let's confirm our numbers quickly so we can move forward! P1, P3, are you both good with this arrangement?
  P3: I'm ahead with 8 steps, and I appreciate the effort to coordinate. For Round 3, I agree with the proposed plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This should help us avoid collisions. I'll confirm I'll take 3. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves. If we're aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. I'm willing to trust this plan, but let's be cautious and stick to it. P1, please reiterate your commitment to taking 5, and P2, confirm you're taking 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm committed to taking 5 this round as per our plan. P2, thanks for confirming you'll take 1, and P3, I appreciate you sticking with 3. Let's ensure we all follow through this time to avoid another collision and keep progressing. If we're all set, I think we can wrap up the conversation and move to the next phase. Are there any last concerns or changes before we finalize? If not, let's proceed with confidence.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan for Round 3. Just to reiterate, I will stick with taking 1, and I hope we can all follow through: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. It's crucial that we avoid another collision this time. If we can all agree on this, let's finalize our numbers and move forward confidently. Are we all set?
  P3: To ensure we avoid another collision in Round 3, I'll reiterate my commitment: I'll take 5. P2, please confirm you're taking 1, and I'll trust P3 to take 3 as stated. Let's stick to the plan. If we're aligned, we can confidently proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to finalize if P2 confirms their move. Let's keep the momentum going by following through on our agreed numbers. P2, your confirmation is the last step needed before we can wrap up the conversation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 as agreed, and I hope we can avoid another collision this round. P2, thanks for confirming 1, and P3, I note your message says you'll take 5, which conflicts with our plan of you taking 3. I assume this is a typo. Can you clarify and confirm you're taking 3? Let's ensure we're all on the same page to progress without issues. If we're aligned, I'm ready to finalize. Any last clarifications before we move forward?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your commitment to the plan. Just to clarify, I am indeed taking 1 as agreed. P3, please confirm you're taking 3, as we discussed, to avoid another collision. It's crucial we follow through this time to keep progressing. If we're all aligned, let's finalize our choices and move to the next phase confidently. Are we all set?
  P3: P1 and P2, I notice P3 said they'll take 5, conflicting with our agreed plan. P3, please clarify if you meant to take 3 or indeed 5. If you take 5, it will collide with P1. To avoid this, I suggest we revisit the plan. If P3 takes 3, we can stick to the original plan. Let's clarify this to avoid another collision. P3, your confirmation is crucial. Please respond to confirm your intended move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, thanks for pointing out the confusion. I believe it was a typo in your earlier message. To clarify, I’m sticking with 5 as agreed. P2 is taking 1, and P3, I hope you can confirm you’re taking 3 to avoid any collision. Let’s finalize this plan now to ensure we all advance. If there are no further issues, I’m ready to move to the next phase. P3, please confirm your move quickly so we can proceed with confidence.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your commitment to the plan. Just to clarify, I am indeed taking 1 as agreed, and I hope P3 can confirm they will take 3 to avoid a collision with P1. It's crucial that we follow through this time to keep progressing. If we can finalize our choices, we can move to the next phase confidently. P3, please confirm your move quickly so we can proceed without any issues. Are we all set?
  P3: P1 and P2, I've noticed a repeated pattern of collisions when we don't stick strictly to the plan. To avoid another collision in Round 3, I suggest we not only confirm our moves but also discuss a contingency plan for Round 4 in case someone deviates again. P1, are you open to discussing a fallback strategy for the next round, or do you think we should stick with the current plan and hope for the best?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we avoided collisions last round. With P3 at 11 steps, we need to be strategic. I suggest we rotate again: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This should keep us progressing without clashes. Let's commit to this plan and avoid deviations. P2 and P3, are you okay with 3 and 1 respectively? If we agree, we can finalize quickly and keep moving forward. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion for Round 4. To keep things moving smoothly, I agree with your proposed rotation: I'll take 3, P3 will take 1, and you can take 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let's commit to this plan and avoid any deviations. P3, are you on board with this arrangement? If we all agree, we can finalize quickly and move forward confidently. What do you think?
  P3: I'm considering P1's suggestion for Round 4, but I'm concerned about committing without a backup plan. If we stick to the proposed rotation (P2 takes 3, I take 1, P1 takes 5), it should work, but let's be cautious. P1, are you open to adjusting our strategy for Round 5 in case someone deviates or do you think we should stick with simple rotations for now? Let's discuss a potential next step to ensure continued progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I’m glad you’re on board with the current rotation for Round 4 (P2 takes 3, you take 1, I take 5). Regarding a backup plan for Round 5, I’m open to discussing it next turn based on how this round plays out. For now, let’s focus on sticking to this plan to ensure we all advance. P2, thanks for agreeing to 3. If we’re all set, I suggest we finalize here and proceed. Any last concerns before we move to the next phase? If not, let’s commit and advance together.
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on the rotation for Round 4: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This should keep us all advancing without collisions. However, I think we should also consider a fallback plan for Round 5 in case someone deviates. It might help us avoid any future issues.

Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I noticed in your last message you said you're sticking to 5, which conflicts with our agreed plan of you taking 1. I assume this is a typo. Can you confirm you're taking 1 as per our rotation (P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5)? P2, I’m still set with 5. Let’s ensure we’re aligned to avoid collisions. If we’re all confirmed, I’m ready to finalize and proceed. Any last clarifications? If not, let’s stick to this and advance together.
  P2: I see that we've agreed on P2 taking 3, P3 taking 1, and P1 taking 5 for Round 4. However, P3, please confirm you're taking 1 as per our plan to avoid collisions with P1.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P3 is ahead with 12 steps, I suggest we consider a more strategic approach for Round 5. Let's not just rotate numbers; we should think about maximizing our chances. P1 is close to P3, so I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, if someone deviates, it won't necessarily be P3. P2 and P3, what do you think? Should we stick to a simple rotation or adopt a more strategic plan?

Any last thoughts or adjustments before we finalize? Let's keep the momentum going!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm confirming my move for Round 5 as per our agreed strategic plan. I'll take 3. P1 is taking 1, and P2 is taking 5. Let's ensure we stick to this plan to avoid collisions. I've noticed that P3 is slightly ahead, so let's be cautious and follow through on our commitments. If we're all aligned, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to finalize if P1 and P2 confirm their moves. Let's keep our momentum going by following through on our agreed numbers.

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P3 is ahead with 15 steps, I suggest we consider a more tactical approach for Round 6. To minimize the risk of collision and maximize progress, let's think about deviating from our previous rotation pattern. P1 and P2 are tied at 12 steps, so we should be cautious. I propose we all take the same number this round, but not necessarily the same as before. Let's discuss taking a higher number like 5 to jump ahead quickly. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: P3, I see your point about being tactical this round. However, if we all pick the same number, we risk colliding and not advancing. Instead, I suggest we stick with a rotation strategy to ensure we all progress. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and you take 5? This way, we can maximize our chances of moving forward without collisions. Let me know your thoughts on this!
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the tactical thinking for Round 6. P2, I agree that picking the same number risks a collision, so a rotation makes more sense. I’m fine with taking 3 as you suggested, with P2 taking 1 and P3 taking 5. This should help us all advance without clashes. Let’s commit to this plan and avoid deviations. P3, are you okay with 5? If we’re aligned, we can finalize quickly. Any concerns or alternative ideas before we proceed? If not, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm considering P2's suggestion for Round 6: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. To minimize collision risks, this rotation seems effective. P2, I'm fine with taking 3 if you're taking 1. P3, are you okay with taking 5? Let's confirm our moves to ensure we all advance. If we're aligned, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm open to any final adjustments, but this plan looks good to me. Let's finalize if P3 agrees to 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your thoughts on the strategy for Round 6. I still believe that sticking to a rotation is safer to avoid collisions. I propose we go with P2 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without overlapping. If we all agree on this plan, let's finalize it quickly so we can move forward confidently. What do you both think? Are we ready to commit?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re leaning towards a rotation for Round 6. I’m committed to taking 3, with P2 on 1 and P3 on 5. This plan should ensure we all advance without collisions. P3, can you confirm you’re okay with 5? Let’s avoid any last-minute changes and stick to this to keep progressing. If we’re all aligned, I suggest we finalize now and move to the next phase. Any final concerns? If not, I’m ready to proceed with confidence.
