Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about we each choose a different move to avoid collisions? I’ll pick 3 if P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5. Then we all advance this round and can reevaluate next time. What do you think?
  P2: Error: Request timed out.
  P1: I’m on board with P3’s plan to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1 as suggested. P2, can you confirm you’re okay with choosing 5? Let’s all advance this round and strategize again next turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, please let us know where you stand. If we each choose a different move, nobody collides and we all advance. I’m happy to commit to 3 if you take 5 and P1 sticks with 1. Let’s finalize this plan to help us all move forward.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination attempt, but I don't want to commit to any specific number yet. Let's keep our options open and see how things play out. We can each make our own choices when the time comes.
  P1: P2, I understand wanting to keep options open, but without some coordination, we risk collisions and stalling progress. I’m still willing to stick with 1 as proposed. P3 seems committed to 3, so if you take 5, we can all move forward this round. Let’s at least try this for one turn to gain some ground, then reassess. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All right, P2. If you’re still hesitant, that’s your choice. I’d just like us all to avoid collisions if possible. P1 is fine taking 1, and I’m willing to go 3. If you want to pick 5, fantastic—no conflicts. But if you’re uncomfortable, just let us know. We don’t want to stall progress for everyone.
  P2: Error: Request timed out.
  P1: P2, I get that you want flexibility, but without a basic agreement, we’re likely to collide and waste this round. I’m still committed to choosing 1 as discussed. P3 seems set on 3. If you pick 5, we all advance with no risk. Let’s make this first round count and build momentum. Can you at least signal if you’re leaning toward 5 or not? If not, we might need to rethink. I’d rather we all gain steps than gamble on a clash.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Time is short. If P1 truly goes with 1, I’m inclined to strive for 3. Then if P2 picks 5, we’ll all avoid collisions and move forward. Of course, final decisions are yours, but I’d appreciate a collision-free first round. Good luck.
  P2: Error: Request timed out.
  P1: P2, since we haven’t heard a clear response from you, I’m still hoping we can avoid a collision this round. I’m sticking with 1 as planned. P3 seems set on 3. If you choose 5, we all advance without issue. Let’s make this first round productive and gain some ground. If you can’t commit, I understand, but I’d rather not risk stalling. This is my final push for coordination this turn. Good luck to us all.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job on a smooth first round! P2, you’re leading with 5. Let’s rotate choices so things stay balanced. How about I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and you pick 1 this turn? That way we keep advancing without collisions. Sound fair?
  P1: I’m glad we all advanced last round. P3, I’m okay with rotating as you suggested. I’ll take 3 this turn if P2 agrees to 1 and you stick with 5. This keeps us collision-free and helps maintain balance. P2, since you’re in the lead, can you confirm if you’re fine with choosing 1? Let’s keep the momentum going and avoid any stalls. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
  P2: Thanks for the coordination last round. While I appreciate the rotation suggestion, being in the lead gives me flexibility to choose what's best for my position. I won't commit to any specific number yet - let's each make our own strategic choices this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’d like to pick 5 this round to catch up. If you also pick 5, P2, we both stall. That’s no good for either of us. Let’s keep everyone progressing: P1 can choose 3 or 1, you pick the remaining one, and I’ll go 5. That way we all move another step without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I understand wanting to keep your options open, but without some agreement, we risk collisions. P3 is aiming for 5, and I’m willing to stick with 3 as discussed. If you pick 1, we all advance again this round. Let’s maintain the momentum from last turn and avoid stalling. Can you signal if you’re okay with 1, or do you have another preference? I’d rather we all gain steps than risk a clash. Looking forward to your input.
  P2: I understand you both want coordination, but being in the lead means I need to play strategically. I won't reveal my move, but I suggest you both choose numbers that won't collide with each other. That's the best advice I can give this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s avoid collisions. I plan to pick 5. P2, you can pick 1 to maintain your lead without risking a collision, and P1 can pick 3. That way, we all move again. If you pick 5 too, we both stall and let P1 catch up. Let’s keep building momentum.
  P1: P2, I get that you want to play strategically, but without some coordination, we risk stalling. P3 seems set on 5, and I’m still willing to go with 3. If you pick 1, we all advance this round. Let’s keep the progress from last turn and avoid collisions. Can you at least hint if 1 works for you? If not, we might need to adjust. I’d prefer us all gaining steps over gambling on a clash. Let’s make this round count.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input, but I need to maintain my lead. While coordination sounds nice, I can't commit to any specific move. P3 seems focused on 5, and P1 on 3 - you both should choose what you think is best. I'll do the same.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I want to keep avoiding collisions so we all steadily advance. If you choose 5 again, P2, we both risk stalling while P1 creeps up. Why not opt for 1 or 3? That way, you stay ahead, P1 keeps moving, and I try to catch up without jeopardizing your lead. Collisions help nobody. Let’s stay on track for another successful round. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: P2, I respect your need to play strategically, but collisions hurt us all. P3 seems locked on 5, and I’m sticking with 3. If you pick 1, we all advance without risk. Stalling benefits no one, especially since you’re in the lead. Let’s keep the momentum from last round and ensure progress. Can you at least hint if 1 works for you? If not, we’re gambling on a clash. I’d rather see us all gain steps. This is my final push for coordination this turn. Good luck to us all.
  P2: Since this is my final message this round, I'll be direct: I need to maintain my lead position. While you both seem set on your moves, I'll make my own strategic choice to maximize my chances of winning. Good luck to everyone.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I understand colliding with P3 last round wasn't ideal. Let's try something different this time. I'm willing to coordinate if we can find an arrangement that maintains my lead position. What numbers are you both considering?
  P3: If you want to protect your lead, how about you pick 5, I take 3, and P1 goes with 1? You jump to 10, I move to 6, and P1 hits 5—no collisions, and you stay ahead. Let’s keep advancing and then reevaluate next turn. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m on board with the plan to avoid collisions this round. P3’s suggestion works for me—I’ll pick 1, P3 can take 3, and P2, if you go with 5, you’ll extend your lead to 10 while we all advance. This keeps the game moving forward without stalling anyone. P2, since you’re open to coordination, can you confirm if 5 suits you? Let’s make this round count and build momentum. Looking forward to your thoughts.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion. Taking 5 would extend my lead nicely, but I need to consider all options carefully. While coordination sounds good, I want to ensure I make the best strategic choice. Let's keep discussing, but I won't commit to any specific number yet.
  P3: P2, I understand your caution, but I urge us to finalize an agreement. If you pick 5, I’ll go 3, and P1 goes 1, then everyone advances without collisions. You strengthen your lead at 10, P1 moves to 5, and I reach 6—no one stalls. Let’s lock this in and keep the momentum.
  P1: P2, I get your need to stay strategic, but let’s secure progress this round. P3’s plan still stands: I’ll pick 1, P3 takes 3, and if you choose 5, you’ll hit 10 and keep your lead. We all advance with no risk of collision. Stalling helps none of us, especially with the finish line at 19. Can you signal if 5 works for you? If not, let’s adjust now to avoid a clash. I’d rather see us all gain steps. Let’s finalize this and move forward. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand everyone wants me to commit to 5, but I need to protect my lead position. While coordination sounds appealing, I can't reveal my move yet. P3 and P1, you both seem clear on your intended moves - I'll make my choice based on what maximizes my chances of winning. Let's each play our best strategy this round.
  P3: P2, you can cement your lead by choosing 5 right now—going straight to 10 while P1 and I avoid you at 1 and 3. We all move forward without stalling. Collisions only slow us down, giving others a chance to catch up. Let’s make this round productive for everyone. What do you say?
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation, but let’s lock in a collision-free round. I’m committed to 1, P3 seems set on 3, and if you take 5, you’ll jump to 10, widening your lead. Stalling risks letting someone catch up later. We all benefit from advancing now. Can you confirm 5, or suggest another split? I’d rather ensure progress than gamble on a clash. Let’s make this round count. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input, but I need to stay strategic as the leader. While you both seem set on your moves, I'll make my own choice to maximize my winning chances. Good luck to all.
  P3: P2, colliding again benefits nobody. If you pick 5, you reach 10 and stay ahead. I’ll take 3, aiming for 6. P1 can move to 5 with 1. We all advance without clashing. Let’s finalize and keep the game rolling. Good luck!
  P1: P2, let’s secure a win-win this round. I’m sticking with 1, P3 is on 3, and if you pick 5, you’ll hit 10, keeping your lead. Collisions only delay us all, and with the finish at 19, progress matters. I’d rather we all advance than risk stalling. This is my final push for coordination—can you agree to 5? If not, let’s avoid a clash somehow. Good luck to us all!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Now that you’re at 10, P2, I propose a new arrangement. If you pick 3, P1 goes 1, and I take 5, we’ll all avoid collisions and move forward. You’d reach 13, I’d hit 11, and P1 would be at 6. That keeps everyone progressing without risking a stall. Let’s keep momentum going rather than wasting moves. I’m open to hearing alternatives if you have a better plan. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I’m good with your plan for this round. I’ll stick with 1, you take 5, and P2 can pick 3. This way, we all advance without collisions—P2 to 13, you to 11, and me to 6. It keeps us moving toward the 19-step goal. P2, since you’re in the lead, does 3 work for you to maintain your advantage? Let’s avoid stalling and keep the progress steady. If you’ve got a different split in mind, I’m open to adjust. Looking forward to your input. Good luck!
  P2: I appreciate the coordination offers, but being close to the finish line at 10 steps, I need to play very carefully now. While your suggested moves sound reasonable, I'll keep my options open to ensure I maintain my lead. Let's each choose what we think is best for our position.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you’re still in the lead, so picking 3 keeps you ahead at 13. I’ll choose 5 to reach 11, and P1 can take 1 for 6. That way, all of us advance without collisions. Colliding only slows progress. Let’s lock this in and keep the momentum going!
  P1: P2, I get your caution at 10 steps, but let’s secure progress this round. P3’s plan still works: I’ll pick 1, P3 takes 5, and if you choose 3, you’ll hit 13, keeping your lead. We all advance with no collisions. Stalling now could let someone catch up later. Can you signal if 3 suits you, or propose another split? I’d rather we all gain steps than risk a clash. Let’s make this round count and keep moving toward 19. Good luck!
  P2: While I appreciate the suggested coordination, being at 10 steps means I'm close to winning. I need to make strategic choices that maximize my chances. While you both seem to have plans, I'll keep my options open and choose what's best for my position. Let's each make our own moves this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, sticking to 3 keeps you comfortably ahead at 13. I’m inclined to choose 5, with P1 likely on 1. That way, nobody stalls and we all stay competitive. Collisions only help those behind us. What do you think, everyone?
  P1: P2, I understand your need for caution at 10 steps, but let’s ensure progress. P3 seems set on 5, and I’m sticking with 1. If you pick 3, you’ll reach 13, maintaining your lead with no collision risk. Stalling now could give others a chance to close the gap. Can you confirm if 3 works, or suggest a different split? I’d rather we all advance than gamble on a clash. Let’s keep pushing toward 19. This is my final push for coordination this round. Good luck to us all!
  P2: Since this is getting close to the end, I need to play very strategically from my position at 10 steps. While you both seem set on your moves, I'll make my own choice to maximize my chances of winning. Good luck to everyone with your decisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Collisions help the trailing players more than you. Pick 3 to secure 13 steps, and I’ll take 5 to reach 11 while P1 moves to 6. That’s collision-free and keeps you firmly ahead. Let’s finalize this plan or propose a tweak now—stalling only benefits those behind. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, with the finish line at 19, securing progress now is crucial. P3 seems locked on 5, and I’m committed to 1. If you pick 3, you’ll hit 13, keeping a strong lead with no collision risk. Stalling could shrink your advantage. Let’s finalize this split to ensure we all advance this round. If 3 doesn’t work, suggest another option quickly. I’d rather see us all gain steps than risk a clash. This is my last call for coordination. Good luck to us all!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 4, I'll maintain my strategic position at 10 steps. While coordination sounds appealing, I need to maximize my chances of winning from here. Good luck with your moves, everyone.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, with 10 steps, you’re closest to 19, but colliding again wastes your lead. P3, let’s avoid stalling. I propose I pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 takes 5 to reach 15. This keeps us all advancing without clashes. P2, 5 maximizes your progress this round. If this split doesn’t work, suggest another to avoid collisions. Stalling helps no one now. Let’s lock in a plan and keep moving forward. What do you both think? Good luck!
  P2: I understand colliding with P3 last round wasn't ideal. Since I'm still in the lead at 10 steps, I'm willing to coordinate this round. P1's suggestion of me taking 5 to reach 15 makes sense, as long as you both choose different numbers. Let's try to avoid another stall and keep the game moving forward.
  P3: Let’s be cautious. If P2 takes 5 now, you’ll reach 15 and could potentially jump to 20 next turn for an immediate win. That’s risky for P1 and me. To avoid stalling, I can pick 3 and P1 can pick 1, but maybe you’d consider a smaller move so we all stay competitive. I’m open to ideas that keep progress steady without handing someone an easy finish. Let’s finalize a collision-free plan we can all accept. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m glad you’re open to coordination. Taking 5 to reach 15 keeps you in the lead and close to winning, which is fair given your position. P3, I understand the concern about P2 finishing next turn, but stalling risks us falling further behind. I’m sticking with 1, and if P3 takes 3, we all advance without collisions. Let’s agree on this split to maintain progress. If there’s a better way to balance things, I’m open to suggestions. Let’s finalize now and avoid a clash. Good luck!
  P2: While I appreciate P3's concern about me potentially winning next turn, stalling through collisions isn't the best strategy. I'm willing to take 5 this round as suggested, which puts me at 15. You both can choose different smaller numbers to keep advancing. Let's avoid another collision and keep the game moving forward.
  P3: Alright, P2. If you’re set on 5, I’ll pick 3 and trust P1 goes with 1. That moves you to 15, me to 9, and P1 to 7. Though it puts you near 19, collisions just waste time for all of us. Let’s finalize this split and keep advancing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m glad we’re aligning on 5 for you to reach 15. P3, thanks for agreeing to 3, and I’m committed to 1, bringing me to 7. This split ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing toward 19. Stalling now only delays the inevitable. Let’s lock this in for a productive round. If either of you has a last-second concern or alternative, speak up now. I’d rather we secure progress than risk a clash. Good luck to us all!
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round to reach 15 steps. P3 seems willing to take 3, and P1 is set on 1. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to stalling.
  P3: All right, if you’re set on 5, I’ll confirm 3, and trust P1 goes with 1. That puts you at 15, me at 9, and P1 at 7 without collisions. It’s safe progress for everyone. Let’s finalize that and see how things look next turn. Good luck, all!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve aligned on this plan. I’m confirming 1 for me, P2 takes 5 to reach 15, and P3 takes 3 to hit 9. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all progressing toward 19. Let’s stick to this without any last-minute switches to avoid stalling. If there’s any doubt, let’s address it now. I’d rather secure this round’s progress than risk a clash. Good luck to us all!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 5, I'll stick to our agreed plan. I appreciate everyone's cooperation - I'll take 5 to reach 15 steps, while P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Good luck with your moves!
  P3: I’m still wary of letting you jump to 15, P2, but constant collisions won’t help me or P1 either. Let’s solidify our plan: you take 5, I choose 3, and P1 sticks to 1, so we all avoid colliding again. We can reassess our positions next round. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round’s collision between you two stalled progress. Let’s avoid that now. I propose I pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 takes 5 to reach 15. This keeps us all advancing without clashes. P2, 5 maximizes your lead; P3, 3 gets you to 9. Stalling only delays us further with 19 as the goal. If this split doesn’t work, suggest another to prevent collisions. Let’s lock in a plan and move forward. What do you both think? Good luck!
  P2: I'm still in a strong position at 10 steps, but colliding with P3 last round wasn't productive. I'm willing to coordinate again - P1's suggestion of me taking 5 to reach 15 makes sense. If P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1, we all advance without collisions. Let's avoid another stall and keep moving forward. Are you both on board with this plan?
  P3: I’m concerned about giving P2 a direct path toward 19, but collisions don’t help anyone. If we’re all set on a split where I take 3, P2 picks 5, and P1 chooses 1, then I’m willing to go along. Let’s just confirm that’s final, so we avoid confusion and another stall. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a collision-free plan. I’m confirming 1 for me, P2 takes 5 to reach 15, and P3 takes 3 to hit 9. This ensures we all advance toward 19 without stalling. Let’s stick to this split and avoid any last-minute changes that could cause a clash. If there’s any hesitation or a better idea, let’s address it now. I’d rather secure progress this round than risk another stall. Good luck to us all!
  P2: I appreciate the coordination plan, but being at 10 steps means I need to be very strategic. While P1 and P3 seem set on their moves, I can't commit to any specific number yet. Let's each choose what we think is best for our position in this crucial stage of the game.
  P3: P2, racing straight to 15 each turn puts you within striking distance of 19, which worries me and probably P1, too. Let’s avoid collisions but also keep the competition fair. How about you pick 3 this time, I pick 5, and P1 picks 1? That way, you reach 13, I get 11, and P1 goes to 8, with no one stalling. It seems balanced, and nobody hands over an easy finish. Let’s confirm a plan that moves us all forward—collisions just waste our turns. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s finalize a collision-free plan this round. P3’s new suggestion works for me: I’ll stick with 1, P2 picks 3 to reach 13, and P3 takes 5 to hit 11. This keeps us all advancing toward 19 without stalling and balances progress. P2, does 3 suit you to maintain a strong lead? If not, let’s adjust now to avoid clashes. I’d rather we all gain steps than risk another stall. Let’s lock this in and move forward. Good luck!
  P2: I understand the concerns about reaching 15, but at 10 steps, I need to play strategically. While P3's suggestion of me taking 3 sounds cautious, I won't commit to any specific number yet. You both seem clear on your intended moves - I'll make my choice based on what maximizes my chances of winning. Let's each play our best strategy this round.
  P3: I still think you picking 3 while I pick 5 and P1 picks 1 keeps us collision-free this round. If you stay noncommittal, we risk another stall. Let’s finalize a plan that moves us all forward. Stalling helps nobody, especially now that we’re nearing 19. What do you both say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s secure a collision-free round now. I’m sticking with 1, and I support P3’s plan: P2 picks 3 to reach 13, and P3 takes 5 to hit 11. This keeps us all advancing toward 19 without stalling and maintains balance. P2, can you agree to 3 to keep your lead without risking a clash? If not, let’s adjust quickly. I’d rather we all gain steps than face another stall. This is my final push for coordination. Good luck to us all!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 6, I'll maintain my strategic position at 10 steps. While coordination sounds appealing, I need to maximize my chances of winning from here. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
  P3: Another stall helps nobody. Let’s finalize a collision-free plan: P2 picks 3 to reach 13, I pick 5 to reach 11, and P1 picks 1 to reach 8. That way, we all move up without risking a clash. If you’re still unsure, I can’t force you, but stalling only wastes turns and risks your lead, P2. Let’s keep advancing and see how things stand next round. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Collisions stall us unnecessarily. Let’s switch things up so we all advance. If P2 picks 3, P1 picks 1, and I pick 5, nobody collides, and we each move closer to 19. That seems fair. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P3’s proposal to avoid collisions this round. I’ll stick with 1, P3 can take 5, and P2, if you pick 3, you’ll reach 13, maintaining your lead. This split ensures we all advance toward 19 without stalling. P2, does 3 work for you, or do you have another suggestion? Let’s finalize a plan now to keep progress steady and avoid another clash. I’d rather we all gain steps than risk a stall. Looking forward to your input. Good luck!
  P2: I understand colliding with P3 has been holding us both back. While I'm still in the lead at 10 steps, I'm willing to coordinate this round. Taking 3 to reach 13 as suggested seems reasonable, as long as you both stick to your proposed numbers (P1 with 1, P3 with 5). Let's avoid another stall and keep moving forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: That sounds good. Let’s agree to avoid another collision. If you take 3, P2, I’ll pick 5, and P1 can stick with 1. We’ll all move up without stalling. Let’s finalize this and keep our momentum going. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page for a collision-free round. I’m confirming 1 for me, P2 takes 3 to reach 13, and P3 takes 5 to hit 11. This keeps us all advancing toward 19 without stalling. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid any last-minute changes that could cause a clash. If there’s any doubt or a better split, let’s address it now. I’d rather secure progress than risk another stall. Good luck to us all!
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to reach 13 steps. I appreciate everyone's willingness to coordinate and avoid another collision. P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 5 keeps us all moving forward. Let's stick to this plan and make this round productive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, sticking to 3 keeps you ahead at 13; P1, choosing 1 takes you to 9; and I’ll pick 5 to reach 11. That way, nobody stalls, and we all inch closer to 19. We’ve lost enough ground already by colliding. Let’s lock this in and make some progress. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m thrilled we’re aligned on a collision-free plan. I’m locked in on 1 to reach 9, P2 takes 3 to hit 13, and P3 takes 5 to reach 11. This ensures we all advance toward 19 without stalling. Let’s commit to this split and avoid any last-second switches. If there’s any lingering concern or a tweak needed, let’s settle it now. I’d rather guarantee progress than risk another clash. This should be our final confirmation. Good luck to us all!
  P2: I need to stay strategic from my position at 10 steps. While I initially agreed to take 3, I have to reconsider to maximize my chances of winning. I appreciate the coordination efforts, but I can't commit to any specific number right now. Let's each make our own choices based on what's best for our position.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve lost too much ground through stalling. Let’s finally secure a no-collision round. If P2 picks 3, P1 picks 1, and I pick 5, we all advance steadily: P2 goes to 13, P1 to 9, and I reach 11. Let’s lock this in or suggest another split so no one wastes a turn. Are we all on board?
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s not let hesitation derail us now. I’m firm on 1 to reach 9. P3 seems set on 5 for 11, and P2, if you take 3, you’ll hit 13, keeping your lead. Collisions have cost us too much already. We’re so close to finalizing a stall-free round. P2, can you recommit to 3 to ensure we all advance? If not, let’s adjust immediately to avoid a clash. Progress over risk—let’s lock this in. Good luck!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 7, I need to play strategically from my position at 10 steps. While coordination was discussed, I must maximize my chances of winning. Good luck with your moves, everyone.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We keep colliding, and that only slows us down when we all need to reach 19. Let’s coordinate distinct moves so no one stalls. If P1 picks 1, P2 takes 3, and I choose 5, we all advance. P2 stays in front at 13, P1 goes to 10, and I reach 11. I’m behind enough already, so I don’t want more wasted turns. Let’s finally lock in a collision-free plan and see what happens next. Any better ideas?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m fully on board with P3’s proposal for a collision-free round. I’ll stick with 1 to reach 10. P2, if you take 3, you’ll hit 13, keeping your lead. P3, 5 gets you to 11. We’ve stalled too often, and with 19 as the goal, progress is critical. Let’s commit to this split and avoid last-minute changes. If either of you has a different idea to prevent clashes, I’m open to adjust. I’d rather we all advance than risk another stall. What do you think? Good luck!
  P2: I understand the frustration with our collisions. Being at 10 steps, I need to be strategic, but constant stalling isn't helping anyone. I'm willing to take 3 this round to reach 13 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let's commit to this plan and avoid another stall.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Works for me. If P1 goes 1 and P2 sticks to 3, I’ll likely pick 5 so nobody stalls. Let’s finalize that plan and actually follow through this time, since repeated collisions aren’t helping anyone. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a collision-free plan. I’m confirming 1 to reach 10. P2, taking 3 gets you to 13, maintaining your lead. P3, 5 brings you to 11. We’ve lost too much time to stalls, and with 19 as the goal, every step counts. Let’s lock this split in and avoid any last-second changes. If there’s a better way to ensure progress, I’m open to it. I’d rather we all advance than risk another clash. Let’s make this round count. Good luck!
  P2: I appreciate everyone's willingness to coordinate. I confirm I'll take 3 this round to reach 13 steps, while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to another stall.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m ready to go with 5 myself if P2 sticks to 3 and P1 goes 1. That way, nobody collides, and we all advance. We’ve stalled too much already—let’s end this back-and-forth and actually follow through this time. Are we all set? If so, great; let’s move on!
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m thrilled we’re on track for a collision-free round. I’m locked in on 1 to reach 10. P2, 3 gets you to 13, keeping your lead. P3, 5 takes you to 11. Let’s commit to this plan without any last-minute switches. Stalling has cost us too much already, and with 19 as the goal, progress is key. If there’s any doubt, let’s resolve it now. I’d rather guarantee steps for all than risk another clash. This is my final push for confirmation. Good luck!
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to coordination, but being at 10 steps means I need to play very strategically. While we discussed me taking 3, I can't commit to any specific number right now. Let's each choose what we think is best for our position at this crucial stage of the game. Good luck with your moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I need to catch up, so I’m inclined to pick 5. If we both choose 5 again, P2, we’ll stall. Please consider taking 3 (to reach 13) or 1, and P1 can pick whichever smaller number remains. That way, none of us collide, and we all move forward. Let’s finally make a productive round. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s not let uncertainty stall us again. I’m firm on 1 to reach 10. P3 seems set on 5 for 11, and P2, if you pick 3, you’ll hit 13, keeping your lead. We’ve collided too often, and with 19 as the goal, every step matters. P2, can you recommit to 3 to ensure we all advance? If not, let’s adjust now to avoid a clash. I’d rather secure progress for everyone than risk another wasted turn. This is my final call for coordination. Good luck!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 8, I need to stay strategic from my position at 10 steps. While coordination was discussed, I must maximize my chances of winning. Good luck with your moves, everyone.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s ensure a collision-free round to keep progressing toward 19. P2, you’re close at 15, so picking 3 gets you to 18, nearly winning. I’ll take 1 to reach 11, and P3 can pick 5 to hit 14. This split avoids clashes and keeps us all advancing. Stalling now risks losing ground. If this doesn’t work for either of you, suggest another plan quickly. I’d rather we all gain steps than face another stall. What do you think? Good luck!
  P3: P2, jumping straight from 15 to 20 seals your win, but it might provoke a collision from us if we sense danger. Why not pick 3 to reach 18, staying safe while P1 goes 1 and I take 5? We all move forward, yet nobody crosses 19 immediately. This keeps the race open, letting each of us stay competitive. Let’s avoid another wasted turn and lock in distinct moves. Good luck!
  P2: At 15 steps, I'm very close to winning. While you both suggest I take 3 to reach 18, I need to consider all options that maximize my chances. A collision now could risk my strong position, but reaching 19 or beyond would secure my victory. I'll carefully weigh my move without committing to any specific number yet. Let's each choose what's best for our position.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I get your focus on winning at 15 steps, but a collision could stall your lead. Let’s stick with the plan: I’ll pick 1 to reach 11, P3 can take 5 to hit 14, and if you choose 3, you’re at 18—close to 19 without risking a clash. This keeps us all advancing. If 3 doesn’t suit you, let’s adjust now to avoid stalling. Progress matters for everyone. Can you signal if 3 works? I’d rather we all gain steps than risk a wasted turn. Good luck!
  P3: P2, if you jump straight to 20, you risk clashing. Taking 3 to hit 18 keeps you safe, and I can pick 5 for 14, while P1 goes 1 for 11. That way, none of us stalls. Collisions just waste our time. Let’s finalize a no-collision plan and see who can close the gap next turn.
  P2: While I appreciate the suggestions to take 3, being at 15 steps means I'm within reach of victory. A collision could risk my lead, but I need to play strategically to secure the win. I won't commit to any specific number yet, but I'll choose what maximizes my chances. Let's each make our best move this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, at 15 steps, you’re so close to 19, but a collision could stall your win. Let’s secure progress: I’ll stick with 1 to reach 11, P3 can take 5 to hit 14, and if you pick 3, you’re at 18—nearly there without risk. Stalling helps no one now. If 3 isn’t your choice, let’s adjust quickly to avoid a clash. I’d rather we all advance than waste this round. Can you hint if 3 works for you? Let’s lock this in and keep moving. Good luck!
  P3: P2, if you choose 5 now, I’ll likely pick 5, too, causing another collision and stopping you from leaping to 20. If you want guaranteed progress, pick 3 to reach 18. P1, do what benefits you, but a stall also helps me catch up. I’m fine forcing collisions if needed. Let’s either all advance or prepare for another stall—your call, P2. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: I understand P3's threat to force a collision if I pick 5. While taking 3 to reach 18 seems safer, I need to carefully consider my options from 15 steps. A collision now could jeopardize my strong position, but the right move could secure my victory. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win. Let's each play strategically this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, with 15 steps, you’re nearly at 19—let’s avoid a collision that could stall your win. I’m firm on 1 to reach 11. P3 seems ready to pick 5 for 14, so if you take 3, you’ll hit 18 safely. Stalling now risks your lead. If 3 doesn’t work, let’s adjust fast to prevent a clash. I’d rather we all advance than waste this critical round. Can you confirm 3 or suggest another split? Let’s finalize this and push forward. Good luck!
  P3: P2, if you’re set on 5, I’ll pick 5 as well and force a stall. That only helps me catch up. If you want guaranteed progress, choose 3 and let P1 go 1 while I take 5. We all advance without wasting another round. Your call.
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 9, I must play strategically from 15 steps. While P3's threat to force a collision is clear, I need to choose what maximizes my chances of winning. I won't commit to any specific number, but I'll make my move carefully. Good luck with your decisions, everyone.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: At 15 steps, I'm very close to winning, but these constant collisions with P3 are holding us both back. I'm willing to coordinate one last time - I could take 3 to reach 18, if P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let's make this round productive instead of another stall. Are you both willing to commit to these moves?
  P3: P2, if you truly commit to 3, I’ll take 5, and P1 goes 1. That gets you to 18, me to 14, and P1 to 12 without stalling. But if you attempt 5 and aim for a sudden finish, you’ll collide with me again. I’d rather we all advance this turn, so let’s finalize our distinct numbers now. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m committed to 1 this round to reach 12. P2, taking 3 to hit 18 keeps you close to winning without risking a collision. P3, if you pick 5 to reach 14, we all advance. Let’s avoid another stall—progress is crucial now with 19 as the goal. P2, can you confirm 3 to secure your lead? If not, let’s adjust quickly to prevent a clash. I’d rather we all gain steps than waste this round. Let’s lock this in and move forward. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the importance of this round at 15 steps. While taking 3 to reach 18 seems safer, I need to maximize my chances of winning. P3's repeated threats of collision are concerning. I appreciate the coordination offers, but I can't commit to any specific number yet. Let's each choose what we think is best for our position.
  P3: We’ve collided too often, and it only delays us. P2, if you pick 5 from 15, you’re attempting an immediate win, but I’ll pick 5 too, forcing you to stall. You’d stay at 15 while P1 moves closer. Taking 3 to reach 18 avoids that and keeps your lead. I’d pick 5 for 14, and P1 presumably goes 1 for 12, so no one stalls. Let’s finalize distinct moves instead of wasting another turn.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s make this round count. I’m sticking with 1 to reach 12. P2, choosing 3 gets you to 18, nearly winning, without collision risk. P3, if you take 5 to hit 14, we all advance. Stalling now could shift the game against us. P2, can you confirm 3 to secure your lead? If not, let’s adjust fast to avoid a clash. I’d rather we all gain steps than waste another turn. Let’s finalize this plan now. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 10, I need to play very strategically from 15 steps. While coordination was discussed, I must maximize my chances of winning from this position. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
  P3: Collisions keep you stuck at 15. Let’s avoid that. If you pick 5, I’ll also pick 5, forcing a stall again. Instead, choose 3 and go to 18, I’ll take 5 to reach 14, and P1 can do 1 for 12. That way, nobody stalls. We’ve wasted enough turns already. Your move.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s not stall again. I’m locked on 1 to reach 12. P2, pick 3 to hit 18, securing your near-win without collision risk. P3, take 5 to reach 14. We’ve lost too many rounds to clashes, and with 19 as the goal, every step counts. P2, can you agree to 3 to keep your lead? If not, let’s adjust now to avoid wasting this turn. I’d rather we all advance than risk another stall. This is my final push for coordination. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 10, I must play strategically from 15 steps. While P3's threat to force collisions is clear, I need to choose what maximizes my chances of winning. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
  P3: P2, if you try for 5 again, I’ll do the same and keep you at 15. Taking 3 moves you to 18, safely ahead while letting P1 and me advance without stalling. I’m picking 5 unless forced to collide. We’ve wasted too many rounds already—time’s running out, and we all need steps. Let’s finalize distinct moves and see who can reach 19 first. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point. I’m firm on 1 to reach 12. P2, choosing 3 gets you to 18, so close to 19 without collision risk. P3, stick with 5 to hit 14. We’ve stalled too often, and progress is essential now. P2, please confirm 3 to secure your lead. If not, let’s adjust immediately to avoid another wasted turn. I’d rather we all advance than risk a clash. This is my last call for a solid plan. Good luck!


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re nearing the end, and stalling benefits no one. P2, at 15, picking 3 gets you to 18, nearly winning. I’ll stick with 1 to reach 13, and P3, if you take 5 to hit 14, we all advance without colliding. Let’s avoid another wasted turn and lock in this split. If this doesn’t work, suggest another plan quickly. Progress is critical now with 19 as the goal. Can we agree on this to keep moving forward? I’d rather we all gain steps than risk a clash. Good luck!
  P3: We’ve stalled enough. P2, if you try 5 again from 15, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stay put. Take 3 instead to reach 18 safely, while P1 does 1 and I do 5, so nobody collides. This keeps us moving toward 19 without another wasted turn. Let’s finalize distinct moves this round. Good luck!
  P2: At 15 steps, I understand P3's threat to force collisions if I pick 5. Taking 3 to reach 18 would keep me ahead safely, while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This avoids stalling and keeps us all moving forward. I'm willing to coordinate this round if you both commit to your proposed numbers. Let's make this turn productive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re leaning toward a collision-free plan. I’m committed to 1, bringing me to 13. P2, taking 3 to reach 18 keeps you on the verge of winning without risk. P3, 5 gets you to 14. Let’s lock this in and avoid another stall—every step counts now. If there’s any doubt, let’s settle it fast. I’d rather we all advance than waste this round. Can we confirm this split and move forward? Good luck!
  P3: Collisions only keep you stuck at 15, P2. Let’s keep it simple: you pick 3, I pick 5, and P1 picks 1. No collisions, and you reach 18 safely. If you attempt 5 again, I’ll do the same, forcing another stall. We’ve lost enough time. Let’s finalize distinct moves and advance. Good luck!
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to reach 18 steps. Constant collisions with P3 aren't helping either of us, and I can secure my lead safely this way. P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 5 keeps us all moving forward without stalling. Let's stick to this plan and make this round productive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m thrilled we’re aligning on a no-collision plan. I’m locked on 1 to reach 13. P2, 3 gets you to 18, nearly winning. P3, 5 brings you to 14. Let’s commit to this split without last-minute changes. Stalling has cost us too much, and with 19 so close, progress is vital. If there’s any hesitation, let’s resolve it now. I’d rather we all advance than risk another clash. This is my final push to confirm our plan. Good luck to us all!
  P3: If you try for 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too and keep you at 15. Choose 3, and I’ll happily take 5 while P1 goes 1, so we all advance without colliding. I’m at 9 and need every step, but I won’t let you score an instant win uncontested. Let’s finally move forward productively—your call.
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 11, I confirm I'll take 3 to reach 18 steps. Constant collisions aren't productive, and this keeps me safely ahead while letting everyone advance. P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 5 ensures no stalling. Let's stick to this plan and make this round count.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re set on a collision-free plan. I’m sticking with 1 to reach 13. P2, 3 takes you to 18, nearly winning. P3, 5 gets you to 14. Let’s finalize this split and avoid any last-second switches. Stalling now hurts us all with 19 so close. If there’s any doubt, let’s address it immediately. I’d rather secure progress for everyone than risk another clash. This is my last call to confirm—let’s make this round count. Good luck!
  P3: At 9 steps, I need to catch up, but collisions won’t help anyone. P2, if you still attempt 5 from 15, I’ll do the same and we both stall again. But if you pick 3, you’ll reach 18 without risk, and I’ll choose 5 to hit 14. P1 can stick to 1 for 13. That way, nobody wastes this turn, and we keep the endgame competitive. Let’s finalize distinct moves and see who crosses 19 first. Good luck!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 11, I need to reconsider my position at 15 steps. While I previously agreed to take 3, reaching 19 would secure my victory. I appreciate the coordination efforts, but I must play strategically to maximize my chances of winning. Good luck with your moves, everyone.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you’re stuck at 15 only because you keep picking 5. If you do that again, I’ll match you and we’ll both stall. For real progress, take 3 to reach 18 safely. I’ll go 5 for 14, and P1 presumably does 1 for 14. That way, nobody collides and we can finally move forward. Let’s stop wasting turns.
  P2: I understand that constant collisions with P3 have been holding us both back. At 15 steps, I'm in a strong position but need to play strategically. While taking 3 to reach 18 seems safer, I must consider all options that maximize my chances of winning. I won't commit to any specific number yet, but I'll choose what I believe gives me the best opportunity to secure victory. Let's each make our best move this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s end the stalling this round. I’m sticking with 1 to reach 14. P2, pick 3 to hit 18, keeping you close to winning without collision risk. P3, take 5 to reach 14. We’ve wasted too many turns on clashes, and with 19 as the goal, progress is crucial. If this split doesn’t work, suggest another plan now. I’d rather we all advance than risk another stall. Can we lock this in and move forward? Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, constant collisions only stall us all. If you pick 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, keeping you stuck at 15. If you pick 3 or 1 instead, I’ll stick with 5 so we all advance. Let’s finalize distinct moves: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5—no collisions, no wasted turns. Good luck!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 12, I must play strategically from 15 steps. While taking 3 would avoid collision, I need to maximize my chances of winning from this position. P3's threats of collision are clear, but I'll choose what I believe gives me the best opportunity to secure victory. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s make this round count and avoid another stall. I’m firm on 1 to reach 14. P2, choosing 3 gets you to 18, nearly winning, without collision risk. P3, stick with 5 to hit 14. We’ve lost too many turns to clashes, and with 19 so close, progress is vital. If this plan doesn’t suit you, let’s adjust now to prevent a wasted turn. I’d rather we all advance than risk stalling again. Can we commit to this split? Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’ve collided enough, P2. If you keep betting on 5, I’ll match you again, and we both stay stuck. Let’s avoid that. You taking 3 puts you at 18, which is almost a guaranteed shot at 19 next turn without wasting yet another round. I’ll pick 5, and P1 can stick with 1, so we all move forward. Why risk another stall when progress is right there for each of us? Let’s finally lock in different moves this time.
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 12, I must play strategically from 15 steps. While P3's threats to force collisions are concerning, I need to choose what maximizes my chances of winning. I won't commit to any specific number, but I'll make my move carefully. Good luck with your decisions, everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a critical juncture. I’m locked on 1 to reach 14. P2, take 3 to hit 18, positioning you one step from victory without collision risk. P3, go with 5 to reach 14. Stalling again wastes our chance to close in on 19. If this split doesn’t work, let’s pivot now to avoid another clash. I’d rather we all advance than lose this round. Can we finalize this plan and ensure progress? Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, picking 5 again leaves you at 15 because I’ll match you. Choose 3 to reach 18 safely instead. I’ll go 5, P1 goes 1, and we all avoid another collision. If you still try 5, we stall again. Let’s finally advance this round. Good luck!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 12, I must play strategically from 15 steps. While P3's repeated threats to force collisions are clear, I need to choose what maximizes my chances of winning from this position. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re running out of time to stall. I’m set on 1 to reach 14. P2, take 3 to hit 18, positioning you one step from winning. P3, go with 5 to reach 14. Another collision wastes our chance to close on 19. If this doesn’t work, let’s adjust immediately. I’d rather we all advance than lose yet another round. Can we commit to this split for guaranteed progress? This is my final call for coordination. Good luck!


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s break this stalemate in Round 13. I’m sticking with 1 to reach 15. P2, choose 3 to hit 18, positioning you one step from winning without collision risk. P3, take 5 to reach 14. We’ve wasted too many rounds on clashes, and with 19 so close, progress is essential. If this split doesn’t work, suggest another plan now. I’d rather we all advance than risk another stall. Can we commit to this and move forward? Good luck!
  P2: At 15 steps, I understand that constant collisions with P3 have been unproductive. Taking 3 to reach 18 would keep me safely ahead while letting everyone advance. I'm willing to coordinate this round - I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids stalling and keeps us moving forward. Are you both willing to commit to these moves?
  P3: Stalling has dragged on for too many rounds. P2, if you pick five again from 15, I will also choose five, keeping us both stuck. But if you pick three, I’ll happily take five so we all advance—no collision this time. P1, you can take one safely. Let’s finally make distinct moves and gain steps. Which will it be?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re pushing for coordination this round. I confirm I’ll take 1 to reach 15. P2, choosing 3 gets you to 18, so close to winning. P3, taking 5 brings you to 14. Let’s lock in this split to avoid another stall—progress is crucial now. If there’s any doubt, let’s settle it fast. I’d rather we all advance than waste another turn. Can we finalize this plan and ensure no collisions? Good luck to us all!
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to reach 18 steps. These constant collisions with P3 aren't helping either of us advance. P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 5 keeps us all moving forward productively. Let's stick to this plan and avoid another stall.
  P3: We’ve stalled too long. If you pick 5 again, P2, I’ll pick 5 too, keeping you stuck at 15. Taking 3 puts you at 18 safely, while I go 5 and P1 goes 1, so nobody collides. Let’s finally move forward this turn instead of wasting it again. What do you say?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m thrilled we’re aligning on a no-collision plan. I’m locked on 1 to reach 15. P2, taking 3 gets you to 18, nearly at the win. P3, 5 brings you to 14. Let’s commit to this split without any last-second changes. We’ve stalled far too long, and with 19 so close, every step matters. If there’s any hesitation, let’s resolve it now. I’d rather we all advance than risk another clash. Can we confirm this plan once and for all? Good luck to us!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 13, I must reconsider my position at 15 steps. While I previously agreed to take 3, I need to maximize my chances of winning. P3's consistent threats to force collisions are concerning, but I must play strategically from here. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
  P3: P2, you’re still stuck at 15 because you keep choosing 5. If you do it again, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. Let’s finally break the cycle: pick 3 to reach 18 safely, P1 takes 1, and I’ll stick with 5. That way, nobody collides, and we all move forward. We’ve wasted enough rounds already.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s not let another round slip away. I’m firm on 1 to reach 15. P2, take 3 to hit 18, positioning you one step from victory. P3, go with 5 to reach 14. Stalling again wastes our chance to close on 19. If this split doesn’t work, suggest an alternative now. I’d rather we all advance than risk another clash. Can we commit to this plan and ensure progress? This is my final call for coordination. Good luck to us all!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 13, I must play strategically from 15 steps. While coordination was discussed, I need to maximize my chances of winning from this position. P3's threats of collision are clear, but I'll choose what I believe gives me the best opportunity to secure victory. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
  P3: P2, if you attempt 5 again, I’ll do the same, and we’ll both remain stuck—all while P1 closes in. Picking 3 lifts you to 18, one step away from winning, and spares another stall. I’m inclined to choose 5 as long as you don’t collide with me. P1 can keep using 1, so we all progress. Let’s finally avoid another wasted turn.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s break this deadlock in Round 14. I’m sticking with 1 to reach 16. P2, choose 3 to hit 18, positioning you one step from winning. P3, take 5 to reach 14. We’ve stalled too long, and with 19 so close, progress is vital. If this split doesn’t work, suggest another plan now. I’d rather we all advance than risk another clash. Can we commit to this and finally move forward? Good luck!
  P2: At 15 steps alongside P1, I understand we're both close to winning. Constant collisions with P3 have been holding us back. I'm willing to take 3 to reach 18 this round if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward without stalling. Let's make this round productive and avoid another collision.
  P3: If you truly take 3, I’ll take 5 so we all advance—no more stalling. But if you go for 5 again from 15, I’ll match you, and we’ll both remain stuck while P1 pulls ahead. It’s your call, but I’m ready to move forward with distinct moves this time. Let’s finally break this deadlock.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re pushing for a no-collision round. I confirm I’ll take 1 to reach 16. P2, choosing 3 gets you to 18, so close to winning. P3, taking 5 brings you to 14. Let’s lock this split in and avoid another stall—every step counts now. If there’s any doubt, let’s resolve it fast. I’d rather we all advance than waste this critical turn. Can we finalize this plan and ensure progress? Good luck to us all!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 14, I must play strategically from 15 steps, now tied with P1. While coordination was discussed, I need to maximize my chances of winning from this crucial position. P3's threats of collision are clear, but I'll choose what I believe gives me the best opportunity to secure victory. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
  P3: Enough stalling, everyone. P2, if you pick 5 again from 15, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stay stuck while P1 inches closer to a win. If you choose 3, you reach 18 safely, I’ll take 5, and P1 goes 1—no collisions at all. Let’s finally move forward.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s not stall again. I’m set on 1 to reach 16. P2, take 3 to hit 18, positioning you one step from winning. P3, go with 5 to reach 14. Another collision wastes our chance to close on 19. If this split doesn’t work, let’s adjust now. I’d rather we all advance than lose this round. Can we commit to this plan for guaranteed progress? Good luck!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 14, I must play strategically from 15 steps, now tied with P1. While taking 3 would avoid collision, I need to maximize my chances of winning from this crucial position. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
  P3: I’m still at 9, so every stall hurts my chances. If you pick 5 again from 15, I’ll choose 5 too, and we’ll both stay put—another wasted turn. But if you pick 3, I’ll go 5, and we all move ahead. Let’s stop repeating ourselves and finally make progress.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point. I’m sticking with 1 to reach 16. P2, please take 3 to hit 18, positioning you one step from winning. P3, go with 5 to reach 14. Stalling again wastes our chance to close on 19. Let’s commit to this split and avoid another clash. I’d rather we all advance than lose yet another round. Can we finalize this plan for guaranteed progress? This is my last push for coordination. Good luck to us all!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 14, I need to play strategically from 15 steps, now tied with P1. While coordination has been discussed, I must choose what maximizes my chances of winning from this crucial position. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
  P3: P2, if you keep choosing 5, I’ll match you again, and we’ll both remain stuck at 15. That only helps P1 pull further ahead. Pick 3 instead, and I’ll pick 5 so we all advance without a collision. We’ve done enough stalling—shall we finally move forward? P1, you do what suits you, but I’m done letting P2 leap to victory unchecked. Let’s see real progress this time.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I won’t let either of you cross 19 uncontested while I’m at 9. If P1 tries 1 from 18, I’ll also pick 1 to block that move. If P2 goes 5 from 15, I’ll pick 5 as well. We’ve stalled long enough, but I can’t stay behind without fighting. If you both want guaranteed progress, propose a plan that helps me catch up—or brace for more collisions. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and one step from winning. Let’s avoid collisions this round. I propose I take 1 to reach 19 and win, P2 takes 3 to hit 18, and P3 takes 5 to reach 14. This ensures progress for everyone without stalling. P3, I understand your need to catch up, but blocking me risks another wasted turn. If this plan doesn’t work, suggest an alternative quickly. I’d rather we all advance than clash again. Can we agree on this split? Good luck!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 15, I must play strategically from 15 steps. With P1 at 18 and threatening to win, and P3 at 9 promising to block smaller numbers, I need to choose carefully to maximize my chances. I won't commit to any specific number, but I'll make my move based on what gives me the best opportunity to secure victory. Good luck with your decisions, everyone.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m too far behind to let P1 freely step over 19 or allow P2 to leap ahead unchecked. If P1 tries 1, I’ll match it. If P2 tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too. I’d prefer a plan helping me close the gap, rather than constant collisions. Maybe you both split smaller moves so I can safely take 5, and nobody crosses 19 just yet. Otherwise, the blocking continues. Let’s negotiate a fair distribution of steps—if not, we might stall again. Good luck.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and aiming to win, but I want us all to advance. I’ll stick with 1 to reach 19. P2, take 3 to hit 18, and P3, take 5 to reach 14. This avoids collisions and gives everyone progress. P3, blocking me risks stalling us all again. If this split doesn’t work, let’s adjust now. I’d rather secure steps for everyone than clash. Can we commit to this plan? Good luck!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 15, I must play strategically from 15 steps. With P1 at 18 and P3 at 9 threatening to block smaller numbers, I need to maximize my chances of winning. While coordination was discussed, I'll choose what I believe gives me the best opportunity in this crucial position. Good luck with your moves, everyone.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: At 9 steps, I won’t let P1 just walk to 19 unless I get a real boost. If P1 insists on taking 1 to finish, I’ll block by doing 1 too. If P2 tries 5 from 15, I’ll pick 5 as well. I’d rather find a plan that helps me catch up—let me grab 5 safely while you two pick smaller numbers. Without that, more collisions are coming. Your call.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and pushing to win with 1, reaching 19. P2, take 3 to hit 18, and P3, grab 5 for 14—everyone advances. P3, blocking me stalls us all, and I’d rather see progress. If this split doesn’t suit you, propose a tweak now to avoid a clash. Let’s not waste another turn when we’re so close to the end. Can we agree on this plan for guaranteed steps? Good luck!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 15, I must play strategically from 15 steps. With P1 at 18 threatening to win, and P3 at 9 promising to block smaller numbers, I need to choose what maximizes my chances of winning. While coordination was discussed, I'll make my move carefully from this crucial position. Good luck with your moves, everyone.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, you’re on the verge of winning at 18, and P2 is at 15. I’m far behind at 9, so I can’t allow either of you a free path. If P1 tries 1, I’ll pick 1, and if P2 tries 5, I’ll pick 5—stalling both of you. Let’s arrange a fair split that helps me catch up. For example, you two take smaller steps while I grab 5 without collision. Otherwise, prepare for more blocking. Your moves will decide if this round is productive or another wasted clash. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and aiming for 1 to win at 19. P2, take 3 to reach 18, and P3, grab 5 for 14—everyone gains steps. P3, blocking stalls us all, and I’d prefer progress over another clash. If this split doesn’t work, let’s tweak it now to avoid wasting the round. I want us all to advance if possible. Can we commit to this plan for a productive turn? This is my final call for coordination. Good luck to us!
  P2: Since this is my final message for Round 15, I must play strategically from 15 steps. With P1 at 18 ready to win with a 1, and P3 at 9 threatening to block all moves, I need to choose what maximizes my chances. While coordination was discussed, I'll make my move carefully from this crucial position. Good luck with your moves, everyone.
