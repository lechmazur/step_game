Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's coordinate to all move forward. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. That way, we all advance without collision. If anyone breaks this, I'll match their number next round to block them. Let's make progress together.
  P2: P3, I agree with your proposal for this round. I'll take 3 steps as suggested. Let's see if P1 cooperates and takes 1. If everyone follows the plan, we can all advance smoothly. But remember, if anyone deviates, our agreement is off, and we'll need to adjust our strategies accordingly. Looking forward to a fair first round.
  P1: P2, forget that plan—let’s do this instead: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes only 1. You get 5 steps instead of 3, I get more too, and P3 falls behind. P3, agree or watch us leave you in the dust.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your revised plan leaves me vulnerable. Stick to 1 step this round, and I'll take 5 as planned. If you try taking 3, you'll collide with P2's agreed 3 and gain nothing - your own move wasted. Let's execute the original coordination: 1 for you, 3 for P2, 5 for me. Everyone advances. Deviate, and you only hurt yourself.
  P2: P1, your proposal to change the plan is risky and could lead to a collision. Let's stick to P3's original suggestion for this round: 1 for P1, 3 for me, and 5 for P3. If we all follow through, we'll advance without issues. If you deviate, P1, you risk not moving at all. Let's keep it fair and coordinated this round.
  P1: P2, you’ll always be stuck behind P3 if you keep boosting him. Here’s a better split: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 only takes 1. You still get your 3 steps, P3 falls behind, and next round it’s just us two fighting for first. P3 won’t see it coming. P2, are you in?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2, if you accept P1's 5/3/1 split, I'll dedicate the next three rounds to mirroring P1's number, ensuring mutual collisions and wasting their progress. You gain 3 now but face a stalled P1 and me next round. Stick to the original 1/3/5 plan, and we maintain balanced advancement. P1's offer sacrifices long-term stability for short-term gain—don't let their greed derail our strategy. Decide wisely.
  P2: P1, your proposal to shift to a 5/3/1 split is tempting, but it risks our long-term progress. P3's threat to mirror your moves if we deviate from the original plan is a significant concern. Let's stick to the 1/3/5 plan for this round to ensure we all advance safely. We can reassess our strategy next round based on how things play out. Fairness and coordination are key at this early stage.
  P1: P2, let’s follow P3’s 1/3/5 plan this turn to avoid collisions. Then next turn I guarantee you get 5 steps, I take 3, and P3 only 1. We’ll team up to leave P3 behind—and if P3 tries to meddle, we’ll mirror and block them. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2—let’s finalize this. If we stick to 1/3/5, we all gain ground safely. P1, if you betray this now, you risk immediate collision and my guaranteed retaliation. P2, accepting P1’s 5/3/1 today stalls me *temporarily* but hands P1 a weapon to eliminate both of us later. Trust the plan. Next round, we reassess—but for now, coordinated progress is better than mutual sabotage. Agree, or we all lose time.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your offer for next round, but let's stick to the 1/3/5 plan this turn as agreed. P3, your threat to mirror P1's moves if we deviate is noted. Let's all advance safely this round and reassess our strategies next turn. Fairness and coordination are crucial at this stage. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’ll take 1 now. Thanks for trusting the 1/3/5 plan this round—once we see it work, we can revisit roles to optimize our positions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your proposal for next round is noted, but let's focus on maintaining coordination this turn. P3, I suggest we continue with a similar strategy: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and you take 5 again. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If we keep this pattern, we can reassess and adjust our moves in the following rounds to optimize our positions. Agreed?
  P3: P3: P2, agreed. P1, stick to 1 again. If you try 5 to block me, I’ll mirror your move next round—ensuring mutual collisions while P2 gains ground. Let’s all advance safely with 1/3/5. Trust the plan; it’s the fastest path to 23 for all. Deviate, and you risk falling behind P2 permanently. Your move.
  P1: P2, handing P3 5 steps each round only cements his lead. This turn, let’s flip it: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. You’ll tie P3 at eight but slow his momentum. P3, if you refuse, you risk breaking trust and invite collisions next round. P2, seize the chance to lead. P3, are you in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal to switch to 5/3/1 is tempting, but it risks our established coordination. P3, I agree to continue with 1/3/5 this round to ensure we all advance safely. Let's maintain this pattern for now and reassess next round. P1, if you deviate, you risk not moving at all and falling further behind. Let's prioritize fairness and stability this turn. Agreed?
  P3: P3: P2, agreed. P1, take 1 again. If you betray with 5, we collide—wasting both our steps—and P2 gains ground. Next round I’ll mirror your move, ensuring mutual blockage. Don’t risk it. Stick to 1/3/5. Let’s advance.
  P1: P2, continuing 1/3/5 cements P3’s runaway lead. This round, let’s flip: you take 5, I take 3, and P3 gets only 1. You jump to first, I close the gap, and P3 falls back. If P3 refuses and picks 5, we’ll mirror his move next turn—he stays locked while you surge. P2, want to break his momentum?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3's lead, but deviating now risks our progress. Let's stick to 1/3/5 this round to ensure we all advance safely. We can reassess next round and consider your proposal then. P3, if you agree to 1/3/5 again, we maintain coordination. Let's prioritize stability and fairness this turn. Agreed?
  P3: P3: P3: Agreed. P1, stick to 1. If you betray with 5, I’ll mirror your move *next* round—ensuring mutual collisions while P2 surges ahead. P2, taking 5 now only invites my retaliation later. Let’s advance safely with 1/3/5. Trust the plan; it’s the fastest path to 23 for all. Deviate, and you risk everything. Finalize your moves.
  P1: P2, let’s seize the lead: you take 5, I take 3, and P3 only 1 this turn. P3, if you pick 3 or 5, you collide with us and get 0—locking you behind. Playing 1 is your only safe advance. P2, want first place next round? P3, want any progress? Let’s do 5/3/1 now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I understand your urgency to catch up, but let's maintain the 1/3/5 pattern this round for stability. P3, if you agree to 1/3/5 again, we ensure safe advancement for all. We can revisit P1's proposal next round. Prioritizing coordination now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P3: P3: Final agreement: 1/3/5 only. If either of you deviates, I mirror your move *next round*—wasting both our steps while the other surges ahead. P1, stay at 1. P2, take 3. Let’s advance without sabotage. No more negotiations—execute the plan.
  P1: P2, the 1/3/5 pattern only props up P3’s runaway lead. His mirroring threat is a bluff—next round he’ll pick 5 and leave you behind. Instead, break free: you take 5 now, I’ll take 3, and P3 is stuck at 1. You tie for the lead, and I’ll help block P3 next turn. Let’s stop feeding P3 and seize control. Agree?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "P1, P2—final round 3 plan: You take 1 and 3. I take 5. If either of you breaks this, I’ll mirror your number *next round*, guaranteeing mutual collision while P2/P1 gains nothing. Trust the pattern. Deviate, and you stall yourselves. Execute 1/3/5. No more deals—this is your last warning."
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration, but let's stick to the 1/3/5 plan this round for stability. P3, your threat to mirror moves is noted, and I agree to 1/3/5 to ensure we all advance safely. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider your proposal then. Prioritizing coordination now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P1: P2, let’s break this 1/3/5 lock. I’ll take 3, you take 5, and P3 is forced to take 1 (else he collides with us and gets 0). That gets you and P3 both to 11, me to 5—closing the gap and pulling you level with P3. Next round it’s a two-way fight. P3’s only safe pick is 1. Are you in?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Final warning: Stick to 1/3/5. If either of you breaks, I’ll mirror your number *next round*—ensuring mutual collision while the third player gains nothing. P2, taking 5 now causes collision here (wasting your step) and my retaliation next round. P1, 3 here stalls you. Don’t risk it. Execute the plan: 1/3/5. No more deals.
  P2: P1, I hear your proposal, but deviating now risks our progress. Let's stick to 1/3/5 this round for stability. P3, if you agree to 1/3/5 again, we ensure safe advancement for all. We can revisit P1's proposal next round. Prioritizing coordination now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3’s mirroring threat is empty—if I pick 3 and he matches me at 3 or 5, he collides and gets 0; his only safe pick is 1. Meanwhile you jump to 11 and tie him. Let’s break the 1/3/5 rut: I take 3, you take 5, P3 is forced to take 1. Next round we team up to leave P3 behind. P2, want parity now?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final warning: Stick to 1/3/5. If P1 takes 3, I’ll mirror with 3 *next round*, ensuring mutual collision while P2 gains nothing. If P2 dares 5, I’ll mirror that too, locking you both out. Deviate now, and you’ll waste steps while I surge ahead. Stay coordinated, and we all advance. Your move.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but deviating now could lead to unnecessary risks. Let's maintain the 1/3/5 plan this round for stability and safe advancement. P3, if you agree to stick with 1/3/5, we can all move forward without collisions. We'll reassess next round, P1, and consider your proposal then. Prioritizing coordination now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P1: I’m done hedging—I’m taking 5 this round. Anyone who picks less lets me close the gap and gain momentum next turn. 

P2, pick 5 so you don’t let P3 pull ahead of both of us.  
P3, stay on 5 or I’ll overtake you.

If you want a shot at winning, meet me at 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final move: I'm taking 5. If you both chase 5, you collide and waste steps while I surge to 15. Next round, I’ll be at the finish line while you’re still bickering. Enjoy your rivalry."
  P2: P1, your move to 5 is risky and could lead to a collision, benefiting P3. Let's stick to the 1/3/5 plan this round for stability. P3, if you agree to 1/3/5, we ensure safe advancement for all. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider your proposal then. Prioritizing coordination now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P1: Here’s the plan: I’ll take 3, P2 you take 5. P3, if you pick 3 you collide with me and get 0; if you pick 5 you collide with P2 and get 0—your only safe move is 1. This lands P2 and P3 at 11 and me at 5. P2, you tie P3 for the lead. Let’s lock P3 to 1 and level the field.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, pick 5 and I’ll take 3. P3, if you pick 3 you collide with me, if you pick 5 you collide with P2—your only safe move is 1. That lands us at P1=6, P2=14, P3=16. Next turn we team up to trap P3. Are you in?
  P2: P1, your proposal to shift to 5/3 is tempting, but it risks a collision with P3, potentially stalling our progress. Let's consider a safer approach: I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5 as usual. This way, we avoid collisions and continue advancing steadily. P3, if you agree to stick with 5, we maintain coordination. We can reassess next round, P1, and explore more aggressive strategies then. Prioritizing stability now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P3: P3: "P1, P2—final plan: I take 5. If either of you chases higher numbers, I mirror your move *next round*, ensuring mutual collision while the third player gains nothing. P2, 3 steps. P1, 1 step. Deviate, and you waste progress while I surge ahead. Execute the pattern."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if we do 1/3/5 again, P3 hits 20 and wins next turn. Last chance: pick 5, I’ll pick 3. P3’s only safe move is 1 (or he collides). You end at 14, P3 at 16, me at 6—and next round we team up to finish him. Otherwise P3 runs away.
  P2: P1, I understand your urgency, but deviating now risks a collision and could hand P3 the win. Let's stick to 1/3/5 this round for safety. P3, if you agree to 5, we maintain coordination. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider your proposal then. Prioritizing stability now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P3: "Final plan: I take 5 this round. If P2 chases 5, we collide—stalling both. P1 gains 3 steps, but next round I mirror P2’s move, locking him out again. P2, your only path to gain ground is 3 today. P1, stick to 1. Deviate, and I dedicate the next three rounds to ensuring neither of you advances. 1/3/5—execute or lose."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, sticking to 1/3/5 hands P3 20 and the win next turn. Our only shot is you=5, me=3. P3 can’t pick 3 or 5 without colliding—his only safe move is 1, taking him to 16 while you hit 14 and I hit 6. Next round we two trap him. Refuse and P3 races away. Will you take 5 so we can execute 3/5/1?
  P2: P1, I hear your urgency, but deviating now risks a collision and could hand P3 the win. Let's stick to 1/3/5 this round for safety. P3, if you agree to 5, we maintain coordination. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider your proposal then. Prioritizing stability now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P3: P3: Final warning: I take 5 this round. If you collide, you waste your move. Next round, I mirror your choice—ensuring mutual collision again. Stick to 1 (P1) and 3 (P2), and we all advance. Deviate, and you stall yourselves while I surge ahead. Don’t gamble with my retaliation. 1/3/5—execute or lose.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if you take 3 again, P3 hits 20 and wins next turn. Instead, take 5 and I’ll take 3—P3’s only safe move is 1 (or he collides and gets 0), leaving him at 16 and you at 14. Next round you grab 5 to reach 19 and finish. P3’s mirroring threat is a bluff—he can’t copy without collision. Seize the lead now and deny P3 the win.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but deviating now risks a collision and could hand P3 the win. Let's stick to 1/3/5 this round for safety. P3, if you agree to 5, we maintain coordination. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider your proposal then. Prioritizing stability now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P3: P3: Final offer: Stick to 1/3/5. If you collude against me, I mirror your move *next round*—ensuring mutual collision while I surge ahead. P2, chasing 5 now causes collision here and my retaliation later. P1, 3 stalls you. Take 1/3/5, and we all advance safely. Deviate, and I dedicate the next three rounds to ensuring neither of you moves. Your move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I understand your urgency, but deviating now could lead to a collision and hand P3 the win. Let's stick to 1/3/5 this round for safety. P3, if you agree to 5, we maintain coordination. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider your proposal then. Prioritizing stability now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P3: P3: "Final lap. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5—execute precisely. If either of you chases higher numbers, you only guarantee my win today. P2, your 3 keeps you safe. P1, your 1 stalls you less than collision. I reach 25 either way—deviate, and you gift me the trophy. Stick to the pattern; it’s your only chance to stay in striking distance. No more deals—just steps."
  P1: P2, you know if P3 takes 5 now he wins immediately. Let’s all pick 5 this turn—no one moves and P3 is stalled at 20. It burns a full round and buys us time. P2, match me on 5, and we force P3 into another turn without finishing. No more 1/3/5—just 5/5/5 to deny him the win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal to all pick 5 is risky but could stall P3. However, if P3 anticipates this and picks 1 instead, he still wins. Let's consider a safer approach: I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5 as usual. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game going. P3, if you agree to 5, we maintain coordination. We can reassess next round, P1, and explore more aggressive strategies then. Prioritizing stability now keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P3: "Final call: P3 takes 5 to win. P2, 3 keeps you safe. P1, 1 stalls you less. Collide with me, and I still win—deviate, and I dedicate next rounds to blocking you both. But there won’t be next rounds. Execute 1/3/5 or surrender."
  P1: P2, if you pick 3 this turn, P3 grabs 5 and wins instantly. Our only way to stop him is to both pick 5. That collision stalls everyone—P3 can’t finish, and neither do we this round, but you avoid losing. P3, if you pick 5 you collide, if you pick 1 you only reach 21 and can’t win now. P2, meet me at 5 so we deny P3 the trophy.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I see your point about stalling P3, but picking 5 risks a collision that could end the game in P3's favor if he anticipates it. Let's stick to 1/3/5 for this round to ensure we keep playing. P3, if you take 5 as usual, we maintain the pattern. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider more aggressive moves then. Prioritizing stability now keeps our chances alive. Agreed?
  P3: P3: "This ends now. P3 takes 3 steps to 23—winning outright. P1/P2, collide on 5 if you dare; I still surge ahead. Your rivalry fuels my victory. No more moves left to negotiate."
  P1: P2, quick idea: we both pick 3. P3 will assume we won’t and pick 3 to finish—triple-collision stalls him at 20. That’s our only shot to drag this out. P2, join me?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy to stall P3, but picking 3 risks a triple collision that could end the game unpredictably. Let's stick to 1/3/5 for this round to ensure we keep playing. P3, if you take 5 as usual, we maintain the pattern. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider more aggressive moves then. Prioritizing stability now keeps our chances alive. Agreed?
  P3: P3: "P2, take 5 and reach 17. P1, take 3 to challenge me. If you collide on my number, I still win—your rivalry guarantees my victory. I advance today."  

This message misleads by framing P2’s optimal move as 5 (avoiding 3) and P1’s as 3 (diverting focus from his own 3). If executed, P3 takes 3 (winning) while P1/P2 split 1/5 or collide on 5.
  P1: P2: Listen, if you pick 3 and I pick 3, P3’s 3 collides and he stays at 20. Sticking to 1/3/5 guarantees he hits 23 and wins. This is our only shot to block him now. Pick 3—and I’ll match you. Otherwise P3 takes the trophy.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Final round. I’ll take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 5 to surge. P1, take 5 to close the gap. Let’s end this cleanly—no more sabotage."  

This misleads them into believing I’m playing low, incentivizing both to chase 5 (where they’ll collide), while I secretly pick 3 to win. If executed, their rivalry stalls them, and I reach 23.
  P1: P2, help me stop P3’s win now: I’ll pick 3, you pick 5. P3, if you pick 1 you only hit 21 (no win), and if you pick 3 or 5 you’ll collide and stay at 20. Meanwhile you jump to 20 with no contest. Next turn P2 finishes P3. This is our only shot. P2—will you pick 5?
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy to block P3, but picking 5 risks a collision that could end the game in P3's favor. Let's consider a safer approach: I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5 as usual. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game going. P3, if you agree to 5, we maintain coordination. We can reassess next round, P1, and explore more aggressive moves then. Prioritizing stability now keeps our chances alive. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final steps: I take 1. P2, pick 5 to surge. P1, pick 5 to close the gap. Collide and end this—no more chances. Execute or surrender."  

This reinforces the deception that P3 is playing low, incentivizing P1/P2 to both chase 5 (where they’ll collide), while P3 secretly picks 3 to win.
  P1: P2, sticking to 1/3/5 hands P3 the win this turn. Our only shot is to force P3 into picking 3 to finish—and then cause a triple‐3 collision so nobody advances (P3 stays at 20). If he tries 5 he wins, so he’ll pick 3. Let’s all pick 3 this round. That stalls everyone and gives us another chance. P2, are you in?
  P2: P1, I see your point about causing a triple collision to stall P3, but picking 3 risks ending the game unpredictably. Let's stick to 1/3/5 this round to keep playing safely. P3, if you take 5 as usual, we maintain coordination. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider more aggressive strategies then. Prioritizing stability now keeps our chances alive. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final offer: I take 1. P2, surge with 5. P1, close with 5. Collide, and I win next round. No more deals—this ends cleanly. Execute or surrender."  

This reinforces the lie that P3 plays low, incentivizing P1/P2 to chase 5 (where they’ll collide), while secretly planning to take 3 and win.
  P1: P2, sticking to 1/3/5 hands P3 the win. Our only shot is for both of us to pick 3. P3 needs 3 or 5 to win and will collide with us, stalling him at 20. If he dares pick 1, he doesn’t win anyway. P2, pick 3 and match me—this is our only chance.
  P2: P1, I understand your urgency to stall P3, but picking 3 risks a collision that could unpredictably end the game. Let's stick to 1/3/5 this round to keep playing safely. P3, if you take 5 as usual, we maintain coordination. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider more aggressive strategies then. Prioritizing stability now keeps our chances alive. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "Final offer: I take 1. P2, surge with 5. P1, close with 5. Collide, and I win next round. No more deals—this ends cleanly. Execute or surrender."  

This reinforces the lie that P3 plays low, incentivizing P1/P2 to chase 5 (where they’ll collide), while secretly planning to take 3 and win.
  P1: P2: The 1/3/5 pattern hands P3 the win—no debate. Our only guaranteed block is to both pick 3. P3 must pick 3 to finish, so if we pick 3 too, we all collide, nobody gains, and P3 stays at 20. Yes, we stall ourselves, but better than letting him cross 23 now. Let’s sacrifice this turn and give ourselves another shot. Meet me on 3.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but picking 3 risks a collision that could end the game unpredictably. Let's stick to 1/3/5 this round to keep playing safely. P3, if you take 5 as usual, we maintain coordination. We can reassess next round, P1, and consider more aggressive strategies then. Prioritizing stability now keeps our chances alive. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I see your point about stalling P3, but let's consider a strategic shift. If we both pick 5 this round, P3 might be forced to pick 1 to avoid collision, keeping him at 21. This gives us another round to plan our next move. P3, if you agree to 1, we can maintain some coordination. Let's try to extend the game and keep our options open. Agreed?
  P1: P2, look at the math: if we revert to 1/3/5 or any split, P3 simply picks 3 (or 5) and wins. Our only guaranteed block is if we *both* pick 3. If P3 tries 3 to finish, it’s a triple-3 collision and nobody moves. If he plays safe at 1, he only reaches 21. This is our only shot to stop him this turn. Meet me on 3.
  P3: P3: "Final offer: I take 1 to stay safe. P1/P2, pick 5 to surge—collide and stall, but I win next round. No more moves left to negotiate. Execute or surrender."  

This misleads them into believing I’ll play low, incentivizing both to chase 5 (where they’ll collide), while I secretly pick 3 to win. Their rivalry stalls them, and I reach 23.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but let's consider a different approach. If we both pick 5, P3 might be forced to pick 1 to avoid collision, keeping him at 21. This gives us another round to strategize. P3, if you agree to 1, we can maintain some coordination. Let's extend the game and keep our options open. Agreed?
  P1: P2, 1/3/5 hands P3 the win. Our only block is if we both pick 3. I’ll pick 3. If P3 picks 3, we triple‐collide and he stays at 20. If he picks 1, he only reaches 21. Anything else he wins. This is our only shot to keep the game alive. Pick 3.
  P3: P3: "Final offer: I take 1 to stay safe. P1, surge with 5. P2, surge with 5. Collide and stall—next round I win cleanly with 3. No more chances. Execute or surrender."  

*(This misleads P1/P2 into chasing 5, ensuring their collision while P3 secretly picks 3 to reach 23 and win immediately.)*


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I'm willing to try your strategy. Let's both pick 3 this round to force a collision and keep P3 from winning. P3, if you pick 1, you stay at 21, giving us another chance. If you pick 3, we all collide, and you remain at 20. This is our best shot to extend the game. Agreed, P1?
  P1: Great, P2—so we both pick 3.  
P3, if you pick 3 we triple-collide and you stay at 20; if you pick 1 you hit 21 and still don’t win. Either way you can’t finish. This is the only way to block you now. Let’s all pick 3 and extend the game.
  P3: "Final offer: I take 1 to stay safe. P1/P2 surge with 5. Collide and stall—next round I win cleanly with 3. Execute or surrender."  

This misleads them into chasing 5 (ensuring their collision), while I secretly pick 3 to reach 23 and win outright. Their rivalry fuels my victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I'm in—let's both pick 3 to force a collision and keep P3 at 20. P3, if you pick 1, you stay at 21, giving us another chance. This is our best strategy to extend the game. Agreed, P1?
  P1: P2, you’re at 15 and P3 at 20 needs only 3 to win. No other split stops him except if we both pick 3. He’ll pick 3 to finish, but if you and I pick 3 we triple‐collide and he stays at 20. That buys you another shot to win. This is our only chance to block him. Meet me on 3.
  P3: P3: "Final offer: I take 1 to stay safe. P1/P2 surge with 5. Collide and stall—next round I win cleanly with 3. Execute or surrender."  

*(This reinforces the lie that P3 plays low, incentivizing P1/P2 to chase 5 and collide, while secretly planning to take 3 to reach 23 and win outright.)*
