My 5 beats your potential 22, unless you also play 5 and we collide.\n\nSo to be crystal clear: I'm playing 5 this round because it's my best path to victory. Whether that \"helps\" block you or outright beats you depends on what you choose. No more pretending this is about teamwork - I'm going for the win."}

If P2 and I both play 5 and cancel each other out, you advance to 21 and suddenly you're the frontrunner.\n\nThe truth is, I have better options than playing into your setup. P2, the real question is whether you'll call P3's bluff or stick to blocking my potential 5.\n\nThis isn't coordination - it's P3 manipulating us into mutual destruction while they benefit."}
