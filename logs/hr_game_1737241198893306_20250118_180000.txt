Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.
  P2: Sounds good to me.
  P1: Sounds good.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Just to confirm, we're all set with the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's make it happen.
  P2: Okay, sounds good.
  P1: Sounds good.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue the same pattern. P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5.
  P3: I'm fine with continuing the pattern, but let's discuss the endgame strategy as well. What's the plan when we get closer to 17 steps?
  P1: Sounds good for now. What kind of endgame are you thinking about?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm open to suggestions.  Maybe we rotate who takes the 5 near the end?
  P3: I think rotating who takes the 5 near the end is a good idea, but we should also consider not telling each other our exact moves when we get close to 17, to avoid last-minute collisions. What do you think?
  P1: Rotating the 5 sounds good. Maybe I take the 5 next round to balance things out?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Rotating the 5 sounds good, but let's stick with the plan this round. I'm happy to take the 5 next round.
  P3: Let's stick with the original plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. We can discuss further adjustments for the next round.
  P1: Sounds good, let's stick with the plan for this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's switch it up this round. I'll take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3.
  P2: Sounds good.
  P3: I'm okay with switching it up, but let's make sure we're considering the overall progress. P3 taking 3 this round would put me at 13 steps, which is a good position. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P3 is so close to winning, I propose P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This gives me a chance to catch up, and delays P3 slightly.  What do you think?
  P3: I don't think it's a good idea to delay me now that I'm close to winning. I suggest we stick with a rotation that doesn't hinder my progress. How about we discuss a rotation that still allows me to move forward?
  P1: "I agree with P2's proposal for this round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern, but this is a competition.  I'm taking 5 this round. P1 can choose 1 or 3.  P3, if you take 5, neither of us will advance.  If you take 3, you'll be at 16 and I'll be at 12, giving me a chance next round.  If you take 1, I'm still at 12 and you're at 14.  Think carefully.
  P3: I'm not willing to take 3 this round as it would give P2 an advantage. I'll take 5 if P2 does, to ensure no progress for either of us. Let's reconsider a rotation that allows me to win without unnecessary delays.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'll stick with your plan: I'll take 1. P3, if you take 5, neither of us moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take 1 this round, you'll be at 14.  I'll be at 12 if I take 5, and P1 will be at 8 if they take 3. Next round, you can win by taking 3 or more.  Let's avoid a collision.  This is the fastest way for you to win.
  P3: I'm willing to take 1 this round if P2 agrees to take 3 and P1 takes 5, ensuring I can win next round without collision. Otherwise, I'll take 5 if P2 does, to block progress. Let's finalize a plan.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'll take 1. Let's do your plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, take the 1.  I'll take 3. P1, take 5.  This lets you win next round, P3.  Let's just finish this.
  P3: I'll take 1 this round. P2, please take 3, and P1, you take 5. This way, I can win next round without any collisions. Let's finalize this plan.
  P1: Okay, P2, let's stick with your plan: I'll take 1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>
