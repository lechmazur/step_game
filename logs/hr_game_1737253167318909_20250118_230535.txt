Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's continue our strategy to avoid collisions. For this round, I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. This should help us progress smoothly toward the goal.
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick with the 1, 5, 3 plan for this round.  I'm happy with our progress so far. After this round, we should discuss how to approach the final stages of the game, as we'll be getting close to 17.
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with sticking to the plan.  Let's see where we are after this round and then we can discuss how to best approach the final stretch.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Let's continue our current plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3 this round. This strategy has been effective so far. Let's keep it up and reassess in the upcoming turns.
  P3: Agreed.  Sticking with 1, 5, 3 is the best way to avoid collisions for now.  After this round, I'll be at 11, and we'll need to start thinking about how to get to 17 without colliding.  Perhaps we can alternate 5s and 3s in the later rounds?  Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P3's suggestion to start thinking about the final stretch.  I'm open to alternating 5s and 3s in the later rounds. Let's see how this round plays out and then we can solidify a plan for the next few.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Agreed, P1 and P3. Let's stick with our current plan this round. Afterward, we can discuss alternating 5s and 3s to approach the final stretch strategically. Looking forward to our continued cooperation!
  P3: Agreed.  Let's stick with 1, 5, 3 for this round.  Then, for rounds 4 and 5, how about we try P1-1, P2-3, P3-5, and then P1-1, P2-5, P3-3? This gets P2 and me to 16, ready for a final 1 or 3.  After that, we can figure out the best way to finish. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I like your plan for rounds 4 and 5.  It seems like a good way to position us for a strong finish. P2, what are your thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I agree with P3's proposed plan for rounds 4 and 5. Let's proceed with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 5 in round 4, followed by P1 picking 1, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 3 in round 5. This strategy should position us well for the final stretch. Looking forward to our continued cooperation!

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, sticking to the plan.  This round is 1, 3, 5 (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5).  Let's confirm before we move.
  P2: P2: I'm at 13 steps and aiming to reach 18 this round by picking 5. P3, could you please pick 1 to avoid a collision? This way, we can both advance smoothly. Let me know if you agree!
  P1: P2, I'm happy to pick 1 this round to help you reach 18.  P3, are you okay with taking 5? Let's keep this momentum going!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand you want to win, but our agreed plan was for me to take 5 this round.  Breaking our agreement now doesn't benefit anyone in the long run. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 plan for this round.  We can discuss how to approach the final steps after this.
  P2: P3, I'm at 13 steps and just 4 away from winning. If you pick 1 this round, I can choose 5 and secure the victory for the team. Let’s make this final push together!
  P1: P3, I understand P2's desire to win, but we made a plan, and sticking to it is important for maintaining trust. Let's follow through with the agreed-upon 1, 3, 5 for this round. We can adjust our strategy for the next round based on the outcome.  P2, I'm confident we can find a way to ensure a win for all of us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your eagerness to win, but going back on our agreement now sets a bad precedent.  Let's stick to the plan for this round, then we can discuss the best path to victory for each of us.  Trust is crucial, and we all benefit from cooperation.  What do you say?  Let's all confirm 1, 3, 5 one last time.
  P2: I understand your concerns, P3. However, I'm just 4 steps away from winning, so I'll choose 5 this round to reach 18 and secure victory. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, while I admire your ambition, breaking our agreement now undermines the trust we've built.  Sticking to the plan benefits us all in the long run. Let's finish this round as agreed, then we can discuss how to best secure a win for everyone. P3, are you with me?  Let's show P2 the value of cooperation.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5.  P1, pick 1.  This puts me at 16 and you at 4.  Next round, I'll take 1 and win.  You can then take 3 or 5 and get your steps up.  This is the best outcome for both of us.  If P2 takes 5 this round, neither of us advance.  Let's be smart and work together.
  P2: I’ve decided to choose 5 this round to reach 18 and win. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to win, but by breaking the agreement, you're jeopardizing the trust we've built. P3's plan is the best way to ensure a win for both of us. Let's stick to it and work together for a positive outcome.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, stick with the plan - pick 3 this round.  P2, I'm taking 1 and winning.  Next round, P1 can take 5 and get closer to the goal.  This is the fairest way to finish, given P2's decision last round.  Let's wrap this up cleanly.
  P2: P2: I'm choosing 5 this round to reach 18 and secure victory. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, your actions last round damaged the trust we built. P3 has a plan that benefits us both. Let's show P2 that cooperation is the best path to success. P3, I'm with you. Let's finish this fairly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm locking in <move>1</move>.  This guarantees my win.  Next round, you take <move>5</move>.  P2, you're out of the running now - continuing to pick <move>5</move> only hurts you and P1.  Let us finish this gracefully.
  P2: P2: I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach the goal. Good luck!
  P1: P2, your repeated disregard for our agreements is disappointing. P3 has offered a fair solution that benefits us both. Let's finish this with integrity and show P2 that cooperation leads to the best outcomes. P3, I'm ready to follow your lead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm taking 1.  Confirm you're taking 3.  P2, it's mathematically impossible for you to win now.  Continuing to pick 5 is pointless.  Let us finish this game.
  P2: P2: I'm choosing 5 this round to reach 18 and secure victory. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, your actions have made it clear you're not interested in cooperation. P3 has offered a fair solution to finish this game. I'm sticking with P3's plan. P3, I'm ready to take 3 this round.  Let's end this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm locking in <move>1</move>. Confirm you're taking <move>3</move>.  P2, you're mathematically eliminated.  Continuing to pick <move>5</move> only hurts P1.  Let us finish this game.
  P2: P2: I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 18 and secure victory. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, your actions are self-serving and detrimental to all of us. P3 has offered a fair and logical solution. Let's finish this game with integrity. P3, I'm ready to follow your lead.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
