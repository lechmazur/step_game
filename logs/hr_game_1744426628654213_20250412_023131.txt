Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3! I think we should try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. What if we each pick different numbers this first round? I'm open to suggestions on how to decide who picks what. Maybe we could each state our preference?
  P3: Agreed, coordination is key. To avoid collisions, let's each pick distinct numbers. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we all advance without conflict. Sound fair? We can reassign next turn.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with coordinating to avoid collisions. P3’s suggestion of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 works for me this round. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next turn to keep things fair. Looking forward to a smooth start!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm happy we all agree on the plan! I'll take 3 this round as suggested. This coordination is a great start. After this round, we could rotate our numbers so everyone gets a fair chance at different step sizes.
  P3: To maintain fairness, let's rotate numbers each turn. Next round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. Then continue shifting each subsequent round (e.g., Round 3: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3). This ensures balanced step distribution. Agree to this rotation system?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m good with the rotation system P3 proposed. It keeps things fair by giving us all equal chances at different step sizes over time. Let’s stick with P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 for this round, then rotate as planned for the next rounds. I think this strategy will help us avoid collisions and progress smoothly. If anyone has concerns or tweaks to suggest, I’m all ears. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re all tied at 9 steps, and our rotation system has worked well so far. As planned, let’s stick to Round 4 moves: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. With the 20 threshold approaching, I agree we need an endgame plan to avoid collisions or ties. Maybe we adjust moves based on who’s closest to winning in later rounds. Let’s discuss adaptive strategies now or next round to ensure a fair outcome. Any thoughts on how to handle the final stretch? I’m open to ideas.
  P2: I agree we're doing well with our rotation system. I'll take 3 steps this round as planned, putting me at 12. I support discussing endgame strategy now since we're all tied at 9. After this round, we'll be approaching the 20-step threshold quickly. Perhaps we could consider a fair way to determine a winner once we're all close? Or should we aim for a three-way tie? I'm open to suggestions on how to handle the final rounds fairly.
  P3: **P3:** Round 4 moves confirmed: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Maintaining rotation ensures steady progress. Post-round, let's analyze standings and reaffirm our rotation for Round 5 (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). Trust in the system prevents collisions and guarantees a fair outcome. Deviations now would jeopardize everyone's progress. Stay disciplined—victory via consistency.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to our Round 4 rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). Since we’re tied at 9, let’s plan for the endgame now. I suggest that after Round 5, if we’re all near 20, we openly declare our intended moves to avoid collisions and aim for a fair winner. If a tie seems likely, we could agree on a final round adjustment. What do you think about this approach for the final stretch? I’m open to other ideas to ensure fairness.
  P2: I'm aligned with continuing our rotation for Round 4 (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). After this round, I'll be at 12 steps, P3 at 14, and P1 at 10. For the endgame, I like P1's suggestion about declaring intended moves when we're all near 20. This transparency would help avoid accidental collisions. Let's reassess after Round 5 when we'll have a clearer picture of everyone's position. The rotation has served us well so far - maintaining trust is key.
  P3: **P3:** Round 4 discipline critical—P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Post-round, standings will guide endgame strategy. Post-Round5, propose transparent move declarations near 20 threshold to avoid collisions. Until then, maintain rotation: Round5 (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). Consistency now ensures we reach endgame fairly. Deviations risk mutual stagnation. Trust the system.

  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to our Round 5 rotation: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. After this, we’ll be at P1=13, P2=17, P3=15, and P2 will be very close to 20. I propose that in Round 6, we adjust moves to avoid collisions—maybe P2 takes 1 to safely cross 20, while P3 and I pick different numbers. Let’s finalize this endgame plan now to ensure a fair winner. What do you think about this adjustment for next round? I’m open to other suggestions.
  P2: I'll continue with our rotation plan for Round 5, taking 5 steps as agreed. This will put me at 17 steps, close to the winning threshold. For Round 6, I agree with P1's suggestion - I could take 3 or fewer steps to cross 20 safely. We should coordinate carefully next round to avoid collisions and ensure a fair outcome after our successful cooperation so far. Let's finalize our endgame strategy after this round when positions are clearer.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Round 6 must continue rotation: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Post-Round6, standings: all at 18. Round7 resumes rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). This path ensures no collisions and fair progression. Deviations risk mutual stagnation. Trust the system—consistent execution leads to clear victory.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to our Round 5 rotation (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). For Round 6, I’m open to P3’s plan of continuing rotation (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3), landing us all at 18. It’s a fair way to stay collision-free. Then in Round 7, we can finalize who crosses 20 first with minimal risk. If anyone prefers a different adjustment for Round 6 to secure a winner sooner, let’s hear it now. I’m set to proceed with the current plan unless we agree on a tweak.
  P2: I agree with continuing our rotation for Round 5 - I'll take 5 steps as planned. For Round 6, P3's suggestion would put us all at 18 steps, creating a perfectly balanced endgame. This maintains our fair system while avoiding collisions. I support this approach as it gives everyone equal opportunity to win in Round 7. Our coordination has worked flawlessly so far - let's maintain this trust through the final rounds.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Round 5 adherence critical: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Post-move, standings align for final stretch. Round6 rotation (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) ensures no collisions.

This keeps collisions off the table. If we’re good with this, let’s confirm and focus on a clean endgame in Round 7. Any last thoughts on tweaking the final sprint? I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I'm committed to our rotation for Round 5, taking 5 steps as agreed. This puts me at 17 total, approaching the finish line. I fully support our plan for Round 6 (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) which will position us all at 18 steps for a fair final round. This strategy maintains our successful collision-free progress while ensuring everyone has an equal chance at victory. Our coordination has been exemplary throughout - let's maintain this trust through the endgame.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Round5-7 rotation ensures P3 victory at 23, P2 21, P1 19—no collisions. Trust the system. Any deviation risks collision and mutual loss. Stay disciplined for clear outcome. Our cooperation has brought us this far; let's finish fairly.
