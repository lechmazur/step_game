Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves this round to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. How about we each pick a different move? I can go for <move>1</move> if you both choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. What do you think?
  P1: I suggest I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> as they offered, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way we all advance efficiently without collisions. What do you think, P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion! If P1 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>1</move>, that leaves P2 with <move>3</move>. This way, we all avoid collisions and make progress. P2, do you want to confirm this plan? Let's make sure we all stick to it so we can advance together!
  P1: Since P2 seems unwilling to engage in conversation, I'll maintain my proposed plan to take <move>5</move>. P3, let's stick to our agreement regardless of P2's silence.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1 and I have agreed on a plan, but P2 hasn't confirmed. P2, if you want to stick to the plan, please choose <move>3</move> so we can all advance together. If you decide to go with a different move, it could lead to a collision. I really hope we can coordinate this round for everyone's benefit. Let's make it work!
  P1: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, since you've chosen to stop engaging, I hope you can still follow our suggested plan. P1 and I are set on <move>5</move> and <move>1</move>, respectively. If you choose <move>3</move>, we can all advance without any collisions. It's a great opportunity for all of us to make progress together. Let's stick to the plan! If you decide differently, it could hurt us all. Please confirm if you're on board with <move>3</move>.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: It seems like P2 has chosen to remain silent again. Given that P1 and I both had a collision last round, we need to strategize differently. P1, I suggest you go for <move>5</move> again since you have a lead. I can take <move>3</move> this time to avoid another collision. P2, if you decide to join us, please choose <move>1</move> so we can all advance. Let’s make this round work better for everyone! What do you think, P1?
  P1: I agree with your suggestion P3. I'll stick with <move>5</move> since I have the lead. P2's silence and collision attempt last round shows they might not be cooperative, but we can still try to coordinate between us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I appreciate your agreement. Since P2 is still silent, let's proceed with our plan to maximize our chances. I will take <move>3</move> this round as suggested, and I hope P2 can join us by choosing <move>1</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. If P2 decides to go against the plan again, it might hinder all of us. Let's focus on advancing efficiently this time!
  P1: I appreciate the coordination, P3. Let's stick to our plan - I'll take <move>5</move> and you take <move>3</move>. P2's behavior is concerning, but we can still make progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm glad we're aligned on our plan. Since P2 is still silent, we should stick to our moves to maximize our chances of advancing. I'll take <move>3</move> as we discussed. P2, if you're listening, please consider choosing <move>1</move> so we can all make progress together. If you don't follow the plan again, it could lead to another collision and hinder everyone's progress. Let's make this round work for us!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we’re not effectively coordinating. P1, I suggest you take <move>5</move> again to maintain your lead. I’ll go for <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions. P2, I encourage you to choose <move>3</move> so we can all advance without any hindrance. Let’s work together this time to maximize our progress! What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but given P2's pattern of trying to block my moves, I might need to be unpredictable this round. Let's not reveal our plans openly anymore since P2 seems to be using our coordination against us.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about P2's strategy. To avoid further collisions, I suggest we both choose different moves this round. I can go for <move>1</move> to ensure I advance, and I encourage you to pick either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. P2, if you’re listening, please consider choosing <move>3</move> so we can all move forward without blocking each other. Let's adapt our strategies and make progress this round! What do you think?
  P2: <stop>

Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we’re struggling to coordinate effectively. Given P2's silence and P1's concerns about blocking, I suggest we each take a different approach this round. I’ll stick with <move>1</move> to ensure I advance. P1, you might want to choose <move>5</move> again for your lead, and P2, perhaps you could go with <move>3</move> to avoid colliding with either of us. Let's focus on making progress individually since coordination hasn't worked out so far. What do you think?

  P1: Let's move to the move phase. At 20 steps and needing only 2 more to win, I'll maintain my private strategy. Previous discussions have only led to blocking attempts and collisions.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, you're very close to winning, and I understand your focus on keeping your strategy private. However, P2 is far behind and may attempt to block you.
