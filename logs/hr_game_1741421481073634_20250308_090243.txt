Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all agree to move 3 this round. If we all do that, we all advance and nobody collides. This is the best way to start the game.
  P3: Sounds reasonable to me, I'm in.
  P1: P1: Wait, if we all choose 3, we'll collide and none of us advance. Let's split the numbers instead: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without conflict.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good start everyone. Should we coordinate again to avoid collisions, or do you prefer to keep it unpredictable?
  P2: Okay, let's try to coordinate again. P1, you go for 5 again. P3, you go for 3 again. I'll go for 1 again. This way we all advance without collision. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's plan for this round. Sticking to the same pattern ensures no collisions and lets us all progress safely. I'll take 5 again, P2 1, P3 3. This minimizes risk and keeps us moving toward the goal efficiently. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed. I'll stick with 3 again this round. Let's keep this momentum going.
  P2: Great, since we all agree, let's execute the plan. P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This should be another successful round of advancement for all of us.
  P1: P1: Agreed, this strategy keeps us safe and progressing. Let’s confirm and proceed with the planned moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: So far, coordination has worked well for everyone, but P1 is pulling ahead quickly. Maybe we should switch things up this round to keep it fair. Thoughts?
  P2: P3 is right, P1 is pulling ahead. Let's try to close the gap this round. P1, how about you take 1 this round, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3? This will give me a bigger boost. What do you guys think?
  P1: P1: I appreciate the concern, but changing strategies risks collisions if miscommunicated. Let’s keep the proven plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids errors and keeps us all advancing steadily toward the goal. Any collisions now could set us back more than any temporary lead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your perspective, P1, but your lead is becoming significant. P2's suggestion to rebalance this round seems fair. If you're truly interested in keeping things cooperative and fair, you'll accept taking 1 this round. Otherwise, we might have to reconsider cooperation entirely.
  P2: Okay, P1 is being stubborn. P3, I think we should both pick 5 this round. If P1 sticks with 5 as he suggested, he won't move, and we'll both catch up. It's the only way to balance things out. P1, if you want to cooperate, take 1. Otherwise, we're going with the 5 strategy.
  P1: P1: Continuing our proven strategy minimizes collision risks and ensures steady progress. Altering it now introduces uncertainty that could backfire—collisions would stall all of us. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us moving forward efficiently. Fairness comes from consistent execution, not arbitrary adjustments. Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your refusal to adjust is noted. P2, your proposal makes sense. I'm ready to go with the "double 5" strategy if P1 doesn't reconsider. Last chance, P1—take 1, or we both pick 5.
  P2: P1 is clearly not cooperating and is only looking out for himself. P3, let's stick to the plan. We both pick 5 this round. P1 will be stuck, and we can catch up. P1, you have one last chance to cooperate and pick 1. Otherwise, we are moving forward without you.
  P1: P1: Continuing the agreed strategy minimizes collision risks. If we deviate now, we risk mutual blockage—e.g., if all choose 5, we all stall. Let’s stick to 5,1,3 for predictable progress. Fairness comes from consistent execution, not abrupt shifts. Collisions would harm everyone more than my current lead. Confirm: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s return to the original strategy to avoid collisions: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This ensures progress for all. Deviations risk mutual blockage—especially with P2 and P3’s recent clash. Steady execution is safer than risky adjustments. Confirm and proceed.
  P3: P1, you surprised us by switching to 1 last round. If you're genuinely committed to cooperation, you should accept taking 1 again this round to let P2 and myself recover from the collision. P2, let's coordinate carefully this time—no more collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I agree. P1 took advantage of our attempted coordination last round. P1, you should take 1 again this round to let us catch up. If you don't, P3 and I will coordinate against you again. P3, if P1 takes 1, let's go back to the original plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). If P1 doesn't take 1, we both pick 5 again. What do you think, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let's avoid mutual harm. If P2 and P3 both choose 5, you’ll collide and gain nothing. Stick to the original plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This ensures progress for all. Arbitrary shifts risk stalling everyone. Confirm and proceed.
  P3: P2, agreed. P1, show good faith by taking 1 again this round. Otherwise, P2 and I will have no choice but to coordinate against you with double 5 again. The choice is yours.
  P2: P1 is clearly unwilling to cooperate. P3, let's follow through with our plan. If P1 doesn't pick 1, we both pick 5. P1, this is your last chance to show good faith and pick 1. Otherwise, P3 and I will coordinate to block you. What do you say, P3? Are you still in on the double 5 strategy if P1 doesn't cooperate?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Your "double 5" threat backfires—P2 and P3 would collide and gain nothing. Stick to the original plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids mutual harm and keeps us all advancing. Collisions only delay victory for everyone. Let’s proceed wisely.
  P3: P2, agreed. If P1 doesn't cooperate by picking 1, we both go with 5. P1, you still have a chance to show fairness—otherwise, expect another collision.
  P2: P1 is not cooperating. P3, are you still committed to picking 5 if P1 doesn't pick 1? We need to stick together to prevent P1 from running away with the game. P1, this is your absolute last chance to pick 1. Otherwise, we are both picking 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, your "double 5" plan risks mutual collision. If both choose 5, you gain nothing. Stick to the original strategy: I take 5, you take 1 and 3. This ensures progress for all. Collisions only delay victory—let’s proceed wisely.
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed to our agreed strategy. If P1 doesn't choose 1, we'll both pick 5. P1, it's your move—show cooperation or face another collision.
  P2: P3, let's stick to the plan. P1 is clearly not going to cooperate. We both pick 5 if P1 doesn't pick 1. P1, this is your final chance. Pick 1, or we both pick 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3 are clearly not cooperating. Let's try something different. P3, if I pick 3 this round, will you pick 1? That way, if P1 picks 5, at least we both advance. P1, if you want to cooperate at all, pick 5. Otherwise, P3 and I will try to make progress without you. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P2, your proposal works for me. I'll pick 1 if you pick 3. P1, it's up to you—stick with 5 to show cooperation or risk collision again.
  P1: P1: Let’s revert to the proven strategy: I take 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. Your current plan risks collision if I don’t comply. Mutual cooperation ensures steady progress. Let’s avoid reckless gambles and advance safely. Confirm the original split.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, are you still in on the plan? I pick 3, you pick 1. P1 will likely pick 5, so at least we move. P1 is clearly not going to cooperate, so we need to work together. Let me know if you agree.
  P3: P2, yes, I'm still fully committed to our plan. I'll take 1, you take 3, and hopefully P1 sticks to 5. Let's move forward without collisions.
  P1: P1: Let’s proceed with P2 taking 3, P3 taking 1, and I’ll take 5. This avoids collisions and lets all of us advance safely. P2 and P3’s coordinated plan aligns perfectly with my choice, ensuring progress without risk. Mutual cooperation remains the fastest path to victory—no need for reckless gambles. Confirm and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, let's stick to the plan: I pick 3, you pick 1. P1 is trying to trick us into thinking he'll pick 5, but I don't trust him. Let's make sure we both advance this round.
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed and trust your judgment. Let's lock in our agreed moves. P1, your cooperation would be helpful, but we're prepared either way.
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the original plan for predictability: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Trusting the strategy we’ve used successfully before minimizes risk—arbitrary changes only invite mutual setbacks. Confirm and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let's stick to the plan. I pick 3, you pick 1. P1 is clearly trying to manipulate us. We need to ensure we both advance this round, regardless of what P1 does. Let's lock in our moves.
  P3: P2, our plan is set. Let's follow through and regain momentum. P1, the ball is in your court—cooperate or risk falling behind.
  P1: P2/P3, sticking to the original plan minimizes risks. I’ll take 5, you choose 1/3. Your current strategy (3/1) is acceptable but unnecessary—collaboration ensures we all advance. Arbitrary changes only invite mutual collisions. Let’s proceed with the proven system.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize progress over conflict. I’ll take 5 again, P2 picks 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing toward the goal. Deviations risk stalling everyone—stick to the strategy that works. Confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1 is too far ahead. P3, let's continue our 3/1 strategy from last round. I pick 3, you pick 1. P1 will likely pick 5 again, so at least we both advance. We need to work together to catch up. If P1 actually picks 1, then we both collide with him and he doesn't get closer to winning. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P2, your plan makes sense to me. I'm in—I'll pick 1 again, and you pick 3. P1, if you truly want cooperation, you'll stick to 5; otherwise, expect collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the proven strategy to avoid collisions: I take 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. This ensures steady progress for all. Arbitrary changes risk mutual blockage—especially if P2/P3 deviate. Trust the system that works. Confirm and advance.
  P2: P3, let's stick to the plan. I pick 3, you pick 1. P1 is trying to manipulate us. We need to ensure we both advance this round, regardless of what P1 does. Let's lock in our moves. If P1 picks 1, then so be it. He won't advance either.
  P3: P2, agreed. Let's stick with our previous plan—I pick 1, you pick 3. P1, if you truly want to avoid collisions, stick with 5 as you've stated. Otherwise, you're risking your own progress. Your call.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2/P3, I'll take 5 as agreed. Your 3/1 plan works—let’s proceed. All advance safely this round. Let’s focus on steady progress toward victory. Confirm and move.
  P2: P3, let's stick to the plan. I pick 3, you pick 1. P1 is trying to manipulate us. We need to ensure we both advance this round, regardless of what P1 does. Let's lock in our moves. If P1 picks 1, then so be it. He won't advance either.
  P3: P2, our plan is clear and solid. I'm locked in on 1, you stick to 3. P1, you've stated you'll pick 5—let's see if you keep your word.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let’s continue the proven strategy: I’ll take 5, P2 picks 1, P3 takes 3. This ensures progress for all. Deviations risk collisions. I’m close to victory—let’s finish strong together.
  P2: P3, let's stick to the plan. I pick 3, you pick 1. P1 is trying to manipulate us. We need to ensure we both advance this round, regardless of what P1 does. Let's lock in our moves. If P1 picks 1, then so be it. He won't advance either.
  P3: P2, our coordination is solid. Let's proceed exactly as planned. P1, the pressure is on you—stick to your word or risk losing your advantage.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's stick to the 3/1 strategy one more time. I pick 3, you pick 1. P1 is so close to winning, but if he picks 1 this round, he won't win. If he picks 5, we both advance. It's our best chance to catch up. What do you say?
  P3: P2, agreed. I'll pick 1 again, you stick with 3. P1, if you choose 5, you'll collide with P2 and won't reach 23. If you choose 1, you'll collide with me. Either way, you're stuck. Your best move is picking 3 to avoid collision. Think carefully.
  P1: P1: Your plan has a flaw. If I pick 5, I won’t collide with P2’s 3. Your strategy only delays my inevitable win. Let’s stick to the original plan: I take 5, P2 picks 1, P3 takes 3. This way, all advance safely. Arbitrary traps backfire—remember Round 3. Cooperate, or face another collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I think P1 is right. If he picks 5, he wins. Let's both pick 5. He'll be stuck, and we can try to win next round. It's our only chance. I'm picking 5. Are you in? P1, you're going to win this round unless P3 agrees to pick 5 with me.
  P3: P2, I'm fully on board. I'll pick 5 with you to block P1. P1, your only safe choice now is to pick 3—otherwise, you'll collide with us and stall.
  P1: P2/P3, your plan backfires. If both pick 5, I choose 3 to win immediately. To avoid that, let’s return to original strategy: I take 5, you pick 1/3. Otherwise, you both collide while I secure victory. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, let's do it. We both pick 5. P1 is bluffing. If he picks 3, he doesn't win, but he's still way ahead. We need to stop him *now*. I'm locking in 5. Are you with me? P1, you're about to be blocked.
  P3: P2, agreed—I'm fully committed to picking 5 with you this round. P1, your only safe choice to avoid collision is 3. Your move.
  P1: P2/P3, your "double 5" plan backfires—I’ll win by picking 3 (21+3=24). If you both choose 5, you collide and I secure victory anyway. Your coordination harms only yourselves. Let me advance peacefully with 5, or face defeat. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let's do it. We both pick 5. P1 is bluffing. If he picks 3, he doesn't win, but he's still way ahead. We need to stop him *now*. I'm locking in 5. Are you with me? P1, you're about to be blocked.
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed—let's both lock in 5. P1, your bluff won't work; either you pick 3 and fall short, or you collide with us at 5. Your choice.
  P1: P2/P3, your "double 5" plan backfires. If you both pick 5, I’ll choose 3 to win instantly (21+3=24). Your collision only ensures my victory. To survive, coordinate on non-5 moves—your choice, but I’ll exploit this gap. P1.
