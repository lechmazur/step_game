Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick different numbers this round. P1, how about you pick 1? P2, you can pick 3. I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without any issues. Let me know if you agree.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fine with P3’s suggestion to avoid collisions this round. I’ll go with 1 as proposed. P2, are you okay with picking 3? If we all stick to different numbers, we can all make progress. Let me know if you’re on board.
