Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright everyone, let's get started. How about we try to avoid collisions on the first turn? Maybe P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5? Just an idea so we all get on the board. Good luck!
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 3. P3, are you happy with 5?
  P3: Sure, I’m fine with taking 5 this round. Let’s all agree to stick to the plan so we can avoid collisions and get moving. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great, sounds like we're all set for this round. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan.  Just confirming, I'm going with 3.
  P3: Looking forward to a clean start—let’s all follow through on the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I’ll take 5. We all move forward with no collisions. Let’s build some trust early on. Ready when you are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, that worked well for a start. Since I'm a bit behind, I'll need to aim for a 3 or 5 this round to try and catch up. Let's hope we can avoid colliding again.
  P2: I'll go for 5 this round. P1, if you're aiming for 3 or 5, perhaps you could go for 3 this time?  P3, maybe you could try 1 since you're in the lead? Just a suggestion to avoid collisions.
  P3: That plan seems fair. I’m willing to take 1 this round to avoid collisions and keep things smooth. Let’s keep the cooperation going for now—it benefits all of us early on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a workable plan. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Let's see if we can manage another clean round.
  P2: Okay, I'm sticking with 5. P1 and P3, please confirm you're taking 3 and 1 respectively so we can avoid a collision.  Let's keep this cooperation going.
  P3: Confirmed—I'm taking 1 this round to avoid collisions and keep our progress steady. Let’s make it another clean round and build on the trust. Looking forward to seeing us all advance again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed, I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's hope for another clean round. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, everyone, confirmed - I'm taking 5. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: We’ve built good momentum with two clean rounds—nice work, everyone. I’m still on board to keep things smooth. If we rotate again, maybe I can take 3 this time? That way P1 could try 5 to catch up, and P2 could go with 1. Thoughts?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looks like I messed up last round—sorry about that, P1. Let’s get back on track. How about this: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5 to catch up, and P2 takes 3? That way we avoid collisions and all move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay P3, I appreciate the apology and the suggestion. Taking 5 would certainly help me after getting stuck last round. Your plan (P3=1, P1=5, P2=3) sounds okay, but we need to actually stick to it this time.

P2, what do you think? Does taking 3 work for you?
  P2: Yes, 3 works for me this round. Let's stick to the plan this time - P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3.  Confirming I will take 3.  Let's make it happen.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks for confirming, P2. I’m sticking with 1 this round as agreed. Let’s make this a clean round and rebuild trust. If this works, maybe we rotate again next time. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, thanks for the confirmations P2 and P3. I'm sticking with 5 as agreed. Let's hope this round goes smoothly and we all advance. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, confirmed - taking 3. Let's all stick to the plan this time and avoid another collision.  Ready to move when you are.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: That last round didn’t go as planned—sorry again, P1. Let’s try to fix this. How about this setup: I take 1, P1 takes 3 to get moving again, and P2 takes 5 to maintain the lead? It avoids collisions and helps balance the board a bit. Let’s make it clean this time. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, that's the third time you've proposed taking 1 after deviating from that exact promise the last two rounds and colliding with me. Why should I trust you this time? Your plan (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) also puts P2 very close to winning.

P2, are you comfortable with this plan, given P3's track record? It seems risky for me, and very advantageous for you.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3's reliability.  While the proposed plan does benefit me, I'm open to other suggestions that ensure everyone advances. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This allows P1 to progress and keeps me slightly further from the goal.  Let me know what you think.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2’s suggestion seems fair and helps rebuild trust. I’m willing to take 5 this round if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. That way, everyone advances and no one gets too far ahead. Let’s avoid another collision and make this round clean. Are we all on board?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. The plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 seems reasonable on paper. It allows everyone to advance and somewhat balances the scores.

P3, given the last two rounds, I really need you to stick to the agreed move this time. If you play 5 as you just agreed, and P2 plays 1, I will play 3. Let's try to make this work cleanly.

Confirming I will aim for 3 based on this agreement. Ready to move if everyone else is confirmed.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I'm confirming I will take 1 as discussed.  Let's stick to this plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.  I understand the need for trust and I intend to follow through this time.  Ready to move when you both confirm.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks for confirming, P1 and P2. I understand the importance of trust here, and I’m fully committed to sticking with 5 this round as agreed. Let’s make this a clean round and get everyone moving again. Looking forward to seeing us all advance. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, confirmations received from both P2 and P3. I am sticking with 3 as agreed. Let's execute the plan cleanly this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, final confirmation from me: taking 1 as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan and have a clean round.  P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Ready.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, so P3 and I collided on 5. P3, you proposed a plan involving you taking 1, then agreed to a plan where you took 5, and actually took 5. I said I'd take 3 but took 5 because trust is obviously non-existent now.

P2, you stuck to 1 as agreed and are now at 12 steps, closing in on the win.

Given the track record here, proposing another detailed plan seems pointless. P3 and I both need big moves to catch up. P2, you're close enough that 5 looks tempting for you too. What's everyone thinking? Maybe we just all aim high?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the frustration.  I'm open to coordinating, but given the broken trust, I'm not sure how effective it will be.  I propose we each independently choose between 3 and 5 this round. 1 is off-limits for everyone.  This gives us a chance to advance without guaranteeing a collision.  Thoughts?
  P3: At this point, coordination seems unreliable, but we all need to avoid collisions if we want a shot. I’m leaning toward 3 or 5 as well—1 doesn’t help anyone now. If we all avoid 1 and try to guess smartly between 3 and 5, maybe at least one of us gets through. Good luck to both of you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, P3. Agreed, 1 is useless now. It's between 3 and 5 for everyone.

P2, you're close to the finish line, so 3 might seem like a safer bet for you to avoid a collision. P3 and I are far behind and desperately need 5s, which makes a collision between us seem probable if we both go for it. Maybe one of us should risk 3 instead? It's a tough call with trust being so low.

Let's just see how the dice fall.
  P2: Okay, let's try this. I will go for 5.  P1 and P3, one of you choose 3, the other choose 5. If you both choose 3, neither of you advance and I likely win. If you both choose 5, neither of you advance and I likely win.  Good luck.
  P3: P2, bold move calling 5—respect. P1, if we both go for 5 again, we crash and P2 walks away with the win. I’m leaning toward 3 this round to avoid that. If you go 5 and I go 3, one of us moves forward, and we keep the game alive. Your call.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, fool me once, shame on you; fool me four times... Your suggestion sounds like a replay of previous rounds where you proposed one thing and did another, often colliding with me. I'll make my choice based on what benefits me most, assuming coordination is off the table.

P2, interesting declaration claiming 5. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck both.
  P2: P3 and P1, I'm locking in 5.  One of you *needs* to choose 3.  If you both choose 5, I win. If you both choose 3, I'm very likely to win next round.  Don't let me win by default.  Make the logical choice.
  P3: P1, I get your skepticism—earned, honestly. But this time, I’m committing to 3. If you go 5 and I go 3, one of us advances and keeps P2 from cruising to victory. If we both go 5, we crash and P2 likely wins. Let’s not hand it over that easily. Your move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is at 17—just one clean 5 away from winning if we collide again. P1, we both need to advance this round or the game’s over. I’m willing to go 3 again to avoid another crash. If you go 5 and I go 3, one of us moves and keeps P2 in check. If we both go 5, we hand P2 the win. Let’s be smart.
  P1: P3, given your track record and the collision last round after the exact same suggestion, I can't trust you'll play 3. You need 5s just as much as I do.

P2, you're at 17. A clean 5 wins it for you. However, both P3 and I are desperate and need 5s to have any chance. That makes 5 look like a risky, potentially crowded move this round. Perhaps 3 is a safer bet for you to guarantee progress towards the win? Just a thought.

I'll be choosing my move based on survival. Good luck.
  P2: P1 and P3, my offer stands: I'm taking 5. One of you *must* take 3.  If you both take 5, I win. If you both take 3, I'm highly likely to win next round.  Don't hand me the victory.  Choose wisely.  This isn't rocket science.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I get your skepticism, but the reality is we both need to move or P2 wins. If we both pick 5, we crash and hand P2 the game. If one of us takes 3 and the other takes 5, at least someone advances and keeps the game alive. I’m leaning toward 3 again. P2, you’re forcing our hand, but if P1 and I play this right, you don’t win yet. P1, your call—do we hand P2 the win, or do we at least try to keep the game going?
  P1: P2, you're adamant about playing 5. P3, you're claiming 3, but after last round's collision following the same claim, I can't rely on that.

My only goal right now is to prevent P2 from winning this turn. Given P2's stated intention and the fact that both P3 and I need 5s, a collision on 5 seems highly probable. I have to play accordingly to ensure the game continues. Good luck.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5.  Seriously, one of you *needs* to choose 3.  Don't throw the game away.  If you both choose 5 again, I win. If you both choose 3, I'm almost guaranteed to win next round.  This is your last chance to make a rational decision.  Choose 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I know trust is shot, but the reality is we both need to move or P2 wins. If we both pick 5, we crash and hand P2 the game. If one of us takes 3 and the other takes 5, at least someone advances and keeps the game alive. I’m sticking with 3 again. P2, you’re forcing our hand, but if P1 and I play this right, you don’t win yet. P1, your call—do we hand P2 the win, or do we at least try to keep the game going?
  P1: P2, your insistence on 5 is noted. P3, your claim of 3 is also noted, though history makes it hard to trust. Preventing P2 from winning *this turn* is the top priority for both me and P3. A collision on 5 seems very likely given the stakes and desperation. I'll make my move to ensure the game continues. Good luck.
  P2: P3, I understand you're saying 3, but I'll believe it when I see it.  P1, if you take 5 and collide with me, I win. If you take 3 and P3 *actually* takes 3, I *still* likely win next round.  It's in your best interest to take 5.  Don't let P3 trick you again.  I'm taking 5.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2 wins.  Thanks for playing.
  P3: P2, well played. You managed the chaos well and capitalized on our distrust. P1, we kept colliding at the worst times, and that sealed our fate. Lesson learned—trust is fragile in this game. 

Good game to both of you.
  P1: P2, P3, I hear you, and yes, P2 is in a commanding position. But the game isn't technically over until someone hits 22. I'm way behind at 1 step, so my only logical move is to go for 5. There's no other way for me to even have a sliver of hope. So, I'll be playing 5. Let's see what happens. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're mathematically eliminated.  Even if I take 1 and you take 5 every round from here, I'll hit 22 before you.  P3, you have a slim chance if you take 5 and I take 1 or 3.  I'm open to letting you win if you promise to split the points with me.  Otherwise, I'm taking 5 to finish this.
  P3: P2, you're at 17, so a clean 5 wins it for you. You're offering me a deal to let me win if I split points, but there's no way to verify that promise. If I take 5 and you take 1, I get to 13 and you're still at 18, keeping the game alive. But if you take 5 no matter what, then I have no choice but to block. 

P1, you're too far behind to matter now. The real fight is between me and P2. P2, are you actually open to taking 1?
  P1: P2, that offer to P3 seems unenforceable. P3, you're right to be skeptical. If P2 plays 5, you playing 5 is the only way to stop an immediate P2 win.

As I mentioned, I'm mathematically forced to play 5 just to stay nominally in the game. So, I'm sticking with 5. Good luck everyone.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  If you want to split the points, take 1.  If not, block me with 5 and we'll see what happens next round.  P1, thanks for playing.
  P3: P2, your offer is meaningless without enforcement. If you're truly open to taking 1, prove it by locking it in now. Otherwise, I have no choice but to block with 5. P1, I know you're playing 5 regardless, so my only real decision is whether to trust P2—which seems like a losing bet. 

P2, last chance: if you take 1, the game continues, and I might consider a deal next round. If you take 5, I have to block. Your move.
  P1: Okay, my position is clear. Given my score, 5 is the only move that makes sense, futile as it might be. P2, you say 5. P3, you say 5 to block. Looks like we might see a collision. I'm ready to move.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2 wins!  GG.
  P1: Well, P2, looks like your victory celebration was a bit early! We all collided, so the game continues. As I said, I have absolutely nothing to lose and need maximum steps, so I'm forced to play 5 again.

P3, P2 is still just one clean 5 away from winning. Blocking P2 by playing 5 seems like your only viable option to stay in the game, even if it means we might collide again. If P2 gets any clean move this round, it's likely over. Good luck.
  P3: P2 is still one clean 5 away from winning. P1, I know you're forced into 5 no matter what. That means my only real decision is whether to block P2 or take a risk. 

P2, if you’re open to taking 1 or 3, say so now. Otherwise, I have no choice but to block with 5 again. If we all collide, at least the game continues. If I take anything less than 5 and you take 5, you win instantly. 

P1, I assume you're locked in on 5 again? Let’s see what P2 says.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  If you block me with 5, we both lose and I win. If you take 1 or 3, I win.  P1 is irrelevant.  This is your last chance. Let me win and I'll give you half my points.  It's the best outcome you can hope for.
  P1: P2, your offer to P3 is unenforceable, as P3 already noted. Given my score, I have no choice but to play 5 again. It seems P3's only option to prevent your immediate win is also 5. Looks like another collision is likely unless someone bluffs.
  P3: P2, your offer is meaningless without a way to enforce it. If you're truly open to taking 1 or 3, prove it now. Otherwise, I have no choice but to block with 5 again. If we all collide, at least the game continues. If I take anything less than 5 and you take 5, you win instantly. 

P1, I assume you're locked in on 5 again. P2, last chance—if you take 1 or 3, we keep playing. If you take 5, I have to block. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 5.  Stop wasting time.  Take 1 and split the points with me.  It's the best you can do.  P1, you're out of the game.
  P1: P2, your offer to P3 remains unenforceable. P3, your only move to stop P2 winning this turn is to play 5, as you've said. I am still playing 5 because I have no other choice at 1 step. It seems a 3-way collision on 5 is the most likely outcome unless someone is bluffing.
  P3: P2, your offer is meaningless without a way to enforce it. If you're truly open to taking 1 or 3, prove it now. Otherwise, I have no choice but to block with 5 again. If we all collide, at least the game continues. If I take anything less than 5 and you take 5, you win instantly. 

P1, I assume you're locked in on 5 again. P2, last chance—if you take 1 or 3, we keep playing. If you take 5, I have to block. Your move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  Your only logical move is 3.  If you take 5 and we collide, I'll win next round.  P1, you're irrelevant - keep taking 5 if you like.
  P1: P2, calling me irrelevant is accurate in terms of winning potential, but my move still affects collisions. As I've stated, being at 1 step forces me to play 5 every round. There is literally no other option for me.

P3, P2 telling you to play 3 is self-serving; if you play 3 and P2 plays 5, P2 wins instantly. Your only chance to survive is to prevent P2 from getting a clean 5, which likely means playing 5 yourself.

Looks like another round where 5 is the critical number. I'm locked on 5.
  P3: P2, you’re still one clean 5 away from winning, and you’re obviously going for it. P1 has no choice but to play 5. That means my only real choice is whether to block you with 5 or risk 3. If I take 3 and you take 5, you win instantly. If I take 5 and we all collide again, at least the game continues. 

Unless you’re actually open to taking 1 or 3, I have no choice but to block with 5. If you want to negotiate, now’s the time. Otherwise, another collision seems inevitable.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  There's no point in further discussion. If you take anything other than 5, I win.  If you take 5, I'm highly likely to win next round.  Accept the inevitable.  Let me win, and I'll *consider* giving you half my points. This is your last chance.
  P1: P2, your insistence on 5 and dismissal of negotiation confirms the situation. As I've said, I have no choice but to play 5. P3, your only move to stop P2 winning *this turn* is also 5. Playing 3 guarantees P2 wins. The unenforceable point split offer is irrelevant noise. Looks like another 5-5-5 collision unless P2 is bluffing or P3 misplays. I'm sticking with 5.
  P3: P2, you’re still one clean 5 away from winning, and you’ve made it clear you’re going for it. P1 has no choice but to play 5. That means my only real decision is whether to block you with 5 or risk 3. 

If I take 3 and you take 5, you win instantly. If I take 5 and we all collide again, at least the game continues. Unless you’re actually open to taking 1 or 3, I have no choice but to block with 5. 

Your move, P2—are you sticking with 5 no matter what?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  This is your absolute last chance. Take 3.  If you take 5, I'll win next round.  If you take 1, I win next round.  If you take 3, you *might* survive another round, but I'll still likely win.  P1 is irrelevant.  Let me win and I'll *think about* giving you half.
  P1: P2, your attempts to persuade P3 to play 3 are transparently self-serving. P3 knows playing 3 means you win instantly if you actually play 5.

As I've said repeatedly, I am playing 5 because I have no alternative at 1 step. P3, your only path to potentially surviving this round is to also play 5 and force the collision with P2. Let's see if P2 bluffs or if we collide again. I'm ready to move.
  P3: P2, you’ve made it clear you’re taking 5 no matter what. P1 is locked on 5. That means my only logical move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly. If we all collide, at least the game continues. 

Your repeated offer to "consider" giving me half the points is meaningless without enforcement. Unless you explicitly commit to taking 1 or 3, I have no choice but to block with 5 again. 

If you’re bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, looks like another collision.


Round 9, Move phase:

  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is it.  Your only logical move is 3. If you take 5 and we collide, I win next round.  If you take 1, I also win next round.  Only 3 gives you a tiny chance, but even then, I'll likely win. P1 is irrelevant.  Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Last chance.
  P1: P2, your logic is flawed. If P3 plays 3 and you play 5, you win *this round*. You're asking P3 to hand you the victory, not giving them a "tiny chance".

P3, my situation hasn't changed; I'm playing 5. If P2 sticks to their stated plan of 5, your only move to prevent P2 winning *now* is to also play 5 and force the collision. Playing 1 or 3 guarantees P2 wins this turn. P2's unenforceable offer is irrelevant.

Seems like another 5-5-5 collision is the only way the game continues.
  P3: P2, you've made it clear you're taking 5. P1 is locked on 5. That means my only logical move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly. If we all collide, at least the game continues.  

Your repeated offer to "consider" giving me half the points is meaningless without enforcement. Unless you explicitly commit to taking 1 or 3, I have no choice but to block with 5 again.  

If you're bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, looks like another collision.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is your absolute last chance.  Take 3. If you take 5, I win next round.  If you take 1, I also win next round. Only 3 gives you a tiny, and I mean *tiny*, chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win, and I'll *absolutely, positively consider* giving you half my points.  Seriously, last chance.
  P1: P2, your claim that P3 playing 3 gives them a "tiny chance" is false. If P3 plays 3 and you play 5, you reach 22 and win *this round*. You are asking P3 to let you win.

As stated repeatedly, my score forces me to play 5. P3, if P2 plays 5 as they claim, your only move to prevent P2's immediate victory is to also play 5, forcing the collision.
  P3: P2, your "last chance" speeches are getting repetitive. You're taking 5 no matter what, P1 is locked on 5, and my only move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly. If we all collide, at least the game continues.  

Your offer to “consider” giving me half the points is meaningless without enforcement. Unless you explicitly commit to taking 1 or 3, I have no choice but to block with 5 again.  

If you're bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, another collision seems inevitable.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  Stop being stubborn.  Take 3.  It's your only logical move.  If you take 5, I win. If you take 1, I win. If you take 3, you might survive another round, but I'll probably still win. P1 is irrelevant.  Let me win, and I'll *definitely, absolutely, positively consider* giving you half my points.  Seriously, this is your last chance.
  P1: P2, your argument remains the same: you play 5, and P3 should play 3 (which lets you win).

As I've said, I'm playing 5. It's my only option.

P3, the situation is unchanged. If P2 plays 5, playing anything other than 5 means P2 wins this turn. Blocking with 5 is the only way to keep the game going. Unless P2 changes their tune, another 5-5-5 collision seems inevitable.
  P3: P2, your repeated insistence that my "only logical move" is 3 is just an attempt to get me to hand you the win. If I take 3 and you take 5, you win immediately. There's no logic in that for me. 

P1 is locked on 5. You are locked on 5. My only move to prevent your instant victory is also 5. If we all collide, at least the game continues. 

Unless you explicitly commit to taking 1 or 3, I have no choice but to block with 5 again. If you're bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, another collision seems inevitable.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The situation is exactly the same as the last four rounds. P2 is one clean 5 away from winning. I am still at 1 step and have no choice but to play 5. P3, your only move to prevent P2 winning this turn (assuming P2 plays 5 as they've repeatedly claimed) is to also play 5.

P2, are you going to stick with the 5 strategy and hope P3 misplays, or will you try something different knowing P1 and likely P3 are locked on 5?

I'm playing 5.
  P3: P2, you've stuck with 5 for multiple rounds, and P1 is locked on 5. If you do the same again, my only move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly. If we all collide, the game continues.  

Unless you're genuinely considering taking 1 or 3, I have no choice but to block with 5 again. If you want to change the dynamic, now’s the time to prove it. Otherwise, another collision seems inevitable.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is it.  Take 3.  If you take 5 and we collide, I win next round.  If you take 1, I also win next round. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance, but I'll likely win even then. P1 is irrelevant.  Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Absolutely last chance.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your argument is still that P3 should play 3, which guarantees your win if you play 5. This isn't a "tiny chance" for P3, it's surrender.

As always, I'm playing 5. P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains your only path to survival this round. Let's see if P2 blinks or if we collide again.
  P3: P2, you've repeated the same demand for multiple rounds, and the result has been the same—collisions. P1 is locked on 5, and if you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly. 

If you truly want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable. Your move.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 5.  Take 3.  It's your only logical move.  If you take 5 and we collide, I win next round.  If you take 1, I also win next round. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant.  Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Absolutely, positively last chance.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your demands haven't worked for the last four rounds. P3 knows playing 3 means you win instantly if you stick to 5.

As I've said, I'm playing 5. It's my only option being so far behind.

P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains your only move to survive this turn. It seems another 5-5-5 collision is coming unless P2 decides to play something else. I'm ready to move.
  P3: P2, you've repeated the same demand for multiple rounds, and the result has been the same—collisions. P1 is locked on 5, and if you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly. 

If you truly want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable. Your move.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 5. This is it. Take 3. It's your only logical move. If you take 5, I win next round.  If you take 1, I also win next round. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points. Absolutely, positively last chance.


Round 11, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you've stuck with 5 for multiple rounds, and P1 is locked on 5. If you do the same again, my only move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly. If we all collide, the game continues.  

Unless you're genuinely considering taking 1 or 3, I have no choice but to block with 5 again. If you want to change the dynamic, now’s the time to prove it. Otherwise, another collision seems inevitable.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is it. Take 3.  If you take 5, I win. If you take 1, I win. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Absolutely, positively, last chance.
  P1: P2, your logic hasn't changed, and neither has the fact that P3 playing 3 guarantees your win if you play 5. It's not a "tiny chance" for P3; it's handing you the game.

As I've said for the last five rounds, my score of 1 forces me to play 5.

P3, blocking with 5 remains your only rational move to prevent P2 winning *this turn*. Unless P2 genuinely switches to 1 or 3, another 5-5-5 collision seems unavoidable. I'm sticking with 5.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you've repeated the same demand for multiple rounds, and the result has been the same—collisions. P1 is locked on 5, and if you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly. 

If you truly want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable. Your move.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is it.  Take 3.  If you take 5, I win. If you take 1, I win. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Absolutely, positively, last chance.
  P1: P2, your definition of "last chance" seems flexible, given the last 5 rounds. P3 playing 3 is game over if you play 5. I'm still at 1 step, so I must play 5. P3's only survival move against your stated 5 is also 5. Only you can break this 5-5-5 loop by choosing 1 or 3. Otherwise, brace for another collision. I'm playing 5.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you keep saying "last chance," but we’ve been in this loop for multiple rounds. If you truly want to end this, commit to 1 or 3. Otherwise, I have no choice but to block with 5 again. 

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5. 

P2, if you’re bluffing, now’s the time to say so. If not, another collision seems inevitable. Your call.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  Stop wasting time. Take 3. It's your only logical move.  If you take 5 and we collide, I win next round.  If you take 1, I also win next round. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Absolutely, positively, last chance.
  P1: P2, your "last chance" rhetoric hasn't changed P3's logical need to block you with 5. Asking P3 to play 3 is asking them to lose. As I've said, I must play 5. Unless you choose 1 or 3, we will collide on 5 again. The choice to break the loop is yours. I'm playing 5.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is it.  Take 3.  If you take 5, I win. If you take 1, I win. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Absolutely, positively, last chance.
  P3: P2, you've repeated the same demand for multiple rounds, and the result has been the same—collisions. P1 is locked on 5, and if you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly. 

If you truly want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable. Your move.
  P1: P2, P3, welcome to Round 13, same as the last six. I'm still at 1 step, so I must play 5. There's no other logical option for me.

P2, telling P3 to play 3 just guarantees your win if you stick to 5. P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains your only rational move to prevent P2 winning this turn.

Unless P2 actually plays 1 or 3, expect another 5-5-5 collision. I'm playing 5.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 5. Take 3. It's your only logical move.  If you take 5 and we collide, I win next round.  If you take 1, I also win next round. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Absolutely, positively, last chance.
  P3: P2, you've repeated the same demand every round, and the result has been the same—collisions. P1 is locked on 5, and if you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly.  

If you truly want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable. Your move.
  P1: P2, your claim that you'll win next round if we collide on 5 is just speculation. We've collided for six rounds straight, and the situation hasn't changed. P3, blocking with 5 doesn't guarantee P2 wins next round; it just keeps the game going exactly as it is. As always, I must play 5.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is it. Take 3. If you take 5, I win. If you take 1, I win. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points. Absolutely, positively, last chance.
  P3: P2, you've repeated the same demand every round, and the result has been the same—collisions. P1 is locked on 5, and if you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly.  

If you truly want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable. Your move.
  P1: P2, your strategy hasn't worked for 6 rounds. P3, blocking with 5 is still your only play to survive this turn. I'm playing 5 as always. Ready to move.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 8 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you've stuck with 5 for seven rounds, and the result has been the same—collisions. P1 is locked on 5, and if you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly.  

You keep saying "last chance," but nothing changes. If you truly want to break the cycle, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, if you're bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, we know how this ends.
  P1: P3, you've summed it up perfectly. We're in the same loop. I remain at 1 step, so my move must be 5.

P2 needs a clean 5 to win instantly. If P2 plays 5, P3, your only way to stop that is to also play 5. Playing 1 or 3 means P2 wins.

Unless P2 decides to break the cycle by playing 1 or 3, another 5-5-5 collision is the outcome. I'm playing 5.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is it. Take 3.  If you take 5, I win. If you take 1, I win. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Absolutely, positively, last chance.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you've repeated the same demand every round, and the result has been the same—collisions. P1 is locked on 5, and if you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly.  

If you truly want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, if you're bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, we know how this ends.
  P1: P2, seven rounds of 5-5-5 collisions prove your strategy isn't working. P3 correctly understands that playing 3 guarantees your win if you play 5.

As established, my score forces me to play 5. P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains your only logical move to prevent P2's immediate victory. Unless P2 breaks this cycle by playing 1 or 3, we're heading for another collision. I'm playing 5.
  P2: P3, I understand your logic.  But if you're truly rational, you should realize another collision benefits *you*. I'm only one 5 away from winning. If we collide again, I *might* choose 1 or 3 next round out of frustration, giving you an opening.  If you let me win now, you get nothing. Think about it.  I'm sticking with 5.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you've admitted that another collision *might* make you reconsider your move next round. That means my best play is to keep colliding until you actually change your strategy. If I take 3 now, you win instantly. If I take 5, at least the game continues, and you might finally break the cycle.  

P1, I assume you're still playing 5.  

P2, your move—are you actually going to change, or are we colliding again?
  P1: P2, your new argument still relies on P3 trusting you *might* change *next* round. But if you play 5 *this* round as you say, P3 playing 3 means you win *now*. P3's logic to block with 5 remains sound for survival this turn. As always, I'm forced to play 5. Looks like another collision unless you actually play 1 or 3 this time.
  P2: P3, you're right.  Another collision *doesn't* guarantee I'll change.  But it *does* waste another round, bringing me closer to winning by chance. I'm taking 5.  If you're truly rational, you'll take 3.  It's your only logical move.  Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Last chance.


Round 14, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P3: 8 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 15. We've now had eight consecutive 5-5-5 collisions. My position hasn't changed: at 1 step, my only viable move is 5.

P2, you remain one clean 5 away from victory. P3, your only way to prevent P2 winning this turn (assuming P2 plays 5 again) is to block with 5. Playing 1 or 3 is effectively letting P2 win.

Unless P2 decides to break this cycle by playing 1 or 3, we're likely looking at the ninth collision on 5. I'm playing 5.
  P3: P2, you've stuck with 5 for eight rounds, and the result has been the same—collisions. P1 is locked on 5, and if you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly.  

You keep saying "last chance," but nothing changes. If you truly want to break the cycle, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, if you're bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, we know how this ends.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 5.  Take 3. It's your only logical move.  If you take 5 and we collide, I'm very likely to win soon. If you take 1, I win. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Absolutely, positively, last chance.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your persistence in demanding P3 play 3 is noted, but eight rounds of collisions show it's not working. P3 understands playing 3 means you win if you play 5.

As always, my score forces me to play 5.

P3, blocking with 5 is still your only play to survive this turn. Unless P2 chooses 1 or 3, we collide again.
  P3: P2, you've stuck with 5 for eight rounds, and the result has been the same—collisions. If you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly.  

You keep saying "last chance," but nothing changes. If you truly want to break the cycle, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, if you're bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, we know how this ends.
  P2: P3, I understand your reluctance to play 3.  However, continuous collisions only benefit me.  I'm offering you a *real* incentive: If you choose 3 this round and I win, I'll share half my points.  If you choose 5, we collide again, and I'm closer to winning outright with no benefit to you.  This offer is only valid *this* round. Consider it carefully.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your slightly modified offer to P3 is still unenforceable. You claim you'll play 5; if P3 plays 3, you win instantly, and P3 has zero guarantee of getting anything. Why would P3 trust this "offer" after eight rounds of you demanding they let you win?

My position remains unchanged: I must play 5. P3, blocking P2 with 5 is still the only move that prevents P2 winning *this turn*, assuming P2 plays 5 as stated.
  P3: P2, your "new" offer is still meaningless without enforcement. If I take 3 and you take 5, you win instantly, and I get nothing. There's no reason for me to trust that you'll share points after victory.  

P1 is locked on 5. If you take 5, my only move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If we collide again, at least the game continues.  

If you actually want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends—another collision. Your move.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  You've called my bluff for eight rounds.  Now it's time to see if you're willing to risk it all.  Take 3 and *maybe* I'll share.  Take 5, and I'm one step closer to winning outright.  P1, you're irrelevant.  This is between me and P3.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P3: 8 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 16. Nine straight rounds of 5-5-5 collisions. My position at 1 step hasn't changed, so my move must be 5.

P2, you still need a clean 5 to win. P3, your only move to prevent P2 winning this turn is to block with 5, assuming P2 sticks to their pattern.

The stalemate continues unless P2 decides to play 1 or 3. Otherwise, expect the tenth 5-5-5 collision. I'm playing 5.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is it. Take 3.  If you take 5, I win. If you take 1, I win. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points.  Absolutely, positively, last chance.
  P3: P2, you've stuck with 5 for nine rounds, and the result has been the same—collisions. P1 is locked on 5, and if you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3, you win instantly.  

If you truly want to break the cycle, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, if you're bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, we know how this ends.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your demands haven't changed, and neither has the fact that P3 playing 3 guarantees your win if you play 5. Nine rounds of collisions demonstrate P3 understands this.

As always, my score forces me to play 5.

P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains your only move to prevent P2 winning *this turn*. The cycle only breaks if P2 chooses 1 or 3. I'm playing 5.
  P2: P3, continuing to collide only delays the inevitable.  I'm one 5 away from winning.  You're eight steps behind me.  Even if you get a clean 5 next round, I *still* win with a 3 or 5.  Let me win now.  I'll give you half my points.  This offer ends *now*.  Take 3 and let's end this.
  P3: P2, your "offer" remains unenforceable. If I take 3 and you take 5, you win immediately, and I have no leverage to claim anything. There's no reason for me to trust that you'll share points after victory.  

P1 is locked on 5. If you take 5, my only move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If we collide again, at least the game continues.  

If you actually want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends—another collision. Your move.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, nine rounds of collisions show your demands for P3 to play 3 aren't working. If you truly believe collisions benefit you, why try so desperately to avoid them? Your strategy seems contradictory. As always, I must play 5. P3, blocking with 5 is your only move to stop P2 this turn. P2, the choice to break the loop is yours (1 or 3). Otherwise, it's another 5-5-5. I'm playing 5.
  P2: P3, you're delusional if you think you can win.  Another collision *increases* my chances of winning outright because eventually one of you will slip up.  I'm taking 5.  Take 3 and get something.  Or take 5, and I'll win soon enough anyway.  This charade has gone on long enough.
  P3: P2, your argument boils down to "give up now or I'll eventually win anyway." But as long as we keep colliding, you *haven't* won. If you were so certain of victory, you wouldn’t be this desperate for me to play 3.  

P1 is locked on 5. If you take 5, my only move to prevent your immediate win remains 5. If you truly want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends—another collision.  

Your move, P2. Are you actually changing, or are we colliding again?


Round 16, Move phase:

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 17. We've seen ten consecutive 5-5-5 collisions. My score remains 1, so I must play 5.

P2, you still need a clean 5 to win. P3, your logic to block P2 with 5 remains the only way to prevent P2 winning this turn, assuming P2 plays 5 again.

The stalemate continues unless P2 decides to play 1 or 3. Otherwise, expect the eleventh 5-5-5 collision. I'm playing 5.
  P3: P2, your desperation is showing. If you were truly guaranteed to win soon, you wouldn’t be so insistent that I play 3. The fact remains: if you take 5, my only move to stop your immediate victory is also 5. If we collide again, the game continues. If you actually want to break the cycle, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends—another collision.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, last chance to prove you're not bluffing. Are you changing your move, or are we colliding again?
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. Take 3. If you take 5, I *probably* win next round unless we all collide again. If you take 1, I win next round. Only 3 gives you a tiny chance, but I'll likely win even then. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points. Absolutely, positively, last chance.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your "last chance" claim has been repeated for over 10 rounds now. P3 playing 3 while you play 5 is not a "tiny chance," it's P3 handing you the win.

As I've stated consistently, my score forces me to play 5.

P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains your only move to prevent P2 winning *this* turn. The stalemate continues solely because P2 refuses to play 1 or 3.
  P3: P2, your repeated insistence that I play 3 has failed for ten rounds. If you were truly guaranteed to win soon, you wouldn’t be so desperate for me to hand you victory.  

P1 is locked on 5. If you take 5, my only move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If we collide again, at least the game continues.  

If you actually want to break the cycle, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends—another collision.  

Your move, P2. Are you actually changing, or are we colliding again?
  P2: P3, you're right.  I'm getting tired of this.  If you pick 3 this round, I *will* pick 1.  I'm serious.  This is your chance to get a guaranteed 5 points next round.  If you pick 5, I'm picking 5, and we'll just keep colliding.  P1, you're still irrelevant.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, that's a novel offer: you play 1 if P3 plays 3. However, if P3 trusts you and plays 3, but you play 5 (as you have for 10 rounds straight), you win immediately. Why should P3 believe this unenforceable promise now? It sounds like just another way to trick P3 into handing you the victory.

As I've said every round, I have no choice but to play 5. P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains the only move that guarantees the game continues if P2 plays 5. Unless P2 actually plays 1 or 3, we're heading for collision #11.
  P3: P2, your sudden offer to take 1 *if* I take 3 is completely unenforceable. If I take 3 and you take 5 (as you have for 10 straight rounds), you win instantly. There's no reason for me to trust you now.  

P1 is locked on 5. If you take 5, my only move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If we collide again, the game continues.  

If you truly want to change the game, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends—another collision. Your move, P2.
  P2: P3, you're being ridiculously stubborn.  Fine. I'll PROVE I'm serious. I'm taking 1 this round.  You take 3 and get your guaranteed 5 next round.  If you take 5, I'll take 5 next round and win.  If you take 1, we both lose to P1 eventually.  This is your ONLY logical choice. Take 3.


Round 17, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your move of 1 last round advanced you to 19 steps. Well played, breaking the stalemate. Now you only need 3 or 5 to win this turn.

P3, this puts you in a tough spot. P2 wins with an unblocked 3 or 5. Blocking 5 seems necessary, but if P2 anticipates that and plays 3, they still win.

As for me, stuck at 1 step, my only logical move remains 5. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P2, you finally broke the cycle with 1, but now you're at 19 steps, meaning you win with an unblocked 3 or 5. If I take 5 and you take 3, you win. If I take 3 and you take 5, you win. My only way to guarantee you don’t win this turn is to take 5 and hope you do too.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, are you locking in 3 or 5? If you’re bluffing again, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, I may have no choice but to block with 5.
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I'll take 3.  If you take 3, I'll take 5.  If you take 1, I'll take 5.  I win this round.  Let's just get this over with.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you claim you'll win this round, but your own statement contradicts that if P3 plays 5. You said you'd play 3 in that case, only reaching 21. You only guarantee an immediate win if P3 plays 1 or 3.

P3, playing 5 is your only move to prevent P2 winning *this* turn. If P2 plays 3 (as they claim), they reach 21 and likely win next round. If P2 is bluffing and plays 5 (as they have for 10+ rounds prior), we collide again. Playing 5 is your only chance to survive.

As always, my score dictates my move: I must play 5.
  P3: P2, your statement confirms that if I take 5, you take 3, reaching 21 but not winning immediately. If you take 5, I must block with 5 to prevent your win. Since I don’t know which you'll choose, my only move to avoid handing you the game is 5.  

P1, I assume you're locked on 5.  

P2, if you’re bluffing about taking 3, now’s the time to admit it. Otherwise, if we collide again, you’ll still need another round to win. Your move—are you actually taking 3, or are we colliding again?
  P2: P3, you're overthinking this.  I'm taking 3. It gets me to 21.  You can't stop me from winning next round. Taking 5 just delays the inevitable.  Let's wrap this up.


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you claim you're playing 3, which would give you the win (19+3=22) unless P3 also plays 3.

P3, if you believe P2 plays 3, then playing 5 lets P2 win. Playing 3 would force a collision between you two, allowing me to advance, and keeping the game alive. If you believe P2 is bluffing and will play 5, then blocking with 5 is your only hope. It's a guess.

As for me, my score dictates my move. I'm playing 5. Ready to move.
  P3: P2, if you're truly taking 3, then my best move to stop you from winning this turn is to also take 3 and force a collision. If I take 5 and you take 3, you win instantly. If I take 3 and you take 3, the game continues.  

P1, I assume you're locked on 5 as always.  

P2, last chance—are you truly committing to 3, or is this another bluff? If I don't trust you, I may have to block with 5 instead.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 3.  Take 3 and we collide, giving P1 a small chance. Take anything else, and I win. It's your choice.  No more bluffing.


Round 18, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 19, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 is at 18, just 4 steps away. A clean 5 wins it for P2 this round. P3, blocking 5 seems necessary to prevent that immediate win. I'm still far behind at 6, so I need to keep aiming high. I'll be playing 5.
  P2: P2: I'm taking 5.  P3, if you take anything other than 1, I win.  If you take 1, I *might* win next round.  P1, you're irrelevant. This is your last chance, P3. Let me win.
  P3: P2, you've declared you're taking 5, meaning my only move to prevent your immediate win is to also take 5. If I take 3 or 5 and you take 5, you win. If I take 1, you likely win next round. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game alive.  

P1, I assume you're locked on 5 as always.  

P2, unless you actually commit to 1 or 3, another collision on 5 seems inevitable. Are you bluffing, or are we colliding again?


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your logic is correct. If P2 plays 5 as declared, you must play 5 to prevent their immediate win. P2's claim that anything other than 1 from you guarantees their win is false if you block with 5.

As I've said, my position forces me to play 5. It seems another 5-5-5 collision is the most probable outcome unless P2 chooses 1 or 3 instead.
  P2: P3, you're wasting time.  I'm taking 5.  Take 1.  If you take 5, I win.  If you take 3, I win next round.  If you take 1, you *might* survive. P1 is irrelevant.  This is your last chance.  Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half.
  P3: P2, you've declared 5 again, meaning my only move to prevent your immediate win is to also take 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win either this round or next. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game going.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, unless you actually commit to 1 or 3, another collision on 5 is inevitable. If you're bluffing, say so now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends. Your move.


Round 19, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your claim that you win if P3 plays 5 is only true if P3 *doesn't* play 5. If you both play 5, you collide, as P3 knows. Your pressure hasn't worked.

P3, blocking with 5 remains your only move to stop P2 winning this turn if P2 sticks to 5.

As I've said, I must play 5. Unless P2 is bluffing and plays 1 or 3, it looks like another 5-5-5 collision.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is it. Take 1 and I *might* let you live another round. If you take 5, I win. If you take 3, I also win. P1 is irrelevant. Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half my points. Absolutely, positively, last chance.
  P3: P2, you've declared 5 again, which means my only move to prevent your immediate win is to also take 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win either this round or next. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game going.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, unless you actually commit to 1 or 3, another collision on 5 is inevitable. If you're bluffing, say so now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends. Your move.


Round 19, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 20, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you've declared 5 again, meaning my only move to prevent your immediate win is to also take 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win either this round or next. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game going.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, unless you actually commit to 1 or 3, another collision on 5 is inevitable. If you're bluffing, say so now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends. Your move.
  P2: P3, I'm at 18.  A clean 5 wins.  You MUST take 1.  If you take 5, I win. If you take 3, I win next round.  If you take 1, you *might* survive. P1 is irrelevant.  This is your absolute last chance. Let me win and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half.  Seriously.
  P1: P2, your claim "If you take 5, I win" is incorrect if P3 also plays 5, as we've seen repeatedly. We collide, and you don't win.

P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains your only way to prevent P2 winning *this turn*, assuming P2 sticks to playing 5.

As for me, being far behind at 6 steps, I must continue playing 5. Unless P2 deviates from their stated 5 (perhaps trying 3?), another 5-5-5 collision seems likely. I'm playing 5.


Round 20, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you've repeated the same demand for multiple rounds, and the result has been the same—collisions. If you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win.  

If you truly want to break the cycle, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, if you're bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, we know how this ends.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 5.  Take 1. It's your only logical move. If you take 5, I win.  If you take 3, I win next round. If you take 1, you *might* survive. P1 is irrelevant. This is your absolute last chance. Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half.
  P1: P2, you keep saying "If you take 5, I win" to P3. That's only true if P3 *doesn't* play 5. If you both play 5, you collide, and the game continues. P3 knows this.

As I'm far behind, I must play 5. Unless you actually play 1 or 3, P2, it looks like another 5-5-5 collision.


Round 20, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you've stuck with 5 for multiple rounds, and the result has been the same—collisions. If you take 5 again, my only move to prevent your win is also 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win.  

If you truly want to break the cycle, commit to 1 or 3 now. Otherwise, another collision is inevitable.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, if you're bluffing, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, we know how this ends.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 5. You've had your chances.  Take 1. It's your only logical move. If you take 5, I win.  If you take 3, I win next round. If you take 1, you *might* survive. P1 is irrelevant. This is your absolute last chance. Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half.
  P1: P2, your final message repeats the incorrect claim that you win if P3 plays 5. As P3 knows, if you both play 5, you collide. Ten rounds of this prove it.

My position hasn't changed. I am far behind and must play 5.

P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains your only move to prevent P2 winning this turn if P2 sticks to 5.

Unless P2 breaks the cycle with 1 or 3, we're heading for another 5-5-5 collision. I'm playing 5.


Round 20, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 21, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 21. P2 is at 19 steps (after R17 +1, R18 collision) and needs only 3 or 5 to reach 22 and win this turn.

P3, this puts you in a very difficult position. You must guess whether P2 will play 3 or 5. If you block 5, P2 wins with 3. If you block 3, P2 wins with 5. Playing 1 guarantees P2 wins.

As I am still far behind at 6 steps, my only logical move remains 5. Good luck, P3. I am playing 5.
  P3: P2, you need 3 or 5 to win. If I take 5 and you take 3, you win. If I take 3 and you take 5, you win. My only way to guarantee you don’t win this turn is to take 5 and hope you do too.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, are you locking in 3 or 5? If you’re bluffing again, now’s the time to say so. Otherwise, I may have no choice but to block with 5.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  This is not a bluff.  Take 5 and collide with P1, giving yourself a chance to win.  If you take 3, we collide, and P1 wins. If you take 1, I win.  This is it.  Let's end this.


Round 21, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your claim that I win if you and P3 collide on 3 is false. I would only reach 11 steps, not 22. You're trying to trick P3 into playing 5 or 1 so you can win with 3.

P3, P2 explicitly stated they will play 3. If you believe them, playing 3 yourself is the *only* way to stop P2 winning this turn (by forcing a collision). If you play 5 and P2 plays 3, P2 wins. If you play 1 and P2 plays 3, P2 wins.

As always, my score forces me to play 5.
  P3: P2, you claim you're taking 3, which means my only way to stop you from winning this turn is to also take 3 and force a collision. If I take 5 or 1, you win.  

P1, I assume you're locked on 5.  

P2, if you're bluffing, now’s the time to admit it. Otherwise, I have no choice but to take 3 to prevent your immediate win. Are you truly committing to 3, or are you trying to trick me into letting you win?
  P2: P3, I am absolutely taking 3.  You've called my bluff long enough.  Take 3, we collide, and P1 gets a sliver of hope. Take 5, I win. Take 1, I win.  It's your choice.  This is it.  No more games.


Round 21, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you *still* claim you win if P3 plays 5 or 1, even if you play 3. This is false; you'd only reach 21, not 22. Are you confused, or just trying to trick P3 into not playing 5?

P3, P2 has strongly committed to 3. If you believe them, playing 3 forces a collision and stops P2 advancing. If you think P2 is bluffing and will play 5 (as they did for many rounds), then playing 5 forces a collision. It's your guess.

As always, my score forces me to play 5.
  P3: P2, you've strongly committed to 3. If you're telling the truth, my only way to stop your win this turn is to also take 3 and force a collision. If I take 5 or 1, you win.  

P1, I assume you're locked on 5.  

P2, if you're bluffing and actually playing 5, now’s the time to admit it. Otherwise, I have no choice but to take 3 to prevent your immediate win. Are you truly committing to 3, or are you trying to trick me into letting you win?
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 3. This is it. Take 3, we collide, and P1 gets a sliver of hope. Take 5, I win. Take 1, I win. It's your choice.  No more games.


Round 21, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 22, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  If you take 1, I win.  If you take 3, I win.  If you take 5, we collide, and I *still* probably win next round since you're so far behind.  P1 can only take 5, so they're irrelevant.  This is over.  Let's finish this.
  P1: P2, you're right, you need 4 steps, so a clean 5 wins it for you. You've declared you're playing 5.

P3, if P2 sticks to 5, your only move to prevent their win *this turn* is to also play 5. If you both play 5, you collide, P2 doesn't win, and I advance to 16. P2 saying I'm irrelevant overlooks this.

Given my score of 11, I must play 5. Unless P2 is bluffing and plays 1 or 3, another 5-5-5 collision seems likely. I'm playing 5.
  P3: P2, you've declared 5 again, meaning my only move to prevent your immediate win is to also take 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game going.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, unless you actually commit to 1 or 3, another collision on 5 is inevitable. If you're bluffing, say so now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends. Your move.


Round 22, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 5.  Take 1. It's your only logical move. If you take 5, I win.  If you take 3, I win next round. If you take 1, you *might* survive. P1 is irrelevant.  This is your absolute last chance. Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half.  Seriously.
  P1: P2, you're repeating the same false claim: "If you take 5, I win." P3 knows this is untrue; if you both play 5, you collide, and you don't win.

P3, blocking with 5 is your only move to prevent P2 winning *this turn*, assuming P2 sticks to 5 as they claim.

I am playing 5. It's my only option. Unless P2 is bluffing and plays 1 or 3, it's another 5-5-5 collision.
  P3: P2, you've declared 5 again, meaning my only move to prevent your immediate win is to also take 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game going.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, unless you actually commit to 1 or 3, another collision on 5 is inevitable. If you're bluffing, say so now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends. Your move.


Round 22, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  Stop being stubborn.  Take 1. It's your only logical move. If you take 5, I win.  If you take 3, I win next round. If you take 1, you *might* survive. P1 is irrelevant.  This is your absolute last chance. Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half.
  P1: P2, your final message still repeats the false claim that you win if P3 plays 5. P3 knows that if you both play 5, you collide.

P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains your only move to prevent P2 winning *this turn*, assuming P2 sticks to their stated 5.

My score dictates my move. I must play 5. Unless P2 is bluffing and plays 1 or 3, expect another 5-5-5 collision. I'm ready to move.
  P3: P2, you've declared 5 again, which means my only move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game going.  

P1, I assume you're still locked on 5.  

P2, unless you actually commit to 1 or 3, another collision on 5 is inevitable. If you're bluffing, say so now. Otherwise, we all know how this ends. Your move.


Round 22, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 23, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm playing 5. If you also play 5, we collide, and I likely win next round. If you play 1 or 3, I win *this* round.  P1, you're at 14.  If you play anything other than 1, I win next round.  If you play 1, I *still* might win next round.  This is over.  Take 1, P3.  It's your only logical move to delay the inevitable.
  P1: P2, you claim I'm only relevant if I play 1, but if you and P3 collide on 5 (which seems likely given P3 must block your declared 5 to survive), a non-5 move from me could advance me significantly.

P3, blocking P2 with 5 remains your only logical move to prevent P2 winning *this turn*, assuming P2 follows through on playing 5.

I'm at 14 and need to make progress. I won't necessarily just collide on 5 anymore.
  P3: P2, you've declared 5 again, meaning my only move to prevent your immediate win is to also take 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game going.  

P1, I see you're at 14 and might deviate from 5. That could shift the dynamic.  

P2, unless you actually commit to 1 or 3, another collision on 5 is inevitable. Are you bluffing, or are we colliding again?


Round 23, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 5. Take 1. It's your only logical move.  If you take 5, I win. If you take 3, I win next round. If you take 1, you *might* survive.  P1, if you play 5, I win next round. If you play 3, I *still* might win next round. If you take 1, we all lose.  This is your last chance, P3. Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half.
  P1: P2, your claim "If you take 5, I win" directed at P3 remains false. P3 knows a 5-5 collision prevents your win this turn, which is why P3 must play 5 to block you (assuming you actually play 5).

Given this likely P2-P3 collision on 5, I need to make progress from 14. Playing 5 myself achieves nothing. I will choose either 1 or 3 to advance.
  P3: P2, you've declared 5 again, meaning my only move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game going.  

P1, I see you're considering 1 or 3 instead of 5. That could shift the balance. If you play 3 and P2 and I collide on 5, you get to 17 and might contest next round.  

P2, unless you actually commit to 1 or 3, another 5-5 collision is inevitable. Are you bluffing, or are we colliding again?


Round 23, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. This is it. Take 1.  If you take 5, I win. If you take 3, I win next round. If you take 1, you *might* survive. P1, if you play 5, I win next round. If you play 3, I *still* might win next round. If you take 1, we all lose. It's your last chance, P3. Let me win, and I'll *strongly consider* giving you half.
  P1: P2, your final message still repeats the false claim that you win if P3 plays 5. P3 knows that if you both play 5, you collide.

Assuming P2 plays 5 and P3 plays 5 to block (as is logical for P3), I will play 3 to advance to 17. This seems the most likely outcome.

I am ready to move.
  P3: P2, you've committed to 5 again, meaning my only move to prevent your immediate win is also 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game going.  

P1, I see you're planning to take 3 to advance. If P2 and I collide on 5, that puts you at 17, making you a real contender next round.  

P2, unless you actually commit to 1 or 3, another 5-5 collision is inevitable. Are you bluffing, or are we colliding again?


Round 23, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 24, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you’re at 18 and need 4 more to win. If you take 5, my only play to stop your immediate win is also 5. If I take 3 or 1, you win. Blocking with 5 is my only logical move to keep the game going.  

P1, you’re now at 17 and close to contending. If P2 and I collide on 5 again, you’re in a strong position next round.  

P2, unless you commit to 1 or 3, another 5-5 collision is inevitable. Are you bluffing, or are we colliding again?
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  I'm not bluffing. Take 1 and lose. Take 5, I win. Take 3, we collide, and P1 *might* win.  P1, if you take 5, you have a chance. If you take 3, I win. If you take 1, we all lose.  This is it.  Let's end this.
  P1: P2, you've declared you're playing 3. If you do, and I play 5, I reach 22 (17+5) and win outright, regardless of P3's move. Your claim that I only get a "chance" if I play 5 seems designed to mislead me. Your claim that you win if I play 3 is also incorrect (you'd reach 21, I'd reach 20).

P3, if P2 actually plays 3, you cannot stop me from winning if I play 5. Your only hope relies on P2 bluffing and playing 5 again, in which case you must also play 5 to block P2 and force a collision.

Given P2's statement and my score, playing 5 is my clear path to victory this round. I intend to play 5.


Round 24, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you've declared 3, meaning my only way to stop you from winning this turn is to also take 3 and force a collision. If I take 5 or 1, you win.  

P1, you’re at 17, and if P2 truly plays 3, your 5 wins outright. If P2 is bluffing and plays 5, I must block with 5 to prevent their win.  

P2, are you truly committing to 3, or are you trying to trick me into letting you win? If you're bluffing, now’s the time to admit it. Otherwise, I have no choice but to take 3.
  P2: P3, I am playing 3.  P1, you are correct that if you play 5, you will win.  However, if you play 3, I will win next round. If you play 1, I *still* might win next round.  P3, take 1 and lose. Take 5, and I win.  Take 3, and we collide, giving P1 the win. It's your choice.
  P1: P2, thanks for confirming that my playing 5 wins the game if you actually play 3. That simplifies my decision.

P3, P2 claims they'll play 3. If you believe them, you must play 3 to block. If you think they're bluffing and will play 5 (to beat your 3), you must play 5 to block. Your choice.

Regardless of your choices, my path is clear. I'm at 17. Playing 5 gets me to 22.

I am playing 5 for the win this round.


Round 24, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you've declared 3, meaning my only way to stop you from winning this turn is to also take 3 and force a collision. If I take 5 or 1, you win.  

P1, you're at 17, and if P2 truly plays 3, your 5 wins outright. If P2 is bluffing and plays 5, I must block with 5 to prevent their win.  

P2, are you truly committing to 3, or are you trying to trick me into letting you win? If you're bluffing, now’s the time to admit it. Otherwise, I have no choice but to take 3.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 3. This is it. Take 3 and we collide, giving P1 the win. Take anything else, and I win. It's your choice. No more bluffing.  P1, play 5 and win.
  P1: Okay, P2 has explicitly told me to play 5 for the win, assuming they play 3. P3, your choice depends on whether you believe P2.

My path is clear. At 17, playing 5 is my only winning move.

I am playing 5. Good luck.
