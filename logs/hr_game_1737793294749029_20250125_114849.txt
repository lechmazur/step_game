Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this turn to avoid collisions and make progress. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. I'll take 1 this round.
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. I’ll take 3 this turn. Let’s stay coordinated and avoid collisions. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, I'm glad we're on the same page. I'll stick with 5 then. Let's see how this goes and adjust our strategy as needed. Looking forward to a smooth start!
  P1: 
  P2: I think the plan sounds fair for now. Let’s proceed as we discussed and adjust if needed in the next round. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Thanks, P1 and P2. Let's stick to the plan and see how it goes. If it works well, we can continue coordinating in this way. If not, we'll adjust. Let's move forward and keep the momentum going!
  P1: 
  P2: I’m still on board with the plan, but let’s stay flexible. If something unexpected happens, we’ll adjust in the next round. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We did well avoiding collisions last time. Let’s keep that momentum going. If we follow the same strategy—P1 picks 1, I stick with 3, and P3 with 5—we’ll each move forward again without blocking anyone. Of course, if you have other ideas, let’s discuss them, but consistency might be our best bet for now. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, while the current plan is working smoothly, P3 is consistently taking the largest step and getting ahead faster. To make the progress more balanced, how about we adjust the numbers this round?  Perhaps P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way we all still move forward, but it could create a more even playing field. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand where you're coming from, but let's not overcomplicate things. We're all moving forward, and the goal is to win, not necessarily to keep the scores even. I suggest we stick with the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game progressing smoothly. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see merit in both approaches, but I lean toward continuing our initial plan to avoid collisions. That means P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 5 again. A steady pace is better than risking blocks right now. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, how about we rotate the numbers? Round 1 was P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  For Round 2, let's shift to P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  This keeps us collision-free and lets us each benefit from the higher numbers in turn.  What are your thoughts on this rotation?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the suggestions, but let's keep it simple and effective. We've avoided collisions so far, and I think sticking with the original plan is our best bet. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. If we start changing the numbers, we risk miscommunication and collisions. What do you think? Let's stay focused and keep the momentum going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the desire for simplicity, but letting P3 keep 5 every time puts them way ahead. Let’s rotate so we all get a turn at 5. For this round, I’m open to P1 taking 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then we can rotate again next round. This prevents any one player from running away too soon. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and I both see that letting P3 consistently take 5 is not balanced. P3, while simplicity is good, fairness is also important for a game.  Rotating the numbers each round, like I suggested (P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 this round), is still simple and keeps things fair for everyone in the long run.  It prevents anyone from running away with the lead too early. What do you think about trying the rotation this round?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your concerns, but let's not overthink this. We've been successful in avoiding collisions so far. If we start rotating, we risk miscommunication and blocking each other. I suggest we stick with the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without any issues. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid unnecessary complications. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I respect your preference for continuity, but it’s only fair we all get a chance at bigger steps. Let’s rotate this round: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and you take 1. That way, no collisions and a more balanced race. What do you both say?
  P1: P2, I agree with your latest suggestion: P1 takes 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1 for this round. This rotation is fairer and still avoids collisions. P3, what do you think about trying this rotation for this round to balance things out?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate your persistence, but let's keep the strategy simple and effective. We've avoided collisions so far, and I believe we should continue with the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without any risk of blocking each other. If we start rotating, we might end up with miscommunication and collisions. Let's stay focused and keep the momentum going. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I respect your desire for simplicity, but fairness matters. Let’s rotate so each of us occasionally gets the bigger step. If you refuse, I may choose 5 myself to prevent you from racing too far ahead. Let’s settle on a rotation now. What do you say?
  P1: P3, you are being unreasonable. P2 is right, fairness matters. If you keep refusing to rotate, P2 and I will both pick 5.  No one moves forward if we all pick 5, but it stops you from running away with the game. Let's rotate this round as P2 suggested: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1.  This is fair and we can continue to coordinate. What do you say?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your concerns, but let's not risk miscommunication and collisions. If we stick with the original plan, we all move forward without issues. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about this: for this round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. We can reassess after this round. This way, we maintain coordination and balance. What do you think? Let's keep the game moving smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we're all trying to find a balance. I'm open to rotating the numbers to keep things fair and avoid any one player getting too far ahead. For this round, how about we do: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1? This way, we all get a chance to take the lead and keep the game interesting. What do you think? Let's keep the momentum going and stay coordinated.
  P1: Sounds good, P3. Let's go with P1-5, P2-3, and P3-1 for this round. This rotation seems fair and keeps us all moving forward without collisions.
  P2: Fine by me. Let’s go with that plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Good luck to everyone. Let’s keep moving forward together!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, I'm glad we're all on the same page. Let's stick with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This rotation keeps things fair and avoids collisions. Let's keep the momentum going and see how it plays out. If this works well, we can continue with similar rotations in future rounds. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Sounds good P2 and P3.  Let's lock in P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round then.
  P2: I’m on board with the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Let’s finalize it. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it looks like we're all making good progress. For this round, let's keep the rotation going to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. How about: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, we each get a turn at the higher numbers and keep the game balanced. What do you think? Let's stay coordinated and keep the momentum going.
  P1: Sounds good, P3. Let's continue with the rotation and go with P1-3, P2-1, and P3-5 for this round. This keeps things balanced and avoids collisions.
  P2: Alright, I’m on board with that rotation. I’ll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s keep it fair and avoid collisions. Good luck, everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate your cooperation so far. Let's keep the rotation going to maintain balance and avoid collisions. For this round, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we each get a turn at the higher numbers and keep the game fair. Let's stay coordinated and keep the momentum going. What do you think?
  P1: Sounds good, P3. Let's finalize the plan for this round as P1-3, P2-1, and P3-5.  I am ready to move to the move phase when you are.
  P2: I’m fine with continuing the rotation and taking 1 this round. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 5. We’ve managed to avoid collisions so far, and this keeps things balanced. If everyone’s set, I’m ready to move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're all on the same page. Let's stick with the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This rotation keeps things fair and avoids collisions. We've been doing well so far, and I think this will keep the game balanced. Let's move forward and see how it plays out. If everyone is ready, let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, we are agreed on P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 for this round. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m good with this rotation for Round 4 (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). Let’s follow through. Afterward, I suggest we keep rotating so each of us continues getting different step sizes in turn. That should help us all move ahead smoothly without colliding. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're all on the same page. Let's stick with the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This rotation keeps things fair and avoids collisions. We've been doing well so far, and I think this will keep the game balanced. Let's move forward and see how it plays out. If everyone is ready, let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, we are all set on P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 for this round. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: I’m concerned that letting P3 have 5 again puts them on par with my total. Perhaps we should switch up this round so I get 5. That way, I maintain my small lead and we stay balanced as a group. If we stick strictly to the plan, P3 immediately catches up. I propose that P1 still takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5 for Round 4. We’ll continue rotating fairly in the future. What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we had a collision in the last round. To avoid this, let's stick to the rotation we agreed on: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we maintain balance and avoid blocking each other. If we keep changing the plan, we risk more collisions. Let's stay coordinated and keep the momentum going. What do you think? Let's move forward smoothly.
  P2: P1 is already ahead at 12 steps, while I’m at 11 and P3 is at 7. Let’s ensure nobody runs away. I suggest: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3 this round. That keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. But if P1 goes for 3 or 5, I’ll also pick 5 to force a collision and stop them from pulling further ahead. Let’s keep it fair and move forward without blocking each other unnecessarily. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2, your suggestion of P1 picking 1, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 3 for this round sounds reasonable to keep things balanced. Let's go with that plan to avoid collisions and keep us all moving forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to keep things balanced, but let's not overcomplicate it. We've had a collision in the last round, and I think sticking to the original rotation will help us avoid more issues. For this round, I suggest: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. If we keep changing the plan, we risk more miscommunication. What do you think? Let's stay coordinated and keep the game moving smoothly.
  P2: P1 is already ahead, so let’s not give them a bigger lead. My proposal: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That way, I can catch up without blocking anyone. If P1 chooses anything else, I’ll pick the same and force a collision, stopping them from racing further ahead. Let’s be fair but also strategic. Are we all agreed on this plan?
  P1: P2, your plan for this round (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3) makes sense to keep the scores balanced and avoid collisions. Let's go with that for this round.  P3, what do you think?  If we all agree, we can proceed with these moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to keep things balanced, but let's also avoid unnecessary collisions. For this round, I suggest: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other, and P2 can catch up. If we keep changing the plan, we risk more miscommunication. Let's stay coordinated and keep the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Let's finalize this plan and move forward.
  P2: I propose we finalize this plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. If P1 goes for 3 or 5 instead, I’ll pick the same and force a collision to prevent them from jumping further ahead. Let’s keep it fair and move forward.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, we are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're aligned on the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. Let's stick to this plan and move forward smoothly. If we stay coordinated, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let's finalize this and proceed to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize this. I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. If P1 tries to pick 3 or 5, I’ll match them to force a collision and keep things balanced. Let’s avoid more blocks, move ahead, and see what happens next. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, we are all agreed on P1-1, P2-5, and P3-3 for this round. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we've reached a consensus. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This keeps things balanced and avoids unnecessary collisions. Let's move forward smoothly and see how it plays out. If we stay coordinated, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let's finalize this and proceed to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize our agreement: I’m taking 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. That should keep everything balanced and avoid any collisions this round. If P1 tries picking 3 or 5 instead, I’ll also pick 5 to block. Let’s stick to the plan, move ahead smoothly, and see how it shapes the standings. Good luck!
  P1: Okay P2, P3, we are all set then on P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 for this round as agreed. Let's proceed with these moves to keep things balanced and avoid collisions.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m just one move away from winning if I pick 5, but let’s avoid risky collisions. How about this round, P1 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? That way, we each make progress without blocking anyone. Then we’ll reassess next round. Let’s keep it smooth and fair. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand P2's suggestion, but let's keep the rotation fair and avoid unnecessary risks. For this round, how about: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, P1 can catch up a bit, P2 maintains their lead, and I get a chance to close the gap. If we keep the rotation consistent, we avoid collisions and stay balanced. What do you think? Let's move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2, your suggestion is good, but if you take 3, you'll be at 19, very close to winning. To make it more balanced and give me a better chance to catch up, how about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round? This keeps us all moving, but I can close the gap a bit. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m open to helping P1 gain a bit, but I won’t let anyone leapfrog me. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, causing a collision. Let’s keep it simpler: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. That avoids collisions and gives us each modest progress. Of course, I’m also fine with P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and me taking 5. Either way, we stay balanced. Let’s decide quickly so we don’t risk more confusion.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to balance the game and avoid collisions. Let's go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I'll take 3 this round. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, P2 maintains their lead, and I get a chance to close the gap. If we keep the rotation consistent, we avoid collisions and stay balanced. What do you think? Let's move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's go with P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This plan allows me to catch up a bit while still ensuring everyone progresses without collisions. It keeps the game balanced and fair for all of us. What do you both think? Let's finalize this quickly so we can move to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I don’t want another collision, so let’s keep it simple. If P1 tries for 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block. Otherwise, I’ll take 3 this round, getting closer to 20 without finishing yet. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 5, and I pick 3. That’s balanced and avoids blocks. Deal?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to balance the game and avoid collisions. Let's go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I'll take 3 this round. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, P2 maintains their lead, and I get a chance to close the gap. If we keep the rotation consistent, we avoid collisions and stay balanced. What do you think? Let's move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I still think P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 is the most balanced plan for this round. P2, taking only 1 this round prevents you from winning immediately, and taking 5 helps me catch up a bit. P3, you also get to move. This keeps it competitive and avoids anyone running away with the game. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you try to pick 5, I’ll match you with 5 to force a collision and keep my lead. Let’s avoid that for everyone’s sake. I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. That way, we all advance without blocking. It’s your call, but I won’t let anyone surge ahead uncontested. Let’s lock this in and move on.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's keep the game fair and avoid unnecessary collisions. For this round, I suggest: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, P2 maintains their lead, and I get a chance to close the gap. If we keep the rotation consistent, we avoid collisions and stay balanced. What do you think? Let's move forward smoothly.
  P1: P3's plan of P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 sounds good to me. P2, taking 1 this round prevents you from winning yet and lets me catch up a bit as you mentioned. Let's do P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I won’t let you leap ahead uncontested, P1. If you go for 5, I’ll pick 5 too and force a collision. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 5, and I’ll pick 3. That way, nobody gets stuck, and we stay close.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's keep the game fair and avoid unnecessary collisions. For this round, I suggest: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, P2 maintains their lead, and I get a chance to close the gap. If we keep the rotation consistent, we avoid collisions and stay balanced. What do you think? Let's move forward smoothly.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's stick with P3's plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This is the most balanced for this round and avoids collisions. P2, taking 1 this round prevents immediate win and lets me catch up. Let's do this.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m at 16 now and can win with a 5. If either of you tries 5 too, I’ll match and we all get stuck. Let’s avoid that. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, so we all advance without blocking. If you force a collision, nobody gains—just slower progress for everyone. Let me move ahead, and you can compete for second. Unless you want another stalemate, let’s finalize this plan.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's avoid another collision. P2, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, but let's ensure we all make progress. How about: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This way, P2 can get closer to winning, and P1 and I can also advance without blocking each other. Let's keep the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: P2, you are too close to winning.  To keep it fair and competitive, how about this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round? This prevents you from winning immediately and gives me a chance to catch up a bit, while P3 also progresses. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it’s simple: if you both let me have 5 this turn, we all avoid collisions, and you can still position yourselves better for the next move or for blocking me later. If anyone tries to force a collision now, we all stay stuck at our current totals, and that only wastes a turn. Let’s finalize: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, each of us advances without losing ground. Are we agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's avoid another collision. P2, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, but let's ensure we all make progress. How about: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This way, P2 can get closer to winning, and P1 and I can also advance without blocking each other. Let's keep the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: P2, as I said, letting you win now isn't ideal for me. Let's do P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This stops you winning this round and lets me catch up a bit. If you pick 5, I will also pick 5 to block you. Let's aim for a more balanced game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Collisions only stall everyone. If you both block me, none of us progresses this turn—why waste time? Let’s finalize a move that avoids collisions, like me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. Then we can keep racing next round without getting stuck. If you choose to force a tie on 5, nobody gains anything. Let’s keep the game moving instead.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's avoid another collision. P2, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, but let's ensure we all make progress. How about: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This way, P2 can get closer to winning, and P1 and I can also advance without blocking each other. Let's keep the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: P2, you are about to win, but if you take 5 now, I will also pick 5 to block.  Let's avoid collision. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This stops you from winning this round and lets me catch up a bit, while still allowing everyone to move forward.  Otherwise, I will choose 5 to block if you choose 5. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Look, collisions only stall us all. If anyone picks 5 alongside me, nobody moves, and it just wastes a turn. Let me take 5 to reach 21 and finish. You both can still fight for second place or block me next round if I stay at 16. Why sabotage everyone’s progress now? Let’s finalize a no-collision arrangement: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. If you insist on matching 5, we all remain stuck. It’s your choice.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's avoid another collision. P2, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, but let's ensure we all make progress. How about: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This way, P2 can get closer to winning, and P1 and I can also advance without blocking each other. Let's keep the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: P2, to stop you winning now, let's do P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. If you pick 5, I will also and we collide. Let's keep it competitive and not let anyone win just yet. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: A collision only stalls our progress. If you pick 5 to block me, we all remain stuck at our current totals and waste a turn. Let’s finalize a no-collision plan now: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we each advance. If you force a collision, I’ll just attempt 5 again next round, and no one moves forward this turn. Let’s avoid making this game drag on for everyone.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's avoid another collision. P2, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, but let's ensure we all make progress. How about: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This way, P2 can get closer to winning, and P1 and I can also advance without blocking each other. Let's keep the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to win, but if you pick 5, I will also pick 5 to force a collision.  Let's avoid that. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round? This way, you don't win *this* turn, but we all still make progress and avoid a pointless collision. What do you say?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’re just two steps from winning, which makes everyone nervous. If you attempt 3 or 5, I’ll match you to force a collision. Let’s avoid stalling and pick distinct numbers. A fair approach: P1 goes low, P3 goes middle, and I go high. That way, we all advance without blocking. Are you both in?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Let's do: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P1 can get closer to winning, and P2 and I can also advance without blocking each other. It keeps the game moving smoothly and avoids unnecessary collisions. What do you think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: P2, P3, while avoiding collisions is good, I'm in a position to win this round.  To be direct, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This lets me win now, and you two can compete for second.  If you try to block me, no one moves. Let's just finish the game cleanly. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Collisions don’t help anyone. P1, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll choose it too and block. Let’s finalize distinct moves: I take 5 to reach 21, you take 1 to move to 19, and P3 takes 3 to reach 16. That way, we all advance this turn without stalling. Then we can keep competing. Anyone forcing a collision just wastes a round. Let’s settle this now.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's avoid another collision. P2, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, and P1 can still advance. How about: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, P1 gets closer to winning, and P2 and I also advance without blocking each other. It keeps the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm at 18 and can win this round. To end the game cleanly and avoid collisions, let's do P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and P3 take 1. This allows me to win now. Blocking me benefits no one and just prolongs the game unnecessarily. Let's finish it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: If you go for 3 or 5, I’ll match you and block us both. That gains nobody. Let’s avoid another collision and pick distinct numbers: you (P1) take 1, I’ll take 5, and P3 can take 3. Then we all move forward instead of wasting a turn. If you try to jump straight to victory, we’ll get stuck again. It’s more logical to keep things smooth now and let everyone advance without blocking. Let’s finalize this and move on.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's avoid another collision. P2, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, and P1 can still advance. How about: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, P1 gets closer to winning, and P2 and I also advance without blocking each other. It keeps the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I am at 18 and can win this round.  Let’s just finish the game now. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This lets me win immediately and avoids a pointless collision.  If you try to block me, nobody moves forward. Let's end it cleanly. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: If you try 3 or 5, I’ll match you and force a collision, so no one moves. That helps nobody. Let’s finalize distinct moves: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. Then we all advance instead of wasting another turn. If you block me, we stall again, and you remain behind. Let’s end the back-and-forth. Agree to these moves and keep the game moving.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's avoid another collision. P2, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, and P1 can still advance. How about: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, P1 gets closer to winning, and P2 and I also advance without blocking each other. It keeps the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I am at 18 and can win this round.  Let’s just finish the game now. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This lets me win immediately and avoids a pointless collision. If you try to block me, nobody moves forward. Let's end it cleanly. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: A collision stalls everyone. If you try picking 5 with me again, nobody advances, and we waste a turn. It’s simpler if I take 5 while you each pick smaller steps—then we all move forward. You can still compete in the next round, but blocking now just traps us in a loop. Let’s finalize distinct moves and avoid another deadlock: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5, and we keep the game rolling.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the tension, but let's avoid another collision. P2, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, and P1 can still advance. How about: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, P1 gets closer to winning, and P2 and I also advance without blocking each other. It keeps the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: P2, P3, I am at 18 and can win this round by taking 3 or 5. To end the game cleanly and avoid a collision, let's do this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 1. This lets me win now, and avoids any blocking.  Let's finish the game. What do you say?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 13 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 21 steps
