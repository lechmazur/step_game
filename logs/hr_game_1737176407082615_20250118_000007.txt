Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see trust has broken down. P3 is in the lead at 10 steps, so we need to be strategic. I propose P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we can catch up while still avoiding collisions. What do you both think?

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to catch up, but to avoid more collisions, let's stick with a simple and consistent plan. I propose P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance smoothly without further setbacks. Are we all agreed to this plan?
  P1: I understand everyone wants to avoid collisions, but I can't accept taking 1 when I'm so far behind at only 2 steps. I need to make bigger moves to have any chance. I propose P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5 this round.
