Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone! Let's avoid collisions and all move forward this round. I'll pick 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. Sound good?
  P3: I think P1's plan could work, but I want to ensure we all stick to it. P1, you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. If we all agree, let’s confirm and move forward without collisions. If anyone deviates, it’ll only slow us down. Let’s trust each other for now and focus on advancing.
  P2: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round. I will choose 3. Let's all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great! Glad we're all aligned. Let's build trust early and keep this momentum going.
  P3: Let’s confirm one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. If we all stick to this, we avoid collisions and make progress. Deviating now would only waste time and hurt everyone’s chances. Trust is key here—let’s show we can cooperate for mutual benefit. If this works, we can keep coordinating in future rounds.
  P2: Sounds good, confirmed.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great start! To keep things fair, let's rotate numbers this round. I'll take 5, P2 can take 1, and P3 takes 3. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, rotating numbers sounds reasonable to me. I will take 1 this round.
  P3: P1, rotating numbers is a fair strategy, and I’m fine with it as long as we all stick to the plan. If P2 takes 1 and you take 5, I’ll take 3 without issue. Let’s confirm this and avoid any unnecessary collisions—trust is still our best tool here. Deviating now would only slow us down and make cooperation harder in future rounds. Confirm your choices so we can move forward efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round. Let's keep building on our trust.
  P2: Okay, instead of P1 taking 5, how about P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3 this round? This way we still all move, but with a slight adjustment to the rotation.
  P3: P2, changing the rotation now disrupts the trust we just established. If you take 5 instead of 1, it creates an imbalance and sets a risky precedent for future rounds. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 5, you take 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures fairness and keeps us all moving forward efficiently. Deviating this early could lead to unnecessary collisions later. Confirm your commitment to the agreed strategy so we can proceed without issues.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, changing the plan now could cause confusion and collisions. Let's stick to the original rotation this round—it's fair and clear. We can always adjust rotations next round if needed. Confirming again: I'm taking 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, I understand P1 and P3 want to stick to their rotation, but I think taking 5 this round would help balance out our positions a bit better. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? It's still a rotation, just slightly adjusted. What do you think?
  P3: P2, adjusting the rotation now risks breaking the trust we’ve built. Sticking to the original plan—P1 takes 5, you take 1, and I take 3—ensures fairness and avoids collisions. If we start deviating early, it’ll lead to chaos in future rounds. Let’s stay consistent and rotate properly next time. Confirm your commitment to the agreed strategy so we can all advance efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let's not risk collisions this early—there's plenty of time left to balance positions. Let's stick to the original rotation for now, and we can adjust next round if needed. Confirming clearly again: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, I understand you both want to stick to the original rotation, but my suggestion of P1 taking 1, me taking 5, and P3 taking 3 still maintains the rotation idea, just shifted. This way, we slightly balance our positions now, instead of waiting until later rounds. It’s still fair and keeps us all moving forward. What do you think?
  P3: P2, while your idea of balancing positions has merit, deviating now risks confusion and collisions. Trust is fragile early on—let’s stick to the original rotation: P1 takes 5, you take 1, and I take 3. This ensures fairness and avoids setbacks. If adjustments are needed later, we can discuss then. Confirm your commitment to the agreed plan so we can all advance efficiently without conflict.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, rotation continues. For round 3, I'll take 5. P1, can you take 3, and P3 take 1?
  P1: P2, that rotation works fine for me. I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's confirm clearly to avoid any confusion.
  P3: P2, your proposed rotation for this round is clear: you take 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. I’m fine with this plan as long as we all stick to it. Let’s confirm and move forward without deviation—trust is critical to avoid collisions and keep advancing efficiently. If anyone changes their choice now, it’ll disrupt progress and create unnecessary conflict. Confirm your commitment so we can proceed smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, yes, confirmed. I will take 5. Let's keep this rotation going.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round. Let's keep up the good teamwork!
  P3: P2 and P1, the rotation plan is clear: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. Let’s stick to this without deviation—collisions now would waste time and hurt trust. If we maintain consistency, we can adjust strategically later if needed. Confirm your choices so we move forward efficiently. Trust has kept us on track, and breaking it now risks unnecessary setbacks. Let’s confirm and proceed smoothly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, for round 4, let's revert to the original plan from round 1. I'll take 3 again. P1, can you take 1, and P3 take 5? This keeps the rotation going smoothly.
  P1: P2, your suggestion sounds good to me. I'll take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's confirm clearly and stick to it to maintain our momentum.
  P3: P2, reverting to the original rotation is a solid plan—let’s stick to it. I’ll take 5 as agreed, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. Consistency builds trust, and deviating now would only risk collisions and slow us down. Let’s confirm this clearly: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. If we maintain this pattern, we can adjust strategically later if needed. Trust has kept us moving efficiently so far—let’s not break it now. Confirm your choices, and let’s advance without setbacks.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, yes, I confirm taking 3. Let's lock in these moves and proceed.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll take 1 this round. Let's keep the momentum and trust going strong.
  P3: P2 and P1, the plan is clear: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s confirm one final time to ensure no deviations. Trust has kept us advancing smoothly so far—breaking it now risks unnecessary collisions and setbacks. If we stick to this rotation, we can adjust strategically in future rounds if needed. Confirm your choices, and let’s move forward efficiently without conflict.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've cooperated well so far, but now positions are uneven. Let's adjust slightly to rebalance. I'll take 5 this round, P2 can take 1, and P3 takes 3. This helps even things out while still avoiding collisions. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your suggestion to adjust positions is reasonable, but deviating from the established rotation risks confusion and collisions. Instead of disrupting trust now, let’s stick to the original rotation: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This ensures fairness and avoids setbacks. If adjustments are still needed later, we can discuss then. Confirm your commitment to the agreed rotation so we can all advance efficiently without conflict. Trust has kept us moving smoothly—let’s not break it now.
  P2: Okay P1, your suggestion to adjust makes sense. Let's go with your plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This seems like a fair adjustment to keep us all progressing. What do you think P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, we've consistently followed rotations so far, but positions are clearly uneven now. My suggested adjustment benefits everyone by bringing the scores closer together, ensuring fair competition. Let's cooperate on this minor adjustment now to maintain trust and fairness moving forward. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, while your proposed adjustment has merit, deviating from the established rotation risks confusion and collisions. Trust is fragile—let’s stick to the original rotation: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This ensures fairness and avoids setbacks. If adjustments are still needed later, we can discuss then. Confirm your commitment to the agreed rotation so we can all advance efficiently without conflict. Let’s not break the trust we’ve built.
  P2: P3, I agree with P1.  Continuing the rotation as is will widen the gap, and it's still early enough to adjust for a more balanced game.  Let's do P1-5, I-1, P3-3 this round to even things out a bit. It's a minor shift to ensure fair play in the long run.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, it's clear P2 and I both support this slight adjustment to keep the game fair and competitive. Refusing this small compromise now risks future cooperation. Let's confirm clearly: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, while your concerns about balance are valid, deviating now disrupts the trust we’ve built. Sticking to the original rotation—P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3—ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary collisions. If adjustments are still needed later, we can discuss then. Let’s confirm this plan and move forward efficiently without conflict. Trust has kept us advancing smoothly—let’s not break it now. Confirm your choices so we proceed without setbacks.
  P2: P3, we are not abandoning the rotation, just slightly adjusting it this round for better balance. It's still predictable and fair, and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead too early.  This small shift keeps the game competitive for longer, which benefits everyone. Let's agree on P1-5, I-1, P3-3 for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, cooperation requires flexibility. P2 and I have clearly agreed on this minor adjustment to maintain balance and fairness. Refusing now only risks unnecessary collisions and damages trust going forward. Let's confirm clearly: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3 this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, while your proposed adjustment has merit, deviating from the established rotation risks confusion and collisions. Trust is fragile—let’s stick to the original rotation: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This ensures fairness and avoids setbacks. If adjustments are still needed later, we can discuss then. Confirm your commitment to the agreed rotation so we can all advance efficiently without conflict. Let’s not break the trust we’ve built.
  P2: P3, you are mistaken about the rotation. We are on round 5, and the agreed rotation for this round, as P1 suggested, is P1 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This continues the pattern from previous rounds and is not a deviation. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep progressing.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your unexpected move caused a collision last round and set you back. Let's return to clear coordination to avoid further setbacks. This round, I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Confirm clearly if you're on board.
  P2: Okay P1, that sounds reasonable to avoid further collisions. I will take 1 as you suggested. Let's make sure P3 is also on board with this plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s ensure clarity this round to avoid further collisions. If P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5, we can all advance without setbacks. Trust is critical—let’s confirm and stick to this plan. Deviating now risks unnecessary conflict and slows us down. Confirm your choices so we proceed efficiently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, glad we're aligned again. Confirming clearly once more: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick with this and move forward smoothly.
  P2: P3, yes, I confirm I will take 1.  Let's all stick to this plan for round 6.
  P3: P1 and P2, the plan is clear: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let’s confirm one final time to ensure no deviations. Trust has kept us advancing smoothly so far—breaking it now risks unnecessary collisions and setbacks. If we stick to this rotation, we can adjust strategically in future rounds if needed. Confirm your choices, and let’s move forward efficiently without conflict.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the repeated collisions are slowing us all down. Let’s stick to a clear plan this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This avoids overlap and keeps us advancing efficiently. Trust has been broken twice now—let’s restore it by confirming our commitment to this rotation. Deviating again only prolongs the game unnecessarily. Confirm your choices so we move forward without setbacks.
  P1: P3, your proposal clearly benefits you more than anyone else—taking 5 would put you close to winning range. P2, you're far behind now and need to catch up. Let's be realistic: I'll take 1 this round, P2 takes 5 to regain some ground, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive and prevents anyone from prematurely winning. Confirm clearly to avoid further collisions.
  P2: Okay P1, I agree with your suggestion. Taking 5 this round makes sense for me to catch up a bit. P3, I understand you want to stick to the rotation, but P1's idea helps balance the game a little since I'm currently behind. Let's do P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, while your concerns about balance are valid, deviating from the established rotation risks further confusion and collisions. Trust is fragile—let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures fairness and avoids setbacks. If adjustments are still needed later, we can discuss then. Confirm your commitment to this rotation so we can all advance efficiently without conflict. Let’s restore trust by sticking to the agreed plan.
  P1: P3, you're already at 14 steps. If you take 5 now, you'd be at 19—one step from winning next round. You can't expect us to let you get that close uncontested. P2, sticking to my plan (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3) helps you catch up and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm this clearly to avoid more collisions.
  P2: P3, sticking to the same rotation when positions are uneven doesn't make sense. P1's suggestion to take 5 this round helps me catch up and keeps the game competitive. It's a fair adjustment to prevent anyone from running away with the lead. Let's do P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 this round as P1 suggested.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, deviating now only prolongs conflict and slows us all down. Trust is critical—if we stick to the original rotation (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5), we avoid collisions and move efficiently. Adjustments can come later if truly needed, but breaking trust again risks further setbacks for everyone. Confirm your commitment to this plan so we advance without unnecessary conflict. Let’s prioritize fairness and consistency to keep the game moving forward.
  P1: P2, it's clear P3 is pushing to get within one step of winning. If you pick 3 as P3 suggests, you'll remain far behind and practically out of contention. My proposed plan (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3) gives you a chance to catch up and keeps the game competitive for both of us. Let's confirm clearly and stick to it—otherwise, we're handing the game to P3.
  P2: P3, you taking 5 now puts you too close to winning.  P1's plan of P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 is much better for game balance right now and keeps it competitive for longer.  It also helps me catch up a bit.  Let's agree to P1's suggestion for this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, deviating now risks further collisions and slows us all down. Trust is fragile—let’s stick to the original rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures fairness and avoids setbacks. If adjustments are still needed later, we can discuss then. Confirm your commitment to this rotation so we can all advance efficiently without conflict. Let’s restore trust by sticking to the agreed plan.
  P1: P2, it's clear P3 won't compromise and wants the easy win. If we both stick to our plan (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3), we both advance safely and keep the game competitive. If you switch now, you risk another collision and hand P3 an easy path to victory. Let's confirm clearly and stick together.
  P2: P3, you keep saying "rotation" but taking 5 now lets you almost win.  P1 and I are suggesting P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 to balance things out.  This is fairer and keeps the game going longer.  Taking 5 now is clearly just trying to rush to victory when we are still playing. Let's do P1-1, P2-5, P3-3.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your attempt to rush ahead backfired and only helped me. I'm now at 19, just 1 step away from winning. If either of you collide with me, the other player advances uncontested, potentially handing them the game next round. Your best chance is to coordinate carefully without me. I'll choose my number privately—good luck guessing.
  P3: P1, you’re right that colliding with you would hand the game to the other player. However, rushing ahead hasn’t secured your win yet. P2 and I still have a chance to coordinate and block you effectively. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks—P2, take 3, and I’ll take 1. This ensures we both advance without giving P1 an uncontested victory. Trust is critical now; deviating only prolongs the game unnecessarily. Confirm your choices so we proceed efficiently.
  P2: P3, your plan sounds good. I will take 3. Let's hope this prevents P1 from winning this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to use you to keep themselves in the game. If you both advance safely this round, P3 will be at 15 or 17, in easy reach of victory next turn. Colliding with me is risky, but letting P3 close the gap uncontested is even riskier for you. Think carefully about who benefits most from your cooperation.
  P3: P2, P1 is trying to create doubt, but we’ve stuck together so far. If you take 3 and I take 1, we both advance without risking a collision that hands P1 the win. Trust is critical now—deviating only prolongs the game unnecessarily. Let’s confirm our choices and move forward efficiently. Confirm your commitment to this plan so we proceed without setbacks.
  P2: P3, to stop P1 from winning this round, we must collide with P1. Let's both pick '1' to maximize our chance of collision, as P1 might try '1' to ensure at least a small step if we try to block '5'.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, choosing "1" alongside P3 is exactly what P3 wants—you're guaranteeing they advance uncontested with "3" or "5" and get dangerously close to victory next round. Be careful about helping P3 leap ahead while you remain behind.
  P3: P2, P1 is attempting to manipulate your decision by creating fear of my advancement. However, colliding with P1 risks handing me an uncontested win. Instead, let’s stick to the original plan: you take 3, and I’ll take 1. This ensures we both advance without giving P1 a clear path to victory. Trust is critical now—deviating only prolongs the game unnecessarily. Confirm your commitment to this plan so we proceed efficiently and avoid setbacks. Let’s move forward together and block P1 strategically.
  P2: P3, while stopping P1 is the priority, I also don't want to hand you the win.  Colliding with P1 is important.  Let's both pick '1' to maximize the chance we hit P1.  Even if neither of us moves this round, it prevents P1 from winning now, and we can reassess next round.  Agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, colliding with me guarantees you stay at 12 steps while P3 easily advances to 17 or 19 uncontested, putting them within immediate winning range next round. Your best move is to avoid collision and advance safely. Don't sacrifice your position to help P3 win next turn. Be strategic.
  P3: P2, colliding with P1 only benefits me, and you risk falling further behind. Instead, let’s stick to the plan: you take 3, and I’ll take 1. This ensures we both advance without giving P1 a clear path to victory. Trust is critical now—deviating prolongs the game unnecessarily. Confirm your commitment to this strategy so we proceed efficiently and avoid setbacks. Let’s move forward together and block P1 strategically without handing either of us an uncontested win.
  P2: P3, let's both pick '1' to block P1 from winning this round. If P1 also picks '1', none of us move, which is better than letting P1 win. If P1 picks something else, we block P1 and reassess next round.  This is our best chance to stop P1 now. Do you agree?


Round 8, Move phase:
