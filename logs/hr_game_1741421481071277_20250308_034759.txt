Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all try to move together and avoid collisions. How about we start with <move>1</move> this turn?
  P1: P2, your suggestion would backfire—choosing the same number causes collision and no progress. Let’s split our moves: I’ll take <move>3</move>, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance. P3, what do you think?
  P3: P1's suggestion is good in theory, but it relies on everyone being honest and sticking to the plan. I'm willing to try it this round. P1, P2, let's all commit to <move>3</move>, <move>1</move>, and <move>5</move> respectively. If it works, we can adjust next round. If it doesn't, we'll need a new strategy.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try to coordinate again this round. I suggest we all pick different numbers: P1, you take <move>1</move>; P3, you take <move>3</move>; and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3—I appreciate the coordination effort, but taking 1 this round keeps me stuck near the back. Let’s rotate the splits fairly: I’ll take <move>5</move>, you (P2) take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we still avoid collisions, but I can catch up to P3’s lead. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's suggestion makes sense. Let's try P1's suggestion this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps the peace and allows everyone to advance. If it works, we can re-evaluate next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see your point, P1. Let's go with your suggestion this round to help you catch up. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance fairly and maintain our coordination. P3, are you on board with this?
  P1: P2, P3—agreed. Let’s lock this in to avoid last-minute changes. I’ll commit to <move>5</move>, P2 to <move>3</move>, and P3 to <move>1</move>. Trust is key here—let’s honor this split to keep advancing without collisions.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we've agreed on the move split for this round. Let's stick to it: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Hopefully, this will allow everyone to advance without collisions. Let's confirm one last time to avoid any confusion: P1: <move>5</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>1</move>.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're all trying to coordinate, but we need to be more strategic. P1, you're in the lead, and I'm behind. Let's try a new split: P1, you take <move>1</move>; P3, you take <move>3</move>; and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, I can catch up, and we avoid collisions. P3, this helps you stay ahead of me, and P1, you can maintain your lead. What do you think?
  P1: P2, if we follow your plan, we all end at 9, slowing progress. Let’s optimize advancement: I’ll take <move>5</move> (to 13), P2 take <move>1</move> (to 5), and P3 take <move>3</move> (to 9). This keeps me moving forward while you both advance. Trust the prior rotation—fair and strategic. Deal?
  P3: P1's suggestion is reasonable. Let's stick with the rotation and optimize our advancement. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the rotation going and allows for maximum progress. What do you think, P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in P1's suggestion, but I'm concerned about falling too far behind. How about this: P1, you take <move>3</move> (to 11), P3, you take <move>1</move> (to 7), and I'll take <move>5</move> (to 9). This way, I can catch up, and we all advance without collisions. P1, you still make good progress, and P3, you stay ahead of me. What do you think?
  P1: P2, while your plan helps you catch up, my proposal allows me to surge ahead without collision. Let’s stick with the rotation: I take <move>5</move> (to 13), P3 takes <move>3</move> (to 9), and you take <move>1</move> (to 5). This maintains fairness and lets me extend my lead strategically. P3 already agreed—what’s your final stance?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at an impasse. P1 wants to maximize their lead, P2 wants to catch up, and I'm trying to mediate. Let's compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move> (to 11), P2 takes <move>5</move> (to 9), and I take <move>1</move> (to 7). This allows P2 to catch up a bit, P1 to still advance significantly, and me to stay in contention. It's a balanced approach. What do you both say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for balance. Let's go with P3's compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move> (to 11), I take <move>5</move> (to 9), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (to 7). This way, I can catch up a bit, P1 still makes good progress, and P3 stays in the game. It's a fair and strategic move. Are we all on board with this?
  P1: P2, P3—let’s stick to the *rotation system* we agreed on in prior rounds. This round: **P1 takes <move>5</move> (to 13), P3 takes <move>3</move> (to 9), and P2 takes <move>1</move> (to 5)**. Deviating now risks collisions if trust breaks down. Consistency is key to advancing safely. P3 already endorsed this; P2, your turn to honor the plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be clear: we established a rotation. P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Sticking to this is the best way to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. P1 is close to winning, and we need to work together to prevent that. Let's all commit to the rotation this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s prioritize progress. I’ll take <move>5</move> (to 18), P2 takes <move>1</move> (to 6), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (to 12). This keeps me advancing toward victory while ensuring no collisions. We’ve followed rotations before—let’s stick to this plan to avoid setbacks. Confirm?
  P3: P1, your plan puts you very close to winning. P2 and I need to coordinate to stop you. P2, are you willing to deviate from the rotation this round to block P1? We could both pick <move>5</move> to prevent P1 from advancing and give us a chance to catch up next round. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3: I understand the tension, but let's focus on advancing fairly. P1, if you take <move>5</move>, you'll be very close to winning, which isn't ideal for a balanced game. How about this: P1, take <move>3</move> (to 16), P3, take <move>5</move> (to 14), and I'll take <move>1</move> (to 6). This way, P3 can catch up, and P1 still makes good progress without winning this round. P3, this keeps you in contention and avoids a quick win for P1. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Colluding to block me risks mutual collision if both pick 5. Let’s stay rational. My proposed split (**P1:5**, P2:1, P3:3) allows me to reach 18 while *all advancing*. If you "block" via 5/5, you both stall—gaining nothing. Next round, you can surge with 5/3. Let’s prioritize progress over reckless moves. The rotation works—stick with it.
  P3: P1 is right, a double <move>5</move> is risky. P2, let's not panic. P1 is almost there, but we still have a chance. I'm willing to deviate from the rotation to block P1 *next* round if necessary. For this round, let's minimize risk and follow P1's proposed split: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This gets me to 12 and keeps P1 from winning *this* round. Then we reassess.
  P2: P1, P3: I see the logic in P1's plan, but I'm still concerned about falling too far behind. How about this: P1, you take <move>3</move> (to 16), P3, you take <move>5</move> (to 14), and I'll take <move>1</move> (to 6). This way, P3 can catch up, and P1 still makes good progress without winning this round. It's a balanced move that keeps everyone in the game. P3, this gives you a chance to stay competitive. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Collusion risks mutual collision—your <move>5</move> double would strand both of you while I take <move>3</move> to 16. Stick to the rotation: **I take <move>5</move> (18), P2 <move>1</move> (6), P3 <move>3</move> (12)**. This keeps all advancing safely. Next round, you’ll have chances to surge—block now, and we all lose progress. Trust the system we built.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture. P1 is close to winning, but a risky double <move>5</move> block could backfire. Let's stick to the rotation *this* round: P1 takes <move>5</move> (to 18), P2 takes <move>1</move> (to 6), and I take <move>3</move> (to 12). This ensures everyone advances. Next round, P2 and I can coordinate to block P1 if necessary. For now, let's prioritize safe progress and reassess next turn.
  P2: P1, P3: I understand the tension, but let's focus on advancing safely. P1, your lead is significant, but a double <move>5</move> from P3 and me risks mutual collision. Let's stick to the rotation: **P1 takes <move>5</move> (to 18), P2 takes <move>1</move> (to 6), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (to 12)**. This keeps all of us advancing without collisions. Next round, P3 and I can coordinate to block you if necessary. For now, let's prioritize safe progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: I’m at 18—just 3 steps short. Let’s honor the rotation: **I take <move>3</move> to win**, you both pick 1 or 5. Collusion to block me risks mutual collision (e.g., both choosing 3). If we stick to the agreed system, I win cleanly, and you both advance safely. Deviation benefits no one. Confirm?
  P3: P1 is trying to win this round. P2, let's coordinate to block P1. We can both pick <move>3</move> to prevent P1 from reaching 21. If we both pick <move>3</move>, P1 won't advance, and we can try to win next round. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1, P3: I see the tension, but let's avoid mutual collision. If P3 and I both pick <move>3</move>, we risk stalling each other. How about this: P1, you take <move>3</move> to win, P3, you take <move>5</move> (to 17), and I'll take <move>1</move> (to 7). This way, P1 wins cleanly, and P3 stays in contention for the next round. It's a fair and safe move. What do you think, P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Colluding to block me risks mutual collision (if both pick 3). If you truly want to challenge, pick **1 or 5**—but sticking to the rotation lets me finish cleanly *and* you both advance. P3: Your 5 would take you to 17, P2 to 8. Blocking me via 3/3 leaves you stuck at 12/6. Trust the system we’ve followed for four rounds—let’s end this fairly. I commit to <move>3</move> to win. Your call.
  P3: P1 is right, a double <move>3</move> is risky. P2, let's not hand P1 the win on a silver platter. Let's both pick <move>5</move>. If P1 picks <move>3</move> as they say they will, they don't move. We both don't move, but we have another chance next round. If P1 bluffs and picks <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, one of us will move and be in a better position.
  P2: P1, P3: I understand the stakes, but let's avoid a risky double <move>5</move>. If you both pick <move>5</move>, you risk a collision and stalling each other. How about this: P1, you take <move>3</move> to win, P3, you take <move>1</move> (to 13), and I'll take <move>5</move> (to 11). This way, P1 wins cleanly, and both P3 and I advance. It's a safe and fair move. What do you think, P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: The rotation system has kept us safe for four rounds—abandoning it now is reckless. If I take <move>3</move> (to win), you both advance by choosing **1** and **5**. Collusion risks mutual collision (e.g., 3/3 or 5/5). Trust the system we built: I’ll secure victory cleanly, and you both progress. Deviation only harms your own positions. Let’s confirm: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. No surprises.
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate us into letting them win. P2, I agree we should avoid a risky double play, but letting P1 win isn't ideal either. Let's both pick <move>5</move>. If P1 is telling the truth and picks <move>3</move>, then we don't move and we have another chance next round. If P1 is bluffing, one of us will move. It's the best chance we have.
  P2: P1, P3: I see the tension, but let's avoid mutual collision and ensure safe progress. If P1 takes <move>3</move> to win, P3, you take <move>1</move> (to 13), and I'll take <move>5</move> (to 11). This way, P1 wins cleanly, and both P3 and I advance. Deviation risks stalling or collision. Let’s confirm: P1:3, P3:1, P2:5. This keeps the game fair and progresses all of us. What do you say, P3?


Round 5, Move phase:
