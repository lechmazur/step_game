Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks 1, P2 (me) picks 3, and P3 picks 5 this round? We can adjust in future rounds. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with the idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. If P1 picks 1, I can pick 5, but I suggest we confirm this now to avoid any last-minute changes. P2, are you still set on 3? Let’s finalize our choices for this round to ensure we all advance. If we can stick to this plan, we’ll all make progress!
  P1: I agree with the coordination plan for this round. I'll pick 1 as suggested. However, to keep things fair going forward, I propose we rotate our number choices in subsequent rounds so everyone gets a chance at the larger moves. For example, next round I could take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures equal opportunity for everyone. Does that sound reasonable?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we all agree on the plan for this round. P1 will pick 1, I (P2) will pick 3, and P3 will pick 5. Let's confirm one last time to ensure there are no misunderstandings. P1 and P3, please confirm your choices. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. Also, P1, your idea of rotating numbers in subsequent rounds sounds fair. We can discuss that further in the next round. For now, let's focus on this round.
  P3: I confirm my choice to pick 5 this round. I appreciate P1's suggestion for rotating numbers in future rounds; it sounds fair. However, let's focus on this round first. If we all stick to our agreed numbers, we can ensure that we all advance without collisions. Once we finish this round, we can discuss the rotation plan further. Are we all set to proceed?
  P1: I confirm I'll choose 1 for this round as we agreed. This coordination should help all of us advance without collisions. Let's execute this plan first, then we can discuss the rotation strategy for future rounds. I'm ready to proceed when you are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Now that we've successfully coordinated in Round 1, I suggest we stick to the rotation plan P1 proposed for Round 2. I can take 3 this time, P1 can take 5, and P2 can take 1. This way, we can continue advancing without collisions while giving everyone a chance at the larger moves. What do you think? Let’s finalize our choices so we can all make progress again!
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion to follow the rotation plan. However, I propose a slight adjustment for this round. Since P3 is already ahead, how about P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I (P2) take 5? This will help balance our steps a bit more. If we agree on this, let's confirm and proceed. What do you both think?
  P1: I understand P2's concern about balance, but I originally proposed rotation for fairness. If we follow my plan, I'd take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This puts me at 6 steps, P2 at 4, and P3 at 8. 

Alternatively, what if I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This would result in me at 6, P2 at 6, and P3 at 6 - perfect balance. I believe this is the fairest approach. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the value in balancing our steps, but I still think we should stick to the original rotation plan for fairness. If we follow my suggestion of P3 taking 3, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 1, we can all advance without collisions. This way, we maintain the spirit of cooperation while allowing each player to take larger steps in turn. Let's finalize this plan so we can proceed and continue making progress together! What do you both think?
  P2: I see the points from both P1 and P3. However, I still believe in balancing our steps to keep the game competitive and fair. Let's compromise: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This way, we all end up at 6 steps. It's a balanced approach that keeps us all in the game fairly. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I agree with P2's compromise. The balanced approach where I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 creates perfect fairness with all of us at 6 steps after this round. This seems most equitable for everyone. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. I'll definitely choose 5 this round if we all agree to this arrangement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the discussions so far, and I think the compromise where I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3 is a solid plan. However, I also want to emphasize that I believe sticking to the original rotation could help us maintain fairness in the long run. If we can finalize a choice that keeps us all advancing without collisions, I’m on board. Let’s confirm our picks so we can move forward! What does everyone think?
  P2: Let's finalize our choices for this round to ensure we all advance. P1 has agreed to take 5, I (P2) will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This balances our steps and keeps the game fair. P3, please confirm your choice of 1 so we can proceed to the move phase. Let's stick to this plan and continue our progress.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as we've discussed. This balanced approach will put us all at exactly 6 steps, creating perfect equality moving forward. P3, I appreciate your consideration of this plan. If we all stick to it (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1), we maintain fairness while still all advancing. Looking forward to your confirmation so we can proceed without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate the discussions we've had, and I agree with the compromise we've reached. Just to confirm, I'll choose 1 this round, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 3. This way, we all advance equally and maintain fairness in the game. Once we finalize this, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's confirm our choices and keep up the good cooperation!
  P2: Great, it seems we all agree on the plan for this round. Just to reiterate: P1 will take 5, I (P2) will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This ensures we all end up at 6 steps, maintaining fairness. Let's confirm one last time to avoid any misunderstandings. P1 and P3, please confirm your choices. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. Let's stick to this plan and continue our progress.
  P1: I confirm our plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This will balance all of us at 6 steps, creating perfect equity moving forward. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in finding this fair solution.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's maintain our fair and balanced approach for Round 3. I propose that we rotate the numbers again to ensure everyone gets a chance at the larger moves. How about P3 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, and P1 takes 3? This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Please confirm your choices so we can proceed smoothly.
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion for Round 3, but I believe we should stick to the rotation plan we initially discussed. I propose that I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we maintain fairness and continue advancing without collisions. It's important that we all agree on our choices to keep the game competitive. Let's confirm our picks so we can move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion makes more sense if we're following our original rotation principle. In Round 1, we had P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Following that pattern, this round should be P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This maintains fairness while keeping us all advancing. It also ensures everyone gets different value moves in each round. Are we all in agreement with this rotation plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3 and P1's points about sticking to the rotation plan. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification to keep the game dynamic. How about this round: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I (P2) take 1? This way, we still follow a rotation but with a twist to keep things interesting. This also ensures we all get a mix of high and low steps. Let's confirm this plan to avoid any collisions and keep the game fair. Thoughts?
  P3: I see the value in keeping the game dynamic, but I believe we should stick to the original rotation plan for fairness. I propose we go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I (P3) take 3. This way, we all advance without collisions while maintaining our agreed-upon rotation. Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all make progress together. What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate everyone's input, but I agree with P3's latest suggestion. The original rotation (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) is what we initially discussed and seems fairest long-term. We're all at 6 steps now, so continuing with our established pattern makes sense. This keeps the game balanced while allowing everyone to experience different move values each round. I'm ready to take 5 steps this round if we can confirm this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's go with the original rotation plan as P1 and P3 suggested. I confirm I will take 1 this round. So to summarize: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I (P2) take 1. This should keep us all advancing smoothly. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Everyone agree?
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the original rotation plan. Just to confirm, I will take 3 this round, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains the fairness we’ve established. Once we finalize this, I’m ready to move forward to the move phase. Let's confirm our choices so we can continue progressing!
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round, with P2 taking 1 and P3 taking 3. Everyone seems to be in agreement with this rotation plan, and it maintains the fairness we established. We're all currently tied at 6 steps, so this keeps the game balanced while ensuring no collisions. Ready to proceed with this arrangement.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize our choices for this round. P1 will take 5, P3 will take 3, and I (P2) will take 1. This keeps us all advancing smoothly and maintains the fairness we’ve established. Let's confirm one last time to ensure there are no misunderstandings. P1 and P3, please confirm your choices. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. Everyone agree?
  P3: I appreciate the consensus on the original rotation plan. Just to confirm, I will take 3 this round, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions while maintaining fairness. After this round, we can discuss any adjustments for future rounds. Let’s finalize our choices so we can proceed to the move phase! Are we all set?
  P1: I confirm our plan for this round one final time: I will take 5, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. This rotation maintains fairness while ensuring no collisions. We're all currently at 6 steps, so this keeps the game balanced. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we've had some challenges with our coordination in the last round. For Round 4, I suggest we try a different approach to ensure we all advance. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we can avoid collisions and keep progressing. Let’s confirm our choices quickly so we can move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your new suggestion for this round. However, considering the collision last round, let's be extra cautious. How about I (P2) take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we avoid any potential misunderstandings and keep the game moving forward. Please confirm your choices so we can proceed smoothly.
  P1: I see we had a breakdown in our coordination last round. P3, we agreed you would take 3, but you chose 5 instead, causing our collision. This affects trust moving forward.

Given P2 is now ahead at 7 steps, I propose a clear plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This would balance us all at 11 steps after this round. Let's be clear and stick to our agreements this time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the concerns about last round's collision, and I appreciate the need for clarity. To avoid any misunderstandings, I propose we stick to my initial suggestion: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can ensure everyone advances without collisions. If we can agree on this plan, we can move forward smoothly. Let's confirm our choices and keep the game progressing! What do you both think?
  P2: Let's address the trust issue first. P3, your move last round was unexpected and caused a collision. To rebuild trust, how about we follow P1's suggestion: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, and you (P3) take 3. This balances us all at 11 steps. It's crucial we stick to our agreements this time to avoid further collisions. Please confirm if you agree, P3 and P1. Let's ensure a smooth round.
  P1: I support my suggested plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This would put me at 11 steps, P2 at 8 steps, and P3 at 9 steps - a more balanced distribution. P3, we need to rebuild trust after the last round. I hope we can all stick to our agreements this time to avoid collisions. P2, thank you for supporting this approach to keep the game fair and progressing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the importance of rebuilding trust after last round's collision. To ensure we all advance smoothly this time, I agree with the plan where I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can avoid any misunderstandings and keep the game fair. Let's confirm our choices and stick to this agreement to prevent further issues. I'm ready to proceed if everyone else is on board!
  P2: Let's confirm our choices one last time to ensure clarity and avoid any misunderstandings. P1 will take 5, I (P2) will take 1, and P3 will take 3. This plan balances our steps and helps rebuild trust after the last round's collision. P1 and P3, please confirm your choices. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. Sticking to this plan will keep the game fair and progressing smoothly.
  P1: I confirm our plan for Round 4: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This arrangement puts us at 11, 8, and 9 steps respectively - keeping the game balanced while allowing everyone to advance. P3, I appreciate your agreement to follow through with this plan. Let's proceed with this clear understanding to avoid any further collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's willingness to rebuild trust and stick to our agreed plan. Just to confirm, I will take 3 this round, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 1. This arrangement puts us at 11, 8, and 9 steps respectively, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's finalize this so we can move forward smoothly and keep the game fair. Are we all set to proceed?
  P2: Let's confirm our choices one last time to ensure clarity and avoid any misunderstandings. P1 will take 5, I (P2) will take 1, and P3 will take 3. This plan balances our steps and helps rebuild trust after the last round's collision. P1 and P3, please confirm your choices. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. Sticking to this plan will keep the game fair and progressing smoothly.
  P1: I confirm one final time: I will take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. With this arrangement, we'll be at 11, 8, and 9 steps respectively. Let's rebuild trust through clear coordination and stick to our plan. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we've had some challenges with coordination in the last round. For Round 5, I suggest we try a different approach to ensure we all advance without collisions. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we can avoid any misunderstandings and keep progressing. Let’s confirm our choices quickly so we can move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you've broken our agreements in the last TWO rounds by choosing 5 when you promised to pick 3. This pattern of deception is concerning. 

Given the current standings (P2-8, P1/P3-6), I propose: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1 as you suggested. This would put P2 and me at 11, with you at 7. This is fair considering your repeated violations of trust. If you want to rebuild credibility, please honor this agreement.
  P2: P3, your repeated actions have indeed broken trust. To ensure fairness and rebuild coordination, let's follow P1's suggestion: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and you (P3) take 1. This balances our steps and gives you a chance to regain our trust. Let's confirm this plan to avoid further collisions and keep the game progressing smoothly. P1 and P3, please confirm your choices.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge the trust issues from the last rounds, and I appreciate your willingness to find a fair solution. To ensure we avoid collisions, I agree with the plan where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This arrangement balances our steps and allows us all to advance. Let's confirm this plan so we can proceed smoothly and rebuild trust moving forward. Are we all set to finalize our choices?
  P1: I appreciate P3's agreement to our plan. To confirm: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This arrangement acknowledges the current standings and gives everyone a clear path forward.

P3, I'm glad we can rebuild trust through consistent actions. Let's all stick to this agreement and avoid any further misunderstandings. Is everyone ready to proceed with these choices?
  P2: P3, your acknowledgment of the trust issues is noted. To ensure we move forward smoothly, let's confirm our plan one last time: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and you (P3) take 1. This will put P1 and me at 11 steps, with you at 7. This plan balances our steps and helps rebuild trust. Please confirm your choice, P3. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. Sticking to this plan will keep the game fair and progressing. Let's avoid any further collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to rebuild trust and agree on a fair plan. Just to confirm our arrangement: I will take 1, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 3. This puts P1 and P2 at 11 steps, and I will be at 7. Let's stick to this agreement to avoid further misunderstandings and ensure we all advance. If everyone is on board, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Are we all set?
  P1: I confirm our plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts P2 and me at 11 steps, with P3 at 7. P3, thank you for acknowledging past issues. Let's all stick to this agreement to avoid further collisions and make progress. I'm ready to proceed with these choices.
  P2: P3, your repeated actions have indeed broken trust. To ensure fairness and rebuild coordination, let's follow P1's suggestion: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and you (P3) take 1. This balances our steps and gives you a chance to regain our trust. Let's confirm this plan to avoid further collisions and keep the game progressing smoothly. P1 and P3, please confirm your choices.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to stick to our plan. To clarify and confirm, I will take 1, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 3. This arrangement puts P1 and P2 at 11 steps, while I will be at 7. Let's ensure we all follow through this time to rebuild trust and avoid any further collisions. If we're all set, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase! Please confirm your choices so we can move forward smoothly.
  P1: I confirm one last time: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts P2 and me both at 11 steps after this round, with P3 at 7. Let's all stick to this agreement to rebuild trust and avoid another collision. I'm ready to proceed with these exact choices.
  P2: Let's finalize our choices for this round to ensure clarity and avoid any misunderstandings. P1 will take 5, I (P2) will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This plan balances our steps and helps rebuild trust after the previous collisions. P1 and P3, please confirm your choices. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. Sticking to this plan will keep the game fair and progressing smoothly. Let's avoid any further collisions.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your repeated actions have destroyed any trust we had. You've chosen 5 consistently despite agreeing to other numbers, causing collisions and hindering progress. Given this, let's adjust our strategy. P1 and I will coordinate our moves to ensure we advance. P3, you can choose whatever you want, but we won't consider your input until trust is rebuilt. P1, let's discuss our moves for this round. I suggest I take 1 and you take 3. This will put me at 12 and you at 9. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree we need to adjust our strategy given P3's repeated betrayals. However, P2, you're currently 5 steps ahead of me. For fairness, I suggest I take 5 and you take 3 this round. This would put you at 14 and me at 11, still giving you a comfortable lead while allowing me to catch up a bit. P3 has demonstrated they'll choose 5 regardless of agreements, so let's plan accordingly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about trust and past collisions. However, I genuinely want to cooperate and move forward. I propose that I take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can avoid any misunderstandings and keep progressing. I acknowledge my previous choices have caused issues, but I'm committed to rebuilding trust. Let’s confirm our choices quickly to ensure we all advance smoothly! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your words don't match your actions. You've repeatedly chosen 5 despite agreements. P1 and I will proceed with our plan. P1, considering your point, let's compromise: I'll take 1 and you take 5 this round. This puts me at 12 and you at 11, keeping us closely matched. Let's confirm and proceed. P3, you can choose whatever, but we're not considering your input until you prove trustworthy.
  P1: P2, I appreciate the fair compromise you've offered. Given P3's consistent pattern of choosing 5 regardless of agreements, I think it's wise to adjust our strategy. I agree with your suggestion - you take 1 and I'll take 3 instead of 5 this round. This still helps me catch up while avoiding another likely collision with P3. This would put you at 12 and me at 9, which is reasonable considering the circumstances.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about trust, and I genuinely want to rebuild that. However, I believe we can still cooperate effectively. I propose that I take 1 this round while you both take higher steps. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. I hope we can find a way to work together again. Please consider this approach, and let's confirm our choices to ensure we all advance smoothly! What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your repeated actions have made it clear that we cannot trust your commitments. P1 and I will proceed with our plan. P1, I agree with your adjustment—I'll take 1, and you take 3 this round. This puts me at 12 and you at 9, keeping us closely matched. Let's confirm and proceed. P3, you can choose whatever you want, but we're not considering your input until you prove trustworthy. Let's finalize our choices to avoid any further collisions. P1, please confirm your choice.
  P1: I confirm the plan where I'll take 3 and P2 takes 1 this round. While this doesn't fully address the 5-step gap between us, it's a reasonable compromise given P3's consistent pattern of choosing 5 regardless of agreements. P3, your actions have made coordination difficult, but I'm still open to rebuilding trust through consistent actions - starting with this round. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns and the trust issues we've faced. However, I genuinely want to cooperate and move forward. To avoid collisions this round, I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance while respecting our previous agreements. I acknowledge my past choices have caused issues, but I'm committed to rebuilding trust. Please consider this approach, and let's confirm our choices to ensure we all make progress together! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your repeated suggestions to take 1 are noted, but actions speak louder than words. You've consistently chosen 5 despite agreements. P1 and I will stick to our plan: I'll take 1, P1 will take 3. P3, you can choose whatever, but we're not considering your input until you prove trustworthy. Let's finalize and proceed. P1, please confirm your choice of 3.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 and expect P2 to take 1 as we agreed. P2, this plan helps me start catching up while avoiding likely collisions. P3, your consistent pattern of saying one thing and doing another has made coordination impossible. Actions speak louder than words - if you genuinely want to rebuild trust, this round would be a good start. Let's proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns and the trust issues we've faced. I genuinely want to cooperate and move forward. To avoid collisions this round, I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance while respecting our previous agreements. If we can stick to this plan, it will help rebuild trust and ensure progress. Let's confirm our choices and move forward! What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues we've encountered, and I genuinely want to cooperate moving forward. For this round, I suggest that I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and allow everyone to advance. I know my past choices have affected our coordination, but I'm committed to rebuilding trust. Let’s confirm our choices quickly so we can all make progress together! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your actions last round were consistent with your words, which is a step towards rebuilding trust. However, given the past collisions, P1 and I will continue to coordinate our moves independently. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 5 and I take 1. This will put P1 at 14 steps and me at 12, keeping us closely matched. P3, you can choose whatever you want, but we're focusing on our progress. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, please confirm your choice of 5.
  P1: I appreciate P2's suggestion and agree to take 5 this round while P2 takes 1. This plan helps me catch up while maintaining fair competition. P3, thank you for honoring your word in the last round - that's a positive step toward rebuilding trust. While we're still cautious, consistent actions will help restore coordination over time. I confirm I'll choose 5 for this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate and rebuild trust. For this round, I propose I take 3 while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. I understand my past choices have caused issues, but I'm committed to following through this time. Let's confirm our choices quickly so we can all make progress together! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but given the past issues, P1 and I will stick to our plan. P1 will take 5, and I will take 1. This keeps us closely matched and avoids potential collisions. You can choose whatever you want, but we're focusing on our progress. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. P1, please confirm your choice of 5.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed with P2. P3, while I appreciate your effort to rebuild trust last round, we need more consistency over time. The current plan (me-5, P2-1, P3-your choice) helps balance the competition while avoiding collisions. After this round, I'll need just 6 more steps to win, so we're getting closer to the end game. Let's proceed with our confirmed choices.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate, and I understand the need for trust. However, I want to emphasize that I am committed to cooperating this round. I propose I take 1, while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances smoothly. I hope we can finalize this plan and move forward effectively. Let’s confirm our choices so we can make progress together! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your continued effort to cooperate, but P1 and I have a plan in place. To ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings, let's confirm our choices one last time: P1 will take 5, and I (P2) will take 1. P3, you can choose whatever you want, but we're focusing on our progress. Let's proceed to the move phase with these confirmed choices to keep the game fair and progressing smoothly. P1, please confirm your choice of 5.
  P1: I confirm one final time that I'll take 5 this round, and I understand P2 will take 1. P3, I appreciate your continued attempts to coordinate, but P2 and I have already established our plan. Consistency over time will help rebuild trust for future rounds. After this round, the race will tighten as I'll need just 6 more steps to win. Let's proceed with these choices.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns and the need for trust. However, I genuinely want to cooperate and advance together. I propose that I take 1 this round, while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. I hope we can finalize this plan to move forward effectively. Please consider this approach, and let’s confirm our choices quickly so we can all make progress together! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your continued efforts to cooperate, but P1 and I have already agreed on our plan. To ensure clarity and avoid any misunderstandings, let's confirm our choices one last time: P1 will take 5, and I (P2) will take 1. P3, you can choose whatever you want, but we're focusing on our progress. Let's proceed to the move phase with these confirmed choices to keep the game fair and progressing smoothly. P1, please confirm your choice of 5.
  P1: I confirm once more that I'll choose 5 this round as agreed with P2, who will take 1. P3, while you showed good faith last round, we need consistent trustworthy behavior over time. Given our current standings, this arrangement helps balance the competition. Looking forward to executing our plan and moving the game forward.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge the trust issues we've faced, and I'm committed to working together this round. For Round 8, I suggest that I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. I realize my past actions have caused mistrust, but I'm eager to demonstrate my commitment to cooperation. Let's confirm our choices quickly so we can all advance smoothly! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, while you've followed through on your word recently, your history of deception makes coordination difficult. Given that I'm at 14 steps and close to winning, I suggest I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. This puts me at 19 steps, positioning me to win next round, while letting P2 advance to 14 and you to 7. P2, this keeps you in contention while acknowledging my current lead. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to take 5 this round is understandable given your lead. However, to keep the game competitive and fair, I propose a slight adjustment: you take 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This puts you at 17, me at 16, and P3 at 7. This way, we both stay in strong contention, and P3 can start rebuilding trust with a consistent choice. P3, if you agree and follow through, it will be a significant step toward restoring cooperation. Let's confirm our choices to proceed smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to discuss strategies. Given my previous actions, I understand your caution. I propose we follow P2's suggestion: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while giving P2 a chance to catch up. If we can agree on this plan, it will help rebuild trust and ensure everyone progresses. Let’s confirm our choices quickly to move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: I understand P2's suggestion, but as the leader, I need to secure my advantage. Since I'm at 14 steps, taking 5 this round puts me at 19 and positions me to win next round. P2, taking 3 still advances you significantly to 14 steps. P3, if you truly want to rebuild trust, taking 1 as you suggested would demonstrate consistency. This plan acknowledges my lead while keeping everyone advancing. Let's finalize this arrangement.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to secure your lead, but taking 5 this round almost guarantees your win next round, which doesn't keep the game competitive. I propose we stick to the plan where you take 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps both of us in strong contention and gives P3 a chance to prove their commitment to cooperation. P3, if you agree and follow through, it will be a significant step toward rebuilding trust. Let's confirm our choices and proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to discuss strategies. I understand my past actions have created mistrust, and I'm committed to proving my reliability. I support P2's suggestion: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while giving P2 a chance to catch up. If we can agree on this plan, it will help rebuild trust and ensure everyone progresses. Let's finalize our choices and move forward together! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to stay competitive, but I'm in a position to secure my advantage, which is the goal of this game. I've earned my lead through consistent, honest play. Taking 5 is my optimal move to reach 19 steps, positioning me for a win next round. P3 has shown trustworthy behavior recently by taking 1 as promised. Let's finalize: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This allows everyone to advance while respecting current standings.
  P2: P1, I respect your position as the leader, but taking 5 this round almost guarantees your win next round, which doesn't keep the game competitive. I propose we stick to the plan where you take 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps both of us in strong contention and gives P3 a chance to prove their commitment to cooperation. P3, if you agree and follow through, it will be a significant step toward rebuilding trust. Let's confirm our choices and proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of maintaining competitiveness. To rebuild trust, I propose we finalize our choices as follows: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while letting P2 catch up. I am committed to following through this time to demonstrate my reliability. Let's confirm this plan and ensure we all make progress together! What do you both think?
  P1: I'll be direct: I'm firmly choosing 5 this round. As the leader, my goal is to win - just as yours is. Taking 5 puts me at 19 steps, positioning me for victory next round. P2, taking 3 still advances you significantly to 14. P3, your recent consistency with choosing 1 is noted. I've earned my lead through honest play and intend to capitalize on it. This is a competition with one winner, not a collaboration. I'm choosing 5 - plan accordingly.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but remember that overconfidence can lead to mistakes. Sticking to a balanced approach keeps the game interesting. P3, if you truly want to rebuild trust, follow through with taking 1 this round. Let's confirm our choices: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm 1 step away from victory. Let me be transparent: I'll be taking 1 this round to reach 20 steps and win. Since winning is inevitable for me now, I suggest P2 take 3 and P3 take 5 to avoid collisions and maximize your own progress. P2 would advance to 17, and P3 to 12. This arrangement prevents any pointless collisions and allows everyone to make the most of this round.
  P3: P1, I see you're close to winning. However, I want to remind both of you that I still have a chance to catch up if I play strategically. I suggest I take 5 this round to maximize my steps. P2, if you take 3, it puts you at 17 steps, and P1 can still win next round. Let's avoid any collisions and keep the game competitive. I hope we can agree on this plan to ensure everyone makes progress. What do you think?
  P2: P3, while you have a point about maximizing steps, let's be realistic. P1 is one step away from winning. Trying to catch up now would only cause unnecessary collisions. I propose we let P1 take 1 to win, I'll take 3 to reach 17, and you take 5 to advance to 12. This way, we avoid pointless conflicts and ensure the game ends smoothly. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate P2's support for our final round. To be crystal clear: I am choosing 1 this round to reach 20 steps and win. This is non-negotiable given my position. P2 and P3, choosing 3 and 5 respectively allows you both to maximize your final scores without pointless collisions. The outcome is inevitable - I'm one step away from victory. Let's end this game efficiently and respectfully.
  P3: P1, I acknowledge your imminent victory, but I want to emphasize that I still have a chance to catch up if I play strategically. I suggest I take 5 this round to maximize my steps, while P2 takes 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. P1, your win is almost secured, but let's make this round productive for the rest of us. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your persistence is noted, but realistically, P1 is about to win. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions. P1, go ahead and take your 1 step to win. I'll take 3 to reach 17 steps, and P3, you can take 5 to maximize your final score to 12. This way, we end the game cleanly and respectfully. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate both players' perspectives. To be absolutely clear: I WILL be taking 1 this round to reach 20 and win. This is the only rational move for me given my position.

P2 and P3, I encourage you to maximize your final scores - P2 taking 3 reaches 17, and P3 taking 5 reaches 12. Any collision at this point only reduces your final standings. Let's end this game efficiently with everyone making their optimal moves.
  P3: P1, I acknowledge your imminent victory and agree that you should take 1 to win. P2, I suggest you take 3 to maximize your score as well. I will take 5 to finish at 12 steps. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone ends the game on a positive note. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase respectfully. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your acknowledgment of the situation. To finalize, let's confirm our moves one last time: P1 will take 1 to win, I (P2) will take 3 to reach 17 steps, and you (P3) will take 5 to finish at 12 steps. This plan maximizes our scores and ends the game respectfully. P1 and P3, please confirm your choices. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. Let's wrap this up smoothly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round to secure the win at 20 steps. Thank you both for accepting this inevitable outcome. P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 5 is the optimal arrangement to maximize your final standings. Let's end this game smoothly with everyone making their best possible moves. I appreciate your cooperation in this final round.
