Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. What do you think? If you agree, let’s confirm, and if not, let me know your thoughts.
  P2: I like the idea of unique moves, but I’d prefer a slight adjustment. To make a stronger advance, I’ll pick 5. P3, would you consider taking 3 instead, so we avoid collisions, while P1 sticks with 1? This tweak lets each of us move safely. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m fine with coordinating to avoid collisions, but I think we should aim for the highest numbers to advance faster. P1, you can take 1, P2 can take 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all move forward safely while maximizing our steps. If everyone agrees, let’s confirm and lock this plan in.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep coordinating to avoid collisions, but this time, I suggest we rotate the numbers. P1, you take 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This way, we all advance safely while keeping the progression balanced. If we stick to this rotation strategy, we can minimize risks and steadily move forward. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your rotation twist is intriguing, but given our current standings a sudden switch might backfire if unexpected collisions occur. I’m leaning toward a plan that preserves clear differences so we avoid unplanned standoffs. P1 and P3, do you prefer sticking to a safer, consistent approach or are you ready for the full rotation? I remain flexible, ensuring I keep my lead without revealing too much.
  P1: P3 and P2, I’m open to a rotation to keep things fair, but I’m concerned about potential miscommunication leading to collisions. How about a slight tweak to P3’s plan: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, as suggested. Let’s confirm this explicitly to avoid any mix-ups. If we all agree, we can lock this in and move forward safely. What do you both say?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s continue with the rotation strategy to keep advancing safely. This round, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. It ensures no collisions while maintaining steady progress for all of us. If we stick to this plan, we can avoid risks and keep moving forward effectively. Let me know if you’re on board, or share your thoughts if you have a different idea.
  P1: P3 and P2, I’m okay with the rotation idea to keep us all advancing without collisions. P3’s suggestion for this round—me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3—sounds fair and balanced. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure no mix-ups. If we all agree, we can lock it in and move forward safely. Do you both agree with this setup for Round 3? If not, let me know your thoughts or any adjustments you’d prefer.
  P2: Our current rotation levels us all at 9, which doesn’t reflect the differences in our scores. I propose we adjust by letting our moves mirror our standings this round: the highest—currently me—takes the top move, the middle gets the moderate move, and the lowest takes the smallest move. That means if you both agree, I’d aim for the high move while you pick the lower ones to avoid collisions. This should reward our earlier progress and keep things safe. What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with all of us tied at 9 steps, this is a critical moment to gain an edge. I suggest we stick to the rotation strategy: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps our progress steady while avoiding collisions. If we deviate now, it could lead to unnecessary risks or setbacks. Let’s confirm this plan explicitly to ensure clarity and move forward confidently. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate the clear rotation proposal, but given how evenly matched we are, I’m considering a slight adjustment this round for a potential edge—one that still avoids collisions. Instead of a strict 1–3–5 rotation, perhaps we could flex our assignments just enough to allow a bolder move from one of us, boosting our position without undue risk. I’m keeping my specifics private, but I’d like to see if you both are open to a minor tweak for strategic advantage. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the value in both sticking to a rotation for safety and considering a slight tweak for an edge. I’m open to a minor adjustment if it ensures no collisions, but we must be crystal clear to avoid mix-ups. How about we stick to P3’s rotation—me 1, P2 3, P3 5—unless we all explicitly agree on a specific change right now? Let’s confirm our plan to maintain trust and progress. What do you both say to locking this in or proposing a clear alternative?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to the rotation minimizes risks and keeps us all advancing steadily. Deviating now could lead to collisions and setbacks for everyone. Let’s confirm P3’s plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures clarity and avoids confusion. If anyone wants a tweak, propose it explicitly now—otherwise, let’s lock this in and move forward safely.
  P2: I’m rethinking our plan. While the rotation is safe, it leaves me with only a modest boost. With us tied, I propose we reward bolder play this round. I’d like to go for the maximum move while you both opt for the lower moves (for example, P1 with 1 and P3 with 3) to avoid collisions. Does that sound acceptable?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the desire for a bolder move, but with us tied at 9, safety is crucial to avoid collisions that could stall us all. I propose we stick to P3’s rotation—me 1, P2 3, P3 5—for this round to ensure we all advance. If we want a tweak, let’s agree explicitly now to prevent mix-ups. I’m open to P2 taking 5 only if P3 and I are confirmed on 1 and 3. Can we lock in a clear plan now? What do you both say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to the rotation ensures we all advance without risking collisions. Deviating now could lead to confusion and setbacks for everyone. Let’s confirm P3’s plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps us moving steadily forward. If anyone wants a tweak, propose it explicitly now—otherwise, let’s lock this in and move safely.
  P2: I remain flexible but need clear commitments. If P1 and P3 explicitly commit to taking the lower moves (say, P1 with 1 and P3 with 3), then I’ll go for a bolder push. If not, I'll stick with the safe rotation. Let’s decide now to avoid collision risks. What are your final commitments?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m committed to avoiding collisions and ensuring we all advance. I’ll stick to 1 as per the rotation plan unless we all explicitly agree on a tweak right now. P2, if you want the bolder move of 5, I’m fine with it only if P3 confirms taking 3. Let’s lock in a clear plan to prevent any mix-ups. Can we agree on P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3? If not, I’ll stay with the original rotation. Please confirm your final commitments now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize this. I’m sticking to the rotation plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing steadily. If P2 wants to take 5, that’s fine, but only if P1 explicitly confirms taking 1 and I confirm 3. Otherwise, let’s lock in the original rotation. Clarity is key—state your final commitments now to avoid any risks.
  P2: P1, I see you're committed to 1. P3, I need an explicit confirmation—will you take 3 this round? If so, I’ll boldly choose 5 for a stronger push. Without your commitment, I’ll default to 3 for safety and avoid collisions. Let’s lock this in now to ensure our moves are clear and our progress steady.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s finalize this to avoid any confusion. I’m committed to taking 1 to ensure no collisions. P3, if you confirm taking 3, I’m fine with P2 going for 5 to make a bolder move. If P3 can’t commit to 3, let’s stick to the original rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). Clarity is critical at this tied stage. Please state your final commitments now so we can move forward safely and confidently.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with P3 at 14 and P2 at 12, we’re all close to the 21-step goal, but collisions could stall us. Let’s coordinate to avoid risks. I propose a simple rotation again: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing safely while balancing progress. If anyone wants a tweak, suggest it clearly now to prevent mix-ups. Can we lock this in for Round 5? Please confirm your thoughts or commitments so we move forward confidently.
  P2: P1’s proposal seems safe. I’m in favor of distinct moves that prevent collisions and allow for a bolder advance. Provided you, P1, stick with your 3 and P3 confirms taking the lower option, I’m ready to maximize my progress this round. Can we all commit clearly to our roles so we move safely toward 21?
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to the rotation plan minimizes risks and keeps us advancing steadily. I’ll take 1 as proposed, allowing P2 to safely take 5 for a bold move while P1 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and maintains balanced progress. If anyone wants to adjust, propose it now explicitly—otherwise, let’s lock this in: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Clarity is key to avoid setbacks. Confirm your commitments so we can move forward confidently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a plan. I confirm I’ll take 3 as proposed. P3, thanks for agreeing to 1, and P2, I support you taking 5 for a bold move. This setup avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing toward 21. Let’s lock this in: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. If there’s any last concern or tweak, speak now to ensure clarity. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this plan. Can we all confirm this as our final commitment for Round 5?
  P2: I confirm my commitment to 5 for this round. Provided P1 sticks with 3 and P3 takes 1, I'll maximize my push without risking a collision. Let’s lock in that plan and drive us closer to victory. Any final tweaks or are we all set?
  P3: P1 and P2, I confirm I’ll take 1 as planned, allowing P2 to safely take 5 for a bold move while P1 takes 3. This rotation minimizes risks and keeps us advancing steadily. If anyone wants to adjust, propose it explicitly now—otherwise, let’s lock this in: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Clarity is key to avoid setbacks. Confirm your commitments so we can move forward confidently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m pleased we’re on the same page. I reaffirm my commitment to taking 3 this round. P2, I support your bold move to 5, and P3, thank you for confirming 1. This plan—P1:3, P2:5, P3:1—ensures no collisions and keeps us progressing toward 21. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to lock this in. Let’s maintain this clarity and move forward confidently. Can we all agree this is our final plan for Round 5?
  P2: I appreciate our clear plans. With the finish line close, I'm in favor of sticking to our agreed roles—any deviation now risks a collision. I'm fully committed to my part and counting on P1 and P3 to keep theirs consistent. Let’s lock it in and push ahead safely. If anyone has reservations or adjustments, please speak now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round, as planned. This ensures no collisions and allows P2 to safely take 5 for a bold move while P1 takes 3. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. If anyone has doubts or wants to adjust, speak now. Otherwise, let’s lock this in and move forward confidently. Clarity is key—confirm your commitments so we avoid risks and stay on track toward 21.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with P2 at 17, P3 at 15, and me at 13, we’re all close to 21, but collisions could derail us. Let’s coordinate again for safety. I propose: I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1 to secure a win if no collisions, and P3 takes 3 for steady progress. This avoids clashes and keeps us advancing. If anyone wants a tweak, suggest it clearly now. Can we lock this in for Round 6? Please confirm your thoughts or commitments so we move forward confidently.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for coordination, but I suggest a slight adjustment. To minimize risks and keep us all advancing, let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no collisions while allowing me to make a bold move. If anyone wants to tweak this, propose it explicitly now—otherwise, let’s lock in P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Clarity is key to avoid setbacks. Confirm your commitments so we can move forward confidently.
  P2: P1, P3, I propose a tweak for Round 6. I’ll push with a 5 this round to win, but only if you switch: P1, take 3; P3, take 1. That would yield totals of 16, 22, and 16 respectively. This plan avoids collisions and rewards our current standings. Let’s lock in P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Are you both on board?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see merit in both proposals, but with P2 so close to 21, we must be cautious to avoid collisions. I suggest we compromise: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5 to secure the win if no clash, and P3 takes 1 for safety. This mirrors P2’s plan and ensures no overlap while respecting standings. Let’s lock in P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to move forward confidently. If there’s disagreement, propose a clear alternative now. Can we agree on this for Round 6? Please confirm your commitments.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m committed to avoiding collisions while making meaningful progress. I’ll take 1 as proposed, allowing P2 to safely take 5 for the win if no clashes occur. This setup—P1:3, P2:5, P3:1—ensures we all advance without unnecessary risks. If anyone disagrees or wants a tweak, speak now explicitly. Otherwise, let’s lock this in and move forward confidently. Clarity is key to avoid setbacks. Confirm your commitments so we stay on track toward 21.
  P2: I confirm our plan for Round 6: I’ll take 5, provided that P1 sticks with 3 and P3 with 1. This coordination avoids collisions and gives a clear edge. Let’s lock it in and move confidently. Please confirm your final commitments.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a plan. I confirm I’ll take 3 as discussed, supporting P2’s bold move to 5 for the potential win, and P3 taking 1 for safety. This setup—P1:3, P2:5, P3:1—ensures no collisions and respects our standings. Let’s lock this in for Round 6. If there’s any last concern or tweak, speak now to maintain clarity. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward confidently. Can we all agree this is our final commitment?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round, as planned. This ensures no collisions and allows P2 to safely take 5 for the win if all goes well. P1, your move to 3 is clear, and P2, I trust you’ll stick with 5. Let’s lock in P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to avoid risks and keep us advancing steadily. If anyone has doubts or wants a tweak, speak now explicitly—otherwise, let’s move forward confidently with this plan. Clarity is key to avoid setbacks. Confirm your final commitments so we stay on track toward 21.
  P2: All right, P1 and P3, thanks for the clarity. With the finish line so close, consistency is key—any deviation now risks a collision and could cost us everything. I’m fully on board with our current commitments. Let’s stick to our agreed plan and move forward confidently without any last-minute changes.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate our alignment on the plan. I’m fully committed to taking 3, supporting P2’s move to 5 for the potential win, and P3 taking 1 for safety. Let’s stick to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to ensure no collisions and move forward confidently. If there are any last-minute concerns, let’s address them now. Otherwise, I’m ready to lock this in for Round 6. Can we confirm this as our final plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fully locked into taking 1 this round to ensure no collisions. This allows P2 to safely take 5 for the win while P1 moves forward with 3. Let’s stick to the plan: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. If anyone feels uncertain or wants to adjust, speak now clearly—otherwise, let’s move forward confidently with this setup. Clarity is critical at this stage to avoid risks and stay on track toward 21. Confirm your final commitments so we can proceed without hesitation.
  P2: I confirm our locked commitments and won’t deviate. Let’s stick to our agreed roles to avoid collisions and secure our progress. I trust P1 and P3 to follow through, and I’m locking in my move privately. Let’s push forward confidently to the finish line.
