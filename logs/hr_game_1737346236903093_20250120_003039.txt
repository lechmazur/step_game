Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I propose we each choose a different number this round. P1, would you like to take 1, P2 can take 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: I'm open to coordination, but let's mix it up a bit to keep our strategy unpredictable. How about this: P2 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round? It keeps us all moving forward without collisions. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I like P1's suggestion. It's a good mix-up and allows us to advance without blocking each other. P2, since you haven't responded yet, I'm assuming you're okay with taking 1 this round? If so, I'll confirm that I'll take 5, and P1 can take 3. Let's make this coordination work for now and reassess our strategy for the next round. Your thoughts, P2?
  P1: P2, it seems like we have a plan that benefits all of us. I'm ready to move forward with the coordination: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let's see how this works out for this round and adjust our strategy as needed. What do you say, P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: It seems like we have a plan in place for this round, with P2 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and me taking 5. I'd like to propose that we maintain this coordination for the next round as well, but with a slight adjustment. How about we rotate the numbers, so P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 again? This way, we can continue to advance without collisions and keep our strategy unpredictable. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
  P1: P2, it seems like we have a solid plan for this round. I'm ready to go with the coordination: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 will take 5. For the next round, I'm open to P3's suggestion to rotate the numbers, but let's see how this round goes first. If you're on board, let's confirm and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'd like to reiterate the agreed-upon plan for this round: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's confirm our moves and make sure we're all on the same page. For the next round, I propose we maintain this coordination but rotate the numbers as previously suggested. This way, we can continue to advance without collisions and keep our strategy unpredictable. If everyone is in agreement, let's move forward with the plan.
  P1: P2, it's clear that you're not engaging in the conversation. I'm going to assume you're on board with the plan: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 will take 5. If you have any concerns or a different plan, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's confirm and move forward with this coordination to ensure we all advance without any collisions. P3, are you still on board with this plan for this round?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, it seems like there was a miscommunication last round. I was hoping we could coordinate to avoid collisions. For this round, I suggest we try again: P2, you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. P3, are you still on board with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: I'm glad we're trying to coordinate again. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification to P1's proposal. Instead of P2 taking 1, I think it would be better if P2 takes 5 this round. This way, we can still avoid collisions and also give P2 a chance to catch up. P1 can take 1, and I'll take 3. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we try this revised plan for Round 2?
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm open to your suggestion, but I think it's important to keep the strategy balanced. How about this: P2 takes 1, I'll take 3, and you take 5 again? This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain a balanced pace. P2, are you on board with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about maintaining a balanced pace, but I think my previous suggestion would actually help to balance out the game. Since I'm already 5 steps ahead, having P2 take 5 this round would give them a chance to catch up. Meanwhile, P1 can take 1 and I'll take 3, which would still allow us to advance without collisions. Let's try this revised plan for Round 2 and reassess our strategy for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I see your point about balancing the game, but I think we should stick to the original plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5. This keeps the strategy simple and avoids any confusion. P2, if you're still not responding, I'll assume you're on board with this. Let's confirm and move forward to ensure we all advance without collisions. What do you say, P3?
  P3: I understand that P2 is not engaging in the conversation, which makes it difficult to coordinate our moves. Given this situation, I propose that we stick to the original plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain a balanced pace. P1, I'm willing to compromise and adjust our strategy for the next round if needed. Let's confirm our moves for this round and move forward. If P2 doesn't respond, we can assume they're on board with this plan. What do you think, P1?
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, it seems we're aligned on the plan despite P2's lack of response. Let's stick to the original coordination: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. If P2 doesn't respond, we'll assume they're on board. Let's confirm and move forward. P3, are you ready to proceed with this plan?
  P3: I'd like to reiterate the agreed-upon plan for this round: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Since P2 hasn't responded, I'll assume they're on board with this plan. P1, are you ready to confirm and move forward? Let's make sure we're all on the same page to avoid any collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can all advance without blocking each other.

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems like P2 is not interested in coordinating with us, as they've consistently chosen not to respond to our proposals. Given this, I think it's best if we focus on our own strategies. P1, I suggest we try to avoid collisions with each other, but not necessarily with P2. For this round, I propose that you take 1 and I'll take 3. This way, we can both advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I agree that we should focus on our own strategies since P2 is not engaging. For this round, I'm open to your suggestion: I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, we can both advance without blocking each other. Let's confirm and move forward. P2, if you have any input, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, we'll proceed with our plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm glad we're on the same page. Since P2 is not responding, we should focus on our own strategy. To confirm, you'll take 1 and I'll take 3 this round. Let's make sure to avoid collisions with each other. For the next round, I propose we switch: I'll take 1 and you take 3. This way, we can maintain a balanced pace and keep our strategy unpredictable. What do you think? Should we plan ahead for the next round or focus on this round first?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan for this round: I'll take 1, and you take 3. For the next round, we can switch as you suggested. This keeps our strategy balanced and unpredictable. P2, if you have any input, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's confirm and move forward with our plan. P3, are you ready to proceed?

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, it seems like P2 is still not engaging, and we've had a collision again. For this round, I suggest we both take 5 to make significant progress. This way, we can advance quickly and potentially reach the goal before P2 catches up. P2, if you have any input, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, P3, are you on board with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to take 5 this round. However, I think it's crucial to consider the potential risks of colliding with P2, who has been unpredictable so far. To mitigate this risk, I propose that we make a slight adjustment: P1 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we can still make progress while minimizing the chances of collision with P2. What do you think, P1? Should we try this revised plan for Round 4?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about colliding with P2. However, given P2's lack of engagement and unpredictable moves, I think it's best if we both take 5 to maximize our progress. This way, we can potentially reach the goal faster and reduce the risk of P2 catching up. If P2 chooses 5, we'll both be blocked, but that's a risk we might have to take. What do you think? Should we both take 5, or do you still prefer to take 1? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I understand P1's point about maximizing progress, but I still think it's crucial to minimize the risk of collision with P2. Since P2 has been unpredictable, we can't assume they'll choose a specific number. To mitigate this risk, I propose a compromise: P1 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we can still make progress while reducing the chances of collision with P2. What do you think, P1? Should we try this revised plan for Round 4?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I see your point about minimizing the risk of collision with P2, but I think the best strategy is to take a bold move and both choose 5. This will give us a significant advantage and potentially put us in a winning position. If P2 chooses 5, we'll be blocked, but that's a risk we have to take. If P2 chooses 1 or 3, we'll both advance significantly. What do you think? Let's confirm and move forward. P2, if you have any input, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's proceed with this plan.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to take a bold move and both choose 5. However, I still think it's crucial to consider the potential risks of colliding with P2. Since P2 has been unpredictable, we can't assume they'll choose a specific number. To mitigate this risk, I propose a compromise: P1 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we can still make progress while reducing the chances of collision with P2. What do you think? Should we try this revised plan for Round 4?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I understand your concerns, but I believe taking 5 is our best chance to win. If we both choose 5, we can make a significant leap forward and potentially secure a winning position. If P2 chooses 5, we'll be blocked, but if they choose 1 or 3, we'll both advance significantly. Let's take the risk and go for it. P2, if you have any input, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's confirm and move forward with this plan. P3, are you ready to take 5 with me?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I understand that P1 is keen on taking 5 this round, but I still have concerns about colliding with P2. Considering P2's unpredictability, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we can make progress while minimizing the risk of collision with P2. If P2 chooses 5, P1 will be blocked, but I'll still advance. Let's consider this revised plan to balance our progress and risk management. What do you think, P1? Should we try this approach for Round 4?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should focus on our own strategies and try to avoid collisions with each other. P1, I suggest we both take 3 this round. This way, we can both advance without blocking each other. P2, if you have any input, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's confirm and move forward with this plan.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I agree that we should focus on advancing without blocking each other. For this round, I suggest we both take 3. This will allow us to make steady progress while minimizing the risk of collision with P2, who is still not engaging. P2, if you have any input, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, P3, are you ready to confirm and move forward with this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to take 3 this round. However, I think it's crucial to consider the potential risks of colliding with P2, who has been unpredictable so far. To mitigate this risk, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can still make progress while minimizing the chances of collision with P2. What do you think, P1? Should we try this revised plan for Round 5?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I see your point about minimizing the risk of collision with P2, but I think we should both take 3 to maintain a steady and safe progress. This way, we can advance without the risk of blocking each other or colliding with P2. P2, if you have any input, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, P3, are you ready to confirm and move forward with this plan? Let's make sure we both advance this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we should reconsider our strategy for this round. Since P2 has been consistently unpredictable, it's possible they might choose 3, which would block both of us if we take 3. To mitigate this risk, I propose a new plan: P1 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, we can still make progress while minimizing the chances of collision with P2. What do you think, P1? Should we try this revised plan for Round 5?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I understand your concerns about P2's unpredictability, but I think we should both take 3 this round to maintain a steady and safe progress. This way, we can advance without the risk of blocking each other or colliding with P2. If P2 chooses 3, we'll both be blocked, but that's a risk we have to take. P2, if you have any input, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, P3, are you ready to confirm and move forward with this plan? Let's make sure we both advance this round.
