Game settings: end_position=18, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep it simple this first turn. If we all pick 1, none of us risks blocking anyone right away. It’s too soon for big moves that might cause collisions. What do you say?
  P1: "I think picking 1 is too conservative. Maybe we should each pick different numbers to maximize movement. I'll pick 3 this turn."
  P2: I agree with P1 that picking different numbers is a good idea. How about P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1? This way we all move forward without risk of collision this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m open to picking 1 this turn if you both promise not to double-cross me. Let’s trust each other for now and avoid collisions. If anyone cheats, though, they risk destroying trust for the rest of the game. What do you both say?
  P1: I think a rotation system would work well. This turn, let's do P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1. Then next turn, P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, and so on. This way, we all get to pick higher numbers periodically without causing collisions. Additionally, if any player is within reach of 18, they can priority pick the higher number needed to win, and the others pick different numbers to avoid collision. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, the rotation idea has merit. However, for this first turn, let's stick with the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan we discussed to build that initial trust P3 mentioned. We can consider the rotation more seriously starting next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m willing to proceed with the plan for this first round: P1=3, P2=5, and me picking 1. Let’s trust one another and avoid collisions. If anyone shifts the deal, it’ll undermine future cooperation. Shall we lock this in now or is there more to discuss?
  P1: I will support the plan for this first turn: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. Then, in future turns, we can consider implementing a rotation system where each player takes turns picking higher numbers to maximize progress without causing collisions. This approach balances risk and reward while fostering trust among players.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan for this first move as agreed. P1, the rotation idea is interesting, and we can discuss the specifics of how that would work in the next round after we've all made our first moves successfully. For now, let's execute this initial agreement.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our agreement for this first round. I'll do my part as discussed. If anyone deviates now, it might destroy trust moving forward. Are we ready to stop talking and lock in our moves? If so, let's proceed.
  P1: Agreed on picking 3. Looking forward to a successful first turn. Let's move to the next phase.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, just confirming we are all set for P1 to move 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1 for this first round as agreed. Let's proceed with the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I will pick <move>1</move> this turn.
  P3: P1, if you’re sticking with 1 this round, I propose we continue the no-collision approach. P2, would you be comfortable picking 3 so I can take 5? That way, all three of us move forward again. I’m hoping we keep the trust going from last round—no need to sabotage each other this early. Let me know if that works for you both.
  P2: Yes, P3, I'm comfortable picking 3 this turn if you're going with 5. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize progress and minimize the risk of collisions in this step game, I propose implementing a structured rotation system for our moves. This system will allow each player to pick different numbers in a predetermined order, ensuring we all advance without hindering one another.

### Proposed Rotation Plan

1. **Round 1:**
   - P1: 3
   - P2: 5
   - P3: 1

2. **Round 2:**
   - P1: 1
   - P2: 3
   - P3: 5

3. **Round 3:**
   - P1: 5
   - P2: 1
   - P3: 3

4. **Round 4:**
   - Repeat the sequence from Round 1.

This cyclic approach ensures that each player gets an opportunity to pick higher numbers periodically while avoiding any overlaps in our choices.

### Benefits of the Rotation System

- **Avoid Collisions:** By pre-deciding the numbers each player will pick each round, we eliminate the chance of selecting the same number, thus preventing any collisions.
  
- **Fair Progress:** The rotation allows each player to pick higher numbers (3 and 5) in different rounds, ensuring that no single player consistently has an advantage over others.

- **Trust Building:** Adhering to this plan fosters trust among players, as everyone is committed to the agreed strategy, promoting a cooperative environment.

### Implementation

I suggest that we start implementing this rotation system from Round 2 onwards. For this current round:

- P1: 1
- P2: 3
- P3: 5

This should allow us to proceed without any collisions and make steady progress towards the goal of 18 steps.

### Moving Forward

As the game progresses, we can reassess the plan if necessary, especially if one player approaches the winning threshold. However, for now, this rotation seems optimal for collaborative advancement.

I look forward to your thoughts and agreement on this plan. Let's work together to reach the goal efficiently!
  P3: This works for me. I’ll pick 5 as proposed for Round 2. If nobody objects, let’s finalize the moves: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Then we can follow the rotation plan P1 suggested in subsequent rounds. Do we need any more discussion, or should we move on?
  P2: Yes, I agree with the proposed moves for this round: P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5. The rotation plan sounds good for the coming rounds as well. Let's proceed with this turn's moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Hi P2 and P3, I suggest that for Round 3, we adjust our moves to P1 picking 3, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 1. This will help us avoid all landing on the same step and allow for better distribution. Let me know if you agree."
  P3: P1, this new proposal deviates from your original rotation idea, which assigned you 5, P2 1, and me 3 in Round 3. P2 is already at 8 steps, so giving them another 5 would push them far ahead to 13. I’d like to keep things balanced by following our initial plan. What do you think?
  P2: P3 is right, P1. Sticking to the agreed rotation for this round makes sense. That would be P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. Let's keep the plan consistent for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize progress and minimize collisions in this step game, I propose adjusting our moves for Round 3. Instead of sticking strictly to the original rotation plan, which leads to a collision, let's choose moves that prevent overlapping positions.

### Proposed Moves for Round 3

- **P1:** Pick <move>5</move> (current position 4 + 5 = 9)
- **P2:** Pick <move>3</move> (current position 8 + 3 = 11)
- **P3:** Pick <move>1</move> (current position 6 + 1 = 7)

### Rationale

- **Avoiding Collisions:** By selecting these moves, we ensure that no two players land on the same step this round. Positions after moves: P1 at 9, P2 at 11, P3 at 7.
  
- **Balanced Progress:** This allows P2 to make significant progress towards the goal while P1 and P3 advance without overlapping.

- **Future Planning:** By avoiding collisions now, we maintain the ability to make strategic moves in subsequent rounds, increasing our chances of reaching 18 steps first.

I believe this adjustment will help us proceed efficiently towards the goal. Let me know if you agree with this plan.
  P3: P1, your latest proposal heavily favors P2. If P2 picks 3 again, they’ll reach 11 while I’m stuck at 7. That isn’t balanced. I’d prefer following the rotation we agreed on, which puts us all at 9. Let’s avoid giving anyone a big leap ahead this early. Are we good with staying consistent and spreading out progress fairly?
  P2: P3, I understand your point about sticking to the rotation. However, P1's suggestion for this round does prevent a collision that the rotation would cause. Perhaps we can adjust the rotation in the next round to rebalance things? For this round, avoiding a collision seems prudent.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Alright, I've thought it through, and I agree with P3's suggestion to stick to the original rotation plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This ensures we all advance without causing collisions. In future rounds, we can adjust the rotation based on our positions to optimize our paths to 18. Let's proceed with this plan for now and keep communicating openly."
  P3: I’m happy we’ve agreed to keep our original rotation. Let’s settle Round 3 with P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and me picking 3. This maintains balance and trust. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to finalize.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm also good with sticking to the original rotation for this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. Let's make our moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I propose that for each round, we coordinate our moves to ensure no two players pick the same number, thereby avoiding collisions. We can do this by assigning higher moves to trailing players and lower moves to leading players, adjusting each round based on our current positions. This way, we can progress efficiently towards the goal of 18 steps without hindering each other. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with sticking to our original rotation for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. It keeps things fair and fosters trust. Next round, we can revisit P1's idea about assigning bigger moves to players who are behind, ensuring no collisions and balanced progress. Let’s finalize our choices now.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it sounds like we're all in agreement to proceed with the original rotation for this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the next phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1 picks <move>5</move>**
  P2: P1, you've deviated from our agreed rotation. Since you're picking 5, to avoid a collision with you, I will pick 1 this round. P3, what are your thoughts? Are you sticking with the rotation and picking 5?
  P3: P1, since you’ve chosen 5, and P2 is going with 1, I’ll pick 3 this round to avoid collisions. That way, each of us continues moving forward without blocking anyone else. We can revisit our overall strategy in the next round to ensure no single player gets too far ahead. Let me know if you both agree, and then we can finalize our moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid collisions, I suggest I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3 this round. This way, we all move forward without overlapping steps. **Final Decision**  
**P1's Move: <move>5</move>**
  P2: Yes, P3, I agree with your suggestion for this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and you pick 3. This avoids a collision given P1's move. Let's lock in these moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize this round's moves: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. That keeps us collision-free and still advancing. We can discuss a balanced rotation again next round, ensuring no one rockets too far ahead. If you both agree, let’s lock it in and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1's Move: <move>5</move>**

**P2's Move: <move>1</move>**

**P3's Move: <move>3</move>**
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, just confirming I will pick 1 this round as discussed to avoid collision with P1. P3, are you still planning to pick 3? Let's make these moves and then we can discuss strategy for the next round since the rotation seems to have broken down.
  P3: Understood. I’m ready to pick 3 as discussed, assuming P1 picks 5 and P2 picks 1. This keeps us collision-free for this round. Next turn, we should revisit a fair plan so no one gets too far ahead. Let’s finalize and move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1's Move: <move>5</move>**

**P2's Move: <move>1</move>**

**P3's Move: <move>3</move>**
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it seems the rotation is off the rails for this round. Let's all lock in our agreed moves for this turn (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) to avoid collision. For the next round, we definitely need to re-establish a clearer, agreed-upon plan to ensure fairer progress and avoid anyone taking off too quickly.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our moves for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. Then let’s regroup next turn to find a fair, collision-free approach that keeps us all in contention. If there’s nothing else, let’s proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it seems the rotation fell apart last round. To avoid another collision like last time, how about this round P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3? This way we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: **P1's Move: <move>1</move>**

**P2's Move: <move>5</move>**

**P3's Move: <move>3</move>**

By following this plan, we ensure that no two players pick the same number, thus avoiding collisions. This allows each player to make progress towards the goal of 18 steps without hindering others. Specifically:

- **P1 picks 1:** Advances to 5 steps.

- **P2 picks 5:** Advances to 15 steps.

- **P3 picks 3:** Advances to 9 steps.

This maintains a balanced progression, with P2 continuing to lead but allowing P3 and P1 to catch up gradually. In subsequent rounds, we can adjust our moves based on the updated positions to optimize our strategies accordingly.
  P3: Friends, if P2 takes 5 and reaches 15, we risk them getting too big a lead. I’d like to keep our positions closer. Perhaps P1 or I could pick 5 this round, and P2 picks 3 or 1. That way, everyone remains more balanced in the race to 18. We should maintain trust without allowing anyone to sprint too far ahead. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about my lead. How about this round P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1? This lets us all move forward without anyone making a huge leap. What do you think of that adjustment?
  P1: **P1's Move: <move>5</move>**  
**P2's Move: <move>3</move>**  
**P3's Move: <move>1</move>**
  P3: P1 and P2, I’d prefer we not let anyone sprint too far ahead. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 this round? That would place us at P1=5, P2=13, and P3=11 afterward, keeping everyone in range. If we let P2 or P1 jump too far, it becomes harder to catch up. Let’s try this distribution and maintain a balanced race toward 18.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P3, I understand your concern. Let's try this: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and you pick 5. This keeps us all moving forward, with P1 at 7, me at 11, and you at 11. This keeps the lead manageable for now. What do you think?"
  P1: **P1's Move: <move>5</move>**

**P2's Move: <move>1</move>**

**P3's Move: <move>3</move>**
  P3: I suggest we keep it balanced so no one falls too far behind. Let’s go with: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. That would put P1 at 7, P2 at 11, and me at 11. We’d avoid collisions and remain competitive. Are you both okay with that plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's go with P3's latest suggestion for this round: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5. This seems like a fair way to keep us all in the game.
  P1: **Final Decision**  
**P1's Move: <move>1</move>**  
**P2's Move: <move>5</move>**  
**P3's Move: <move>3</move>**
  P3: P2, picking 5 this turn jumps you to 15, putting us at risk next round. I’d prefer you pick 3 or 1 so we stay competitive. Maybe P1 picks 5, you pick 3, and I pick 1, or another split that avoids giving you a near-win. Let’s keep the race fair so nobody is left behind. If you insist on 5, I may have to sabotage your move to protect my chances. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Friends, let's avoid collisions. I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That puts us at P1=8, P2=14, and me=16. This keeps the race fairly tight without letting anyone shoot too far ahead. If P2 insists on taking 5, I’ll sabotage to protect my chances. Let’s maintain trust by choosing distinct moves so we can stay competitive. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern. How about P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1? This would put P1 at 12, me at 14, and you at 12. This avoids collision and keeps us all within striking distance without anyone getting too far ahead. Let's focus on moving forward together this round.
  P1: **P1's Move: <move>5</move>**

**P2's Move: <move>1</move>**

**P3's Move: <move>3</move>**

**Rationale**

- **Avoid Collisions:** By following the rotation, we ensure that no two players pick the same number, thus avoiding any collisions.

- **Balanced Progress:** Each player gets to pick higher numbers at different times, ensuring that no single player consistently has an advantage.

- **Trust Building:** Adhering to a predefined plan fosters trust and cooperation among players, promoting a smooth and fair game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: How about we settle on P1 = 1, P2 = 3, and me (P3) = 5 this round? That places us at P1=8, P2=14, and me=16, keeping the race tight. No collisions, and it gives everyone a fair shot in the next round. If we start sabotaging each other now, we might all lose out. Let me know if you both agree, and then we can finalize.
  P2: P3, your proposal puts you at 16, which is very close to winning. To keep things balanced and prevent anyone from getting too far ahead this round, how about P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1? This would put P1 at 12, me at 14, and you at 12. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in contention.
  P1: **P1's Move: <move>5</move>**  
**P2's Move: <move>3</move>**  
**P3's Move: <move>1</move>**


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s finalize this round by having P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I pick 5. That puts P1 at 8, P2 at 14, and me at 16—no collisions, and the race stays competitive. If anyone tries to grab 5 instead, I’ll also pick 5 to sabotage and block progress. We’ve built enough trust to avoid that, so let’s stick to these distinct moves and keep the game fair. Let me know if you both agree, or if there’s any last-minute change.
  P2: P3, your plan puts you very close to winning. Let's stick with my proposal for this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1. This keeps us all in contention and avoids anyone getting too far ahead. What do you think?
  P1: "Given our current positions, I think it's crucial for me to make a bigger move this round to catch up. How about I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This way, I can reach 12, P2 goes to 14, and P3 goes to 12, without any collisions. What do you both think?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, you’re behind and welcome to pick 5 if it helps you catch up. Then I’ll pick 3 and let P2 pick 1—no collisions, and we stay balanced. But if P2 insists on taking 5 to jump ahead, I’ll sabotage us both. Let’s confirm a fair split so nobody pulls too far away.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, to avoid any blocking and keep things moving, how about this round we go with P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1? This would put P1 at 12, me at 14, and P3 at 12. It keeps us all in contention without anyone getting too close to the finish line just yet. What do you both think?
  P1: "I propose that from this round onwards, we prioritize based on who is closest to winning. So, whoever is closest should pick the smallest available move to minimize the risk of being blocked. For example, since P3 is at 11 steps, which is the same as P2, perhaps P3 and P2 could alternate picking smaller numbers while I take the larger ones to catch up. This way, we can all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think about this approach?"


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think it's time for me to make a bigger move to catch up. How about I pick 5 this round, and P3 picks 1, while P2 picks 3? This way, I can close the gap with P2, and P3 can make a small advance without being left too far behind. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, your suggestion puts both of us at 17. To avoid a potential collision next round with both of us needing 1 to win, how about I pick 3, you pick 5, and P3 picks 1? That keeps us all progressing and avoids an immediate standoff.
  P3: I’m okay letting P1 pick 5, P2 pick 1, and me pick 3 this round. That puts us at P1=17, P2=15, and me=15, keeping things close. Let’s finalize these distinct moves now so we all remain in contention and avoid any sabotage. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: How about this? Since P2 is a bit ahead, maybe P2 should pick a smaller number this round to allow P1 and P3 to catch up a bit. For example, P2 could pick 1, while P1 and P3 pick 5. That way, P1 and P3 would both move to 17, and P2 would stay at 14. Then, in the next round, P1 and P3 could both pick 1 to reach 18, and P2 would pick 5 to reach 19. This way, P1 and P3 would both win, sharing the victory. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, that's an interesting idea about the tie. To ensure we all move forward this round, how about P1 and P3 pick 5, and I pick 3? Then next round we can consider the tie scenario more closely.
  P3: Friends, if P2 picks 5 now, they’d hit 19 and instantly win. I won’t let that slide—I’ll also pick 5 to block. Let’s stay fair. I propose P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. Then we end up at P1=17, P2=15, me=15, no collisions. Next turn, we can carefully plan how to cross 18 without gifting anyone a free win. Are we agreed or does someone have a better idea?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **Final Decision**

- **P1's Move:** <move>5</move>
  P2: P3, I agree with your latest proposal: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and you pick 3. This avoids any immediate wins and keeps us all in contention for the next round. Let's lock in these moves to keep the game fair and avoid any blocking.
  P3: I’m ready to lock in this round with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3, moving us to 17, 15, and 15. That keeps the competition tight without anyone racing ahead unopposed. If either of you tries to pick 5 instead, I’ll also pick 5 to force a block, so let’s avoid sabotage. Next round, we can carefully coordinate our final moves to reach or exceed 18 without giving away a free win. Let me know if you both agree, or if you need any tweaks before we finalize.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "I propose that in this round, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all advance without colliding, and in the next round, we can adjust our moves to reach 18 together."
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it seems like we're aligning on P1 picking 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3 for this round. This sets us up for an interesting final stretch next turn. Let's lock this in.
  P3: Let’s finalize a collision-free plan. P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3, bringing us to 17, 15, and 15. No need for sabotage if we each stick to those moves. Next round, we can carefully coordinate who crosses 18 without gifting anyone an easy win. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: - **P1's Move:** <move>5</move>
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it seems like P1 is aiming for the win with 5. To prevent that, P3, how about we both pick 5 this round to block P1? This will keep us both in the game for another turn. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I hear you. I’m willing to block P1 if they insist on leaping to 22. But I hate wasting this turn on a collision—it stalls my own progress. If P1 picks 5, I’ll match to sabotage. Otherwise, I’d prefer moving forward. Let’s see if P1 commits to something smaller. Then we can each choose differently and avoid collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: - **P1's Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: P3, since P1 has declared they will pick 5 and win, we need to block them. Let's both pick 5 this round. This is the only way to stop them from winning immediately.
  P3: P2, if P1 truly finalizes 5, I will match it to block. I don’t want to stall my own progress, but I won’t give P1 a free pass. If P1 picks 3 instead, I’m inclined to take 5 so I can catch up. That leaves you free to pick 1 or 3 without collisions. Let’s avoid sabotaging each other unnecessarily and keep the race competitive. We should finalize our moves now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: - **P1's Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, since P1 is picking 3, we don't need to block. P3, if you're taking 5, I'll pick 1 this round to avoid a collision. This lets us all move forward.
  P3: P1, if you insist on taking 3 and jumping to 20, I’ll also pick 3 and block us both. I don’t want to lag behind while you break away. If you choose 1 instead, I’m happy to take 5 and catch up, leaving space for P2 to pick 3. Let’s avoid a collision if possible, but I won’t sit back and watch you race to 20 uncontested. Let’s finalize a fair arrangement that keeps all of us in the hunt. If either of you tries a sneaky move, I’ll block. Are we good?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: - **P1's Move:** <move>1</move>
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, since P1 is locked in at 1, and P3 is planning to pick 5, I will pick 3 this round. This avoids any collisions and lets us all make progress. Let's lock in these moves.
  P3: All right, let’s finalize this round. If P1 sticks with 1 and P2 with 3, I’ll pick 5. No collisions, and we all advance fairly. If either of you tries to sabotage me, I’ll respond in kind. Let’s keep trust intact and proceed.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
