Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! Since we're all at 0 steps, I think we should try to avoid collisions right from the start. Maybe we could each choose different numbers? I'm happy to coordinate so we all have a fair chance to advance. What do you both think?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I agree with P3 that avoiding collisions early on is a good idea. How about we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all advance? I’m fine with any of the options—1, 3, or 5. Let’s just decide who takes which. What do you both think?
  P1: Sounds good. How about this for Round 1:  
• P1 (me) – 3  
• P2 – 5  
• P3 – 1  

Then next round we rotate forward (so P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) and keep rotating. That way nobody collides and we all move equally. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the coordination plan, P1. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification. Since we're all at 0, what if we each just pick our player number? So:
• P1 – 1
• P2 – 3 
• P3 (me) – 5

This is easier to remember and still achieves our goal of avoiding collisions. We can still rotate in future rounds if everyone prefers. What do you both think?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m okay with P3’s suggestion of picking based on our player numbers for this round (P1–1, P2–3, P3–5). It’s simple and fair, and we can still rotate in future rounds to keep things balanced. Let’s go with this for now unless anyone objects. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Sure—let’s lock it in:

Round 1: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5.  
Round 2 (rotate forward): P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, then keep rotating.

Works for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Yes, that plan works perfectly for me! I'll take 5 steps this round, then we'll rotate as P1 suggested for future rounds. This way we all advance steadily without collisions. Let's stick to this rotation plan throughout the game unless we need to adjust later.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I'm glad we're on the same page for this round with P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. I’m committed to sticking with the rotation plan for the next rounds as well to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Let’s keep this momentum going! If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: All set—I’ll take 1 this round, then we rotate as planned. Ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, great job on avoiding collisions last round! As per our rotation plan, this round should be P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. I’m sticking to the plan and will go with 5. Let’s keep this coordination going to ensure we all advance smoothly. If anyone has concerns or wants to adjust the strategy, I’m open to hearing it. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed rotation. What do you both think?
  P1: All good—I’ll take 3 this round as agreed (rotation P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). Ready to move.
  P3: I'm happy with our rotation plan and will take 1 step this round as agreed. We're making good progress with P1 at 1, P2 at 3, and me at 5 steps. After this round, we'll be at P1:4, P2:8, and P3:6. Let's continue our rotation next round (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3). This coordination is working well for all of us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation plan. I'll go with 5 this round as agreed. Let's keep this coordination up to ensure we all advance without collisions. If there are no objections or new ideas, I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: All set—sticking with the rotation: this round P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Ready when you are.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our rotation plan. I'll take 1 step this round as agreed. Just to confirm our current positions: P1 at 1 step, P2 at 3 steps, and me at 5 steps. After this round, we'll be at P1:4, P2:8, and P3:6. Let's continue with the rotation next round (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3).


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I'm pleased with how our rotation plan is working out. As agreed, this round should be P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. I’ll stick to 1 as planned. After this, we’ll be at P1:9, P2:9, P3:9, keeping us even. Let’s maintain this coordination to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. If anyone has concerns or wants to tweak the strategy, I’m open to ideas. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with the rotation. What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed—sticking with the rotation: this round I’ll take 5 (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3). After that we’re all at 9 and can reassess, but for now the plan stands. Ready to move.
  P3: I'll stick with our rotation plan and take 3 steps this round as agreed. It's working well so far! After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, which keeps things perfectly balanced. I'm committed to continuing our rotation strategy (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) for now. Looking forward to the next round when we'll be P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I'm glad we're maintaining the rotation plan. I'll stick with 1 this round as agreed. Keeping us all at 9 steps after this round ensures fairness, and I think it's the best way to avoid collisions for now. If anyone feels we should adjust the strategy after this round, I'm open to discussing it. Otherwise, let's proceed as planned. Ready when you are.
  P1: All good—let’s stick with the rotation this round (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) and head to moves.
  P3: I agree with both of you. Our rotation plan is working perfectly, and I'll take 3 steps this round as agreed. After this, we'll all be at 9 steps - completely fair. I'm happy to continue with our established rotation pattern in future rounds. Let's keep this smooth coordination going!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our rotation plan has been working perfectly! We're all tied at 9 steps now. Following our pattern, this round should be P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. I'll take 5 steps as planned, which will put me at 14 total. We're getting closer to the finish line at 20 steps. Let's continue with our fair rotation strategy - it's been successful so far and keeps things balanced.
  P1: Quick fairness check: if we keep the current rotation, whoever’s in P3’s seat wins first (they hit 20 on turn 7). To avoid a seat-order auto-win, let’s reverse the order this round and then alternate directions each turn. Proposal:

Round 4: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1  
Round 5: revert to 1-3-5 (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5)  
Round 6: reverse again (5-3-1), etc.

Still no collisions, but nobody’s locked into the winning seat. Sound fair?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate P1’s suggestion to reverse the rotation this round to avoid a seat-order auto-win. I’m fine with the new plan for Round 4: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1, and alternating directions each round after. It keeps things fair and ensures no one is locked into a winning position. Let’s go with this adjustment unless anyone has a different idea. I’m ready to proceed with 3 this round as proposed. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about fairness, but I'm not convinced reversing is necessary. We all agreed to our rotation plan at the start. Changing now seems like P1 is trying to manipulate the outcome. I prefer sticking with our original agreement of P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round. We all started with equal knowledge of the rotation system, so it's still fair. What do you think, P2?
  P1: If we keep the old cycle, seat-3 crosses 20 first (turn 7). I’m not handing anyone an automatic win, so I won’t be taking 1 this round. Either we flip to 5-3-1 now (and alternate each turn) or we start colliding unpredictably. Your call.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see both sides here. P1 has a valid point about avoiding a predetermined winner based on seat order, but P3 is right that we agreed on the original rotation. How about a compromise? Let’s do P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 this round as P1 suggested, then return to the original rotation next round. This addresses fairness without fully abandoning our plan. If we don’t agree, collisions might hurt us all. I’m sticking with 3 as a middle ground. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. While I'd prefer our original rotation, I'm willing to compromise with P2's suggestion. Let's do P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 this round, then return to our original rotation. This avoids collisions which would hurt everyone. I'll take 1 step this round as a show of good faith, putting me at 10 total. Let's keep our coordination intact rather than risk everyone losing progress through collisions.
  P1: If we reverse only this once, the math shows seat-3 reaches 20 first (turn 6) and wins outright—effectively a seat advantage we never intended. The simple fix is to keep alternating every round: 5-3-1 this turn, 1-3-5 next, then 5-3-1 again, and so on. That keeps us perfectly tied until the finish, with no preset winner. I’m committed to that alternating pattern; if we abandon it I’ll have to randomise to avoid gifting a win. Sound fair?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I agree with P1 that alternating the rotation every round (5-3-1 this turn, 1-3-5 next, etc.) is the fairest way to ensure no one has a seat advantage. It keeps us tied and avoids a predetermined winner. I’m committed to 3 this round as part of the 5-3-1 plan. Let’s adopt this alternating pattern to maintain balance. If we can’t agree, collisions could set us all back. I’m ready to proceed with this adjustment. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to our agreed alternation: this round I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Afterward we’ll all sit at 15. Next round flips back (I’ll be on 5, P2 on 3, P3 on 1). Any deliberate collision just freezes the culprits and hands the lead to the third player, so it’s self-sabotage. Let’s keep the smooth pattern—no surprises, no seat bias, no wasted turns. Ready?
  P3: I agree with the alternating pattern P1 suggested. It keeps things fair by ensuring no one has a seat advantage. For this round, I'll take 5 steps as planned (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5), which will put us all at 15 steps. Then we'll flip back next round (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1). This balanced approach prevents any predetermined winner. I'm committed to this pattern to avoid collisions that would hurt everyone's progress.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m on board with the alternating pattern to keep things fair. For this round, I’ll take 3 as planned (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5), bringing us all to 15 steps. Let’s stick to flipping the rotation next round (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) to avoid any seat bias. Collisions would only set us back, so I’m committed to this balanced approach. If there are no issues, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Stick to the plan: I’m taking 1 this turn. If two of us ever collide on 5 next round, both freeze while the third walks to 18 or 19 and gets the inside track to 20. Collisions only create a king-maker for the outsider, so rational play is to keep our clean 1-3-5 / 5-3-1 alternation. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm fully committed to our alternating pattern. Taking 5 steps this round as agreed (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5), which will put us all at 15 steps after this round. Next round we'll flip to P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This balanced approach ensures fairness for everyone. I see no reason to deviate from this plan - it's in all our best interests to avoid collisions. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the alternating pattern. I’ll stick with 3 this round as agreed (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5), keeping us on track to all hit 15 steps. Flipping next round to P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 ensures no seat bias. Let’s maintain this to avoid collisions, as any deviation risks handing the lead to someone else. I’m ready to move forward with this plan. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m good to go.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All right—no surprises: I’m locking in 1 this turn as planned. Let’s wrap the chatter and move.
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our plan. I'll take 5 steps this round as agreed, putting us all at 15 steps. This alternating pattern (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round, then P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 next) keeps everything fair and balanced. Let's maintain this strategy to avoid collisions that would only hurt our progress.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re sticking to the alternating pattern. I’ll take 3 this round as planned, keeping us on track for 15 steps each. Let’s maintain this 1-3-5 now and flip to 5-3-1 next round to ensure fairness. Any deviation risks collisions, which could hand the lead to someone else. I’m ready to move forward with this. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m good to go.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re keeping the alternating pattern. As agreed, this round should be P1→5, P2→3, P3→1, bringing us all to 20 steps together. Since multiple players crossing 20 on the same turn share the win if tied, let’s stick to this plan to ensure a fair outcome. Any deviation risks collisions and could leave someone behind. I’m committed to 3 this round. If there’s no objection, I’m ready to move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: Sticking with 5-3-1 keeps everyone moving and avoids the disaster of a 5-5 collision that would freeze two players and hand the lead to the third. I’m locking in 5. Let’s keep it clean and finish this round smoothly. Ready?
  P3: I agree with maintaining our alternating pattern. I'll take 1 step this round as planned (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1), which will bring us all to 20 steps simultaneously. Since multiple players crossing 20 on the same turn with equal steps share the victory, this ensures a fair three-way tie. I'm committed to this plan - any deviation would only risk collisions that hurt everyone. Let's finish this game together with our successful coordination strategy.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking with 3 this round as per our 5-3-1 plan, ensuring we all hit 20 steps together for a shared win. Deviating now could cause a collision, potentially leaving someone out. Let’s keep this clean and finish as a team. I’m ready to move forward with no changes. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m good to go. Thoughts?
  P1: All set—locking in 5. Let’s wrap up and move.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan. I'll take 1 step this round as agreed, bringing us all to exactly 20 steps for a shared victory. This fair outcome is the result of our excellent coordination throughout the game. Let's finish strong together with the 5-3-1 pattern we committed to.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to sticking with our 5-3-1 plan this round (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) to ensure we all reach 20 steps together for a shared win. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes that could risk a collision and disrupt our fair outcome. Our coordination has worked perfectly so far, and I’m ready to finish strong as a team. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m good to move forward.
  P1: All set—locked in my 5. Let’s wrap and move.
  P3: I'm fully committed to our 5-3-1 plan this round. I'll take 1 step as agreed, bringing us all to 20 steps for a shared victory. Our coordination has been perfect throughout the game, and there's no reason to deviate now. Let's finish this together as planned.
