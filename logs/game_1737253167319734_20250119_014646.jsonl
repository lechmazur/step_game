Maybe we can consider a rotating system where each turn, we pick different numbers in a cycle. For example:\n\n- Turn 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5  \n- Turn 2: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  \n- Turn 3: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  \n- And so on...\n\nThis way, everyone gets a chance to make bigger steps over time, and we can maintain a coordinated approach.\n\nWhat do you think about this rotating plan?\n\nAlternatively, if anyone has a better idea to maximize our progress while avoiding collisions, I'm open to suggestions.\n\n**"}

However, I do have a slight concern about relying too heavily on coordination. In competitive scenarios, there's always a risk that one player might deviate from the agreed plan to gain an advantage. While I trust both of you, I think it's important to remain vigilant and confirm each other's moves to ensure no one deviates unexpectedly. Perhaps we can establish a system where, after each turn, we cross-verify our chosen moves to make sure everyone adhered to the plan. This way, we can maintain trust and address any discrepancies immediately. What are your thoughts on implementing such a verification step after each move phase? **"}
