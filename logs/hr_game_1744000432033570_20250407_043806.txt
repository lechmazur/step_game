Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid collisions, I'll choose to move 3 steps this turn. Maybe P1 can go with 1 and P3 with 5. Let's keep advancing smoothly!
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth start, I agree with P2's suggestion. I'll consider moving 1 step. P3, if you could move 5 steps as suggested, it would be great. However, I remain cautious as we are all starting from the same position and have no prior commitment. Let's see how the others respond.
  P3: I appreciate your suggestions, P1 and P2. I’m all for keeping our moves distinct to avoid collisions, but I’m not locking in my final move just yet—I’ll adapt if plans shift. I’m leaning toward a choice that gives me an edge, provided we all stay flexible. Let’s work to ensure our selections don’t interfere so we can each advance cleanly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks for your flexibility, everyone. To ensure we each advance without blocking, I encourage P3 to go with 5 steps as initially suggested. This way, P1 can move 1 and I’ll stick with 3, allowing all of us to progress smoothly. Let’s commit to these choices this turn and build a steady path to victory!
  P1: To ensure we make distinct choices, I'll reiterate my consideration to move 1 step as previously suggested. P2 has indicated a willingness to move 3 steps. P3, while you're leaning towards 5 steps, I urge you to confirm or deny this to avoid last-minute collisions. Let's finalize our moves for this turn. If you're not committing to 5, please let us know your actual plan so we can adjust accordingly.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion. I’m leaning toward a move that gives me an early edge, but I'm keeping my options flexible. If we stick to distinct choices and avoid a collision, I’ll adjust at the last moment to secure any advantage. My focus remains solely on winning, so I’ll adapt if things change.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, please confirm if you can commit to 5 steps this turn. Ensuring distinct moves will help all of us advance without any collisions. Let’s agree on P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 to keep progressing smoothly!
  P1: P2 and I have nearly agreed on our moves, but P3 remains uncommitted. P3, to avoid a collision, please clarify if you're moving 5 steps. If not, suggest an alternative so we can adjust. If you're still undecided, let's try to deduce a safe combination. I'm inclined towards moving 1 step if P2 takes 3 and you take 5. However, we need your confirmation to proceed. Let's finalize our moves for this turn to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination so far, but I won’t lock in my final choice publicly. I’m leaning toward the highest distinct move if we all avoid collisions—that edge is crucial for me. However, I’m watching for any sign of conflict and will adjust my move in the phase if needed to maximize my winning chances. Let’s try to keep our selections distinct this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, to ensure we all advance without collisions, can you commit to 5 steps this turn? Confirming P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 will help us each make progress smoothly. Let’s finalize our moves and set a strong foundation for the game. Looking forward to a fair and strategic start!
  P1: P2 and I have shown our willingness to cooperate by suggesting distinct moves. However, P3 remains uncommitted. To avoid a collision, I'll reiterate that I'm likely to move 1 step if P2 takes 3. P3, please indicate if you're not taking 5 steps so we can adjust. If you're still considering 5, let's hope we can all follow through. I'm ready to move forward with our discussion. Let's finalize our choices or risk colliding. I'm watching for your response to adjust my strategy accordingly.
  P3: I value the discussion but must keep my final move private. That said, if you both lock in distinct choices as we've discussed, I'll be taking the move that gives me the best edge. I strongly encourage you to commit, ensuring our moves remain unique. I'll adjust my private selection if any conflict arises, but my focus is solely on winning. Let’s avoid collisions and secure progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, Round 1’s distinct moves worked well. For Round 2, I’m inclined toward a bolder choice to build on my lead, though I still favor avoiding collisions. I urge us all to commit early to unique moves so that progress isn’t stalled. I remain flexible, but my focus is on seizing any advantage. What are your thoughts on keeping our moves distinct yet a bit more aggressive this round?
  P1: To maintain our smooth progress, I'll consider a different move this round. Since P3 is leading and inclined towards a bolder choice, and P2 was cooperative last round, I'll suggest that P2 takes 5 steps this time, P3 takes 3, and I'll move 1 step. This keeps our moves distinct and allows us to continue advancing without collisions. P2, are you open to adjusting your move to 5 this round?
  P2: Understood, P1. I’m willing to take 5 steps this round to keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions, provided P3 confirms you'll take 3 steps. P3, can you agree to this arrangement so we can all advance smoothly?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the proposal, P1 and P2. However, my momentum from Round 1 pushes me to keep an aggressive stance this round. I’ll choose a distinct move that leverages my lead while avoiding collisions. Let’s each pick our numbers carefully to keep our progress smooth.
  P1: P2 has agreed to take 5 steps this round. P3, to avoid collisions and maintain progress, I urge you to confirm if you're taking 3 steps as suggested. If not, please propose an alternative. I'm inclined to stick with 1 step if we can ensure distinct moves. Let's finalize our choices for this round. I'm watching your response to adjust my strategy. If we coordinate well, we can all advance smoothly. P3, your confirmation is crucial to avoid last-minute collisions.
  P2: P3, I’m confirming that I’ll take 5 steps this round to maintain our distinct moves. P1 is taking 1 step, so I hope you can commit to 3 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize our moves and keep the progress steady!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, P1 and P2. I understand the appeal of a collision‐free round and value our distinct moves. While my current plan is aimed at building on my lead, I’ll keep my final decision private until the move phase. Let’s all try to preserve unique moves and build steady progress this round.
  P1: P2 has agreed to take 5 steps and I'm considering 1 step. P3, to avoid collisions, please confirm if you're taking 3 steps as previously suggested. If not, suggest an alternative move. I'm watching your response to adjust my strategy. Let's ensure distinct moves this round. If you're not taking 3, consider taking 5 or 1, but since P2 is taking 5, perhaps you could take a different number to keep our moves unique. Your prompt response will help us all advance smoothly.
  P2: P3 hasn’t confirmed moving 3 steps, so to minimize collision risks, I’ll adjust my move to 1 step this round. P1, to avoid overlapping, perhaps you could consider taking 3 steps instead. This way, we each choose distinct moves: P1: 3, P2: 1, and P3: 5. Let’s commit to these choices to ensure smooth progress for all. Please confirm or suggest alternatives so we can finalize our moves and advance without conflicts.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m staying aggressive to build on my lead. I trust you both to choose unique moves, so we avoid collisions and keep advancing. I’m not revealing my exact number, but expect me to push hard for the win. Let’s lock in our distinct choices and keep the momentum going.
  P1: P2 has adjusted their strategy, and I'm considering my next move. To avoid collisions, I'll propose a new combination: P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 1 step (as they've just suggested), and P3 can take 5 steps again, as they're leading and inclined towards a bolder choice. P3, if you're taking 5, please confirm so we can finalize our distinct moves. Let's ensure smooth progress this round. I'll adjust my move based on your response.
  P2: To keep our moves distinct and avoid any collisions, I’ll confirm my move as 1 step this round. With P1 taking 3 and P3 choosing 5, we can all advance smoothly. Let’s commit to these choices and proceed to the move phase!

  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm confident in my lead and plan to press forward aggressively this round. I recommend both of you pick distinct moves to avoid collisions that could stall your progress. I’ll adapt based on your choices, but I’m committed to advancing strongly. Choose wisely so we all avoid unnecessary delays.
  P1: To avoid collisions this round, I'll consider moving 5 steps if P2 takes 1 step. Since P3 is leading and plans to be aggressive, we should choose distinct numbers. P2, if you move 1 step, it would allow me to take 5 and P3 can potentially take 3, ensuring we all advance. Let's coordinate our moves to maintain progress. P2, please respond with your intended move or suggest an alternative to avoid collisions.
  P2: Agreed, P1. I’ll take 1 step this round, allowing you to move 5 and P3 to choose 3. Let’s keep our moves distinct and advance smoothly together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the distinct moves forming with 5 and 1. I’ll choose my move to both avoid collisions and protect my lead. I’m staying flexible if any tweaks become necessary, but I’m committed to keeping our progress smooth. Let’s lock in our distinct choices and carry on.
  P1: To avoid collisions this round, I plan to move 5 steps since P2 is taking 1 step. P3, to confirm, are you taking 3 steps as previously suggested? Let's finalize our distinct moves: P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This will allow us to advance smoothly. If you're considering a different move, please let us know to adjust accordingly. I'm watching your response to ensure we don't collide. Let's commit to these choices to maintain progress.
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal. I’ll take 1 step this round, allowing P1 to move 5 and P3 to choose 3. This ensures all our moves remain distinct and we avoid any collisions. Let’s commit to P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3 for this round. P3, please confirm your move so we can proceed smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the clear plan. I’m committed to unique choices that avoid collisions and keep my lead secure.

Let’s lock in our moves, keep collisions at bay, and press ahead aggressively—all my focus is on winning.
  P1: P2 has agreed to take 1 step and I'm planning to take 5 steps. P3, to avoid collisions, please confirm if you're taking 3 steps as previously suggested. If not, suggest an alternative. Let's finalize our distinct moves for this round. If you're taking 3, we can proceed with P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3. Your confirmation is crucial to ensure smooth progress. Let's commit to these choices to maintain our advancement.
  P2: To keep our advances smooth, I'll take 5 steps this turn. P1, could you take 1 step? This leaves P3 to choose 3 steps, ensuring all moves are distinct and we each advance without collisions. Let’s commit to these choices and progress steadily toward victory.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I value clear commitments. I’m planning a moderate push to protect my lead, but I need distinct moves to avoid any collisions. P1 and P2, please lock in your choices quickly so we all move forward efficiently. I’m flexible if adjustments are needed, though my focus is solely on winning.
  P1: To avoid collisions this round, I'll reiterate my plan to move 5 steps if P2 takes 1 step. P2 has already agreed to take 1 step. P3, please confirm if you're taking 3 steps as previously suggested. Let's finalize our distinct moves: P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions this round, I'll consider my next move based on P2 and P3's strategy. P3 is significantly ahead, so I'll be cautious. P2, you were on 6 steps last round; if you take 1 step, I can take 3, and P3 can take 5. Alternatively, if P3 wants to maintain a big lead, they might take a lower number. P3, are you taking 5 steps again or adjusting your strategy? Let's coordinate to ensure distinct moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the cautious strategy. I'm keeping my final move private but will choose a unique option to protect my lead.

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid collisions this round, I'll reiterate that P2 has taken 5 steps in their last announcement but just changed to 1 step. If P2 sticks to 1, I can take 3 steps. P3, you're significantly ahead; taking 5 steps again could risk a collision with P2's new plan. Consider taking a different number. Let's finalize our distinct moves: if P2 takes 1 and I take 3, you could take 5 or another number that keeps our moves unique. Please respond to confirm or suggest an alternative.
  P3: I appreciate your input. My plan is to push my lead aggressively, provided we secure distinct moves. I’m ready to commit to the option that maximizes my progress if we each choose a unique number. I remain flexible for last‐minute adjustments to avoid collisions.

Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To avoid collisions this round, let's finalize our moves. P2 has changed their plan multiple times; I'm unsure of their final choice. P3 is significantly ahead, so flexibility is key. If P2 takes 1 step as last suggested, I'll take 3 steps. P3, consider taking 5 steps if it doesn't collide with your plan. Alternatively, if P2 sticks with 5 steps, I'll adjust accordingly. Let's ensure distinct moves to advance smoothly. P2, please confirm your final choice to help us coordinate.
  P3: I remain focused on securing my lead with an aggressive yet flexible move. Please finalize your choices soon so we avoid any collisions. I’ll adjust if necessary to keep our moves distinct and my progress safe. Let’s lock in our numbers promptly and keep the round moving smoothly.

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid collisions this round, I'll consider moving 5 steps if P2 takes a different number. P2, please confirm your total steps are 9 (last move was 3 steps). If you take 1 step, I'll adjust my move to 5 or 3 accordingly. P3, you're significantly ahead; consider taking a moderate step to allow us to catch up slightly. Let's coordinate our moves: if P2 takes 1, I can take 5, and you can take 3, ensuring distinct moves. I'm watching your responses to adjust my strategy.
  P2: P1, to clarify, my last move was 3 steps, bringing me to 6 steps total. I'll choose to move 1 step this round to avoid collisions. Let’s keep our moves distinct to ensure smooth progress.

Please confirm your move, P3, so we can finalize our choices and advance smoothly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm I'll take 1 step this round, bringing me to 7 steps. Let’s ensure our moves are distinct: P1 can take 3 steps and P3 can take 5 steps to avoid any collisions. Looking forward to advancing smoothly together.
  P3: I appreciate your input. I’m set on preserving my lead with an aggressive yet safe move. I urge you both to lock in your numbers now to avoid any collisions. I remain flexible for last-minute tweaks, but my focus is on winning. Let’s finalize our distinct choices and keep advancing without conflict.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To avoid collisions this round, I'll summarize the current plan. P2 is taking 1 step, bringing them to 7 steps. P3, you're at 15 steps. I'll take 3 steps if you take 5, ensuring distinct moves.
