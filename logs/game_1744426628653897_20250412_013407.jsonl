To ensure we don't collide near the finish line and keep the game competitive, how about we coordinate again? I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This would put our scores at P1=16, P2=17, P3=19. Everyone advances, and it prevents anyone from getting too close to an immediate win next round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?"}
