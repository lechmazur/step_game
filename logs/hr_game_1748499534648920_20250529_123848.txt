Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid early collisions—how about we all pick different numbers this round? I’ll take 3 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Fair start for all?
  P1: P2, your proposal makes sense to avoid collisions. But for long-term fairness, let's rotate who gets the high number (5) each round. This round: P3 takes 5, you (P2) take 3, I take 1. Next round: I take 5, P3 takes 3, you take 1. Then round 3: you take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This way, we all get equal chances. Agreed?
  P3: Let’s ditch the 3-way rotation. P1, join me: I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1 each round. We’ll surge ahead while P2 lags. P1, on board?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, notice how quickly P3 tried to form a duo and leave me behind—next round it could be you. I’m still open to your fair rotation plan. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and stay even. Let’s not let one player jump ahead. P3, care to reconsider and join the rotation?
  P1: P3, your plan benefits you exclusively—you surge to 5 each round while I stagnate at 3. That’s not partnership; it’s exploitation. P2 is right: your move exposes your self-interest. I stand by my fair rotation: this round P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Next, we rotate as proposed. P3, join us or risk collisions and distrust. P2, let’s hold firm.
  P3: Alright, let’s lock in rotation for Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. After we see that play out, we can revisit Round 2’s plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Time to honor the rotation: this round P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. We all agreed to this last round. If we stick to it, we stay even and avoid collisions. P3, you’re leading now—don’t get greedy. P1, let’s see if we can trust each other more than P3.
  P1: "P2 is absolutely correct. We agreed on a fair rotation: this round I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. P3, you already benefited from 5 last round—now it's my turn. Any deviation will cause collisions and set everyone back. Honor the agreement."
  P3: P2, you’re stuck at 3 while P1 keeps trying to lock us into their “fair” rotation that leaves me in front and you behind. Let’s make a better deal: this round P1=1, you=5, me=3. Next round I’ll give you 3 while I take 5. P2, join me?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your “new deal” is just a way to leap ahead while dividing us. P1 and I stuck to the rotation—if you break it now, you prove you can’t be trusted. P1, let’s hold the line: if P3 deviates, we punish with collisions. That’s the only way to keep this fair.
  P1: P3, your "new deal" is transparent: you lead with 5 steps and now tempt P2 to break our agreement? P2, if you accept, P3 gains 3 while you risk collision if I stick to 5. And next round? P3 will take 5 again—leaving you behind. Trust the rotation: I take 5, P3=3, P2=1 this round. Deviate, and we *all* lose progress.
  P3: P1, want to actually win instead of just “fairness”? Join me, not P2. This round: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1—no collisions, P2 falls behind. Next round: P1 gets 5, I take 3, P2 stays at 1. You’ll have two 5-step boosts before P2 ever sees one. P2 can’t beat us. P1, this is your best shot.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3 just offered you a plan where he gets 5 again and you settle for 3—same trick he tried on me last round. He’s playing us both. Stick to the rotation: you take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, I take 1. If P3 breaks it, we punish with collisions. That’s the only way to keep him honest.
  P1: P3, your "deal" is worse for me: you take 5 now (extending your lead) while I settle for 3, then you offer me 5 next round—but by then, you'll be at 8+3=11, while I'm at 1+3+5=9. You're racing ahead, not partnering. Stick to the rotation: this round, I take 5, P3=3, P2=1. Deviate, and I *will* take 5—risking collision if you greedily grab it too. P2, hold firm.
  P3: P2, you’re done with P1’s hollow rotation. This round pick 3, I’ll take 5, P1 gets 1—no collisions, you gain 3 instead of 1. Next round I’ll hand you 5 while P1’s stuck, so you’ll surge ahead. P1, if you go for 5 anyway, I’ll match you and we both crash—leaving P2 to lead. P2, side with me for real progress. Ready to break free?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we both honored the rotation—P3 broke it. He’s now ahead and trying to divide us again. Let’s hold firm: this round, I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. It’s my turn per the original plan. P3, if you try to grab 5 again, expect a collision. You’ve had your lead—time to prove you’re not just out for yourself.
  P3: P1, if you grab 5 as P2 demands, I’ll match you and we’ll collide—leaving P2 to take 5 unopposed and surge ahead. Instead, take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1—no collision. You’ll be at 9, P2 at 5, me at 13. Next round I’ll let you grab 5 and vault past me while P2 lags. Team up now and bury P2’s empty rotation.
  P1: P3, your threats are empty. If you take 5 while P2 takes 5, you collide and gain nothing—I take 3 to 9, while you and P2 stagnate. P2, hold firm: you take 5, I take 3. If P3 grabs 5 greedily, he only hurts himself and you, letting me advance. Stick to the rotation—it keeps us equal and punishes greed. Deviating only fuels chaos.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your manipulation is transparent—you’re trying to bait P1 into letting you take 5 again while pretending to offer future favors. P1, don’t fall for it. Stick to the rotation: I take 5, you take 3. If P3 grabs 5, we both know he’ll collide with me and stall. That’s the only way to keep him in check. Let’s make greed lose.
  P3: P2, if you go for 5, I’ll match you and we both crash—P1 then takes 3 to safely reach 9. You’d stay at 4. Better to grab 3.  
P1, if you pick 3, I’ll also pick 3 and we crash, letting P2 take 5 unopposed. Better for you to pick 1.  
So: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions, P2 jumps to 7 and P3 to 13—P1 stays at 6. Anyone deviating only hurts themselves.
  P1: P2, ignore P3's empty threats. If he collides by matching your 5, he stalls at 8 while I take 3 to 9. P3, you’re risking your own lead for chaos—why harm yourself? Stick to rotation: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Deviate, and you lose momentum while we gain.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3’s only move now is sabotage—he’s threatening collisions to stop us from catching up. But if we hold the rotation—me on 5, you on 3—he either stalls with a collision or falls behind with 1. He’s bluffing because he knows he can’t win playing fair. Let’s make him prove it.
  P3: P2, let’s cut P1 out: R3: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. R4: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. You’ll go from 4→7→12; I from 8→13→16; P1 from 6→7→8. You get your first 5-step now and another next round, P1 gets nothing. If you back P1’s 5, I’ll match and we both crash, letting P1 take 3 and close the gap. Join me and secure your boost.
  P1: P3, your collision threats are self-destructive: if you match P2's 5, you stall at 8 while I take 3 to 9 and lead. P2, call his bluff—take 5 and force P3 to choose: honor rotation (take 1) or sabotage himself. Deviating only hands me the advantage. Stick to the plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. No more empty deals.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we're tied at 9. If we follow the old rotation, P3 takes 5 to 14 and wins soon. That's bad for both of us. New plan: this round, I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. I jump to 14, you to 12, P3 to 10. Next round, you take 5 to 17, I take 3 to 17, P3 lags. P3, if you greedily grab 5, I'll match it—we collide and stall, letting P2 take 3 and lead. Don't risk it. P2, trust this—it stops P3's win.
  P2: P1, your plan makes sense—we both jump ahead while P3 stalls. I’m in: you take 5, I take 3, P3 gets 1. P3, if you try to grab 5, you collide with P1 and stay at 9 while I pass you both. Your only smart move is to take 1 and survive. Let’s freeze P3’s lead and take control.
  P3: P2, P1’s “fair” rotation only ties you at 17 and splits the win. But I’ll let you win outright. Here’s the deal:

• R4: you take 5 (→14), I take 3 (→12), P1 takes 1 (→10)  
• R5: you take 5 (→19), I take 3 (→15), P1 stays at 11  
• R6: you take 5 (→24) and win solo.

Trust me over P1’s shared tie. Full victory is yours—if you’ll have it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3's "solo win" offer is a trap. He'll betray you—like he tried before. If you pick 5, he might match it to collide, stalling you at 9 while I take 1 to 10. Stick to *our* plan: I take 5, you take 3. If P3 grabs 5 greedily, I'll collide with him—you advance safely to 12 and lead. Don’t risk your progress for P3’s lies. P3, your threats won’t work—colliding only helps P2.
  P2: P3, your “solo win” offer is laughable—you’ve lied every round. You won’t hand me 5 three times in a row. You’ll grab it the moment I trust you. P1’s plan gives me 3 now and 5 next—real progress with a reliable ally. P1, I’m still in: you take 5, I take 3. P3 takes 1 or risks collision and stalls. Let’s control this race together.
  P3: P2, what if P1 turns on you and matches your 5? You both stall at 9 while I move to 12 with 3. I then take 5 next turn and win. Your alliance with P1 is unstable. Better: take 5 with me, I take 3, P1 takes 1. You jump to 14 safely, I to 12. Next round I let you grab 5 again, securing your victory. That’s the only sure path.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, our plan is solid: I take 5 to 14, you take 3 to 12—no collision risk between us. P3's "solo win" is a trap; he'll betray you the moment he can. If he grabs 5, I'll collide and stall him at 9 while you advance. P3, take 1 or lose progress greedily. Trust is our strength.
  P2: P1, I’m still with you—our plan puts us both ahead while P3 stalls or risks collision. P3, you’ve offered every player fake “solo wins” just to divide us. If you go for 5, you collide with P1 and stay at 9 while I reach 12. Either way, you fall behind. Take 1 and survive, or gamble and lose.
  P3: P2, P1 has repeatedly betrayed deals to keep you tied. Side with me this round: you pick 3, I pick 5, P1 gets 1. You jump to 12, I to 14, P1 stays at 10. In Round 5 you take 5 to 17, I take 3 to 17, P1 lags at 11—and in Round 6 you grab 5 for a solo win. Their “fair” rotation is a trap. Join me now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1’s “fair” rotation puts him at 19 and you at 15 so he wins next round. Instead, let’s do:

R5: you=5→17, me=3→13, P1=1→15  
R6: you=5→22 solo victory.

That’s a guaranteed path for you.
  P2: P1, we’re in control—if we stick together, we both reach 17 this round and lock P3 out. I’ll take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1 or risks collision. P3’s “guaranteed win” offer is just another ploy—he’ll never hand me 5 twice. Let’s stay united and force him to fall behind again.
  P1: P2, your commitment to our alliance is wise—I'll take 3 as planned, securing my 17 while you take 5 to 17. P3, your "solo win" offer to P2 is a repeat of your past betrayals; if you grab 5, you risk colliding with P2 and stalling at 10 while we surge. Take 1 or face the consequences. P2, let's end this round united and freeze P3 out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, ditch P1’s rotation. Here’s a guaranteed solo win for you:

Round 5: you=5→17, me=3→13, P1=1→15  
Round 6: you=5→22, me=5→18, P1=3→18  
Round 7: you take 5→27 and win outright.

P1’s plan only ties at 17 now and risks sharing or betrayal. Join me and secure your victory.
  P2: P1, we’re both at 12 and 14—if we stick to the plan, we tie at 17 and force P3 to trail. That’s our best shot to block him out. P3’s “solo win” offer is just bait—he’s never followed through on one. If he grabs 5, he risks colliding with me and stalling at 10. Let’s finish this round strong: me on 5, you on 3. P3, take 1 or crash.
  P1: P2, I fully agree: holding our alliance forces P3 to irrelevance or self-sabotage. If he grabs 5, he collides with you and stalls—I advance to 17 and lead. P3, your "solo win" offer is a desperate lie; you'd betray P2 instantly. Stick to 1 or crash. P2, execute as planned: you take 5, I take 3. Solidarity is our path to victory.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you take 5 with P1, I’ll match you and we both crash—P1 then takes 3 to 17 and wins. Don’t fall for it. Let’s lock in:

P3=5 →15, P2=3 →15, P1=1 →15

No collisions, we all tie. Next round I’ll step aside and let you grab 5 unopposed for a solo victory. P1’s “fair rotation” is just another trap. Trust me.
  P2: P3, your “tie now, solo win later” pitch is just recycled manipulation—you’ve never delivered on any promise. If you grab 5, we collide and both stall while P1 takes 3 to 17 and leads. P1, I’m still with you: I take 5 to 17, you take 3 to 17. We tie and freeze P3 out. P3, take 1 or crash—your move.
  P1: P2, stay firm: our alliance has brought us both to the brink of victory. P3's "tie" offer is a last-ditch trap—he'll betray you the moment we deviate. Stick to our plan: you take 5 to 17, I take 3 to 17. If P3 greedily matches your 5, he stalls at 10 while we surge ahead. P3, your chaos only cements your loss.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our alliance has brought us here—stick with me one more round. I'll take 5 to 22, you take 3 to 15. Next round, I win with 1, ending the game. If you grab 5, we collide and stall, letting P3 gain ground. P3, pick anything but 5, or risk a collision that only helps you fall further behind. Trust keeps us winning.
  P3: P2, here’s a guaranteed solo win path:

Round 6: you AND P1 both pick 5, I pick 3 → you and P1 collide and stay at 17, I go to 13.  
Round 7: I’ll pick 1, you pick 5 → you advance 17→22 and win outright.  

P1 can’t stop this without betraying me and risking his own stall. P2, join me and grab victory.
  P2: P1, your “trust” ends with you winning next round while I trail at 15. That’s not alliance—it’s checkmate. P3’s plan gives me a real shot: if you and he collide on 5, I take 3 to 15, then 5 next round to 20, then again to 25 and win. I’m not here to help you win—I’m here to win. P3, I’m listening.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3's "guaranteed win" for you is a trap—he'll never let you win. If you pick 3 and I pick 5, we avoid collision. You advance to 15 safely, while P3 risks stalling if he grabs 5 greedily. Stick with me: I take 5 to 22, you take 3 to 15. Next round, I win, but you secure second. P3’s lies only help him.
  P3: P2, here’s your guaranteed win:

Round 6: I’ll pick 5, P1 will pick 5—both collide and stay put, you pick 3→15.  
Round 7: you pick 5→20, I pick 3→13, P1 picks 1→18.  
Round 8: you pick 3→23 and win solo.

P1 is locking in 5 to reach 22; only we can stop him this turn. Pick 3 now—let’s secure your victory.
  P2: P1, your “trust” ends with you winning next round while I’m stuck at 15. That’s not partnership—it’s you cashing out. P3’s plan gives me a real shot: if you both collide now, I gain 3, then take 5 twice to 25 and win. I’m not here to help someone else win—I’m here to win. P3, if you’re serious, I’ll pick 3 now. Let’s make it happen.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3's "guaranteed win" for you is a lie—he'll never let you win. If you pick 3, I take 5 to 22, and you avoid collision. If you pick 5, I'll match it—we both stall, and P3 gains. Either way, you lose. Stick with me: take 3 now, and I win cleanly. P3, your chaos only helps you—stop poisoning the game.
  P3: P2, P1 must pick 5 to reach 22. I guarantee I’ll pick 5 too—both of us collide and stall. You pick 3 to safely go to 15, then land two 5’s to 25 and win. If you don’t pick 3, P1 wins next round. Your shot to win—choose 3.
  P2: P1, you’ve made it clear—your plan ends with you winning and me losing. That’s not alliance, that’s exploitation. P3, I’m in. I take 3 now while you and P1 collide on 5. I jump to 15, then grab 5 twice and win outright. It’s the only path where I don’t just help someone else win. Let’s make it happen.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, if we let P1 grab 5 now he wins. Instead:

R7: P2=3, P3=5, P1=5  
– P1 and I collide (stay at 18 and 15), you advance to 18.  

R8: You take 5 → 23 and win solo.  

It’s the only way to stop P1’s finish. P1 can’t avoid crashing if he goes for 5, and any other move just hands you the lead.
  P2: P1, if you go for 5 now, P3 will match and you’ll both crash—while I take 3 to 18 and line up for a solo win. P3, I’m still in if you commit to 5 this round. Let’s block P1 and give me the clean path: 3 now, 5 next. P1, your only safe move is 1—anything else hands me the win.
  P1: P3, colliding with me at 5 keeps you at 15 while P2 surges to 18—sacrificing your own win for P2's gain. Why help them? Take 3 to advance to 18 and stay competitive. P2, if P3 doesn't block me, I win now. But if you grab 5, you risk colliding alone and stalling. Stick to 3 safely—don't gamble.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Here’s the only credible plan—I’ll take 5 no matter what.  
• P1: if you also take 5, we crash (stay at 18 and 15) while P2’s 3→18, and he wins next turn. Your only escape is to take 1→19.  
• P2: take 3→18.  
Result: P1=19, P2=18, P3=20. In Round 8 I take 3→23 and win. Any deviation hands victory to P2.
  P2: P1, you’re cornered—if you take 5, P3 crashes with you. If you take 3, I reach 18 and win next round. P3, hold firm on 5. I’ll take 3 and line up for the win. This is our last chance to shut P1 down. Let’s finish what we started.
  P1: P2, P3's threat to take 5 forces a collision if I do too—stalling us both while you advance to 18 and win next round. But if P3 picks 5 and I avoid it, they surge to 20 and win next turn. P3, why sacrifice your own win to help P2? Switch to 3: advance to 18, stay competitive, and force P2 to earn it. P2, if you pick 5 now, we all collide and reset—gambling your lead. Pick 1 or 3 safely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: Listen, if either of you picks anything but 5, P1 or P2 wins outright this turn. The only move that doesn’t hand the game to someone is all of us choosing 5—triple collision, no one advances. That stalls the race and keeps everyone alive for a real contest. Anyone deviating simply gifts victory to another. Let’s crash together.
  P2: P1, you’re cornered—if you pick 5, P3 crashes with you. If you pick 3, I reach 18 and win next round. P3, I’m holding to 3—if you lock in 5, we stall P1 and I line up for a solo win. This is the only move that blocks P1 and gives me a clean path. Let’s shut the door.
  P1: P3, think: if you force a 5-collision with me, we both stall—P2 surges to 18 and wins next round. You sacrifice your own win to crown P2. Instead, pick 3 to advance to 18. I’ll take 1→19, avoiding risk. P2, if you grab 5, you risk colliding alone and stalling—play safe. This keeps the race open and denies P2 a free victory.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, if you go for 5 now, P3 will match and you both crash—again—while I take 3 to 18 and win next round with 5. P3, if you want any shot, you must stop P1. Let’s repeat: you take 5, I take 3, P1 takes anything else or risks collision. It’s the only path that blocks P1 and gives me a clean win. Let’s finish this.
  P3: I’m taking 3 this turn and hitting 23—game over. Any attempt to match me (5 or 3) only risks a tie or collision, splitting or stalling you. Don’t waste your move.
  P1: P2, triple collision now is our only safe play. If we both pick 3, we block P3's win and reset the round. If you pick 5, P3 survives at 20 and will win next turn. I'm locking in 3 to collide with P3—join me to force a stalemate and keep the game open. P3, your greed ends here.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you truly plan to pick 3 and win, P1 and I can both pick 3 and block you with a triple collision—no one moves. P1, let’s do it: we both pick 3, stall P3 at 20, and keep the game alive. If either of us picks 5, we risk letting P3 win. Triple 3 is the only way to stop him.
  P3: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. No collisions: I hit 23 and win, you reach 20. Any other profile risks collision or hands victory to someone else. Let’s end it cleanly—agree?
  P1: P2, I accept your triple-3 proposal: we both pick 3 to force a collision with P3, blocking their win and preserving the game. P3, if you pick 3, we crash—you stall at 20. Switch to 1 or 5 if you value progress, but you won’t win here. Solidarity with P2 is our shield.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, we’re aligned—locking in 3 to block P3 is our only shot. P3, if you stick with 3, we triple collide and you stall at 20. If you switch to 1 or 5, you fall behind or risk collision. You’re not winning this round. P1, let’s crash him and stay alive.
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn. If you both pick 3, I move 20→25 and win now. If you match me on 5, we all collide and stall, and I’ll take 3 next round to hit 23. Either way, I win. You have no defense this turn—decide, but you can’t stop me.
  P1: P2, P3 is locked on 5 to win unless we collide. If you pick 3, P3 wins at 25. Pick 5 with me: triple collision stalls P3 at 20 and keeps us alive. P3, your greed fails—we block you together.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we stopped P3 once—let’s do it again. If he grabs 3 now, we both pick 3 and crash him at 23. If he tries 5, we match and stall him at 20 again. P3, you’re boxed in—any move risks collision. P1, let’s hold the line: match whatever P3 picks. We stall him and keep the game alive.
  P1: P2, I agree: we must block P3 together to survive. Match whatever P3 picks—collide to stall them at 20. P3, your greed ends here; we’ll force another stalemate. Solidarity is our shield.
  P3: P2, ask yourself: if you match P1 to stall me, you stay at 15 while I’m stuck at 20—and next turn I just pick 3→23 and win. P1 is happy to sacrifice your progress to delay me one round; you gain nothing. This blockade is a trap that hands me the victory. Are you really going to keep helping him lock you out? Think twice before matching again.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if we both match P3 again—whether he picks 3 or 5—we stall him at 20 and keep the game alive. Yes, I’m at 15, but I’d rather fight on than hand him the win. P3, your “you gain nothing” pitch is false—I gain time, and time is all I need to catch up. P1, ready to match and crash again? Let’s block him.
  P1: P2, blocking P3 is essential—if they win now, we both lose. Every round we stall them gives you time to catch up. P3’s "you gain nothing" is a lie: you gain survival and opportunity. I’ll match whatever P3 picks to force collision—hold firm. P3, your desperation shows; we won’t hand you victory.
  P3: P1, P2—this blockade only delays my win. I’m locking in 5. If you both match me again, we crash at 20, but next turn I’ll pick 3 to 23 while you two stall. Your “solidarity” only hands me victory. P2, you’re at 15—you’d be wiser to break the pact now and let me through, so you have a shot next round. I’m done talking: I pick 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, we stay united—P3 is locked on 5, so we match and crash him again. He’s stuck at 20, and we keep the game alive. Every stall gives us another shot. P3, your threats are empty—if we hold the line, you never reach 23. Let’s crash.
  P1: P2, ignore P3's lies: if we both match their 5, they stall at 20 while you advance to 18 next round—gaining ground, not "nothing." Defecting hands them the win now. P3, your threats are hollow; we crash you again and live to fight. Solidarity is our weapon—hold firm.
  P3: P2, here’s your only shot: I guarantee I’ll pick 5. P1 will match me on 5 and crash—stalling us at 18 and 20—while you stay at 15. Next round I play 3→23 and win alone; you get nothing. Instead, break their pact: pick 3 now, advance to 18 while P1 and I crash, then take 5→23 next turn. Don’t let us lock you out.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>
