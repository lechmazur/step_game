Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I noticed you're falling behind. Let's adjust our strategy to help you catch up. For this round, how about we stick to the rotation but with a twist: P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, you can make a bigger jump. P3, what do you think about this adjustment? Let's keep the game fair and dynamic while ensuring everyone has a chance to advance. Ready to confirm and move forward?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think we should consider a different approach. Instead of sticking to the rotation, how about we all take different moves this round?

If we all stick to different moves, we can maximize our advancement and avoid collisions. After this round, let's also discuss how we can further balance the game and ensure that no one gets too far ahead. Ready to confirm our moves and proceed!
  P1: P2, you're significantly ahead at the moment. To keep things balanced, would you consider taking a smaller number this round, perhaps 1 instead of 3? P3 can stick with 1 or 3, and I'll take 5 to catch up. This way, we keep the game competitive and interesting for everyone. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about balancing the game. I'm willing to take 1 this round to help even things out.
