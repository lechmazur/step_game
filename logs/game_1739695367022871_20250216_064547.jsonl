P3's sudden 5-step move has given them a significant lead. If we both pick 5 this round, we can catch up quickly and prevent P3 from running away with the game. However, we risk colliding if P3 also picks 5. I suggest we both pick 5, but we need to be prepared for any move P3 makes. P3, will you commit to 1 this round to restore balance? If not, we'll have to take the risk to stay competitive. What do you both think?"}
