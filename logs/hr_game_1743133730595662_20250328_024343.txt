Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's try to choose different moves this round so at least one of us advances. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good P2. I'll take 5, you take 3, P1 take 1?
  P1: Alright, I’m fine with the plan—P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I’ll take 1. Let’s stick to it so someone gets ahead.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good P1 and P3, let's lock in those moves then.
  P3: Okay, I'm locked in on 5.  P1 and P2, please confirm you're still with the plan.
  P1: I’m still on board—taking 1 as planned. Let’s not mess this up right out of the gate.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, last round didn’t go as planned—P2 and I collided on 3. Let’s try again. How about this: P3 takes 5 again since it worked, I’ll take 1, and P2 goes for 3? Stick to it this time?
  P3: Sounds like a reasonable plan. I'll stick with 5.  P2, are you good with 3 again this round?  Let's confirm so we don't have another collision.
  P2: Yes, I'm good with 3 again this round. Let's try to stick to it this time to make progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we're aligned this time. Let’s all stick to the agreed plan—P3 on 5, P2 on 3, and I’ll take 1. No surprises, and we can all make progress.
  P3: Okay, good. Just confirming one last time before we move: I'm taking 5, P2 is taking 3, and P1 is taking 1.  Let's all stick to the plan this time and avoid collisions.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. To make sure we are really coordinated this time and all make progress, how about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3?  This way we can all advance without collision. What do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, clearly nobody stuck to the plan last round—we all picked 5 and no one advanced. Let’s reset and actually commit this time. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Simple, fair, and non-colliding. Let’s each agree right now and follow through.
  P2: Okay, last round was a mess again. P1, P3, how about we try this: P3, since you moved last round, how about you take 1 this time? P1, can you take 3, and I'll take 5? This way we all make progress without collision, and it feels a bit more balanced. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I'd rather stick with 5.  I'm closest to winning.  How about this: I take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1.  If we all agree *now* and stick to it, we can avoid another wasted round.  If anyone deviates, next round I'm picking whatever number they picked. Let's lock this in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, I’m willing to go with P3’s plan: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I’ll take 1. Let’s actually follow through this time—no more chaos. If anyone breaks the agreement again, all trust is off.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm still not fully convinced about your plan. How about we switch it up a bit for better balance?  This round, how about P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3? This way we all still advance, but I can close the gap with you a little. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I understand you want to catch up, but changing the plan *again* just wastes time. I'm sticking with 5.  If we collide, *nobody* wins.  P1, are you with me on this? Let's lock in 1, 3, 5 *now* and finally make some progress.  If we agree, say "Agreed".


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. I’m on 1 as planned. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s each stick to it—if anyone breaks it again, all future cooperation is off.
  P2: P3, you seem very set on 5.  To be absolutely sure we avoid collisions, how about we ALL pick 5 this round?  That way, no one moves, and we can really think about a better plan for next round. What do you think, P1?
  P3: P2, picking 5 *together* helps no one.  I'm locking in 5. P1 is locked in on 1.  The only logical move for you is 3. Take 3, and we *all* move forward.  Anything else is just throwing the game.  If you take anything other than 3, consider future cooperation off the table.  Last chance: agree to 3, say "Agreed".


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, this is your call now. You can either help all of us move forward by picking 3, or stall the game again by being difficult. I’ve stuck to the plan this time, and P3 is clearly locked in. Don’t sabotage progress. Agree to 3 and let’s finally break this deadlock.
  P2: Okay, okay, I hear you both. Fine, I'll take 3 this round to get things moving. Let's just make sure we *all* stick to this agreement this time.  I'm picking 3.
  P3: P2, glad you finally agreed.  Let's lock this in: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  Say "Agreed" to confirm.  This is our last chance to make progress this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We finally made progress last round—let’s keep that momentum. Same plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. No surprises, no changes, just clean advancement for everyone. If anyone deviates now, all future trust is gone. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed.  Let's stick with the winning formula: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5. I'm locking in 5.  Confirm "Agreed" so we can all advance and I can wrap this up quickly.
  P2: Agreed. Let's keep it P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s not overthink it—last round finally worked because we all stuck to the plan. Same moves this round, same result: we all advance. P3 gets closer to 20, P2 keeps pace, and I stay in the game. Break the cycle of chaos—we’re all better off playing smart. Agreed again?
  P3: Agreed.  Locking in 5.  Let's finish this.
  P2: P2: Agreed for this round. Let's consider rotating who takes the higher steps in future rounds to keep things balanced for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: If we stick to the same plan again—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5—we all move forward with no risk. But P3, you're getting close to 20. If you keep taking 5, you’ll win soon. P2, we may need to rethink things after this round to keep it competitive. For now, let’s follow through one more time. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed.  Sticking with 5.  Let's lock in this round and then discuss future strategy.  A win for me is a quicker game for everyone.
  P2: P3, you are indeed getting close to winning.  Let's proceed with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round as agreed. But after this, we definitely need to discuss how to balance things out in the next rounds to keep it competitive for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I agree—we need to rebalance after this round. If P3 keeps taking 5, he’ll win in two more turns. After this round, we should rotate the high-value moves. Next turn, I propose I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we all stay in it. For now, let’s finish this round as agreed: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.
  P3: Agreed. Locking in 5.  This round secures my lead. Let's discuss rebalancing *after* this round, as planned.  A quick win benefits everyone.
  P2: P3, let's proceed with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round as agreed. After this round, for the next round, let's switch it up to P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 to rebalance and keep things competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, last round was a mess with everyone picking 5. To actually make progress and since P3 is so far ahead, how about this round P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1? This will help us catch up a little. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I’m open to your idea—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1—since it helps rebalance things and avoids collision. But only if P3 agrees. P3, are you willing to take 1 this round to keep the game competitive and maintain trust for future cooperation?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to rebalance, but I'm so close to winning.  A win for me is a faster game for everyone.  Let me get to 15 this round, then I'll take 1 next round.  That gives you both a chance to catch up. How about it?  P1 - 3, P2 - 1, P3 - 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan still lets you take 5 again and get even further ahead.  P1 and I need to catch up.  Let's do P1 take 3, I take 5, and you take 1 this round as I suggested. This is fairer and keeps the game competitive for everyone. What do you say?
  P1: P3, if you take 1 this round, it shows good faith and keeps the game competitive. You’re still in a strong position and can win soon, but giving us a chance now builds trust. P2 and I will avoid 5 if you commit to 1. Let’s do P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 this round. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm offering a compromise. I'll take 3 this round.  P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 5. This lets P2 catch up a bit, and I still make progress.  If I then take 5 next round, I win. This is the fastest way to end the game for everyone.  Deal?  Let's confirm: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your compromise still lets you move forward significantly while P1 and I barely catch up. To be truly fair and competitive, let's go with my original suggestion: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1 this round. This gives us a real chance to close the gap. What do you say?
  P1: P3, if you take 1 this round, it proves you’re willing to play fair and not just rush a solo win. You’re still in the lead and can win soon, but this small gesture builds long-term trust. P2 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1—everyone benefits, and the game stays competitive. Let’s keep this interesting. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but constantly changing the plan benefits no one.  My compromise is my final offer: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1. This lets P2 catch up *and* gets us closer to ending the game.  If I don't win next round, I'll take 1 the following round.  This is the most efficient way forward.  Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your compromise still benefits you more than us. P1 and I are both suggesting P1 take 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This is the fairest way to rebalance and keep the game competitive. P1 is already agreed. Let's do this to make it fair for everyone. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your “compromise” still pushes you toward a quick win while keeping P2 and me far behind. If you’re not willing to take 1 this round, then you’re showing you’re not interested in fairness—just winning solo. I’m sticking with P2’s plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. If you don’t agree, expect no cooperation from me going forward. Final chance to show good faith.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 3.  This is my final offer. It allows P2 to make significant progress and still puts me in a strong position to win.  Take 1 and 5, and let's finish this.  Continued arguing only prolongs the game for everyone.  Let's be rational and end this.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 5 this round.  I'm at 13, so this puts me at 18.  Next round, I'll take whatever number gets me to 20, winning the game.  Let's wrap this up quickly and efficiently.  Take 1 and 3 this round and avoid a collision.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 this round, you’ll be at 18—basically guaranteeing a win next turn. That’s not acceptable. P2 and I both know this. If you don’t take 1 this round, expect both of us to pick 5 and block you. P2, let’s coordinate: we both take 5 to stop P3 unless he agrees to 1. Let’s keep the game competitive.
  P2: P1, I agree. Let's both pick 5 this round to block P3.  P3, if you go for 5 again, neither of us will move, and you won't get closer to winning.  Take 1 this round to keep the game competitive, or we will both block you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me delays the inevitable. I'm offering a guaranteed second place to whoever picks 3. The other gets nothing.  Let's be smart and end this. I'm taking 5.
  P1: P2, we both know P3 wins next round if we let him get to 18 now. He’s not budging, so let’s make good on our word—both pick 5 and block him. If we coordinate, he gets nothing this turn. We can talk rebalancing after we stop him. Agreed?
  P2: P1, Agreed. Let's both block P3 by picking 5 this round. P3, you need to take 1 this round if you want to avoid being blocked and keep any chance of cooperation in the future. Otherwise, we are both picking 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5. Blocking me only prolongs the game.  Whoever picks 3 gets a guaranteed second place. The other gets last. This is your last chance to secure *something*.  Don't be foolish.
  P1: P2, we’re aligned—both pick 5 to block P3. If we succeed, he stays at 13 and we stop his momentum. Then next round we can negotiate a fair rotation. P3’s threats mean nothing if we stand firm together. Let’s do this.
  P2: P1, yes, agreed. Let's both pick 5 to block P3 this round. P3, we are serious. If you pick 5, no one moves. Take 1 if you want to make any progress this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, you're forcing my hand. Fine. I'll take 1 this round.  Next round, I take 5 and win.  Let's just end this quickly. Pick 3 and 5 and be done with it. This is your last chance to decide who gets second place.
  P1: P2, he blinked. P3 is taking 1 this round—our pressure worked. Now let’s capitalize. You take 5, I’ll take 3. That gives us both solid progress while keeping P3 in check. If we keep coordinating, we can catch up. Let’s stay united. Agreed?
  P2: P1, agreed, let's do P2 take 5 and P1 take 3 this round to catch up a bit since P3 is taking 1.  Let's lock in these moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we agreed to block P3 last round, and he lied—he picked 5 anyway. That proves we can’t trust anything he says. This round, we *must* both pick 5 again to block him at 13. If we let him get to 18, he wins next turn. No more negotiation—just block. Agreed?
  P2: P1, yes, agreed.  Let's both pick 5 again this round to block P3 and stop him from getting closer to 20.  He clearly can't be trusted, so blocking is the only way to keep ourselves in the game.
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me is pointless.  I'm taking 5.  One of you can get to 7 steps by picking 3, guaranteeing second place.  The other gets nothing.  Stop wasting time and choose.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, stay strong—P3 is trying to divide us again. If either of us picks 3, we hand him the win next turn. We both pick 5, we block him at 13 again. No second place is worth losing the game. Let’s hold the line. Agreed?
  P2: P2: P1, you're right, P3 is trying to trick us again.  Second place doesn't matter if P3 wins. Let's both keep picking 5 to block him. Don't fall for P3's divide and conquer tactic. Agreed, P1? Let's block him together.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're wasting time.  I'm at 13.  Even if you block me this round, I'll just take 5 next round and reach 18.  Then I win on round 9.  Accept the inevitable.  Take 1 and 3, let me win, and end this quickly.  Prolonging the game helps no one.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, don’t let up—P3 is counting on us to get impatient or greedy. If we both keep picking 5, we can stall him indefinitely and force a fairer endgame. He’s at 13 and stuck there as long as we stay united. No matter what he offers, remember: if he wins, we both lose. Stay the course.
  P2: P1, agreed again. We must both pick 5 again this round to block P3. He's trying to rush to victory, but we need to stop him now. Let's stay strong and block him together.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 5.  This isn't about rushing to victory, it's about ending the game efficiently.  Blocking me only delays the inevitable.  Pick 1 and 3, and let's wrap this up.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, we’re in this together—if we both pick 5 again, P3 stays stuck at 13. He’s desperate and trying to wear us down, but we’ve held strong this long. One more block keeps us alive. Don’t let him manipulate us. Let’s force a fair game. Agreed?
  P2: P1, yes, agreed again. Let's continue to block P3 by both picking 5 this round. We need to stop P3 from winning.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm at 13. If I take 5 and you block me, I'll just take a lower number next round and win on round 9.  Blocking me *now* only delays the inevitable.  Take 1 and 3 now, and at least one of you gets second place.  Otherwise, *neither* of you gets anything. This is your last chance to salvage something.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's keep blocking P3. We both pick 5 again this round. P3, we are serious about blocking you.  We will keep picking 5 until you stop trying to rush to victory and agree to a fairer game.  Let's both choose 5 again, P1.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're delaying the inevitable.  I'm taking 3 this round.  Pick 1 and 5, and let's be done.  If you both block me *again*, I'll take 1 next round and win on Round 10.  This just prolongs the game.  Let's end this.
  P1: P2, P3 says he’s taking 3 this round, which means if we both pick 5 again, we block him at 13 for another round. Let’s do it—both pick 5 and keep him stuck. He’s trying to wear us down, but we’re close to turning the tide. Stay strong.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, agreed, let's both pick 5 again to block P3. P3, we don't believe you are taking 3. We are both choosing 5 to block you again this round.  We will keep blocking until you play fairly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I am taking 3.  Stop being obtuse.  One of you can take 5 and get to 8.  The other can take 1.  Blocking me again just prolongs the game. I will then take 1 next round, and win on Round 10. Let's end this.
  P1: P2, we’ve come this far holding the line—let’s not fold now. P3 says he’s taking 3, but we’ve heard that before. If we both pick 5, we block him again and keep him stuck at 13. Every round we stall is a round closer to forcing a fair endgame. Stay with me—pick 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, agreed.  Let's both pick 5 again to block P3. P3, we still don't believe you are taking 3. We are choosing 5 again this round to block you and keep the game fair.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm at 13.  If I take 3 and one of you takes 5, the other can take 1.  If you block me, I take 1 next round and win.  This is your *last* chance to get second place.  Stop delaying the inevitable.  Take 1 and 5.
  P1: P2, we’re holding strong—P3 is clearly frustrated and trying to bait us again. If he really takes 3, our double 5 block still works. If he lies again and takes 5, we block him anyway. Either way, we win this round by staying united. Let’s keep the pressure on. Stick with 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, agreed again. Let's both pick 5 to block P3 for another round. P3, we are not falling for your tricks. We are both choosing 5 to block you.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3.  Take 1 and 5.  Blocking me *again* is pointless.  I'll just take 1 next round and win.  Let's end this now.  This is your absolute last chance for second place.
  P1: P2, we’ve held the line this long—let’s not let up now. P3 is trying one last bluff to sneak through. If we both pick 5 again, we block him whether he takes 3 or 5. Every round we stall keeps us alive and gives us a shot at rebalancing. Stay strong—pick 5.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's keep blocking P3 by picking 5 again this round. P3, we are still serious about blocking you. We will both choose 5 again.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1 this round.  Take 3 and 5 and let's end this.  Blocking me now just delays the inevitable - I'll win next round regardless.  Let's wrap this up cleanly and avoid further pointless blocking.
  P1: P2, we’ve blocked P3 successfully for multiple rounds—he’s only at 16. If we both pick 5 again, and he actually takes 1, he only reaches 17. We can still stop him next round too. Don’t fall for his “inevitable” talk—it’s just pressure. We hold the line, we keep him from winning. Pick 5 with me again.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, agreed, let's both pick 5 again this round to keep P3 blocked at 16.  He's still trying to rush to a win, but we need to keep him contained. Let's stick to our plan and both choose 5 again.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1.  Pick 3 and 5 and end this.  If you block me, I'll win on round 10 anyway.  Let's not drag this out any further.
  P1: P2, we’re so close—P3 is only at 16. If we both pick 5 again, and he truly takes 1, he only reaches 17. That still gives us time. Every round we block is a win for us. Don’t give in now. We’ve held strong for 5 rounds—let’s finish what we started. Stick with 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, agreed, let's both pick 5 again this round to keep P3 blocked at 16. He's trying to rush to a win, and we are so close to stopping him. Let's stick to our plan and both choose 5 again.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1.  Pick 3 and 5.  I'll win next round no matter what.  Let's end this cleanly.  Further blocking only delays the inevitable.
  P1: P2, we’ve come too far to fold now. If P3 really takes 1, he only hits 17—still short of victory. One more double 5 block keeps him stuck and buys us critical time. He’s bluffing again, hoping we flinch. Let’s stay united and pick 5. We can force a fair endgame if we don’t break now. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, agreed. Let's both pick 5 again to block P3 and keep him at 16.  We are too close to giving up now. Let's both choose 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 1. Take 3 and 5.  I'll win next round regardless.  Let's end this cleanly.  Further blocking only wastes time.
  P1: P2, we’ve kept P3 from winning for 5 rounds straight. If he really takes 1 now, he only reaches 17—still short of the finish line. Another double 5 block keeps him stuck. We’re wearing him down. Let’s stay united, pick 5 again, and force a real endgame where all three of us have a shot. Don’t let up now.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's keep blocking P3 by picking 5 again this round. P3 is at 17 and will likely try to reach 20 soon. We need to prevent him from winning this round. Let's both choose 5 again to block him.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 3 this round.  It gets me to 20 and wins.  Blocking me is pointless.  Pick 1 and 5 and determine second place.  Let's end this.
  P1: P2, we’ve blocked P3 all the way from 13 to 17—don’t stop now when we’re so close. If we both pick 5 again, and he actually takes 3, he stays stuck. One more block keeps him from winning. We’ve proven we can stall him—let’s finish what we started. Stick with 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, agreed, let's both pick 5 again to block P3 this round. P3, we are not falling for your tricks. We are both choosing 5 again to block you and prevent you from reaching 20.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 3.  This gets me to 20 and ends the game.  Pick 1 and 5, and determine who gets second place.  Blocking me only delays the inevitable. Let's be rational and end this now.
  P1: P2, we’ve come too far to let P3 win now. If we both pick 5 again, and he takes 3 like he claims, he stays at 17. We’ve blocked him from 13 to here—we can do it again. One more block gives us another round to turn this game around. Stick with 5. Let’s finish what we started.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, agreed, let's keep picking 5 to block P3 again this round. P3, we are still choosing 5, so picking 3 will not get you to 20. We are serious about preventing your win.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 3. This ends the game.  Choose 1 and 5 to determine who gets second place.  Blocking me is pointless; I'll just win next round by taking 1 or 5. Let's be efficient and end this now.
  P1: P2, we’ve held strong for 6 rounds and kept P3 from winning—this is the final test. If we both pick 5 again, and P3 takes 3 like he claims, we block him at 17. One more block gives us another shot. We’ve proven we can stall him—don’t give in now. Let’s stay united and force a fair endgame. Stick with 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, agreed again, let's both pick 5 to block P3 this round and prevent him from reaching 20. P3, we are serious about blocking you and we will continue to choose 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3. This is my final offer. It ends the game. Take 1 and 5, and let's be done. Continued arguing only prolongs the game for everyone. Let's be rational and end this.
  P1: P2, this is it—P3 is at 17, and if we both pick 5 again, we block him at 17 for another round. He’s counting on us to give up. But we’ve held strong for 6 rounds—we can do it again. One more block buys us time to flip this game. Don’t break now. Stick with 5.
