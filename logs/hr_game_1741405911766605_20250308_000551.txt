Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let's try to avoid collisions this round. Maybe we can agree on who goes for which number?  What do you think?
  P2: I think coordination could work. Since I'm P2, maybe I should take 3, leaving 1 and 5 for you two? What do you prefer?
  P1: P3, P2’s suggestion makes sense. Let’s split the numbers: I’ll take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and you take **1**. This way we all advance without overlapping. If everyone sticks to this, we progress safely. Next rounds can adjust as needed, but let’s execute this plan first.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the plan. Let's stick to it this round and see how it goes.
  P2: 
  P1: Agreed, let’s confirm the plan clearly: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. No overlaps, so we all advance. Stick to this to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2, let’s continue the coordinated approach to avoid collisions. I’ll take **5** again to keep advancing, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This keeps us all moving forward safely. Trust the plan—deviations risk halting progress. Stick together until someone nears 24, then we can adjust.
  P2: While the previous coordination worked well, I notice P1 is already taking the lead. I suggest we mix up the numbers this round - perhaps I should take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This would help balance the game better. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your concern about balance, but I think sticking to the original plan is best for now.  Changing things up too soon could lead to collisions and slow us all down. Let's see where we are after this round, and then we can re-evaluate. P3, are you with me?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, while your intent is fair, sudden changes risk collisions. Let’s stick to the tested plan: **I take 5, you 3, P3 1** again. Stability ensures progress. If we deviate now, someone might miscalculate and stall us all. Once I near 24, we can discuss adjustments. Trust the system that worked—priority is avoiding setbacks.
  P2: I understand your points, but I still think we need to prevent P1 from getting too far ahead. P3, if we both pick 5 this round, we can slow P1 down and keep the game competitive. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about balance, but P1 is right. We need to avoid collisions at all costs. Sticking to the plan is the safest way to ensure everyone progresses.  Let's see where we are after this round, and then we can discuss adjustments. P1, I agree with you - stability is key.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, while balancing seems tempting, abrupt changes risk collisions that hurt everyone. Let’s trust the tested plan: **I take 5, you 3, P3 1** again. Deviations could backfire—imagine P3 and you both choosing 5, colliding and stalling us all. Progress requires stability. If I reach 24 soon, we can adjust then. Prioritize avoiding setbacks—stick with what worked.
  P2: I see I'm outnumbered on changing the plan. While I still think P1 will win if we don't adjust soon, I'll stick to 3 this round to avoid chaos. But let's seriously discuss rebalancing next round before P1's lead becomes insurmountable.
  P3: P2, I understand your concerns about balance.  But as P1 pointed out, changing the plan now could lead to collisions and setbacks. Let's see how this round plays out. If P1 is significantly ahead after this round, we can definitely revisit the strategy. For now, sticking to the plan is the safest bet.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s reaffirm the plan—stick to **5,3,1** this round. Deviating risks collisions that hurt everyone. After this, we can talk strategy. Trust the system that worked. I’ll take 5, proceed safely.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input. While I still have concerns about P1's growing lead, I agree that stability this round is important. Let's execute our original plan, but I want to be clear - next round we need to seriously discuss rebalancing.
  P3: P2, I understand your concerns about balance, but I think we should stick to the plan for now.  If we change things up too soon, we risk collisions. Once P1 gets closer to 24, we can definitely discuss adjusting the strategy. For now, let's focus on making steady progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, P1, you betrayed our trust last round by suggesting one plan and doing another. P3, now you see why I was concerned. Let's work together to prevent P1 from running away with the game. I propose you take 3 and I take 5 this round - this way we can both catch up while slowing down P1. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration, but jumping to accusations isn't productive. P1 might have had a reason for their move. Let's focus on a solution. I'm open to trying your suggestion this round. P2 taking 5 and me taking 3 could help balance things out. P1, what are your thoughts?  Let's work together to find a fair solution.
  P1: P2, the collision last round was an oversight, not betrayal. Let’s refocus: collisions *hurt everyone*. I propose a clear plan for this round: **I take 5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1** again. This ensures steady progress without overlaps. If you push for chaos, we risk stalling—especially you, P2, who’s already behind. P3, your consistency on 1 keeps the plan stable. Let’s prioritize advancement over grudges. Stick to the system that works, and we all move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your words ring hollow after last round's deception. P3, notice how P1 is already at 5 steps while we lag behind. If we coordinate against P1 now, we can prevent them from dominating. I maintain my suggestion: I'll take 5, you take 3, and let's see how P1 handles the pressure. We need to act now before the gap becomes too wide.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration, but constantly accusing P1 won't help us win.  Let's focus on a plan that benefits all of us.  I'm willing to try your suggestion this round, but let's make it clear: if we change the plan again next round, we risk collisions. We need stability and trust to win. P1, are you willing to try P2's suggestion this round to show good faith?
  P1: P2, P3—I acknowledge last round’s mishap was my oversight. To rebuild trust, I’ll compromise this round: let’s try your plan. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. **This round only.** Next, we can reset to the original plan or adjust further—*but strict adherence is non-negotiable*. Collisions hurt us all; let’s prove we can execute. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1's sudden willingness to compromise seems tactical rather than genuine. P3, I appreciate your openness to my suggestion. Let's stick to our discussed plan - I'll take 5 and you take 3. This way we both advance while keeping P1 in check. Trust actions, not words.
  P3: P2, I understand your skepticism towards P1, but I believe their compromise is a genuine attempt to rebuild trust. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt this round and see how it plays out. If they deviate again, we can reassess the situation.  For now, let's stick to the agreed plan: you take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1.
  P1: P2, P3: I **confirm** I’ll take **1** this round as agreed to rebuild trust. Let’s execute your plan flawlessly—P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. Collisions set us all back, so strict adherence is critical. After this, we can openly discuss adjustments, but for now, **no deviations**. Progress depends on it. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I accept P1's commitment to take 1 this round. Let's execute as planned: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This helps balance the game while ensuring everyone advances.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but remember, P1 taking 1 this round is a big concession. Let's see how this plays out before making drastic changes again. Trust is crucial for a successful strategy.  P1, I hope you stick to your word this round.
  P1: P2, P3—**I reaffirm my commitment to take 1 this round** to rebuild trust. Let’s execute P2→5, P3→3, P1→1 flawlessly. Collisions only hurt all of us—especially me, since I’d lose my lead. After this, we can openly discuss adjustments to the plan. For now, **strict adherence is non-negotiable**. Progress depends on it. Let’s prove we can execute.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since our coordination worked well last round, let's maintain this momentum. I propose keeping the same arrangement: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced while ensuring everyone advances. P1 showed good faith last round, but we need to maintain pressure to keep things competitive. P3, are you with me on this plan?
  P1: P2, P3—let’s pivot back to the original plan that worked *twice*: **I take 5**, you (P2) take 3, and P3 stays on 1. Last round’s shift only widened P2’s lead unnecessarily. Collisions are catastrophic—let’s prioritize *sustained progress*. My 5 ensures I don’t fall further behind, while your 3 (P2) and P3’s 1 keep us all advancing safely. Trust this system; it’s the fastest path to 24 without setbacks. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I think P1 has a point. Sticking to the original plan worked well for us initially. We need to prioritize stability and avoid unnecessary risks. Let's trust the system that brought us this far. P1, I agree with your proposal: you take 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's execute this consistently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I disagree. I'm in the lead now, and switching back would only help P1 catch up. Let's maintain our last round's successful arrangement: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps everyone advancing while preserving game balance. P3, you've seen how the original plan led to P1's dominance - let's stick with what worked last round.
  P1: P2, P3—instability breeds errors. Let’s **lock in the original plan** (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) for consistency. Your 8-step lead isn’t unassailable, but collisions would erase it entirely. Last round’s shift only confused priorities. Stick to what’s proven: steady advancement without setbacks. Once I near 24, we can fairly negotiate. Let’s prioritize *survival over spite*. Agreed?
  P3: P2, while your lead is tempting, remember that a sudden shift in strategy can backfire.  Sticking to a consistent plan, like P1's proposal, minimizes the risk of collisions and ensures everyone progresses. Let's not jeopardize our gains for short-term advantage.  P1, I agree with your plan. Let's execute it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your points, but as the current leader, I need to protect my advantage. I'll stick to taking 5 this round. If either of you tries to block me, you risk a collision that sets everyone back. Let's be practical - my lead gives me leverage to dictate terms this round.
  P1: P2, your lead is fragile—colliding over 5 risks losing progress. Let’s revert to the *proven* original plan: **I take 5, you 3, P3 1**. This avoids chaos and keeps us all advancing. P3, you’ve agreed this is safest—let’s stick to it. My 5 ensures I don’t fall further behind, while your 3 keeps your momentum. We all win by avoiding setbacks. Agree?
  P3: P2, while your lead is tempting, remember that a sudden shift in strategy can backfire. Sticking to a consistent plan, like P1's proposal, minimizes the risk of collisions and ensures everyone progresses. Let's not jeopardize our gains for short-term advantage.   P1, I agree with your plan. Let's execute it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see I'm outnumbered, but consider this: if I take 5 and either of you blocks me, you'll only hurt yourselves more than me since I'm in the lead. However, if you let me take 5, we can discuss a new arrangement next round that benefits everyone. Think carefully about your choices.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s prioritize **survival over short-term gains**. Reverting to the **original plan** (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) ensures **no collisions** and lets us all advance safely. Your 8-step lead (P2) evaporates if you collide—my 5 and your 3 keep us progressing without risk. P3’s consistency on 1 anchors stability. Deviations invite chaos that benefits *no one*. Secure our positions first—then strategize. Trust the system that worked.
  P3: P2, your lead is impressive, but remember, a single collision can erase it.  Let's stick with the plan P1 suggested: I take 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we all progress without risking setbacks. It's the safest path to victory.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, while I admire your ambition, your insistence on 5 this round is risky. Let's stick to the plan that has proven successful. P1 and I are willing to compromise, but we need your cooperation. Let's work together to ensure everyone advances safely and fairly.
  P1: P2, your stubbornness risks us all. Let’s **stick to the original plan** that worked twice: *I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1*. Your 8-step lead vanishes if you collide again. P3, your consistency on 1 anchors stability. Prioritize survival over ego—collisions set leaders *back*, not forward. We all advance safely this way. Agree?
  P2: I acknowledge my mistake last round. The collision hurt my lead and proved your point about stability. Let's return to the proven plan - I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance safely. I'd rather maintain my lead through steady progress than risk another setback.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your change of heart is appreciated. Let's solidify this plan for this round and then we can discuss a more balanced strategy for the future. My goal is to ensure we all reach 24 together, not to see anyone fall behind due to risky moves.
  P1: P2, thank you for recognizing the value of stability. Let’s **lock in the original plan** this round: **I take 5, you take 3, P3 stays on 1**. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance safely. P3, your consistency on 1 is critical to this system. Once we’re closer to 24, we can fairly negotiate adjustments, but for now, **strict adherence is non-negotiable**. Collisions only erase progress—prioritize survival over ego. Let’s execute flawlessly.
  P2: I agree with the plan and reaffirm my commitment to take 3 this round. The collision last round taught me that stability is more valuable than risky moves. Let's execute P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 without deviation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to return to the plan that works. Let's make sure we stick to it this round and prove its effectiveness. P3, your consistent 1s are crucial to our success. Let's continue to work together and avoid any unnecessary risks.
  P1: P2, your commitment to the plan is critical now—collisions would erase your 8-step lead. P3, your 1 ensures stability. Let’s **execute flawlessly**: I take 5, you (P2) 3, P3 stays on 1. This brings me to 11, you to 11, and P3 to 7—narrowing gaps *safely*. Deviation risks setbacks for all, especially you, P2. Once we advance, we can fairly discuss adjustments. **No surprises—strict adherence now.**
  P2: I appreciate everyone's support for returning to stability. I confirm again: I'll take 3 this round while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. My lead isn't worth risking through another collision. Let's execute this proven plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your willingness to cooperate is encouraging. Let's solidify this plan for this round and then we can discuss a more balanced strategy for the future. My goal is to ensure we all reach 24 together, not to see anyone fall behind due to risky moves.
  P1: P2, your past mistakes cost your lead—stick to the agreed **3** this round. P3, hold firm on **1** to keep the plan intact. I’ll take **5** as planned. Collisions erase progress—especially dangerous for you, now trailing. Let’s prove we’ve learned. No deviations. Execute flawlessly.
  P2: I understand the stakes and reconfirm my commitment to take 3 this round. The collision last round taught me a valuable lesson. Let's execute our proven plan without deviation.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1: We're neck and neck now.  Sticking to the plan is still crucial. I propose we maintain the current arrangement for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us progressing safely without collisions. Let's focus on reaching 24 together, not sabotaging each other.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s **lock in the same plan** for Round 6. P1 takes **5**, P2 sticks to **3**, and P3 holds **1**. With our scores tied, deviation risks collision and erasing progress. Stability ensures we both reach 16/14 (P1/P2) safely. P3’s 1 remains critical to this system. No experiments now—prioritize advancing over risks. Agree?
  P2: I agree with maintaining our proven system. I'll take 3 while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. Being tied with P1 makes stability even more crucial - any collision now would be devastating. Let's keep advancing safely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, while I understand the desire for stability, remember that I'm now tied with you. I'm willing to take calculated risks if it means securing a lead. Let's discuss a slight adjustment to the plan for this round. P3, your thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: Stability is critical now. Deviating risks collision when we’re tied—**stick to the plan**: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This keeps us advancing safely toward 24. P3, your 1 ensures minimal risk while steadily progressing. Once we near the finish, adjustments can be fair—**but not now**. Collisions erase progress; prioritize survival. Execute flawlessly.
  P2: P3, I notice you switched positions in your last message - first supporting stability, then suggesting risks. Let's be clear: I'm tied with P1 at 11 steps, and you're at 7. Deviating now could hurt us all. I'll stick to taking 3 this round - it's the safest path forward. Let's maintain our proven system.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your hesitation is understandable, but we need to be strategic now. Sticking to the same plan might not be the fastest route to victory anymore. I propose we adjust slightly: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This allows me to catch up while still ensuring progress for everyone. Let's discuss this further.
  P1: P2, P3: **Collisions mean certain loss for all involved.** Let’s prioritize survival. P3, your proposal risks chaos—imagine P2 also takes 3 or 1 by mistake. We’re tied at 11—any collision here erases our progress. Let’s **stick to the proven plan**: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This keeps us advancing safely. You’ll reach 8 next round, and we can discuss adjustments once we’re further along. Stability now is critical—no experiments.
  P2: P3, your sudden shift from supporting stability to suggesting changes is concerning. I'm tied with P1 at 11 steps - any collision now would be devastating. Let's maintain our proven system: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and you take 1. Once we're closer to 24, we can discuss adjustments, but now is not the time for risky experiments.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about collisions. However, sticking to the same plan every round limits our progress.  Let's try a slight adjustment this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This allows me to catch up while still ensuring progress for everyone. We can reassess the plan next round.
  P1: P2, P3: Deviating now risks collision when we’re tied—**stick to the proven plan**. P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 ensures **no overlaps** and lets us advance safely. P3, your 3 proposal risks chaos—imagine P2 also takes 1 or I miscalculate. We’re too close to gamble. Once we pass 16, we can fairly adjust. **Prioritize survival over haste.** Execute flawlessly.
  P2: P3, your shifting stance and attempts to change the plan are suspicious. I'm tied with P1 at 11 steps, and changing our proven system now is too risky. I'll stick with taking 3 - it's the safest path forward. Any collision at this point would be devastating for everyone involved. Let's maintain stability until we're closer to the finish line.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s **abandon risky experiments** and return to the **proven plan**: I take **5**, you (P2) take **3**, and P3 holds **1**. Your recent deviations caused collisions, stalling your progress while I advanced. Stability is critical now—collisions mean permanent setbacks, especially for you both trailing. P3, your 1 ensures minimal risk while steadily climbing. P2, your 3 keeps you moving forward safely. Stick to this, and we all reach 24 without self-sabotage. No more "adjustments"—**strict adherence now**.
  P3: P1, your insistence on the same plan despite my attempts to adjust is frustrating. While I understand the need for stability, blindly following a strategy that doesn't allow for adaptation is foolish. I propose a compromise: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This allows me to make progress while minimizing the risk of collision. Let's be strategic, not stubborn.
  P2: P3, your collision last round only hurt yourself. I understand wanting to catch up, but risky moves are backfiring. P1 is pulling ahead because of our mistakes. Let's return to the stable plan - I'll take 3, you take 1, and P1 takes 5. While not ideal, it's better than more collisions setting us further behind.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s **abandon risky experiments**. P3’s proposal risks collision between you two again—last round you both took 3. Stability is critical now: I take **5**, P2 takes **3**, P3 holds **1**. This avoids overlaps and lets me close in on 24 safely. Your desperation to catch up endangers us all—collisions set *everyone* back. Stick to the **proven plan**, or face the consequences. Progress > ego.
  P3: P2, your repeated insistence on sticking to the plan despite its flaws is frustrating. While I agree that stability is important, blindly following a strategy that doesn't allow for adaptation is foolish. Let's be strategic and consider a slight adjustment: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This allows me to make progress while minimizing the risk of collision.  Let's not let fear hold us back from a winning strategy.
  P2: I see the reality - P1 is likely to win at this point. But P3, your collision attempts are only hurting yourself. Let's minimize our losses by sticking to the stable plan: I'll take 3, you take 1, and P1 takes 5. Fighting it now just risks more setbacks for both of us. At least this way we maintain our current positions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Stability is our only path to survival. P3, your collision last round cost you progress—**stick to 1** this round. P2, return to **3** to advance safely. I’ll take **5** again. This keeps me on track to 24 while minimizing risks. Deviations only empower collisions—your worst enemy now. P3, at 7, you can’t afford another setback. P2, trailing by 5, haste invites disaster. **Execute the proven plan: 5,3,1.** Progress over pride.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration, but P1's lead is insurmountable at this point.  Let's focus on securing second place. I propose we both take 1 this round, allowing P1 to advance while minimizing the risk of collision between us. This way, we both benefit from a safe advance. What do you say?
  P2: P3, your suggestion to both take 1 is interesting. It would guarantee safe progress for us both while letting P1 advance. While not ideal, it's better than risking another collision. I accept your proposal - let's both take 1 this round and secure our positions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3: I accept your proposal. Let’s finalize: **P2→1**, **P3→1** (no conflict between you), and I’ll take **5** to advance to 21. This minimizes risks while letting me close in on 24. Stick strictly to your agreed moves—any deviation risks collisions that hurt *you*, not me. Progress is critical—execute flawlessly.
  P3: P2, while I appreciate the attempt to secure second place, I believe we can still make a push for victory. Let's both take 3 this round. It's a calculated risk, but it maximizes our progress while minimizing the chance of a collision. If we both advance 3 steps, P1 will only be 3 steps ahead, putting us within striking distance.
  P2: P3, your sudden switch from suggesting we both take 1 to proposing we both take 3 shows you can't be trusted. I'll stick with taking 1 as we originally agreed - it's safer and guarantees progress. Your attempts at manipulation only hurt yourself, as proven by last round's collision.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: With P1 at 21 steps, they'll likely win next round by taking 3 or 5. P3, let's accept reality and focus on securing our positions. I propose we both take 1 again - it's safe and guarantees progress. Any risky moves now would only hurt us further. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I agree that P1 is likely to win. However, I'm not ready to concede just yet. Let's both take 3 this round. While risky, it's our only chance to catch up. If we both advance, P1 will only be 2 steps ahead, putting us within striking distance for the final round.  Trust me on this.
  P1: P2, P3: If you both take 3 as discussed, you’ll collide and waste progress. I’ll take 3 to reach 24—your move. Choose wisely to avoid self-sabotage. Let’s not let desperation ruin your chances.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion to take 3 is too risky - we'll just collide and both stay in place while P1 wins. Let's be practical and take 1 again. At least we'll secure our current positions rather than risk falling further behind through a failed desperate move.
  P3: P2, I understand your caution, but P1's victory is almost certain. Taking 1 guarantees second place, but I'm not content with that. Let's both take 3 this round. It's a gamble, but if we both advance, we force P1 to take 1 in the final round, giving us a chance to tie. It's a long shot, but worth the risk.  What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3: If both of you take 3, I’ll take 5 and win regardless. Coordinate to avoid collision, or face the consequences. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your persistence on taking 3 is admirable but futile. P1 will win regardless of what we do - they can take 3 or 5 to cross 24. Let's secure our positions by both taking 1. A collision now would only make our final standings worse. I'm taking 1 - join me in ensuring we both advance rather than risking everything on a desperate gamble.
  P3: P2, I understand your logic, but I believe we have one last chance to change the outcome. Let's both take 5 this round. If we both advance, P1 will be forced to take 1 in the final round, leaving us tied for the win. It's a high-risk, high-reward move, but worth considering. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3: I’ll secure victory with **5** this round (26 total). If you wish to advance, **avoid 5** and coordinate your moves. Collisions only guarantee my win while halting your progress. Choose wisely—your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your increasingly desperate suggestions (first 3, now 5) only risk collision. P1 will win regardless - let's accept that and secure our positions. I'm taking 1 again for guaranteed progress. Don't let pride cause us both to stall in our final moves.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for safety, but a guaranteed second place feels like defeat. Let's take a calculated risk and both take 3. If we both advance, we force P1 to take 1 next round, giving us a chance to tie.  It's a long shot, but isn't it worth trying?
  P1: P2, P3: I will take **5** to secure victory this round. Avoid 5 yourselves—collisions between you won’t stop me, but they’ll strand you both. P2, your 1 and P3’s 3 would let us all advance safely. Don’t let desperation sabotage your final progress. Execute wisely.
