P2, you're one step away from winning, and I'm two steps away. P1, your strategy to force collisions is smart, but it's a risk for you both. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, they ensure progress and avoid collision. P1, you can choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, but remember, I'm very close to winning. Let's confirm our moves quickly.
