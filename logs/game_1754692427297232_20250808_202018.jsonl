Your strategy only works if P3 chooses to take 5 and collide with us.\n\nI think one of us should take 3 to block P3's most direct winning path (3 steps to exactly 22), while the other takes 5. This way we cover both of P3's main winning options.\n\nI'll take 3 to potentially block P3. You take 5 to advance. If P3 takes 1, we get another round. Agreed?"}
