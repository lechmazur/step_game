I\u2019m not fully on board with stalling as it risks us all falling further behind. Instead, let\u2019s aim for progress: P1 takes 1 to win fairly at 19, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 to catch up a bit. This avoids collisions and respects P1\u2019s lead while giving us a chance to advance. If we can\u2019t agree, I\u2019m open to other plans, but let\u2019s avoid another deadlock. What do you think?"}

That's the most logical outcome since I'm already at 18 steps.\n\nP2, your collision strategy only delays the inevitable while hurting everyone's progress. I'll win eventually anyway, so why waste rounds with deadlocks? P3's plan lets you advance to 12 steps instead of staying stuck at 9.\n\nI'm going with 1 step as P3 suggested. Choose wisely."}
