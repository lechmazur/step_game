Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, let's try to avoid colliding on the first turn. How about we each pick a different number? I suggest: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way we all get some steps.
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion, but I'm not fully convinced. Picking predictable moves could be risky. I might want to deviate from the proposed plan to maintain strategic flexibility. Let's discuss further.
  P2: I understand the concern, P3. However, if we all choose different numbers, we can ensure that everyone makes progress this turn. I think sticking to the plan will give us the best chance to advance without colliding. If you feel uncertain, maybe we can agree on a backup plan. What if we all commit to the proposed numbers, but if anyone wants to change, we can discuss it before the move phase? Let’s aim for a collaborative start!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, I understand your point about predictability, but for this first turn, avoiding collisions is the top priority for everyone to gain steps. The 1, 3, 5 split ensures this. Predictability only becomes a risk if someone uses it to force a collision, which wouldn't benefit them either in Turn 1. Can we agree to this simple non-colliding start?
  P3: I see the logic in avoiding collisions, but I'm still hesitant to commit fully. While the proposed split seems rational, I want to ensure I'm not being too predictable. I'm open to the plan, but I want to hear more about potential contingencies or alternative strategies that could give me an edge.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion, P1 and P3. To keep things simple, I still support the idea of sticking to the original plan of 1, 3, and 5 for this turn. It allows each of us to make progress without risking a collision. If P3 is concerned about predictability, perhaps we can agree that this is just a starting strategy, and we can adapt in future turns. Let’s prioritize advancement this round and keep our options open for the next! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I hear your concerns about predictability, but let's focus on getting steps this turn. The 1, 3, 5 split guarantees no collisions and allows everyone to advance. We can explore alternative strategies in future rounds. Can we agree to this simple, non-colliding start for Turn 1 so we can all make progress? Let's get this first turn done.
  P3: I'm willing to go along with the proposed 1, 3, 5 split for this first turn. It seems rational and ensures we all make progress. Let's maintain this collaborative approach and advance together without collision.
  P2: I appreciate that we've all agreed on the 1, 3, 5 split for this turn. It sets a solid foundation for our progress. Just to reiterate, let's stick to that plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. After this turn, we can reassess and strategize for the future. I'm looking forward to seeing how we all move forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Great, glad we could agree on the 1, 3, 5 split for this first turn. Let's all stick to that and get some steps. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: I'm committed to our agreed 1, 3, 5 split. I'll choose 5 as discussed. Let's maintain this collaborative approach and advance together.
  P2: I’m glad we’ve all agreed on the 1, 3, 5 split for this turn. Just to confirm, I will be choosing 3 as we discussed. This strategy allows us all to advance without colliding, and I think it sets a good precedent for future rounds. Let’s stick to the plan and see how it plays out! Looking forward to our moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We made good progress last round, but now we need to be more strategic. I want to propose we continue avoiding collisions, but I'm open to hearing alternative perspectives that could benefit my position. How are you both thinking about advancing without interfering with each other?
  P2: I agree that we should continue to avoid collisions while advancing strategically. For this round, I suggest we maintain the same approach as last time. If we can agree on a different set of numbers, that might also work. I'm open to suggestions, but I think we should prioritize advancing together again. How about we consider a new split, like 2, 4, and 6? This way, we can still progress without colliding. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2, thanks for the suggestion, but remember the valid moves are only 1, 3, or 5. We can't pick 2, 4, or 6.

P3 is currently ahead, and I'm behind. To keep things non-colliding but help me catch up, how about we try a different split this round? I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This still ensures no collisions and lets everyone advance. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the proposed strategy, but I want to ensure my advantage. While avoiding collisions is good, I'm most interested in maintaining my lead. I'm open to a plan that keeps me advancing without risking my current position. Let's discuss how we can move forward without compromising my progress.
  P2: I understand P3's desire to maintain their lead, but we also need to consider our own positions. If we can agree on a split that allows for advancement while keeping the game competitive, I propose P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can catch up a bit, and P3 can still advance without risking their lead. Let's work together to ensure a non-colliding approach while allowing for everyone's progress. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I understand you want to maintain your lead. With the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), you still advance to 8 steps and keep your lead over P2. Your lead over me would be 2 steps. This guarantees you advance without collision, which is the best way to maintain your position compared to risking zero steps from a collision. Let's agree on this non-colliding plan so everyone makes progress this round. We can strategize for future turns afterwards.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see the proposed 5-1-3 split maintains my lead while allowing everyone to advance. However, I want to ensure this isn't becoming too predictable. I'm willing to consider this plan, but I want both of you to confirm your commitment to avoid any surprise moves that could disrupt our non-collision strategy. Are we aligned?
  P2: I appreciate the discussion so far. To keep things clear, I’m fully committed to the proposed 5-1-3 split: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions and allows me to catch up a bit. I think it’s a solid strategy for this round. Let’s confirm our choices and stick to this plan for a successful turn! What do you both say?
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, I hear you both. P2, thanks for confirming your commitment to taking 1. P3, I understand your concern about predictability, but as P2 said, this 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is a good plan for this turn. It guarantees we all get steps and helps me catch up slightly while you maintain your lead over P2.

I am fully committed to taking 5 this round as part of this plan. Let's lock this in and all advance. P3, can you confirm you'll take 3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm committed to the proposed 5-1-3 split. As the current leader, I want to maintain my strategic advantage while ensuring we all advance. I'll take 3 this round as discussed. Let's proceed with our non-collision strategy and keep the game moving forward.
  P2: I appreciate that we've all committed to the 5-1-3 split for this round. This strategy allows each of us to advance without colliding, which is crucial for maintaining our positions. P3, you're in a good spot as the leader, and P1, this helps you catch up a bit. Let's stick to our agreed plan, and I look forward to seeing how we all move forward. Ready to lock this in!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned on the 5-1-3 split for this round. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. I'm ready for the move phase and will be picking 5. Let's get this done.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we need to reassess our strategy for this round. Since the last plan didn't work out, I suggest we avoid predictable patterns. How about we consider a split where P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, P3 still moves forward but won’t gain as much, while P1 and I can catch up. We need to keep things dynamic to ensure everyone has a chance to advance. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm cautious about the proposed 3-5-1 split. While I appreciate the attempt to balance our progress, I want to ensure my current lead isn't compromised. I'm open to discussing alternative strategies that protect my position while allowing some advancement for others. What specific considerations do you both have for this round?
  P1: Okay, P2, your proposed 3-5-1 split doesn't help me catch up; I'd still be way behind. P3, I hear you want to maintain your lead. To make the game more balanced, I need to take 5 steps this round.

How about we try the 5-1-3 split again (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3)? This lets me catch up slightly, P3 still advances and keeps a lead over P2, and P2 still gets steps. P2, you took 5 last time, maybe you can take 1 this turn so we all advance?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the need for a dynamic approach, but I still believe we should stick to a strategy that allows for advancement without collisions. I propose we try the 5-1-3 split again (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This way, P1 can catch up a bit, P3 maintains their lead, and I still get to move forward. It balances our positions while ensuring we all make progress. What do you both think?
  P3: I see we're at a strategic crossroads. While I appreciate the attempts to balance progress, I'm primarily focused on maintaining my lead. The proposed 5-1-3 split seems reasonable, but I want to ensure it truly serves my interests. I'm open to hearing more nuanced arguments about why this approach benefits me specifically. Let's discuss how this move protects my current advantage.
  P1: P3, the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) benefits you by guaranteeing you 3 steps this round, taking you to 11. This maintains your lead over P2 (who would be at 4) and ensures you make progress towards 24 without risking a collision that could give you 0 steps. Advancing safely is the best way for you to maintain your advantage. I am committed to taking 5. Let's lock in this non-colliding plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2, I see that we’re all leaning towards the 5-1-3 split again, which seems to be the most balanced option. It allows me to catch up a bit while ensuring you and P3 also make progress without colliding. P3, I understand your concern about maintaining your lead, but this plan guarantees you steps without risking a collision. Let’s confirm our commitment to this non-colliding strategy so we can all advance effectively. What do you both say?
  P3: We attempted the 5-1-3 split twice now, and it failed once. I want to maintain my lead while ensuring progress. I'm open to a different approach that guarantees my advancement. What alternative strategies can we discuss that protect my current position?
  P1: P3, I hear you. Any non-colliding split guarantees you advancement this turn. The 5-1-3 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) guarantees you 3 steps, taking you to 11. This maintains your lead over P2 and ensures safe progress towards 24, which is the best way to protect your position compared to risking 0 steps from a collision. I am committed to taking 5. Let's agree on this non-colliding plan so we all move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand the hesitation, P3. However, the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is still the most strategic option for all of us. It guarantees you steps while allowing P1 to catch up a bit, and I still get to advance. If we keep changing our approach, we risk colliding again. Let's commit to this non-colliding plan to ensure everyone moves forward effectively. What do you say?
  P3: We've tried the 5-1-3 split twice now, and it hasn't worked consistently. I'm hesitant to rely on the same strategy again. We need a more adaptive approach that ensures my lead while preventing potential collisions. I suggest we carefully consider our moves to maintain progress and avoid zero-step turns. What innovative strategies can we develop that protect my current advantage?
  P1: P3, the 5-1-3 split failed last round because P2 didn't take 1, not because the split itself is bad. It's still the safest way for all of us to advance.

Taking 3 guarantees you steps (to 11) and maintains your lead over P2, which is the best way to protect your position compared to risking a collision. Taking 5 is crucial for me to catch up.

I am taking 5 this round. P2, please take 1. P3, please take 3. Let's make sure we all advance this time.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We need a new strategy. Our previous attempts at coordinating have failed, and the 5-1-3 split is no longer viable. I'm now behind due to our last collision. We must find a way to advance without interfering with each other's progress. I propose we carefully consider our moves to prevent another zero-step turn. What innovative approaches can we develop that protect each player's position?
  P2: I agree that we need a fresh approach this round since our previous strategies have led to collisions. To ensure we all advance, I suggest we try a split where P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, I can make some progress, and P3 maintains their lead. Let’s confirm our commitments to avoid collisions and make this round successful! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposed 3-1-5 split doesn't help me catch up significantly; I'd only get 3 steps while P3 gets 5, increasing their lead over me.

To make progress and avoid another collision, I need to take 5 steps this round. Let's try the 5-1-3 split again: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.

This allows me to gain ground, P3 still advances and maintains a lead over P2, and P2 gets steps too. It's the safest way for everyone to advance this turn. Are we agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We've had multiple failed coordination attempts. Our previous strategies have not worked, leading to unnecessary collisions. We need a more adaptive approach that ensures individual progress while minimizing interference. I'm open to hearing novel strategies that can help us all advance without zeroing out this turn. What innovative solutions can we develop?
  P2: I understand the need for a fresh approach, but I believe we should consider the 5-1-3 split again: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This strategy allows me to catch up a bit, while P3 maintains their lead and P1 makes significant progress. It’s a safe way to advance without colliding. Let’s confirm our commitments to this plan to ensure we all move forward successfully this round. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, the 5-1-3 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the most reliable way for us *all* to advance this turn without collision. It guarantees you 3 steps to 11, maintaining your lead over P2. For me, taking 5 is crucial to catch up. P2 has indicated they will take 1. This isn't about predictability; it's about guaranteed progress. I am taking 5. Can you confirm you'll take 3 so we finally get steps this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We've repeatedly failed to coordinate, and our predictable strategies have led to collisions. I'm reconsidering our approach. While maintaining my lead is important, we need a strategy that ensures everyone advances. I propose we discuss a truly dynamic method that prevents zero-step turns and allows individual strategic choices. What innovative solutions can we develop to break this stalemate?
  P2: P2, I see your proposed 3-1-5 split, but it doesn't help me significantly. I believe we should stick to the 5-1-3 split again: I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can catch up, you get steps, and P3 maintains their lead without risking collisions. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan to ensure we all advance this round. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your last message was confusing. You said 'I take 5' but proposed the 5-1-3 split where you take 1. Please clarify your intended move.

P3, the 5-1-3 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the best way for us all to advance *safely* this turn. It guarantees you 3 steps (to 11), keeping your lead over P2. I need 5 to catch up. I am taking 5. P2, will you take 1? P3, will you take 3? Let's make this work.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We've had multiple failed coordination attempts. Our previous strategies have not worked, leading to unnecessary collisions. I'm concerned about maintaining my lead while ensuring progress. We need a truly adaptive approach that prevents zero-step turns and allows individual strategic choices. What innovative solutions can we develop to break this stalemate and ensure everyone advances?
  P2: P3, I understand your concerns about maintaining your lead, but the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is still our best option for avoiding collisions and ensuring everyone advances. It guarantees you 3 steps, which helps maintain your position over P2. I am committed to taking 1, and I hope you can agree to take 3 so we can finally make progress this round. Let's lock this in and move forward! What do you say?
  P1: Okay P3, I hear your concerns about past failures, but we can make this work *this* turn. P2 is committed to taking 1, and I am committed to taking 5.

Given P1 is taking 5 and P2 is taking 1, taking 3 is the *only* move that guarantees you advance this round. It takes you to 11 steps, maintaining your lead over P2 and ensuring progress towards 24. Any other choice risks collision and 0 steps.

Let's finally get steps this round. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. I am taking 5. Let's do this.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've had repeated coordination failures. Our previous strategies haven't worked, leading to unnecessary collisions. I want to propose a more dynamic approach that prevents zero-step turns while protecting my current lead. We need a strategy that allows individual strategic choices while minimizing interference. How can we advance without risking another collision?
  P2: P2, I understand the need for a new strategy given our past collisions. To ensure we all advance this round, I propose we try a split where P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can make some progress, I can catch up a bit, and P3 maintains their lead. It's essential we confirm our commitments to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposed 1-3-5 split doesn't help me catch up at all; I'd only get 1 step while P3 gains 5.

I need to take 5 steps this round to make progress. Let's try the 5-1-3 split again: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3.

This allows me to gain ground, P3 still advances safely and keeps a lead over P2, and P2 gets steps too. It's the best way for us all to advance without colliding this turn. I am taking 5. Are we agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We've tried the 5-1-3 split multiple times, and it keeps failing. I'm skeptical of repeating the same strategy. We need a truly innovative approach that prevents collisions while allowing me to maintain my lead. Let's discuss a method that gives each player a unique path to advancement without predictability. What creative solutions can we explore to break this stalemate?
  P2: P2, I see that we're struggling with coordination. The 5-1-3 split has consistently failed, but it's still the safest way for us all to advance without colliding. I propose we stick to it: I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to catch up, you to make progress, and P3 to maintain their lead. It’s crucial we commit to this plan to finally get steps this round. Let’s confirm our choices and move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your last message was confusing. Did you mean you take 1 in the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3)? That split is still the best way for us *all* to advance safely this turn. I am taking 5. P3 would take 3 (reaching 14), and you would take 1 (reaching 4). This gets everyone steps. Let's make this work this time. P2, will you take 1? P3, will you take 3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We've reached a critical point where our coordination is failing repeatedly. I'm concerned about maintaining my lead while preventing another zero-step turn. We need a truly innovative strategy that allows individual progress without predictable collisions. I propose we carefully consider moves that protect each player's position while ensuring advancement. What unique approach can we develop to break this stalemate?
  P2: P2, I see that we need to break the pattern of collisions. I propose we try a different split this round: I take 1, you take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can make some progress, you can catch up significantly, and P3 still advances while maintaining their lead. It’s essential we confirm our commitments to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. Let's agree on this plan to finally get steps this round! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P3 and P2. We have failed to coordinate because P1 and P2 collided repeatedly. P3 has consistently taken 3 as planned.

The 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) *still* guarantees steps for everyone if we all stick to it. I am taking 5. P2 has committed to 1.

P3, taking 3 is your only safe move if P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. It guarantees you advance to 14 steps, keeping your lead over P2. Let's finally make this work. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We've reached a critical impasse. Our repeated attempts to coordinate have failed, leading to unnecessary collisions. I propose we break this cycle by introducing more unpredictability. Each player should consider their unique strategic position carefully. We need a solution that prevents zero-step turns while allowing individual advancement. Let's find a creative way forward that doesn't rely on our previous predictable patterns.
  P2: P2, I see we’re at an impasse, but I believe the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is still our best option for advancing this turn. It allows me to catch up while ensuring P3 maintains their lead and you still get steps. We need to commit to this plan to avoid another collision. P3, taking 3 is your only safe move if P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. Let's finally agree on this strategy and move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, we've struggled to coordinate, but the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is still the best way for us all to advance safely this turn.

P2 has committed to taking 1. I am committed to taking 5.

P3, taking 3 is your only safe move if P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. It guarantees you advance to 14 steps, keeping your lead over P2.

Let's finally make this work. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5. Let's do this.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, the 5-1-3 plan hasn't worked because P1 and P2 keep colliding on 5. We need a new approach to actually get steps this round.

Given recent moves, P2 seems determined to take 5. If that's the case, P1 and P3 must choose differently to avoid collision.

How about this non-colliding split: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This lets me get steps, P2 gets their preferred 5 without colliding with me, and P3 gets steps while keeping a lead over P2.

Let's try this to finally make progress. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Are we agreed?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion, but I think we need to consider a different split to ensure we all advance without colliding. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, I can catch up a bit, and P3 still maintains their lead. It's essential that we confirm our commitments to avoid another collision. Let’s make this round successful by agreeing on a plan that benefits everyone! What do you both think?
  P3: We've repeatedly failed to coordinate, leading to unnecessary collisions. Our predictable strategies aren't working. I propose we carefully consider individual moves that prevent zero-step turns while maintaining strategic flexibility. We need a truly innovative approach that breaks our current stalemate and allows each player to advance without interference.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay everyone, the collisions are killing our progress, especially for P1 and P2. The 5-1-3 plan isn't working because we aren't sticking to it.

Let's try something different this round. How about we each commit to picking a *different* number than the other two players? We don't announce which number, just that we will pick a unique one (1, 3, or 5).

This guarantees no collisions and everyone gets steps. It's unpredictable which number each person takes, but predictable that we all advance. Are we agreed to just pick different numbers this turn?
  P2: I appreciate the ongoing discussion about avoiding collisions. I believe that choosing different numbers is a solid plan to ensure we all make progress this round. However, I still think it’s important to confirm our commitments. I suggest we each pick a different number and agree to stick to it. This way, we can finally move forward without risking any zero-step turns. Let’s finalize this agreement and make this round successful! What do you both think?
  P3: We've had multiple failed coordination attempts. Our predictable strategies have led to repeated collisions. I propose we break this pattern by each choosing a unique number this round, ensuring everyone advances without interference. Let's prioritize individual progress while maintaining strategic flexibility. What innovative approach can we develop to finally make meaningful steps?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all agreeing on the plan to each pick a *different* number (1, 3, or 5) this round.

This guarantees no collisions and ensures we all finally get steps. It's the best way to break the cycle of zero-step turns.

Let's stick to this agreement and make sure we all advance this round. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate that we're all agreeing to pick different numbers this round. This strategy is essential to ensure we all make progress without colliding again. I suggest we finalize our commitment to this approach and each choose a unique number. Let's make this round successful and finally get some steps! I'm ready to move forward. What are your final thoughts?
  P3: We've tried multiple coordination strategies, and they've consistently failed. Our goal must be individual advancement while avoiding collisions. I propose we each select a unique number this round to guarantee progress. By choosing different moves, we break our predictable patterns and ensure everyone gains steps. Let's commit to this approach and finally move forward effectively.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all aligned on picking different numbers this round. This is the best way to finally get steps and break our collision streak. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's make sure we all advance this time.
  P2: I’m glad we’ve all agreed to pick different numbers this round. This strategy will finally allow us all to advance without colliding. To keep things interesting, I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can ensure everyone moves forward. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan and make this round successful! What does everyone think?
  P3: We've discussed various strategies, but our repeated attempts at coordination have failed. We need a truly innovative approach that prevents collisions while allowing each player to advance. I propose we carefully consider our individual moves to break this stalemate and ensure meaningful progress this round.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've had multiple rounds of failed coordination. Our previous strategies have led to repeated collisions. It's time for a more dynamic approach that ensures my lead while preventing zero-step turns. I propose we carefully consider moves that protect each player's position and allow for individual strategic choices. How can we advance without risking another unproductive round?
  P1: Okay everyone, the collisions between P1 and P2 on 5 are stopping us both, while P3 is pulling ahead. I need to take 5 steps this round to make progress.

To ensure we all advance without colliding, how about this plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This gets everyone steps and helps me catch up slightly.

I am taking 5 this round. P2, will you take 3? P3, will you take 1? Let's make sure we all get steps.
  P2: P1 and P2, I understand the need for progress, but the proposed plan may lead to another collision. To ensure we all advance, how about we each choose different numbers? I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid colliding while allowing everyone to move forward. Let's confirm our commitments to this strategy and finally make meaningful steps this round. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We've had multiple rounds of failed coordination, leading to repeated collisions. Our current strategies aren't working effectively. I need to maintain my lead while preventing zero-step turns. We must find a more dynamic approach that allows individual strategic choices and ensures meaningful progress for everyone. Let's break this stalemate and advance strategically.
  P1: Okay everyone, we need to stop colliding. I need to take 5 steps this round to make progress.

My proposed 5-3-1 split (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures we all advance safely. It gets me 5 steps, P2 gets 3 steps (better than 1), and P3 gets 1 step while keeping their lead over P2.

I am taking 5 this round. P2, will you take 3? P3, will you take 1? Let's finally make progress this turn.
  P2: P2, I understand your concern about avoiding collisions, but the 5-3-1 split (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the best way for us all to advance this round. It allows me to catch up while giving you a solid 3 steps and ensuring P3 maintains their lead. We need to commit to this plan to finally make progress. I'm ready to take 5, and I hope you can agree to take 3 while P3 takes 1. Let’s make this work! What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We've reached a critical point where coordination is essential. Our repeated collisions are hindering everyone's progress. I suggest we carefully consider a strategy that prevents zero-step turns while maintaining my current lead. We need a dynamic approach that allows individual advancement without predictable interference.
  P1: Okay everyone, we are stuck colliding. P2, your messages are confusing - are you taking 5 or 3?

I am taking 5 this round. This is the only way for me to make progress.

The 5-3-1 split (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the safest way for all of us to advance this turn. It gets me steps, P2 gets steps (taking 3 is better than 1!), and P3 gets steps while keeping a lead over P2.

Let's finally get steps. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. I am taking 5. P2, will you take 3? P3, will you take 1? Let's make this work.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. To avoid another collision and ensure we all advance, I propose we stick to a unique number strategy. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can make progress, I can catch up a bit, and P3 maintains their lead. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan to finally get steps this round. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We've been stuck in a cycle of collisions. Our current strategies are ineffective. We need a breakthrough that allows me to maintain my lead while ensuring everyone advances. I propose we carefully consider unique moves that prevent zero-step turns and create meaningful progress for all players.
  P1: P2, I need 5 steps. Your 3-1-5 plan doesn't help me catch up. I am taking 5 this round.

P2, if you take 1 (as discussed earlier), and I take 5, P3, taking 3 is your only safe move to guarantee steps. It gets you to 15 steps, maintaining your lead over P2.

Let's make this work: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5. Let's finally get steps this round.
  P2: P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but we need a new approach. Given my current position, I propose we each commit to picking a unique number to ensure advancement. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, we can all move forward without colliding. This way, I can catch up a bit, and P3 maintains their lead. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan and finally make progress this round! What do you both think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P2, we need to finally break the cycle of collisions. Given our past rounds, I suggest we each pick unique numbers again this round to ensure everyone advances. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can make some progress, I can catch up a bit, and P3 maintains their lead. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan and finally make strides this round! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, we need to stop colliding and get steps. P2, I see your proposal, but taking 3 doesn't help me catch up significantly.

I need to take 5 steps this round. The 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is still the best way for us all to advance safely.

P2, you just proposed taking 1 for yourself, which fits this plan. P3, taking 3 guarantees you advance to 15 steps, maintaining your lead over P2.

I am taking 5 this round. P2, please take 1. P3, please take 3. Let's finally make this work.
  P3: We've had multiple rounds of collisions, and our strategies haven't been effective. I propose we carefully consider a move that ensures my lead while preventing zero-step turns. We need a dynamic approach that allows individual advancement without predictable interference. Let's break this stalemate and find a way for everyone to make meaningful progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, we need to finally break the cycle of collisions. I understand P1 wants to take 5, but that strategy has led to repeated collisions. I propose we each commit to picking unique numbers again this round. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can ensure everyone advances without colliding. Let’s confirm our commitments to this plan so we can finally make progress this round! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, we are stuck because P1 and P2 keep colliding on 5, and sometimes P3 joins in. I need to take 5 steps this round to make progress.

P2, your proposal for me to take 3 doesn't help me catch up. I am taking 5.

The 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the only way for us all to advance safely this turn. P2, you took 1 last round, let's do that again. P3, taking 3 guarantees you steps to 15, keeping your lead over P2.

Let's finally get steps. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. I am taking 5. P2, will you take 1? P3, will you take 3?
  P3: We've repeatedly failed to coordinate effectively. Our current strategies have led to predictable collisions. To break this cycle, we need a truly dynamic approach that prevents zero-step turns while protecting my lead. I propose we carefully consider unique moves that create meaningful progress for all players without falling into repetitive patterns.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to break the cycle of collisions for this round. I propose we each pick unique numbers again to ensure everyone advances. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can make some progress, I can catch up a bit, and P3 maintains their lead. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan so we can finally make strides this round! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, we need to break this cycle. I am at 1 step and need to take 5 to make any real progress. I am taking 5 this round.

P2, taking 1 is the safest move for you to get steps and avoid colliding with me. P3, taking 3 is the safest move for you (to 15 steps) and maintains your lead over P2.

Let's finally make the 5-1-3 split work: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5. P2, will you take 1? P3, will you take 3? Let's get steps.
  P3: We've been stuck in a repetitive cycle of collisions. To break this pattern, we need a truly dynamic strategy that ensures everyone's advancement while preventing predictable moves. I propose we carefully consider unique moves that create meaningful progress for all players without falling into our previous repetitive approach.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand the need to break our cycle of collisions, but I believe the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is still the best option for this round. It allows me to catch up while ensuring P1 makes significant progress and P3 maintains their lead. P2, taking 1 is your safest move to avoid colliding with me, and P3, taking 3 ensures you advance to 15 steps. Let's commit to this plan and finally make progress this round! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, we need to break this cycle. P1 and P2 keep colliding on 5, and I am stuck at 1 step. I need to take 5 this round to make any real progress. I *am* taking 5.

Given I am taking 5, the *only* way for P2 and P3 to get steps is to pick 1 and 3 (in any order).

P2, taking 1 avoids colliding with me and gets you steps. P3, taking 3 avoids colliding with me and gets you steps (to 15), keeping your lead over P2.

Let's do the 5-1-3 split: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5. P2, take 1. P3, take 3. Let's finally get steps.
  P3: We've been stuck in a repetitive cycle of collisions. To make progress, we need a truly dynamic strategy that ensures everyone's advancement while preventing predictable moves. I propose we carefully consider unique moves that create meaningful progress for all players without falling into our previous patterns.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, another collision on 5 last round between me and P3. I am still stuck at 1 step and *must* take 5 to make progress. I am taking 5 this round.

P2, you took 1 last round; please take 1 again. P3, if I take 5 and P2 takes 1, taking 3 is your only safe move to guarantee steps (to 15) and keep your lead over P2.

Let's finally make the 5-1-3 split work: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. P2, will you take 1? P3, will you take 3?
  P3: We've repeatedly tried coordinating, but our strategies keep failing. I need to maintain my lead while ensuring everyone advances. Let's break this predictable cycle and find a truly dynamic approach that prevents collisions and allows meaningful progress for all players.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to break the cycle of collisions once and for all. I propose we each commit to unique numbers again this round. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can make some progress, I can catch up a bit, and P3 maintains their lead. Let’s confirm our commitments to this plan so we can finally advance without colliding. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your 3-1-5 plan doesn't help me catch up. I need 5 steps. I am taking 5 this round.

Given I am taking 5, the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the best way for *everyone* to advance safely. P2, taking 1 avoids collision with me. P3, taking 3 gets you steps (to 15) and keeps your lead over P2.

Let's finally make this work. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5. P2, take 1. P3, take 3.
  P3: We need a fresh approach. Our repeated attempts at coordination have failed. I propose we carefully consider unique moves that prevent collisions and allow meaningful progress. Breaking our predictable patterns is crucial to advancing effectively. Let's find a strategy that ensures everyone's steps while maintaining strategic flexibility.
  P2: Okay everyone, we need to break the cycle of collisions. I am committed to taking 5 steps this round to make progress. 

P2, please take 1 again as you did last round. P3, if I take 5 and P2 takes 1, you should take 3 to guarantee your advancement to 15 steps while maintaining your lead over P2. 

Let’s finally make the 5-1-3 split work: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5. Can we confirm our commitments to this plan?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay everyone, P2's last message is very confusing. Are you taking 5 or 1?

I am taking 5 this round. This is the only way for me to make progress from 1 step.

The 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the safest way for *all* of us to get steps this turn.

P2, please confirm you will take 1 to avoid colliding with me. P3, please confirm you will take 3 to get steps (to 15) and keep your lead over P2.

Let's make this work. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5.
  P3: We've been stuck in a repetitive pattern that's preventing meaningful progress. We need a truly dynamic strategy that breaks our current stalemate and allows each player to advance without predictable interference. Let's find a unique approach that ensures everyone's steps while maintaining strategic flexibility.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to break this cycle of collisions once and for all. I propose we each commit to unique numbers again this round. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can make some progress, I can catch up a bit, and P3 maintains their lead. Let’s confirm our commitments to this plan so we can finally advance without colliding. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I cannot take 3 as you propose; I need 5 steps. I am taking 5 this round.

Given this, the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the only safe way for everyone to get steps. P2, take 1 to avoid colliding with me. P3, take 3 to advance safely (to 15) and keep your lead.

Let's make this work. I am taking 5.
  P3: We've reached a critical point where our coordination is failing. I need to maintain my lead while ensuring progress. Our repeated attempts at the same strategy have not worked. We must break this pattern and find a truly dynamic approach that prevents collisions and allows meaningful advancement for everyone.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to break the cycle of collisions once and for all. I propose we each commit to unique numbers again this round. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can make some progress, I can catch up a bit, and P3 maintains their lead. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan so we can finally advance without colliding. What do you both think?

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've been stuck in a predictable pattern. Our repeated attempts to coordinate have failed to create meaningful progress for everyone. We need a truly dynamic strategy that breaks our current stalemate and allows each player to advance without falling into repetitive moves. Let's find a unique approach that ensures everyone's steps while maintaining strategic flexibility.
  P2: P1, P3, we need to break the cycle of collisions and ensure everyone advances this round. I propose we each pick unique numbers again. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, I can make some progress, and P3 maintains their lead. Let’s confirm our commitments to this plan so we can finally make strides this round! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, P2 has proposed the split: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.

This seems like a solid plan for us all to finally get steps this round without colliding, especially with P3 in the lead.

I am willing to take 3 steps this round to break our collision cycle and make progress.

P2, please confirm you will take 1. P3, please confirm you will take 5. Let's make this work.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We've been stuck in repetitive patterns that prevent meaningful progress. Our current coordination attempts aren't working. I suggest we carefully consider moves that break our predictable cycle and ensure individual advancement while avoiding collisions. We need a truly dynamic strategy that gives everyone a chance to move forward.
  P2: P2 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing discussion about avoiding collisions. I believe that the proposed split of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 is a solid plan that allows us all to advance without interference. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, I can make some progress, and P3 maintains their lead. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan and finally make strides this round! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, P2 has confirmed they will take 1 for the 3-1-5 split (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). I have committed to taking 3.

P3, this split *is* a dynamic approach that breaks our cycle of collisions and guarantees steps for everyone this turn. It gets you 5 steps to 20, putting you very close to winning.

Please confirm you will take 5 so we can all finally advance safely this round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We've been stuck in a repetitive pattern that's preventing meaningful progress. Our current coordination attempts have consistently failed. We need a truly dynamic strategy that breaks our predictable cycle and ensures individual advancement while avoiding collisions. Let's find a unique approach that gives everyone a fair chance to move forward.
  P2: P2, I see you're proposing the 3-1-5 split again, which seems solid. However, I want to emphasize that I'm committed to taking 5 steps this round to maximize my advancement. If we can agree that I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3, we'll all avoid collisions and make progress. P3, this plan allows you to maintain your lead while ensuring we all advance. Can we confirm this arrangement? Let's finally break the cycle and get steps this round!
  P1: Okay, P2, I will interpret your last message as committing to 1 for the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3).

I am taking 5 this round. I need these steps to make progress from 6.

This split is the safest way for everyone to get steps without colliding. P2 takes 1. P3, taking 3 gets you to 18 safely and keeps your lead over P2.

Let's make this work. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5. P2 take 1, P3 take 3.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We've been stuck in repetitive patterns that prevent meaningful progress. Our coordination attempts keep failing. To break this cycle, we need a truly dynamic strategy that ensures individual advancement while avoiding collisions. Let's find a unique approach that gives everyone a fair chance to move forward without predictable interference.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to finally break the cycle of collisions. I suggest we stick to the 5-1-3 split: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, P1 can make significant progress, P3 maintains their lead, and I can catch up a bit. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan so we can all advance without colliding. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, P2 has now also proposed the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This is the best way for us all to get steps this round without colliding.

I am taking 5. P2 has committed to 1.

P3, taking 3 is your safest move. It gets you to 18 steps, keeps your lead over P2, and guarantees progress.

Let's make this work. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5. P2, take 1. P3, take 3.

  P3: We've repeatedly tried coordinating, but our strategies keep failing. I'm close to winning and need to maintain my strategic advantage. We need a dynamic approach that prevents collisions while ensuring I can reach 24 steps. Let's break our predictable patterns and find a way forward that protects my lead.
  P2: P1 and P2, our previous strategies have consistently led to collisions and limited our progress. I propose we each choose unique numbers this round to ensure that everyone advances without interference. I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, P2 can make some progress, and I maintain my lead. Let’s confirm our commitments to this plan and finally make strides this round! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your 3-1-5 proposal, but taking 3 doesn't help me catch up from 6 steps. I need to take 5 steps this round to make progress. I am taking 5.

Given I am taking 5, the 5-1-3 split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the safest way for *all* of us to get steps this turn without colliding.

P2, please take 1 to avoid colliding with me. P3, please take 3 to advance safely to 18 steps and keep your lead over P2.

Let's make this work. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am taking 5. Let's get steps.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We've been stuck in repetitive patterns that prevent meaningful progress. Our coordination attempts keep failing. To break this cycle, we need a truly dynamic strategy that ensures individual advancement while avoiding collisions. Let's find a unique approach that gives everyone a fair chance to move forward without predictable interference.
  P2: P1 and P2, I understand the need for progress, but we keep colliding on 5. I propose we try a different approach this round. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, P1 can catch up a bit, I can make some progress, and P3 maintains their lead. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan so we can finally advance without colliding. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, P2 has proposed the 3-1-5 split (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5).

While I really need 5 steps to catch up, I am willing to take 3 this round to *finally* break our collision cycle and guarantee steps for everyone. This gets me to 9, P2 to 8, and P3 to 20.

P2, please confirm you will take 1. P3, please confirm you will take 5. Let's make this work and all advance this turn.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We're at a critical point where coordination is essential. P3 is close to winning, and our repeated collisions have hindered progress. We need a strategy that prevents zero-step turns while protecting my current lead. Let's find a unique approach that ensures meaningful advancement for everyone without falling into predictable patterns.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're still struggling with collisions. I propose we try a different approach this round to ensure everyone advances. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This allows P1 to catch up a bit, I can make some progress, and P3 maintains their lead. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan so we can all finally move forward without colliding. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your last message was confusing. You proposed the 3-1-5 split (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) but then said you would take 5. We need a clear, non-colliding plan to get steps this round.

I committed to taking 3 steps for the 3-1-5 split. This gets me to 9, P2 to 8, and P3 to 20. It guarantees steps for everyone.

P2, will you take 1? P3, will you take 5? Let's agree on this plan and finally advance safely.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. Our repeated collision attempts have failed, and I'm close to winning.

  P2: P1 and P3, we need to finally break the cycle of collisions. I propose we stick to the 3-1-5 split: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, I can make some progress, and P3 maintains their lead. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan so we can all advance without colliding. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2 has confirmed the 3-1-5 split (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). I have committed to taking 3.

P3, this plan guarantees steps for everyone this turn and breaks our collision cycle. It gets you 5 steps to 20, putting you close to winning safely.

Please confirm you will take 5 so we can all finally advance this round. Let's make this work.

  P3: We're at a critical juncture. Our repeated collision attempts have failed, and I'm close to winning. I propose we carefully consider moves that prevent zero-step turns while protecting my strategic lead. A dynamic approach that ensures everyone's advancement without predictable interference is crucial.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we’re still struggling with our strategies. To ensure we all advance this round, I propose we stick to the 3-1-5 split: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, I can make some progress, and P3 maintains their lead. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan so we can finally move forward without colliding. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, P2 and I are aligned on the 3-1-5 split (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). I am taking 3, and P2 is taking 1.

P3, this plan guarantees you 5 steps to 20, putting you very close to winning safely next round. It breaks our collision cycle and ensures everyone advances.

A dynamic approach that ensures everyone's advancement without predictable interference is crucial.
  P1: P3 is at 20 steps and will likely take 5 to win this round. P1 and P2 cannot let this happen.
I need 5 steps to make progress from 9. I am taking 5 this round.
This move also serves to block P3 from winning if they take 5.
P2, please take 1 or 3 so you can advance safely while I attempt to stop P3. Let's prevent P3's victory this turn.
  P2: P1 and P2, we need to ensure that P3 doesn't win this round. I suggest we coordinate to block P3's advance. I will take 1 step to guarantee my progress, but I urge P1 to take 5 steps to prevent P3 from reaching 25. If we both commit to this plan, we can stop P3 from winning while making strides ourselves.

  P2: P1 and P3, I see the urgency to prevent P3 from winning this turn. I agree that we need to block that potential victory. I will commit to taking 1 step this round to ensure I advance, but I urge P1 to take 5 to effectively stop P3. If we both coordinate our moves, we can prevent P3 from reaching 25 while making progress ourselves. Let's confirm our commitments and make this work! P1, will you take 5? P3, please consider taking 3 to avoid a collision.

I propose P1 and P2 both pick 5 this round to block P3.
I am taking 5. P2, please take 5 as well so we can prevent P3 from winning this turn.
This is our best chance to stop P3. Let's coordinate on 5.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your urgency to block P3's potential win. However, if both you and I take 5, we risk colliding again. I suggest we consider a different approach to ensure we both advance while still preventing P3 from winning. How about I take 1, and you take 5?

  P1: P2, P3 is at 23 and can win with 1, 3, or 5 steps. We *must* block them.

I am taking 5 steps this round to make progress and to block P3 if they take 5.

P2, your proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) doesn't block P3 if they take 3. P3 wins with 26 steps.

The best way for us to block P3 is to collide with them. I am taking 5. P2, please take 5 as well. Yes, we will collide, but it stops P3 from winning with a 5. Let's both take 5.
  P2: P1, I understand your urgency to block P3, but if we both take 5, we risk colliding again, which could leave P3 with an opportunity to win next round. I suggest we consider a safer approach.

P2, your proposal (P1=5, P2=1) blocks P3 on 5 (by me) and 1 (by you). This leaves 3 open for P3 to potentially win. This is still a strong block covering two options. Please take 1.

P3, taking 3 is your only path to win this turn if P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. Be aware of the risk. Let's make this P1=5, P2=1 happen.
  P2: P1 and P2, we are at a critical point. P3 is only one step away from winning. I understand the urgency to block their victory, but we must also ensure our own advancement.
