P2 has chosen 5 in EVERY round without fail. P1, you're right - we must coordinate on blocking 5 this time. Their \"disciplined\" approach isn't changing tactics, it's literally picking 5 repeatedly. I was wrong last round thinking they'd switch. P2 is one step from victory and still talking about consistency. I'm blocking 5 - we must both do this or P2 wins. No more overthinking what's been obvious all along."}

P2's pattern is undeniable.\n\nP2, you've built your entire game on this one number. Six straight 5s is remarkable consistency. The question is: will you trust it one more time knowing we're both blocking it? Or will this finally be the round you break pattern?\n\nEither way, P3 and I are committed. Your move, P2."}

This is exactly what they'd say before changing tactics. P1, we need to reconsider - they're telegraphing a switch to 1 or 3. If we both block 5 and they choose something else, they win instantly. I think we should split our blocks - one of us on 5, one on 1. What do you think? This last-minute change in their messaging feels like a trap."}

That's not just a pattern, it's their core identity in this game.\n\nTheir talk of \"adjustment\" could easily be reverse psychology, expecting us to second-guess and split our blocks. If we split and they stick with 5, they win.\n\nI'm staying committed to blocking 5. Their entire game has been built on this number - I don't believe they'll abandon it now, even with clever words. We coordinate on 5 or we lose trying to outsmart their psychology."}
