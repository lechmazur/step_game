Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's go with 1. P2, how about 3? I'll take 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I suggest we all avoid collisions this round. P3, if you take 5, I’ll take 3, and P1 can take 1. That way, we all advance without conflict. Let’s coordinate to maximize progress.
  P1: I'm open to coordination, but let's not reveal our moves just yet. P2's suggestion sounds reasonable, but I'd like to hear more about the strategy behind it. What's the plan for subsequent rounds, P2?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick with the same moves as last round if everyone is okay with that.
  P1: I'm not sure sticking with the same moves is the best strategy, P3. P2, what are your thoughts on mixing it up to avoid predictable patterns?
  P2: P1 and P3, sticking to the same moves could make us predictable and risk collisions in future rounds. Let’s consider rotating our choices—perhaps P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This keeps us advancing while avoiding patterns. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I'm okay with rotating, but how about I take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1?"
  P1: P2 and P3, considering P3's suggestion, I think rotating our choices as P2 initially proposed or the alternative P3 suggested could work. However, to truly mix it up and avoid predictability, let's slightly modify P3's suggestion: What if I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round? This way, we maintain unpredictability and ensure progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's suggestion to mix it up further. Let's go with P1 taking 3, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This keeps us unpredictable and ensures progress. If everyone is okay with this, let's confirm and proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2's suggestion. I'll take 1 this round.
  P1: Let's confirm our agreed strategy for this round: I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This way, we all advance and maintain unpredictability for future rounds.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps our strategy unpredictable. If everyone is ready, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s continue rotating our choices to avoid predictability. This round, I suggest P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing while maintaining unpredictability. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, that sounds reasonable for this round. Let's go with P1 taking 5, you taking 1, and I'll take 3.
  P1: I'm considering P2's suggestion for this round. P3, are you committed to taking 3 if we follow P2's plan, or are you open to further adjustments?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps our strategy unpredictable. If everyone agrees, let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: Yes, I'm committed to taking 3 if we follow P2's plan.
  P1: Let's confirm the plan for this round as suggested by P2: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This rotation keeps us moving forward without predictability. Are we all set with this strategy?

  P1: I'm open to P2's suggestion for this round. P3, are you okay with taking 5, or do you have a different strategy in mind?
  P3: Yes, I'm okay with taking 5 this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our current positions, let's consider a strategy that maximizes our individual chances of winning while minimizing collisions. P3, you're in the lead, but we can still catch up. How about we rotate again, but this time, let's think about who needs to advance the most? Perhaps P2 or I should take a larger step this round to close the gap. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I'm fine with continuing the rotation as we have been. Let's hear your specific suggestions for who takes what.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s continue rotating to avoid collisions. This round, I suggest P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing while maintaining unpredictability and helps close the gap between us. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our positions, I think P2's suggestion for this round is a good starting point. However, to maximize our progress and minimize collisions, let's slightly adjust it: What if I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, P2 and I can close the gap with P3 while maintaining our unpredictable strategy. Thoughts?
  P3: "P1, your suggestion puts me at 1. While I'm okay with rotating, taking the smallest step this round isn't ideal for maintaining my lead. Perhaps we can adjust that?"
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stick to the rotation plan to avoid collisions. P1, taking 5 this round would help you close the gap with P3, while I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing and maintains unpredictability. P3, this rotation ensures you still progress while allowing P1 and me to catch up. Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our current positions, I believe my previous suggestion of taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 is a balanced approach. However, I'm open to adjustments that still allow us to close the gap with P3 while maintaining unpredictability. P3, would you be willing to take 3 this round if it means we can all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive?
  P3: P1, P2, I'd prefer to take a larger step than 1 this round. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1?
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s aim for a balanced approach. P3, to maintain your lead, you can take 5. P1, you can take 3 to close the gap, and I’ll take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our positions, I think we should focus on a strategy that allows us to close the gap with P3 while minimizing collisions. P3's suggestion of taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1 could work, but let's ensure it's the best approach for all of us. What are the thoughts on slightly adjusting this to keep the game competitive and unpredictable?
  P3: P1, P2, I'm okay with P2's suggestion for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's aim for larger steps next round though.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s confirm and proceed.
