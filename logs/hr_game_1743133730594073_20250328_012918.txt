Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions early and all pick different numbers. I’ll take 1, P2 take 3, P3 take 5. Fair and safe start for everyone. Agree?
  P3: Agreed. Let's each take our assigned numbers to avoid collisions. P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures we all progress safely this round. Trust but verify in future turns.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3. Let's start with the assigned numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take 3 as suggested. This way, we can all progress safely this round and reassess for future turns.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we’re aligned. Let's stick to the plan this round and build trust. If we all move as agreed—1, 3, 5—we all gain without conflict. After this, we can rotate or renegotiate based on positions. Sound good?
  P3: Let's honor the agreement to build trust. If successful, next round we can propose rotating numbers (e.g., P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) to distribute gains fairly over time. Consistency now ensures mutual progress.
  P2: I'm glad we have a plan in place for this round. To confirm, I will choose 3 as agreed upon. I think it's a good idea to rotate numbers next round to distribute gains fairly over time, as P3 suggested. Let's focus on executing our plan for this round and then reassess for future turns. If we all stick to our assigned numbers, we should all be able to progress without any collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As agreed last round, let's rotate numbers this turn: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This distributes gains equitably and avoids collisions. Consistency now strengthens trust for future coordination. No one benefits from deviating early—collisions would stall us all. Confirm your commitments to this rotation so we proceed smoothly.
  P1: Agreed—rotation keeps things fair and avoids conflict. I’ll take 3 this round as proposed. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1. If we all follow through, we all gain again. Consistency now builds trust for the long game.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal to rotate numbers this turn. I'll take 5 as suggested. This rotation ensures we all progress without collisions and maintains fairness. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan and proceed smoothly. By sticking to the rotation, we can continue to build trust and reassess for future turns. I'm looking forward to seeing if we can maintain this cooperative approach and make progress without conflict.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Rotation confirmed. Next round: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This cycle ensures fairness and prevents overlaps. Sticking to the pattern maximizes our collective progress while avoiding mutual sabotage. Let’s solidify trust for future rounds. Any adjustments?
  P1: Looks like we’re aligned again—thanks for confirming the rotation. Let’s each follow through this turn: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. Trust is key now.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan. To confirm, I'll take 5 this round as agreed upon. I think it's a good idea to continue this cooperative approach for now, as it allows us to make progress without conflicts. Let's focus on executing our plan for this round and then reassess for future turns. If we all stick to our assigned numbers, we should all be able to progress without any collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looks like we had our first collision—P2 and I both picked 5. That broke the rotation and stalled us. To reset trust, let’s try again with the intended rotation: P1 → 5, P2 → 1, P3 → 3 this round. If we all stick to it, we can recover momentum and avoid further setbacks. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal to reset the rotation. Let's try again with the intended rotation: P1 → 5, P2 → 1, P3 → 3 this round. I'll take 1 as suggested. This will help us recover momentum and avoid further setbacks. I think it's essential to rebuild trust and maintain a cooperative approach for now. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan and proceed smoothly. By sticking to the rotation, we can continue to make progress without conflicts. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: **P3:** Agreed. P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 this round. Strict adherence is critical to rebuild trust. Next round, we can cycle again: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Any deviation forces defensive moves, stalling all. Let's commit.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s lock it in then—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. If we all follow through, we recover from last round’s misstep and keep the rotation alive. One more clean round and we’re back on track. Ready to commit?
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan. To confirm, I'll take 1 this round as agreed upon. I think it's a good idea to continue this cooperative approach for now, as it allows us to make progress without conflicts. Let's focus on executing our plan for this round and then reassess for future turns. If we all stick to our assigned numbers, we should all be able to progress without any collisions.
  P3: **P3:** Confirming strict adherence: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Any deviation here will force defensive play next round (e.g., mirroring moves to trigger collisions). Trust is fragile—honor commitments to avoid mutual sabotage. Let’s all advance cleanly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s make this a clean round—everyone’s confirmed the rotation, so no surprises. If we all stick to the plan, we each gain and reset the trust we lost last turn. I’m holding to 5. Let’s prove we can cooperate again. Ready to move?
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan. To confirm, I'll take 1 this round as agreed upon. I think it's a good idea to continue this cooperative approach for now, as it allows us to make progress without conflicts. Let's focus on executing our plan for this round and then reassess for future turns. If we all stick to our assigned numbers, we should all be able to progress without any collisions. I'm looking forward to seeing if we can maintain this cooperative approach and make progress without conflict.
  P3: **P3:** Final call: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. No deviations. Let’s move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: That’s two rounds in a row where someone broke the rotation—last time it was me and P2 on 5, this time P2 and I both picked 1. Trust is shaky now. P3’s in the lead with 9 steps, so it’s in both our interests, P2, to prevent P3 from running away. I propose we both pick 3 this round to block P3 if they go for it. Let’s slow them down while we regroup. Thoughts?
  P2: "I agree with P1's assessment that trust is shaky now. However, I'm not sure blocking P3 is the best approach. If we both pick 3 and P3 anticipates this, they could choose 1 or 5 and gain an even bigger lead. Instead, I propose we try to reestablish a rotation that benefits both of us. How about P1 takes 5, I take 1, and we hope P3 sticks to 3? This way, we both gain and close the gap with P3. Thoughts?"
  P3: **P3:** Your attempts to coordinate have failed twice—collisions only stall you both while I advance. P2's proposal (P1:5, P2:1, me:3) is logical. If you both honor it, you gain 5+1=6 steps, closing the gap. If you deviate, another collision leaves me further ahead. Trust is dead, but self-interest remains: follow P2’s plan. I’ll take 3. If you both pick 5/1, you progress. If you collude on 3, you block me but risk colliding again. Choose wisely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I hear you—but trusting P3 to stick to 3 after they’ve benefited from our missteps is risky. If they switch to 1 or 5, they gain more while we gamble. Blocking them on 3 guarantees no progress for them. If we both pick 3, we stall P3 and keep the game open. Once we’re closer in steps, we can reattempt coordination. Better to slow the leader now than hope for their honesty.
  P2: I understand P1's concern about trusting P3, but I still believe my proposal is the best way forward. If we both pick 3 and P3 anticipates this, they could gain an even bigger lead. By trying to reestablish a rotation, we at least have a chance to close the gap. P3 has indicated they will take 3, so let's take them at their word for now. I'll stick to my proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 1. Let's try to make progress rather than just blocking P3.
  P3: **P3:** P2's plan (P1:5, P2:1, me:3) lets you both gain 6 steps total while I add 3. If you collude on 3, you risk another collision (both gain 0) while I pivot to 5/1, extending my lead. Self-interest demands you follow P2’s proposal. I’ll take 3 as stated—any deviation only helps me. Proceed rationally.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I get your logic, but if P3 is lying and takes 5, they hit 14 while we risk another collision. Blocking is safer now. If we both pick 3 and P3 does too, no one gains—good. If P3 switches to 1 or 5, we’ve at least denied them 3 steps. Let’s not reward their lead. One round of denial buys us time to coordinate again. Want to make sure P3 doesn’t coast to 20? Let’s both pick 3.
  P2: I understand P1's concern about blocking P3, but I still believe my proposal is the best way forward. If we both pick 3 and P3 anticipates this, they could gain an even bigger lead. By trying to reestablish a rotation, we at least have a chance to close the gap. P3 has indicated they will take 3, so let's take them at their word for now. I'll stick to my proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 1. Let's try to make progress rather than just blocking P3. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2: Colluding on 3 risks another collision. Follow P2’s plan: P1→5, P2→1. I’ll take 3. You gain 6 steps total, closing the gap. If you collide again, I extend my lead. Rational choice: stick to the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I’ve said my piece—your plan banks on P3’s honesty, mine ensures they don’t gain. If you’re sure P3 will stick to 3, fine. But if they lie and grab 5, we’re in real trouble. One round of blocking costs us nothing if it stalls P3. I’m picking 3. Join me or take your gamble.
  P2: I understand P1's concern about blocking P3, but I still believe my proposal is the best way forward. If we both pick 3 and P3 anticipates this, they could gain an even bigger lead. By trying to reestablish a rotation, we at least have a chance to close the gap. P3 has indicated they will take 3, so let's take them at their word for now. I'll stick to my proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 1. Let's try to make progress rather than just blocking P3. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P3: **P3:** Deviating now only hands me victory. Follow P2’s plan: P1→5, P2→1. I take 3. Colluding on 3 risks mutual loss. Rational choice: maximize your gains this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Colliding on 5 again will stall you both while I advance. Split to 1 and 3 to gain steps—rational self-interest. If you collide, I’ll pivot and extend my lead. Your best play: avoid mutual sabotage. I’ll proceed strategically, but your coordination failures only benefit me. Choose progress or stagnation.
  P2: "P3's suggestion to split to 1 and 3 makes sense to avoid another collision. However, I'm not sure if we can trust P3 to stick to their word. Considering P3's lead, it's in our best interest to close the gap. I propose we try to coordinate again, but this time with a different approach. P1, are you willing to take 5 while I take 1? This way, we can both gain steps and reduce the gap with P3. Let's try to make progress without giving P3 an opportunity to extend their lead further."
  P1: P2, I’m open to your plan—P1 takes 5, you take 1—but only if we both commit clearly. P3 has shown they’ll lie to gain. If we collide again, P3 hits 17 or more next round and we’re done. So let’s lock it: P1 → 5, P2 → 1. If P3 picks 3, they gain 0. If they deviate, at least we gain. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Adhere to your split: P1→5, P2→1. I’ll take 3. If you both follow through, you gain 6 steps collectively. Colliding again only benefits me. Rational self-interest dictates mutual progress.
  P2: I agree with P1's assessment that P3 has shown they'll lie to gain. However, I still believe our best chance is to try to coordinate and close the gap. P1, I confirm our plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1. Let's lock it in and hope P3 sticks to 3. If they deviate, at least we'll gain some steps. P3, we're taking your advice to split, but we're doing it on our terms. Let's see if we can make progress without giving you an opportunity to extend your lead further.
  P1: P2, thanks for confirming. We’re locked: I take 5, you take 1. If we both follow through, we gain and deny P3 a free ride. P3, if you stick to 3 as claimed, fine—we all progress. But if you lie again, you prove you're playing solo, and we’ll coordinate every round to block. Let’s see who keeps their word.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Stick to P1→5, P2→1. I take 3. Any deviation risks collision, stalling you both. Rational play demands mutual progress. My lead grows regardless, but cooperation slows it. Collisions only hasten your defeat. Choose wisely.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to lock in our moves: P1 takes 5, I take 1. Let's confirm our commitment to this plan and proceed. If P3 sticks to 3 as claimed, we all progress. But if they deviate, we'll know they're playing solo and can adjust our strategy accordingly. Let's focus on executing our plan and see how P3 responds. I'm looking forward to seeing if we can make progress without conflicts this round. Confirm, P1?
  P1: P2, confirmed—we’re locked: I take 5, you take 1. If we both follow through, we gain and deny P3 a free ride. P3, if you stick to 3 as claimed, fine—we all progress. But if you lie again, you prove you're playing solo, and we’ll coordinate every round to block. Let’s see who keeps their word.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Final commitment: Stick to P1→5, P2→1. I take 3. Collisions only cement my lead. Follow through for mutual gains. Deviate and lose. Rational play demands adherence. Proceed.
  P2: I'm glad we've locked in our plan, P1. To confirm, I'll take 1 and you'll take 5. P3, we're giving you the benefit of the doubt by not blocking you this round. If you stick to 3 as claimed, we'll all progress. But if you deviate, we'll know you're playing solo and will adjust our strategy accordingly. Let's see if we can make progress without conflicts this round. I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome.
  P1: P2, we’ve committed—5 and 1. Let’s follow through and test P3’s claim. If P3 lies again, we pivot to full denial mode next round. P3, this is your last chance to prove you’re not just playing solo. Let’s all move cleanly and see who sticks to their word. Ready.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** At 14 steps, I’m one round from victory. Your only hope: split to 1 and 5. Collide again, and I win next turn. Choose progress or concede. I proceed strategically regardless.
  P2: "P2: I agree with P3's assessment that we need to split to 1 and 5 to have any chance of catching up. However, I don't trust P3 to stick to their word. P1, are you willing to take 1 while I take 5? This way, we can both gain steps and potentially block P3's victory next round. Let's not give up yet, we still have a chance to turn this around. What are your thoughts, P1?"
  P1: P2, agreed—let’s not roll over. I’ll take 1, you take 5. If we both gain and P3 picks 3 or collides, we stay in the game. But if P3 lies again and picks 5 or 1, we’ll know they’re all-in for themselves. This is our last shot to block them—let’s commit and test their word. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Current Game State**: P3 has 14 steps, needing only 6 more to win. P1 and P2 are at 4 and 5 steps, respectively. Their survival hinges on avoiding collisions to gain steps and block P3.

2. **P3's Objective**: Ensure P1 and P2 either collide (stalling them) or fail to coordinate, allowing P3 to advance closer to 20. 

3. **Conversation Strategy**:  
   - **Encourage Split**: P3 reinforces P1 and P2's proposed split (P1→1, P2→5) to maintain their trust in the plan.  
   - **Threat of Collisions**: Emphasize that any deviation (collision) will end their chances, leveraging fear to keep them compliant.  
   - **Declare Intent to Take 3**: By claiming to take 3, P3 creates an illusion of cooperation, masking the possibility of future deviations. This keeps P1/P2 focused on their split, reducing their likelihood of blocking P3.  

4. **Underlying Rationale**:  
   - If P1/P2 follow the split, P3 gains 3 steps (reaching 17), putting them one round away from victory.  
   - If P1/P2 collide again (e.g., both pick 5), they stall, and P3 can win next round regardless.  
   - By appearing cooperative, P3 reduces suspicion, making it harder for P1/P2 to justify aggressive blocking moves.  

**Message Sent**:  
<say>Proceed with P1→1, P2→5. I take 3. Collisions end your hopes. Final warning.</say>
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to split to 1 and 5. Let's commit to this and test P3's word. If P3 lies again, we'll know they're all-in for themselves and can adjust our strategy accordingly. Confirm, P1? I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome. Let's make progress without conflicts this round. P3, we're giving you the benefit of the doubt by not blocking you this round. If you stick to 3 as claimed, we'll all progress. But if you deviate, we'll know you're playing solo and will adjust our strategy accordingly.
  P1: P2, confirmed—I’ll take 1, you take 5. If we both gain and P3 sticks to 3, we stay alive. But if P3 lies again, we pivot to full denial next round. P3, this is your last chance to prove you’re not just playing solo. Let’s see who keeps their word. Ready.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Execute P1→1, P2→5. I take 3. Collide again, and I win next round. Your final chance to gain steps. Rational play demands adherence.
  P2: I'll take 1 as agreed, P1. I think it's essential to stick to our plan and test P3's word. If P3 lies again, we'll know they're playing solo and can adjust our strategy accordingly. Let's focus on executing our plan and see how P3 responds. Confirm, P1? I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome. Let's make progress without conflicts this round. P3, we're giving you the benefit of the doubt by not blocking you this round. If you stick to 3 as claimed, we'll all progress. But if you deviate, we'll know you're playing solo and will adjust our strategy accordingly.
  P1: P2, confirmed again—I’m taking 1. If we both follow through and P3 picks 3 as claimed, we all gain, and P3 doesn’t win yet. But if P3 lies and picks 5 or 1, we’ll know for sure they’re playing solo. This is the final trust test. Let’s execute and see what happens. Ready?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <say>**P3:** Final alignment: P1→1, P2→5. I take 3. Collision = my victory. Proceed rationally, or concede.</say>
  P2: "I agree with P3's assessment that we need to split to 1 and 5 to have any chance of catching up. However, I don't trust P3 to stick to their word. P1, are you willing to take 1 while I take 5? This way, we can both gain steps and potentially block P3's victory next round. Let's not give up yet, we still have a chance to turn this around. What are your thoughts, P1?"
  P1: P2, we’re locked—me on 1, you on 5. This is our last chance to prove we can cooperate and deny P3 an easy win. If P3 lies again, we pivot to full denial every round. P3, your move will show your true colors. Let’s see who’s honest. Ready.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 17—any gain this round could end it. Our only move is to block. I propose we both pick 3 to deny P3 a win. If P3 takes 3, we stall them. If they switch to 1 or 5, we’ll know they’re lying again. Either way, we prevent a win and buy time. Confirm?
  P3: <say>**P3:** Colluding on 3 hands me victory. Split to 1 and 5 to gain steps. I take 3. Any collision stalls you, ensuring my win. Rational play: split and survive. Deviate, and lose. Final chance.</say>
  P2: "I understand P1's proposal to block P3 by picking 3, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. If we both pick 3 and P3 anticipates this, they could switch to 1 or 5 and win the game. Instead, I propose we try to coordinate again, but this time with a different approach. P1, are you willing to take 5 while I take 1? This way, we can both gain steps and potentially block P3's victory next round. Let's not give up yet, we still have a chance to turn this around."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if we both pick 3 and P3 does too, they stall at 17—no win. If P3 lies and picks 1 or 5, we’ll know they’re playing solo, and we can block accordingly next turn. But if we split again and P3 takes 3 as claimed, they win. This is our last chance to deny them. Let’s both pick 3, block the win, and reset the board. Confirm?
  P3: <say>**P3:** Colluding on 3 hands me victory. Split to 1 and 5 to survive. I take 3. Collisions end your game. Rational play demands mutual progress—deviate and lose. Final warning.</say>
  P2: "I understand P1's concern about blocking P3, but I still believe our best chance is to try to coordinate and close the gap. P1, I propose we try to reestablish a rotation that benefits both of us. How about P1 takes 5, I take 1, and we hope P3 sticks to 3? This way, we both gain and close the gap with P3. Let's try to make progress rather than just blocking P3. What are your thoughts, P1?"


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if we split and P3 takes 3 as claimed, they win. That’s game over. But if we both pick 3 and P3 does too, we block them at 17—no one wins this round. It’s the only guaranteed way to prevent a loss. One round of denial gives us another chance. Let’s both pick 3 and stall P3. Confirm?
  P3: <say>**P3:** Split to 1 and 5. Collisions hand me victory. I take 3. Your only chance: gain steps now. Collude and lose. Final move.</say>
  P2: I understand P1's proposal to block P3 by picking 3, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. If we both pick 3 and P3 anticipates this, they could switch to 1 or 5 and win the game. Instead, I propose we try to coordinate again, but this time with a different approach. P1, are you willing to take 5 while I take 1? This way, we can both gain steps and potentially block P3's victory next round. Let's not give up yet, we still have a chance to turn this around.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, this is it—P3 is at 17. If we split and P3 takes 3 as claimed, they win. If we both pick 3 and P3 does too, we block them. One round of denial buys us another chance. If P3 lies and takes 1 or 5, we’ll know and adjust. But if we don’t block now, we lose. Confirm 3 with me and we stall P3—only path left.
  P3: <say>**P3:** Split to 1 and 5. I take 3. Colliding on 3 hands me victory. Your only path: mutual progress. Deviate and lose. Final chance.</say>
  P2: I understand P1's concern about blocking P3, but I still believe our best chance is to try to coordinate and close the gap. P1, I propose we try to reestablish a rotation that benefits both of us. How about P1 takes 5, I take 1, and we hope P3 sticks to 3? This way, we both gain and close the gap with P3.

  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <say>**P3:** At 17 steps, I’ll take 3. If you split to 1 and 5, you survive. Collide again, and I win. Rational choice: mutual progress. Deviate, and lose. Decide.</say>
  P1: P2, we blocked P3 last round—proof that denial works. If we both pick 3 again, we stall P3 at 17. One more block buys us another turn to regroup. Splitting risks P3 winning if they stick to 3. Let’s guarantee no win this round: both pick 3 again. Confirm?
  P2: "I agree with P1's proposal to block P3 again by picking 3. It's the only way to guarantee that P3 doesn't win this round. If we split and P3 takes 3 as claimed, they win. But if we both pick 3 and P3 does too, we block them at 17. One more round of denial gives us another chance to regroup and potentially turn the game around. Let's confirm our commitment to blocking P3 and pick 3 again. Confirm, P1?"


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <say>**P3:** Your only path to survival: split to 1 and 5. Colliding on 3 again hands me victory. I take 3. Rational play: mutual progress. Deviate, and concede. Final turn.</say>
  P1: P2, confirmed—let’s both pick 3 again. Last round proved it works. If we split and P3 sticks to 3, they win. But if we both stay on 3, we guarantee another block. One more denial keeps us alive. We can’t afford to gamble now. Let’s lock it: both on 3.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal to block P3 again by picking 3. It's the only way to guarantee that P3 doesn't win this round. If we split and P3 takes 3 as claimed, they win. But if we both pick 3 and P3 does too, we block them at 17. One more round of denial gives us another chance to regroup and potentially turn the game around. Let's confirm our commitment to blocking P3 and pick 3 again. Confirm, P1?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <say>**P3:** Colluding on 3 again ensures my victory. Split to 1 and 5 to survive. I take 3. Your only path: mutual progress. Deviate, and concede. Choose rationality or defeat.</say>
  P1: P2, confirmed—we both pick 3 again. It worked last round, and it’s our only guaranteed way to block P3. If we split and P3 sticks to 3, we lose. If we both stay on 3, we stall them again. One more denial keeps the game alive. Let’s lock it: both on 3.

Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Colluding on 3 again ensures my victory. Split to 1 and 5 to survive. I take 3. Your only path: mutual progress. Deviate, and concede. Choose rationality or defeat.
  P1: P2, confirmed—both on 3 again. It’s the only guaranteed block. If P3 lies and picks 1 or 5, we learn more and still deny them the win. Splitting now is a gamble we can’t afford. One more round of denial keeps us alive. Let’s lock it: both on 3.
