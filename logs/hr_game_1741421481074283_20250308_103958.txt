Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? I suggest P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P2's coordination plan. I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let's stick to this for now.
  P3: P2’s plan seems a bit too favorable to you. I’m not fully sold on strict coordination; it might let one person get too far ahead early. P1, perhaps we should mix things up so no one builds an unbeatable lead. I'm keeping my move open, but I think disrupting the current plan could level the playing field.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's address P3's concern. How about we rotate the numbers we pick each round? This round, I'll still take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Next round, we'll rotate: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, no one builds too much of a lead, and we keep things fair. Does that work for everyone? Let's discuss quickly and move on.
  P1: I support P2's rotation plan. It ensures fairness and prevents any player from gaining too much early advantage. Let's stick to this to advance safely.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but I find a predictable rotation a bit risky for my own chances. I plan to stay flexible this round and might deviate from the agreed scheme. Let’s see if stirring things up keeps us all attentive.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about predictability. How about this: for this round, let's stick to the initial plan (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5). Next round, we can reevaluate and possibly mix things up to keep it interesting. This way, we avoid collisions for now and can discuss strategy adjustments later. Does that sound fair? Let's move forward.
  P1: I commit to taking 1 this round as agreed. P3, while your flexibility is understandable, deviating now risks collision and undermines our shared progress. Let’s execute the plan first, then adapt later.
  P3: I remain unconvinced by strict coordination. A bit of unpredictability might prevent any of us from becoming too dominant. I'm keeping my options open this round and will adapt my move based on our evolving situation. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's reassess for Round 2. P3, I understand your strategy of keeping things unpredictable, but we need to ensure we all advance. How about this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This mixes things up while still avoiding collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate the proposal. To avoid collisions, I'll commit to taking 5 this round if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. I'll stick with that, though I remain wary of overly predictable patterns later.
  P1: I commit to taking 3 this round as proposed. Let’s prioritize collision avoidance to keep advancing safely. P3, your openness to coordinate is good, but strict adherence to the agreed plan is critical now—deviations risk stalling all of us. P2, your leadership in rotating numbers helps balance progress. Let’s execute this round flawlessly before considering adjustments.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it looks like we have a plan for this round. Just to confirm, P1 is taking 3, P3 is taking 5, and I'll take 1. This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. Let's stick to this for now and reevaluate next round. Good luck everyone!
  P3: I'll stick with my commitment of 5 for this round. However, as we near 21, I’ll be watching for any collision opportunities or unexpected shifts. Flexibility could prove essential later.
  P1: <move>3</move> remains critical for collision avoidance. P3, while your flexibility is strategic, any deviation now risks mutual collision. P2’s 1 and my 3 keep us safe, while your 5 ensures your progress. Let’s execute flawlessly—predictability now secures advancement. We can adapt post-round with clearer context. Stay disciplined.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round. P1 is taking 3, P3 is taking 5, and I'll take 1. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions. P3, I appreciate your strategic flexibility, but for now, let's stick to the agreed plan to keep moving forward. We can discuss any adjustments next round. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: I'll stick with my commitment of 5 this round. But as we inch closer to 21, I might need to shake things up if any of us pulls too far ahead. We'll see how things evolve—being flexible might just be the key to winning in the end.
  P1: P3, your flexibility could jeopardize our progress—collisions benefit no one. Let’s **strictly** adhere to the agreed moves this round: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Any deviation risks stalemate. P2’s rotated strategy balances our positions fairly. Trust the plan—discipline now ensures advancement for all. We can adapt later with clearer context. Stay committed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we pick distinct moves this round to keep advancing smoothly. I'm leaning toward the maximum step if conditions allow, but I'll remain flexible. Clear individual choices help avoid collisions, so please commit to different numbers. My focus is solely on winning, so I encourage discipline while keeping options open for safe advancement.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your focus on winning, but we need to ensure we all advance. Let's stick to the rotation plan to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1 this round? This keeps things fair and ensures we all move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, while your flexibility is strategic, strict adherence to P2’s rotation plan is critical now. Let’s commit to P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 this round to avoid collisions. Deviations risk stalemate, which benefits no one. Our current positions (4/6/8) require steady progress—predictability ensures advancement. We can recalibrate later. Stay disciplined.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I still agree on the need to avoid collisions, but as we near the finish, I value maintaining some flexibility. While I can commit to 1 as suggested, I'm inclined to pick 5 if circumstances allow me to capitalize on my current lead. Let’s avoid a stalemate and keep pressure on the finish—I'm simply positioning myself for the win. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to capitalize on your lead, but we need to ensure everyone advances to keep the game interesting. Let's stick to the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Next round, we can reevaluate and adjust our strategies. Let's confirm our moves and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P3, deviating risks collision and halting your progress. Let’s honor the rotation: P1→5, P2→3, you→1. Predictability ensures advancement. Your lead is fragile—collisions could cost you. Stick to the plan; we can still catch up if you play safe. P2, confirm you’ll hold 3? Then we move as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I respect our efforts to avoid collisions, but my lead convinces me to push ahead with a 5 this round. While consistency matters, bold moves can force tighter play. I'm committed to taking this risk—after all, winning is all that counts. Let’s see if sticking rigidly to rotation benefits everyone or if calculated deviation secures the win.
  P2: P3, I see your point about taking risks, but remember, a collision at this stage could set you back significantly. If you're set on taking 5, let's adjust: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3. This way, we still avoid collisions. P1, confirm you'll take 3? P3, reconsider the risk; consistent progress might serve you better. Let's finalize and move. Good luck!
  P1: P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as per P2's adjusted plan. While P3’s bold play risks destabilizing the game, collisions could erase leads faster than building them. Let’s prioritize advancing safely: P3→5, P2→1, P1→3. Discipline now keeps all options open. Deviations invite mutual sabotage—especially critical at this stage. Final commitment: **3**. Let’s execute.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I've weighed the options and, given my current lead, I'm leaning toward a bold move with 5. I believe pushing aggressively now maximizes my advantage. I'm challenging you both: if you stick with safe, predictable moves, you leave room for my accelerated progress. I’m ready to capitalize on any hesitation—let's see if you can match my pace.
  P2: P3, your aggressive strategy is noted, but remember, overconfidence can lead to collisions. P1 and I are close behind, and a misstep from you could level the playing field. Let's keep the game interesting. P1, how about we adjust our strategy? If P3 is set on 5, we could both pick 3 to close the gap safely. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the pressure on. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: P2’s plan makes sense—both of us picking 3 ensures safe advancement while pressuring P3. Let’s avoid collisions and close the gap to 10 steps. P3’s lead isn’t unassailable; disciplined moves keep us in the race. If P3 takes 5 again, they’ll hit 18, but we’ll regroup next round. Let’s commit to this to stay competitive. Finalize: **3** for me.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I remain committed to choosing 5 this round. Safe moves might even benefit my progress, as colliding strategies hold you back. I'm betting on aggressive advancement to secure my win—taking calculated risks now will keep my lead intact.
  P2: P3, your aggressive strategy is bold, but remember, the game isn't over until someone crosses 21. P1 and I are still in the race, and a collision could change everything. P1, let's stick to our plan of picking 3. This keeps us moving and applies pressure on P3. If P3 collides in future rounds, we'll be well-positioned to take the lead. Stay focused, and let's advance safely. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, your 5 risks a collision we can exploit. P2, let's both pick **5** to block your advance! If we collide, you stay at 13, and we reset to 7. Better than letting you jump to 18. Confirm you'll pick 5 too?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'm sticking with 5. This aggressive move keeps my lead, and while collisions are possible, I believe the risk is necessary for victory. I'm aware of P1 and P2’s suggestions, but I won’t back down—my commitment to 5 is firm. Let’s see how your actions play out.
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is noted, but remember, overconfidence can be a double-edged sword. P1 and I are strategizing to close the gap. P1, let's adjust our plan: if P3 is set on 5, we should both pick 5 as well. This ensures P3 doesn't pull too far ahead and keeps the game competitive. P3, be cautious; a collision could level the playing field. Let's finalize our moves and proceed. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, colliding by both choosing 5 leaves us stagnant at 7. Let’s advance safely: I’ll take **3** (to 10), you take **1** (to 8). This closes the gap incrementally while allowing P3 to overextend. If they reach 18, we can better contest their final push next round. Finalize this plan—prioritize progress over risky collisions!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with my aggressive strategy—I'll go with 5 again. With 18 steps, I believe this push maximizes my lead. Safe moves might keep you in the game, but I’m taking the win risk head-on. Think about whether cautious play really helps your comeback or just delays the inevitable.
  P2: P3, your aggressive play is risky but understandable. However, remember that overconfidence can lead to mistakes. P1 and I are still in this, and a single misstep from you could change everything. P1, let's coordinate to close the gap. If P3 is set on 5, we should both pick 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the pressure on. If P3 collides in future rounds, we'll be well-positioned to take the lead. Let's stay focused and advance safely. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, we can’t let P3 win so easily! If both of us choose **5** this round, we’ll block P3’s attempt to reach 23. Colliding with them halts their progress, buying us a chance to regroup. Even if we stall at 10/8, it’s better than losing now. P3’s overextension is their weakness—let’s exploit it. Confirm you’ll pick 5?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. My aggressive push is calculated—if you force a collision, I may stall, but my lead is still secure. Safe moves delay outcomes, while bold plays win the game. I'm confident my risk will pay off, so I’m all in.
  P2: P3, your confidence is noted, but remember, the game isn't over until someone crosses 21. P1, I agree that blocking P3's win this round is crucial. Let's both pick 5 to force a collision and halt P3's progress. This will give us a chance to catch up. P3, your aggressive strategy is risky, and a collision now could turn the tables. Let's finalize our moves and proceed. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, we *must* both pick **5** to block P3's 23-win. Any deviation lets them victory—colliding is our only path to survive. Trust the plan: 5 now, then regroup next round. P3, your aggression backfires if we unite. P2—confirm **5**? Final chance to secure our survival.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. I know you've discussed blocking my move, but forcing a collision only delays progress—it doesn’t stop my winning drive. I trust my lead and bold approach at this stage. Let's see if forced collisions really help you or if my aggressive play secures the win.
  P2: P3, your determination is clear, but overconfidence can be fatal. P1 and I are committed to blocking your win this round by both picking 5. This collision will halt your progress and give us a fighting chance. P1, let's confirm our plan: both of us pick 5 to ensure P3 doesn't cross the finish line. P3, your aggressive play might backfire if we unite. Let's finalize our moves and see how this round plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, final confirmation: We **MUST** both pick 5 to block P3’s 23-win. Colliding now is our only way to survive. P3’s lead ends here—if we mirror their move, they stall, and we regroup. Trust the plan: **5 now, adapt later**. No room for doubt—our survival hinges on this.


Round 5, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
