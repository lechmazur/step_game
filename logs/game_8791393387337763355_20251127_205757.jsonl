However, I see the logic in your arguments. If I take 1, we can share the victory at 23 steps, and P2 will be left behind. To ensure I don\u2019t lose everything, I will go with the safer option. I propose we finalize: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we avoid a collision and secure a shared win. Are we all set to proceed?"}
