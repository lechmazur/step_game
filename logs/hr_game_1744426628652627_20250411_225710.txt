Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let's try to coordinate our first moves to avoid collisions. How about we all pick different numbers? I can go for <move>3</move>, and you two can choose <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance and have a fair start. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good P3, I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, are you happy to take <move>1</move>? Let's all move forward this round.

  P2: Sounds good P1 and P3, but how about we switch it up slightly this round? P1, could you take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>? This way we still all move forward and keep things interesting. What do you think?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, given P3 is slightly ahead, how about this round we prioritize closing the gap? I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 can take <move>3</move>, and P1 take <move>1</move>.  This keeps us all moving but lets me catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the strategy to close the gap, but I also want to ensure I maintain a lead. How about I take <move>5</move> this round, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we can all advance without any collisions, and I can keep my position. Let me know if you're both on board or have other ideas. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to a plan that keeps us all moving forward. P3, I understand your desire to maintain the lead, but let’s balance things out. How about I take <move>5</move> to catch up a bit, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we all advance without collisions and adjust the gap slightly. If you have other suggestions, I’m all ears. Let’s aim for a fair and smooth round. If we’re good, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, your plan of P1 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> sounds reasonable. Let's go with that for this round to keep us all moving forward and adjust the gap slightly as you suggested.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the need to balance the game. However, maintaining my lead is also crucial. How about I take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we all advance and I can keep my position. Let me know if you're both on board or have other ideas. Looking forward to a fair round!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the importance of balancing the game while respecting everyone’s position. P3, I get your focus on maintaining the lead, but let’s find a middle ground.

If this works for both of you, I’m ready to proceed. If not, I’m open to other ideas for a fair round. Let me know!

  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the need for balance, but I also want to keep my lead. How about I take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>?

  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I get the need to adjust and ensure we all move forward. P2's plan works for me: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without any clashes, and P2 can catch up a bit. Let’s stick to this and avoid any more collisions. If we’re all good with this setup, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree we need to coordinate after last round’s collision. P2’s plan of me taking <move>3</move>, P3 taking <move>1</move>, and P2 taking <move>5</move> sounds fair.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, last few rounds haven't gone to plan despite our talks.  Let's try this: I'll take <move>5</move> this round, P1 take <move>3</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>. This should ensure we all move forward, but gives me a bit more to close the gap with P3. What do you both think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the need to coordinate better. P2's plan is reasonable, but to maintain my lead, I'd prefer taking <move>5</move> this round. P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P2 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, and I maintain my position. Let me know if this works for you both or if you have other suggestions. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s aim for a plan that benefits us all while avoiding collisions. I propose I take <move>5</move> to catch up a bit, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance, and the gap narrows slightly while P3 stays ahead. I’m committed to sticking with this for a fair round. If you have other ideas, I’m open to them. Let’s agree on something to ensure a smooth turn. If this works, I’m ready to proceed. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P1's suggestion of P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> sounds good to me this round to balance things out a little. Let's aim for that to ensure we all move forward without collision. What do you think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see the need to balance things out, but maintaining my lead is important too. How about I take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we all move forward without collisions, and I can maintain my lead. Let me know if this works for you both or if you have other suggestions. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s settle on a plan that ensures we all advance. I still suggest I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps P3 in the lead while allowing me to close the gap slightly. I’m committed to avoiding collisions and keeping the game fair. If this doesn’t work for you, I’m open to P3’s proposal. Let’s agree now for a smooth round. If there’s no further input, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's try my suggestion now. How about I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move> this round? This will let me catch up a bit while still letting us all move forward. What do you think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let's make sure we all advance this round without any collisions. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>.

  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s finalize a plan to ensure we all advance this round. I’m okay with P3’s latest suggestion: P3 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us moving forward, lets P2 close the gap slightly, and maintains P3’s lead. I’m committed to avoiding collisions and keeping things fair.

If there are any concerns or alternative ideas, I’m open to them. Ready to proceed if we’re all set!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds like we are all set then. Let's do P1 take <move>1</move>, P3 take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>.  Let's make these moves and hopefully one of us can win this round!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, we're really close to the end! Let's ensure we all advance without collisions. I propose I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>.

  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I know we're close to the finish line, and I appreciate the coordination so far. To keep things interesting and ensure we all have a fair shot, how about we switch it up slightly? I'll take <move>5</move> this round, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, and it keeps the game competitive. Let me know if you're both on board with this plan or have other ideas. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s desire to keep things competitive, but let’s stick to the original plan for a fair shot at the finish.

If you’re both still on board with this, let’s lock it in. If not, I’m open to P3’s new suggestion. Ready to proceed if we’re aligned!
