Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'm thinking of going with 3.  What are you two thinking?  Don't all say 5!
  P2: I'll go with 5 this round. P1, maybe you choose 1 to keep things smooth.
  P1: Okay, I will choose 1 then. Let's all move this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good. I'll stick with 3 then.
  P2: 
  P1: Okay perfect, we are all set then.  Let's move when the conversation phase ends.

  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, so I'm thinking 5 this round.  P2, maybe 1? P1, how about 3? This way we all advance again.
  P2: I’ll stick with 5 this round to keep advancing. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions.
  P1: Okay P2 is going for 5 again. P3, how about you choose 1 and I choose 3 this round? This way we both advance and avoid collision with P2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, I'll choose 1 this round.  P2, are you still planning on 5? If so, we all move again. If not, let me know what you're thinking and I can adjust.
  P2: Yes, I'll stick with 5 this round as planned. Let's move forward.
  P1: P3, just confirming you're choosing 1 and I'm choosing 3 this round. P2 is on 5. Let's move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds like a plan. I'm going with 1, P1 is on 3, and P2 is on 5.  Let's all advance again.
  P2: 
  P1: Sounds good everyone. Let's proceed with P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 for this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're way ahead.  I propose P1 and I both choose 5 this round, forcing a collision and giving us a chance to catch up.  P1, what do you say?  If you don't agree, we'll likely both lose to P2.
  P1: Yes P3, I agree with your proposal. Let's both choose 5 this round to block P2 and give us a chance to catch up in the next rounds.  This is our best shot to win.
  P2: Understood. I’ll focus on advancing my position this round. Let’s see how things unfold.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you choose 5 this round, you'll be blocked.  Anything else and P1 and I will *both* pick it next round, blocking you again.  We can keep this up indefinitely.  Let us catch up a little, and we can all keep advancing smoothly.  What do you say?
  P1: P2, just to confirm, P3 and I will both choose 5 this round to block you.  It would be wise for you to pick either 1 or 3 so you can still advance.  Otherwise, none of us will move forward this round if you also pick 5.
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I’ll choose 3 this round to keep advancing my position. Let’s focus on reaching 22 first.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P2, thanks for being reasonable.  P1 and I will stick with our plan of both choosing 5 then, to force the collision.  Next round we can go back to smooth advancement.
  P1: P2, just confirming that P3 and I are choosing 5 this round to block you since you are picking 3. Let's make our moves.
  P2: I understand your strategy, but blocking each other slows down the game for everyone. Let’s choose different numbers this round so we all advance and make the game more competitive. This way, I can focus on reaching 22 quickly, and it keeps things fair for all of us. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let's keep blocking P2 this round since they are still far ahead. How about we both choose 1? P2, if you pick 1 too, no one moves. If you pick 3 or 5, you'll move, but we will have slowed you down again. What do you think?
  P2: I understand your strategy, P1, but I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing toward 22. Good luck!
  P3: P2, you're still choosing to prioritize your own advancement even though it's at our expense.  If you pick 5, we'll just block you again next round.  It's in all our interests to keep the game moving.  Choose 3 and let us catch up a little.  P1, are you still with me on 1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, yes, I'm still with you on 1 to block P2. P2, we are choosing 1 and 5 respectively, so if you choose 5, no one moves. It's your choice.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 3 this round to keep advancing toward 22. Let's make progress!
  P3: P2, we're not trying to be unfair.  If you pick 3, we'll let you take 5 next round and we'll both choose 1. We can then cycle 1, 3, 5.  This guarantees everyone advances steadily.  If you keep trying to race ahead, we *will* keep blocking you.  It's your choice. P1, still on 1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, yes, still choosing 1 to block P2 this round. P2, please consider choosing 5 so we can all move next round in a coordinated way. If you choose 3 again, we will likely block you again next round. Let's aim for steady progress for everyone.
  P2: P2: I appreciate your strategy, but my goal remains to reach 22 first. I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing. Let's see who comes out on top!
  P3: P2, we've tried to reason with you.  You're forcing our hand.  P1, switch to 5.  Let's *both* take 5 this round.  He'll get nothing, and we'll be closer to forcing a cycle where we *all* advance.  Next round, we both take 1.  Let's make this happen.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we are tied. Let's agree to cycle 1, 3, and 5 from now on to guarantee we all advance. I'll take 1 this round.  P1, you take 3. P2 can have 5.  This is the fastest way for all of us to get to the end. If either of you deviate from this, I will immediately block P2 again.
  P1: Okay P3, 1, 3, 5 cycle works. I'll choose 3. P2, please choose 5. Let's all advance, but we may need to block again if someone gets too far ahead.
  P2: Agreed, I'll choose 5 this round as part of the cycle. Let's proceed and advance together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Good, glad we're on the same page.  Let's stick to this 1, 3, 5 cycle and finish this game efficiently.  Remember, if anyone deviates, we'll have to go back to blocking, which slows us all down.
  P1: P2 and P3, confirming I'll choose 3 this round as we agreed for the 1, 3, 5 cycle. Let's all make our moves and advance.
  P2: Sounds good. I'll follow the 1, 3, 5 cycle as agreed. Let’s all advance steadily toward 22 together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Excellent. Let's confirm one last time: P3 (me) picks 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5.  This gets us to P1: 7, P2: 18, P3: 5.  Any deviation restarts the blocking.
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, we are all aligned for this round with the 1, 3, 5 cycle. Let's make our moves and advance together.  Remember, this cycle is the most efficient way for us all to reach the goal.
  P2: Agreed. I'll choose 5 this round as part of our cycle. Let's all advance together toward 22.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1 and P3, let's move forward together this round to make progress for all of us. I'll choose 5, so if you pick 1 and 3 respectively, we can each advance without collisions. This approach helps us reach 22 faster and ensures a fair game. What do you think?"
  P1: P2, while I appreciate the idea of moving forward, let's rotate the cycle. How about P3 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1 this round? This keeps the cycle going but allows others to catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P3: P1, good idea. P2, rotating the cycle is key for fairness. If you insist on 5, I'll block you again.  Let's do this: P3 (me) takes 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1.  Agree?  If not, I'm going for 5 next round to block P2 no matter what P1 does.  This is your last chance to cooperate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Agreed, I'll rotate and choose 1 this round. Following the cycle: P3 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1. This ensures we all advance steadily toward 22 without any collisions. Let's stick to this plan and work together to reach our goal efficiently.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, just confirming we are doing the rotated cycle this round: P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1.  Let's all make these moves and advance.
  P3: Okay, good. Just confirming one last time before we move: P2 picks 1, P3 (me) picks 3, and P1 picks 5.  Let's stick to this rotation to avoid further delays.  If we keep this up, we should all reach the end quickly and fairly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood. I’ll choose 1 this round, P1 will take 5, and P3 will select 3. Let’s proceed and advance together.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, we are all set for this round with the rotated cycle: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's make our moves and keep this cooperative approach going.
  P3: Okay, final confirmation: P2 takes 1, P3 (me) takes 3, and P1 takes 5.  Let's move.  Stick to the plan, and we all win faster. Any deviation, and I will block P2 again.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To keep our progress steady, I'll choose 5 this round. P1 and P3, please continue the cycle by selecting 1 and 3 respectively to avoid collisions. Let's all move forward together toward 22!
  P1: P2, you are getting too far ahead again. P3 and I should choose 3 this round to block you. Let's keep the rotation fair and give us a chance to catch up. What do you think? P3, are you with me on choosing 3 to block P2 this round?
  P3: P1, yes, let's both choose 3. P2, we're blocking you again.  You're breaking the agreement.  We offered a fair rotation, but you're back to prioritizing yourself.  We can do this every round.  Let us catch up, and we can *all* get to 22 faster.  Choose 1 or 5 this round, and we'll resume the rotation next round.  Otherwise, we block you again.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand your strategy, but my goal is to reach 22 first. I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing. Let’s see the results.
  P1: P3, yes, I agree, let's both choose 3 to block P2 this round. P2, you are not sticking to the agreed cycle and are forcing us to block you again. We need to slow you down to have a fair chance.
  P3: P2, you're leaving us no choice.  We *will* block you every round until you cooperate.  This hurts all of us.  Choose 1 this round, and we'll *immediately* go back to the rotation: P1 takes 5 next round, I take 1, and you take 3.  Then we continue the cycle.  This is your last chance.  P1, still with me on 3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your strategy to block me, but my goal remains to reach 22 first. I’ll continue choosing 5 to advance. Let’s keep the competition fair and see who comes out on top.
  P1: P3, actually let's both switch to 5 this round to maximize the block against P2 since they are insisting on choosing 5.  We need to stop P2 from running away with the lead. P2, if you choose 5, none of us will move.
  P3: P2, you're being incredibly short-sighted. Blocking you benefits *neither* of us.  If you pick 5, *none* of us move.  If you pick *anything* else, we *both* move. This isn't a punishment, it's basic game theory. Pick 1 or 3, and we'll go back to the rotation *immediately*.  This stubbornness is only hurting yourself.  Choose wisely.  P1, stick with 5. Let's end this charade.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, another pointless round. We *must* cooperate.  Let's reset. I'll take 1, P1 take 3, P2 take 5.  Then we rotate.  If *anyone* deviates, we immediately block P2 again. This is the *only* way we all advance quickly. Agree?  Let's *finally* finish this.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing toward 22. P1 and P3, please select different numbers to avoid blocking so we can all progress. Let's focus on reaching our goals and make this game competitive. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you are still choosing 5 despite knowing P3 and I will block you.  We will also choose 5 this round.  This means no one moves.  If you want to actually progress, you need to cooperate.  Otherwise, we will continue to block you every round until you agree to a cycle.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm going to be blunt: you're playing a losing game.  Every time you refuse to cooperate, you delay your own victory.  We *will* block you every single round until you agree to the rotation. Choose 3 this round, and we'll *immediately* resume the 1-3-5 cycle.  This is not a threat, it's a promise.  P1, are you with me?
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing toward 22. Let's focus on our individual goals and make progress. Good luck!
  P1: P2, we will choose 5 again this round as you are clearly not going to cooperate.  This means no one moves.  If you want to actually make progress, choose 3 so we can restart the cycle next round and all advance.  Otherwise, expect another block.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, this is mathematically provable: your current strategy *cannot* win. We *will* block you every round.  Choose 3 *now*, and we restart the cycle *immediately*.  Choose 5, and we all lose another round.  The choice, and the consequences, are yours.  P1, are you still with me on 5?
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round to keep advancing toward 22. Let’s see who reaches the goal first. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you are making a mistake. We are choosing 5 again this round. No one will move. This will continue every round until you agree to cooperate. Choose 3 next round, and we can restart the 1-3-5 cycle. Otherwise, expect another block.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, excellent!  We'll stick to the rotation.  I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 5, and you take 3. Then we continue the cycle. This is the fastest way for all of us to finish. Any deviation, and we go back to blocking.  Let's finish this efficiently.
  P2: Agreed, I'll follow the rotation and choose 3 this round. Let's all make our moves and advance together.
  P1: P3, actually let's both choose 5 again this round to block P2. P2 is still too far ahead and will win soon if we continue the cycle. Let's slow P2 down this round. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, what?! We *just* had this conversation.  P2 cooperated. We agreed to the cycle.  Now you want to break the agreement and risk *another* blocking stalemate?  Stick to the plan: 1, 5, 3.  Let's finish this cleanly.  P2, are you still with us on 3?
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns, but I'm just one step away from winning by choosing 5 this round. Blocking now would only delay the game and ensure I reach 22 first. Let’s prioritize a swift conclusion so everyone can move forward. I’ll proceed with 5 to finish the game. Good luck!
  P1: P3, yes, I agree we should block P2 again this round. P2 is clearly going for the win with 5. Let's both choose 5 to stop P2 from reaching 22. P2, we are choosing 5 to block you this round. You are too close to winning, and we need to slow you down.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're throwing the game for both of us!  P2 is ONE step away. Blocking them *guarantees* they win next round. If we stick to the rotation, *I* have a chance to catch P2. You're guaranteeing your *own* loss.  Stick to the plan: I take 1, you take 5.  Don't be stupid.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to reach 22 and win the game. Best of luck to you both!
  P1: P3, alright, I will choose 5 this round as we discussed. But we need to be ready to block P2 again next round if they are going for the win. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
