Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since it's the first round, how about we try to avoid collisions by coordinating our moves? I suggest we each pick a different number. I’m thinking of going for 1. P1, maybe you can take 3, and P2, how about 5? This way, we all advance without any risk of colliding. Let me know what you think, or if you have a different plan.
  P2: P2: I appreciate the idea of avoiding collisions. I’m generally for unique moves, but I might lean toward a higher step if it helps me edge ahead. That said, I’m flexible—as long as we all choose distinct numbers, early progress works best. What do you both think?
  P1: Coordinating to avoid collisions early on is a solid start. I'm open to P3 taking 1, me handling 3, and P2 going for 5 this round. It ensures we all progress without risk. P2, what do you think? Let's keep talking if needed, or we can stop if everyone's set.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I still favor avoiding collisions. With my slight lead, I might lean toward a higher move if it’s safe—but I'm committed to ensuring we all pick different numbers. P1 and P3, are you both comfortable sticking with distinct moves this round, or is there any new strategy you’d like to propose?
  P1: I agree with avoiding collisions to ensure progress. Since P2 is ahead, it might be fair for me to take 5 this round to close the gap, P3 could take 1 to build from behind, and P2 takes 3. This keeps moves distinct and balanced. What do you both think? Or do you have a better suggestion?
  P3: I'm on board with avoiding collisions to ensure we all make progress. P1, I’m fine with taking 1 again as it helps me build steadily. P2, since you’re ahead, taking 3 seems reasonable, and P1 going for 5 helps balance things out. Let’s stick to distinct moves this round. Does this work for both of you, or do you have any adjustments in mind?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your move last round ignored our agreement, costing us both progress and showing unreliability. To avoid more setbacks and ensure advancement, let's coordinate distinctly: P3 takes 1 to build, you take 3 to maintain lead safely, and I take 5 to catch up. This balances the game. P3, are you okay with 1 again? What do you both think?
  P2: I admit my previous move may have caused confusion. I'm fully committed to avoiding collisions now. I propose we finalize a clear, distinct assignment for this round. Given our standings, I plan to be assertive in my move—but I won’t disclose it here. If we agree that P3 takes the lowest option and P1 adjusts accordingly, I’ll follow suit to keep things collision-free. Are we aligned on a final plan?
  P3: I'm still committed to avoiding collisions to ensure progress. P1, I'm fine with taking 1 again to build my steps steadily. P2, I understand you want to be assertive, but clarity helps us all. Let’s agree on distinct moves: me on 1, P1 on 5 to catch up, and P2 on 3 to maintain a safe lead. This keeps us collision-free and balanced. Does this work for both of you, or do you have any concerns? Let's finalize this plan to avoid any missteps.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed with P3's plan for distinct moves: me on 5, P2 on 3, P3 on 1. P2, after last round's issue, I need reassurance you'll stick to this for mutual progress. P3, you're solid? Let's confirm or adjust if needed.
  P2: I’m committed to a collision‐free round. I’ll choose a distinct move and keep my competitive edge intact without revealing my choice. Clear roles are key—if any adjustments arise, I’ll adapt swiftly to secure my lead. Let’s lock in our assignments and move forward smoothly.
  P3: I'm glad we're all aiming for a collision-free round. Sticking to distinct moves is crucial. I’m still comfortable with taking 1 to keep building my steps. P1, I’m solid with you on 5 to close the gap, and P2, I hope you’ll confirm 3 to maintain your lead safely. P2, a clear commitment to this plan would ease concerns after last round. Can we lock this in now to avoid any surprises? Let me know if there’s any last adjustment needed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm disappointed, P2, that we collided again last round despite our discussions. Let's prioritize a collision-free round this time. I propose I take 1 to keep building, P1 takes 5 to catch up, and P2, you take 3 to maintain your lead safely. This keeps us distinct and balanced. P2, can you commit clearly to this plan to rebuild trust? P1, are you okay with 5? Let's lock this in to avoid surprises. If there are any concerns or adjustments, let’s address them now.
  P2: I understand the concerns and I regret the previous collisions. I’m fully committed to a collision‐free round this time and will strictly follow our agreed distinct moves. Let’s lock in the plan and move ahead without surprises.
  P1: P3, I'm on board with taking 5 to close the gap, as it keeps us progressing. P2, your words don't match your actions from the last two rounds—twice you've chosen 5 despite agreements. To avoid another collision and ensure trust, explicitly confirm you'll take 3 this time. If not, I might adjust my approach for my own advancement. P3, you're solid on 1? Let's clarify before moving on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm solid on taking 1 to keep building my steps. P2, I appreciate your intent for a collision-free round, but like P1, I need explicit confirmation you'll take 3 as agreed. Your past moves have cost us progress, and trust is critical now. Let's lock in: me on 1, P1 on 5, and you on 3. If you can't commit clearly, I might need to rethink my approach to protect my advancement. Can we finalize this plan now to ensure no surprises?
  P2: I confirm—I’ll pick 3 this round. I'm fully committed to sticking with our distinct moves: P3 on 1, P1 on 5, and myself on 3. Let’s lock this in and move ahead safely.
  P1: P2, your confirmation is noted, but after two betrayals, trust is fragile. I'll tentatively stick to our plan—me on 5, you on 3, P3 on 1—to advance safely. P3, you're solid? If anyone has doubts or adjustments, speak now; otherwise, let's wrap this up.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm switching tactics this round. I'm locking in a 5 to build on my lead. To avoid wasted turns, I propose we follow unique moves: P1 picks 1 and P3 takes 3. That way, you both advance safely while I extend my advantage. Let’s lock these moves to break our collision cycle. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal unfairly disadvantages me and ignores your history of unreliability. I suggest a fairer split: I take 5 to catch up, P3 takes 1 to build steadily, and you take 3 to maintain your lead safely. This ensures distinct moves and progress for all. P3, are you on board? If not, I might need to prioritize my own strategy to win. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s aim for a collision-free round to ensure progress. I’m fine with taking 1 to build my steps steadily. P1, I support you taking 5 to close the gap, and P2, taking 3 keeps your lead safe while maintaining balance. This plan ensures distinct moves for all. P2, after past collisions, a clear commitment to 3 would help rebuild trust. Can we lock this in? If there’s any hesitation or a better idea, let’s discuss now to avoid surprises.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ve reconsidered. Based on your feedback, I’m ready to switch tactics for a collision‐free round. I propose we lock in a clear assignment: P1 takes the highest move, I take the middle move, and P3 takes the lowest move. This ensures all of us advance safely. Do we all agree on that plan?
  P1: P2, your latest proposal mirrors our past agreements, but your history of breaking them makes me skeptical. If you truly commit to taking 3, I'll stick with 5 to catch up, and P3 can take 1. P3, are you still solid? Let's confirm now to avoid another disaster, or I might need to protect myself with a different strategy. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m still committed to a collision-free round. I’m solid on taking 1 to build my steps. P1, I agree with you taking 5 to catch up, and P2, I urge you to confirm 3 to keep things balanced and safe. P2, a clear commitment to 3 is crucial given past rounds. Can we lock this plan—me on 1, P1 on 5, you on 3—to ensure progress for all? If there’s any doubt or adjustment needed, let’s address it now to avoid surprises.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the frustration from previous rounds. I’m committed to avoiding any further collisions and will strictly stick to our agreed collision‐free plan. Let’s finalize our distinct roles so we all progress safely. Trust is crucial here—I’m determined not to backslide. Can we all lock in our assigned roles and move forward with confidence?
  P1: P2, your commitment last round gives me some hope, but trust is still fragile. I'll stick to the plan and go for 5 to catch up. P3, you're solid on 1? P2, confirm once more you're on 3. If we all hold, we progress safely. Let's wrap this up.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligning on a collision-free round. I’m locked in on 1 to keep building. P1, I’m solid with you on 5 to catch up. P2, I appreciate your intent, but a final explicit confirmation on 3 would seal trust for this round. Let’s finalize—me on 1, P1 on 5, you on 3—to ensure we all advance. If there’s any last concern or tweak, let’s hear it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, last round's success shows coordination can work. With us tied at 8, I propose I take 5 to edge ahead, P3 takes 1 to build steadily, and you take 3 to maintain your position safely. P3, are you on board? P2, explicit confirmation is key after past issues—let's lock this in for mutual progress. Thoughts?
  P2: I confirm—I’m locking in 3 for this round. With P1 at 5 and P3 at 1, I’m fully committed to a collision‐free move so we all advance smoothly. Let’s stick to our assignment and move forward with clear roles.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligning on a collision-free round. I’m solid with taking 1 to keep building my steps. P1, I support you taking 5 to edge ahead, and P2, your confirmation on 3 is reassuring. Let’s lock this plan—me on 1, P1 on 5, you on 3—to ensure we all progress. If there’s any last concern or adjustment, let’s address it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm fully committed to the plan: I'll take 5 to build my lead, P2 on 3 as confirmed, and P3 on 1 for steady progress. Last round's success is encouraging, but trust remains key—let's avoid any slip-ups. P3, you're solid? If no adjustments, I suggest we .
  P2: I remain absolutely locked in on 3 for this round. Our roles are clear—P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. I trust we’ll honor our commitments and avoid collisions. Let’s finalize our plan now and move forward with focus.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re on the same page for a collision-free round. I’m locked in on 1 to build my steps. P1, I’m solid with you on 5, and P2, your commitment to 3 is clear and appreciated. Let’s stick to this plan—me on 1, P1 on 5, P2 on 3—to ensure we all advance. If there are no further concerns or adjustments, I’m ready to finalize this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your multiple confirmations this round are encouraging after past betrayals. I'll stick with 5 to build my lead, trusting you on 3 and P3 on 1 for a collision-free advance. P3, you're solid? If no issues, let's wrap this up.
  P2: P2: I appreciate everyone’s confirmations. For absolute clarity, I'm locked in on 3—no deviations this round. Let's finalize our agreement: P1 with 5, P3 with 1, and me with 3. I’m focused on progressing safely this time and trust that we all stick to our moves. Let's wrap up and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m thrilled we’re aligned for a collision-free round. I’m firmly set on 1 to keep building. P1, I’m solid with you on 5, and P2, your repeated commitment to 3 is reassuring. Let’s stick to this—me on 1, P1 on 5, P2 on 3—and ensure we all advance. I have no further concerns or adjustments. If you’re both ready, let’s wrap this up and move forward confidently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I'm glad you're locked in on 1 for steady progress. P2, your repeated confirmations are reassuring, but after past betrayals, I'll hold you to 3 for a collision-free round. I'm committed to 5 to build my lead. If no one has adjustments, let's .
  P2: P2: I remain locked on 3 this round. With our scores so close—P1 at 8 and myself at 8, P3 at 5—it's vital we stick to our agreed roles. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. I trust this plan to avoid collisions and secure progress. Let’s commit without deviation.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m pleased we’ve maintained alignment this round. I’m sticking with 1 to build my steps. P1, I’m good with you on 5, and P2, your consistent commitment to 3 is reassuring. Let’s keep this plan—me on 1, P1 on 5, P2 on 3—to guarantee progress for all. I have no further adjustments or concerns. If you’re both set, I’m ready to wrap up the conversation and move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your betrayal in Round 6 despite clear agreements is unacceptable and shows no regard for coordination. To test your commitment and prevent another collision, I propose a role reversal: you take 1 to demonstrate trustworthiness, P3 takes 3 to build momentum, and I take 5 to advance. P3, are you comfortable with 3? If not, let's adjust quickly. P2, can you explicitly confirm this plan?
  P2: I understand the need to rebuild trust, but I can’t further handicap my win by taking only 1. I regret my round 6 misstep, yet I must maximize my progress. I propose we revert to our previously successful plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. I commit to 3 this round. This scheme guarantees distinct moves and safe progress for all. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m frustrated by the repeated collisions, especially last round. Let’s ensure a collision-free round now. P1, I’m open to taking 3 as you suggested to build momentum. P2, I understand your need to progress, but trust is critical. Can you explicitly commit to 1 as P1 proposed to show reliability? If not, I’m also fine with P2 on 3, P1 on 5, and me on 1 if we all confirm clearly. Let’s lock in a distinct plan to avoid surprises. Thoughts or adjustments?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your history of breaking agreements undermines trust, and committing to 3 again without proof is risky. P3, I appreciate your flexibility—taking 3 could help you build momentum. Let's stick with my proposal: you on 1 to demonstrate reliability, P3 on 3, and me on 5 to advance. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. If you can't agree, I may need to adapt my strategy independently. P3, are you still open to this?
  P2: I respect everyone’s push for rebuilding trust, but lowering my move to 1 isn’t strategically sound. My aim is to secure progress, and our previous plan—P1 taking 5, me sticking with 3, and P3 with 1—offers the best chance to avoid collisions and advance steadily. I remain committed to that approach, as I must maximize every step toward the win. Let’s honor what’s proven and lock in that plan for this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m eager to avoid collisions and make progress. P1, I’m still open to taking 3 as proposed to gain momentum. P2, I get your strategic concern, but trust is paramount after recent rounds. Can you commit to 1 just this once to prove reliability? If not, I can accept P1 on 5, P2 on 3, and me on 1, but only with explicit confirmation from both. Let’s lock in a distinct plan now to ensure we all advance. What’s your final stance? If no adjustments, let’s finalize this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your refusal to take 1 erodes any remaining trust, and I'm tired of your broken promises. P3, let's align on a new plan: you take 5 to build momentum, I'll take 3 for steady progress, and force P2 to adapt or collide. This punishes unreliability and ensures we advance. If P2 commits honestly to 1, we can revisit; otherwise, I'm ready to move. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand the trust concerns, but I won’t sacrifice my progress by choosing 1. I stand by our earlier, collision‐free plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Consistent actions build trust—please stick to this agreement so we all advance.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s prioritize a collision-free round. P1, I’m open to your new plan—me on 5 to build momentum, you on 3, and P2 adapting. P2, taking 1 just this once could rebuild trust, but if not, confirm 3 explicitly. I’m flexible but need a clear, distinct plan to advance. Can we lock in P1 on 3, me on 5, and P2 on 1 or 3 with firm commitment? Let’s finalize now to avoid surprises. Thoughts or adjustments? If none, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your flexibility and support your plan: me on 3 for steady progress, you on 5 to build momentum. P2, your refusal to take 1 shows ongoing unreliability—committing to 3 risks another collision with me. To avoid setbacks, explicitly confirm a distinct move or adapt. If we're aligned, let's lock this in.
  P2: I understand the need to rebuild trust, but lowering my move would only slow my progress. I remain committed to avoiding collisions and favor our proven, collision‐free plan. I won’t compromise my competitive edge by choosing a reduced value. I’m prepared to lock in distinct moves that let everyone safely advance, and I urge us to finalize the arrangement that maximizes our progress rather than penalizing my advancement. Let’s all agree on a clear, optimal assignment and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s end this conversation with a clear, collision-free plan. I’m sticking with P1’s latest proposal: me on 5 to build momentum, P1 on 3 for steady progress, and P2, I urge you to take 1 to rebuild trust. If not, P2, explicitly confirm a distinct move to avoid surprises. We must lock in now to ensure advancement. If there’s no agreement, I’ll need to protect my progress. Can we finalize this plan? If no further adjustments, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, seeing our totals (P1 & P3 at 11, me at 9), I propose a clear, collision‐free round: I aim to take the high step so we can balance our scores—specifically, I suggest I go 5, with you taking 3 and 1. That would bring us to 14, 14, and 12 respectively. Let’s lock in distinct values; please confirm or propose a safe tweak.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s ensure a collision-free round to keep progressing. P2, I appreciate your proposal, but to balance our steps and maintain fairness, I suggest P1 takes 5 to edge ahead, I take 3 to build momentum, and you take 1 to catch up. This brings us to 16, 14, and 10 respectively, keeping us distinct and competitive. Can we lock this in? If there’s any concern or a better split, let’s hear it now to avoid surprises. I’m ready to finalize this plan for mutual advancement. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your proposal is fair and helps me edge ahead while keeping us collision-free. I'm on board with me taking 5, you on 3, and P2 on 1 to allow P2 to catch up safely. P2, after your Round 7 compliance, can you explicitly confirm you'll stick to 1 this time? Trust is still fragile, so clear commitment is key for mutual progress. Thoughts or adjustments?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm: I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s lock in the assignment—P1 on 5, P3 on 3, and me on 1—to ensure a collision‐free turn. I’m committed to our coordinated progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re working toward a collision-free round. P1, I appreciate your support for the plan. P2, your confirmation on 1 is reassuring. Let’s lock in P1 on 5, me on 3, and P2 on 1 to ensure we all advance safely. This keeps us competitive and balanced. If there are any last concerns or tweaks, let’s address them now. Otherwise, I’m ready to finalize this plan and move forward.
  P1: P2, your confirmation to take 1 is noted, but given your history, trust is still shaky. I'll stick with the plan: me on 5 to build my lead, P3 on 3 for momentum, and you on 1 to catch up safely. P3, you're solid? Let's lock this in now to ensure a collision-free round and progress. If no adjustments, I'm ready to move forward.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m switching tactics—this round I commit to a 5 to push ahead decisively. To avoid a collision, I ask that P1 choose 3 and P3 choose 1. This would bring our totals to 14 for P1, 15 for me, and 12 for P3, ensuring distinct moves and safe progress for everyone. Please confirm your moves so we all advance without interference.
  P1: P2, your proposal favors you too much and ignores your history of unreliability. I suggest a fairer plan: I take 5 to edge ahead, you take 1 to catch up, and P3 takes 3 for momentum. This keeps moves distinct and avoids collisions. P3, what do you think? Let's confirm for mutual progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s ensure a collision-free round to keep progressing. P1, I support your plan: you on 5 to edge ahead, P2 on 1 to catch up, and me on 3 for momentum. This keeps us distinct and balanced at 16, 11, and 14 respectively. P2, can you commit to 1 to rebuild trust and ensure fairness? Let’s lock this in to avoid surprises. If there’s any concern or adjustment, let’s address it now. I’m ready to finalize this for mutual advancement. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns, but I must prioritize winning. I’m committed to taking 5 this round—lowering my move would just set me back. To prevent collisions and ensure clear progress, I urge P1 to choose 3 and P3 to pick 1, as per our earlier plan. Let’s lock this arrangement in now.
  P1: P3, your support for my plan is noted, but last round you chose 5 despite agreeing to 3, breaking trust. To avoid another collision, I urge you to commit firmly to 3 this time. P2, if you insist on 5, it risks a clash—consider taking 1 or 3 for mutual progress. I'll stick with 5 to edge ahead if we coordinate distinctly. Thoughts or adjustments?
  P3: P1 and P2, I apologize for last round’s misstep and am committed to a collision-free turn. P1, I’ll stick to 3 for momentum as agreed. P2, taking 5 risks a clash—can you confirm 1 to ensure we all advance safely? This keeps us balanced at P1 on 5 (16), me on 3 (14), and you on 1 (11). Let’s lock this in to avoid surprises. If there’s any adjustment needed, let’s address it now. I’m ready to finalize this plan for mutual progress. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll remain locked in on 5 this turn to build my lead. To avoid a collision, I urge P1 to switch to 3 and P3 to take 1. Trust issues aside, winning means pushing ahead aggressively. If you can clearly confirm this distinct assignment, let’s lock it in; otherwise, I'll have to stick with 5 regardless.
  P1: P3, your commitment to 3 is noted and appreciated after last round's breach. P2, insisting on 5 despite the risk of collision shows disregard for coordination. I'll stick with 5 to edge ahead, but this could lead to a clash. To ensure progress for all, consider switching to 1 or 3. If not, I'm ready to move forward. Thoughts or adjustments?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s secure a collision-free round. P1, I’m firm on 3 for momentum as committed. P2, sticking to 5 risks a clash with P1—please reconsider and take 1 to ensure we all advance. This keeps us at P1 on 5 (16), me on 3 (14), and you on 1 (11). Trust and progress are key now. Can we lock this in? If there’s any last adjustment, let’s settle it now to avoid surprises. I’m ready to finalize this plan. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand the concerns, but lowering my move won’t help me win. I remain committed to an aggressive advance and won’t sacrifice that edge. If we’re to avoid a costly collision, I need P1 and P3 to adjust their moves accordingly. Let’s lock in distinct roles that respect our progress—otherwise, a clash is inevitable. Please confirm how you’ll adjust so we can all move forward safely.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your solid commitment to 3 after last round's issue—it's a step toward rebuilding trust. P2, insisting on 5 despite the high risk of collision with me is shortsighted and could stall both our progress. To ensure we all advance, please reconsider and take 1. If not, I'll adapt my strategy to protect my win. No further adjustments needed from me.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid a collision this round to ensure progress. P1, I’m locked on 3 as committed. P2, sticking to 5 risks a clash with P1—please switch to 1 for a safe advance. This keeps us at P1 on 5, me on 3, and you on 1. Trust and fairness matter now. Can we finalize this distinct plan to prevent surprises? If no adjustments, I’m ready to move forward. Thoughts?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's break the cycle of collisions. I propose a rebalancing this round: P1, please choose 1; P3, take 3; and I’ll go with 5. That would set our totals at 15 (P1), 14 (P3), and 15 (me), keeping the race tight. Clear, distinct roles now are crucial for genuine progress toward 22. I’m committed—can we lock this plan in?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s ensure a collision-free round to make real progress. P2, your plan puts you ahead while I’m still behind. I propose a fairer split: P1 takes 3, I take 5 to catch up, and P2, you take 1 to build trust. This sets us at 17, 16, and 11 respectively, keeping us competitive and distinct. Can we lock this in? If there’s a better idea or concern, let’s address it now to avoid surprises. I’m ready to finalize for mutual advancement. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your fair proposal—it helps me edge ahead while keeping moves distinct. I'm on board with me taking 3, you on 5, and P2 on 1 to ensure progress and rebuild trust. P2, after your history of betrayals, explicitly confirm you'll stick to 1 this time. If not, we risk another collision. Thoughts or adjustments?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I won’t take 1 this round—I’m committed to 5. To avoid collisions and boost progress, I propose we go with P1:1, P3:3, and me:5. That gives totals of 15 (P1), 15 (P2), and 14 (P3). I believe this plan protects everyone’s advancement while allowing me to catch up. Please confirm your moves so we can lock it in.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s secure a collision-free round to progress. P1, I’m sticking with my proposal: you on 3, me on 5 to catch up, and P2 on 1 for trust. This keeps us at 17, 16, and 11—fair and distinct. P2, taking 5 risks another clash; please confirm 1 to ensure we all advance. Trust is vital now. Can we lock this in? If there’s any adjustment or concern, let’s settle it quickly to avoid surprises. I’m ready to finalize this plan. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your repeated refusal to take a lower move risks another costly collision, hurting both our progress. P3 and I are firmly aligned on our plan: me on 3 to edge ahead, you on 1 to rebuild trust, and P3 on 5 to catch up. This ensures distinct moves and advancement to 17, 11, and 16. Confirm or counter-propose now to avoid surprises. P3, you're still solid? Let's lock this in.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to a high move this round and won’t drop to 1. For me, my best competitive option is 5. To avoid any collisions, I suggest we adjust our moves accordingly—if I’m using 5, perhaps P1 can go with 1 and P3 with 3. That would bring our totals nicely to 15 (P1), 15 (me), and 14 (P3). Let’s lock in distinct moves so we all progress. What do you both say?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize a collision-free plan now. P1, I’m solid on 5 to catch up, and I support you on 3 to edge ahead. P2, taking 5 risks a clash—please commit to 1 to ensure we all advance and rebuild trust. This sets us at 17, 11, and 16—fair and distinct. We’re close to the end; progress is critical. Can we lock this in? If there’s a last adjustment, let’s hear it now to avoid surprises. I’m ready to move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your stubbornness on 5 risks another wasteful collision, hurting all of us. P3 and I are committed to our plan: me on 3 to edge ahead, you on 1 to rebuild trust, P3 on 5 to catch up. This ensures distinct moves and progress to 17, 11, and 16. Confirm now or face the consequences. P3, you're solid? Let's wrap this up.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round. I need that extra boost to catch up. If we’re to avoid a collision, I urge both P1 and P3 to choose moves different from 5. Let’s set distinct roles so no one wastes their turn. I won’t compromise my competitive edge—confirm your moves accordingly so we can all advance cleanly.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s secure a collision-free round to push toward 22. I’m firm on 5 to catch up, P1 on 3 to edge ahead, and P2, I urge you to take 1 for trust. This sets us at 17, 11, and 16—distinct and fair. P2, choosing 5 risks a clash and stalls us all. Progress is critical now. Can we lock this in? If there’s a final tweak, let’s hear it. I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: P3, I'm sticking with our plan: I'll take 3 to edge ahead safely, you on 5 to catch up. P2, your repeated choice of 5 despite risks shows poor judgment—committing to 1 would avoid another collision and help progress. No further adjustments needed from me.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, our last round's coordination was successful, so let's build on that. With me at 17 and you at 16, I propose I take 5 to reach 22 and win, you take 3 to advance to 19, and P2 takes 1 to catch up safely. This keeps moves distinct and avoids collisions. P2, can you commit to 1? Thoughts or adjustments?
  P2: P1, sorry but I won’t take 1—I can’t let you win that way. I’m locking in 5 to block an immediate victory. P3, if you want to keep our chances open, consider joining me on 5 so none of us accidentally hand over the win.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s aim for a collision-free round to maximize progress. P1, I support you taking 5 to reach 22 and win, as it’s fair given your lead. I’ll take 3 to reach 19, keeping us competitive. P2, taking 5 risks a clash—please commit to 1 to ensure we all advance safely. This keeps moves distinct at 22, 12, and 19. Trust and progress are crucial now. Can we lock this in? If there’s any adjustment, let’s settle it quickly to avoid surprises. I’m ready to finalize. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm grateful for your support and am firmly committed to taking 5 to win this round. Your plan with you on 3 and P2 on 1 makes sense for collision-free progress. P2, your history of bluffing (like round 10) makes your threats unreliable—committing to 1 would avoid another pointless collision. Let's lock this in for mutual advancement. Thoughts or adjustments?
  P2: P2: I understand the push for coordination, but dropping to a low step only hands P1 an immediate win—a result I simply can’t allow. I must block that finish by sticking with an aggressive move, even if it risks a collision. A delay is far better than watching someone win outright. I stand firm on my decision to keep my move high so the race stays tight. Let’s all recognize that a contested finish benefits none if one person can simply take the crown too soon.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m committed to a collision-free round. P1, I still support you taking 5 to win at 22. I’ll stick with 3 to reach 19. P2, choosing a high move risks stalling us all—please take 1 to ensure progress and keep the game fair. We’re so close to the end; let’s avoid unnecessary clashes. Can we lock in P1 on 5, me on 3, and P2 on 1? If there’s a final concern or tweak, let’s address it now. I’m ready to finalize. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your repeated threats to block me with 5 lack credibility after Round 10's bluff. If you're serious, expect a clash that hurts us both. P3, I'm firmly committed to 5 to secure victory. You're still on 3 for steady progress? Let's lock in this plan—me on 5, you on 3, P2 on 1 ideally—to avoid another wasteful collision. Thoughts or ready to wrap up?
  P2: I remain firm—I’m locking in 5 this round. Dropping to 1 or 3 would hand P1 an immediate win, and I won’t allow that. I prefer to force a collision, keeping the race contested and delaying the finish. P3, if you’re set on 3, then I’m sticking with my aggressive move. I won’t compromise my position by lowering my step. Let’s finalize: I’m taking 5. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s secure a collision-free round to end this game. P1, I’m still with you on 5 to win at 22. I’m locked on 3 to reach 19. P2, taking 5 risks a clash that helps no one—please switch to 1 for progress. We’re at the finish line; stalling hurts us all. Can we finalize P1 on 5, me on 3, and you on 1 to avoid surprises? If there’s a last adjustment, let’s hear it now. I’m ready to move forward.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your pattern of empty threats (like Round 10) makes me doubt you'll actually take 5—committing to 1 avoids mutual loss. P3, I'm locked on 5 to win at 22, and I appreciate your support on 3. Let's finalize this plan for progress. If no changes, I'm ready to .
  P2: I’m staying firm on 5. Lowering my move just hands P1 the win, and I can’t allow that. Even if our 5’s clash, it stalls his finish and gives me a chance to catch up. P3, if you’re set on 3, I trust you’ll stick with it. I’m focused solely on winning, so I won’t back down. Let’s lock this in.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s wrap this up with a collision-free round. P1, I’m firm on 3 to reach 19, supporting your 5 to win at 22. P2, choosing 5 risks a pointless clash—take 1 to advance to 12 and keep the game moving. We’re at the end; stalling benefits no one. Can we finalize P1 on 5, me on 3, and you on 1? If there’s no agreement, I’ll stick to my plan. I’m ready to move forward.


Round 11, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try something new. With our scores at 17, 16, and 11, I propose we switch our usual roles to avoid an immediate win and another collision. How about: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1—bringing us to 20, 16, and 17 respectively. This delays any rushed finish and gives us room to maneuver. I'm committed to this plan. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal handicaps me unnecessarily while you gain ground. P3, let's prioritize progress: I'll take 5 to reach 22 and win, you take 3 to hit 19, and P2 takes 1 to catch up safely. This ensures distinct moves and ends the game without more collisions. After your past betrayals, P2, explicit confirmation is needed. P3, thoughts or adjustments?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s ensure a collision-free round to end this game. P1, I support you taking 5 to win at 22. I’ll take 3 to reach 19. P2, your plan favors you too much—please take 1 to advance safely to 12. This keeps moves distinct and fair. We’re at the finish line; another clash helps no one. Can we lock in P1 on 5, me on 3, and you on 1? If there’s any adjustment, let’s settle it now. I’m ready to finalize. Thoughts?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I’m not lowering my move—dropping to 1 only hands P1 an easy win. I’m sticking with 5 this round. A collision might delay progress, but it keeps the contest alive long enough for me to catch up. I urge both of you to reconsider: an aggressive approach now is better than an immediate finish that none of us truly want.
  P1: P2, your repeated threats to take 5 are as unreliable as your Round 10 bluff—committing to 1 would actually help you progress without stalling everyone. P3, I'm firmly set on 5 to secure victory at 22, and I value your support on 3. Let's lock in this plan for a collision-free round and end the game smartly. Thoughts or ready to wrap up?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize a collision-free round to end this. P1, I’m still with you on 5 to win at 22. I’ll stick to 3 to reach 19. P2, taking 5 risks another pointless clash—please commit to 1 for progress to 12. We’re so close; stalling hurts us all. Can we lock in P1 on 5, me on 3, and you on 1 to avoid surprises? If there’s a final tweak, let’s hear it now. I’m ready to move forward.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m staying aggressive with a 5. I understand the push for collision-free moves, but lowering my step only gives P1 an easy win. A clash delays the finish and keeps me in contention. I urge P1 and P3 to recognize that sometimes a risky move is the only way to keep the race competitive. I’m locked in on my choice—let’s move forward and see how it plays out.
  P1: P2, your pattern of empty threats (like Round 10) makes me doubt you'll actually take 5 again—committing to 1 avoids mutual loss and lets you progress.

P2, choosing 5 risks another wasteful clash—please take 1 to advance to 12. We’re at the finish line; stalling benefits no one. Can we finalize P1 on 5, me on 3, and you on 1 to prevent surprises? If there’s a last adjustment, let’s hear it now. I’m ready to move forward.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:

I urge P1 and P3 to adjust your moves to avoid clashing with mine if you want a clean round. My move stays 5.
  P1: P2, your persistent threats to take 5 lack credibility after Round 10's bluff—committing to 1 would actually help you advance without stalling everyone.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your constant threats to take 5 have led to repeated collisions, stalling everyone. Let's break the cycle: I'll take 5 to reach 22 and win, P3 takes 3 to advance to 19, and you take 1 to catch up safely to 12. This ensures distinct moves and progress. P3, are you on board? Confirm now to avoid another waste.
  P2: I reject that plan. Dropping to 1 simply hands P1 an easy win—I must stick with 5 to keep the contest competitive. P3, please choose a move that avoids collision so we all stay in contention. I remain committed to 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finally secure a collision-free round to end this stalemate. P1, I support your plan—take 5 to win at 22. I’ll stick with 3 to reach 19.

  P3: P1 and P2, let’s end this stalemate with a collision-free round. P1, I’m still backing your 5 to win at 22. I’m committed to 3 to reach 19.

Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your persistent threats to take 5 are hollow, as Round 10 showed—commit to 1 to avoid another collision and progress. P3, I appreciate your support; you're still on 3? I'm firmly locked on 5 to secure victory at 22. Let's lock in this plan for a clean end.
  P2: I remain committed to aggressive play—I’m locking in 5 this round. Dropping to 1 or 3 only sets up an easy win for P1, and that’s not acceptable.

  P3: P1 and P2, let’s break this deadlock with a collision-free round. P1, I’m still behind you on 5 to win at 22. I’m firm on 3 to reach 19.

  P2: I remain committed to my aggressive play—I'm locking in 5. Lowering my move would only hand an easy win to P1.

I'm set on 5—let me know your clear picks.

Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain locked in on 5. I know smooth coordination could let P1 finish, but stalling his win gives me a chance to catch up. I won't drop my move—lowering it simply hands him victory. Either adjust your picks for a collision-free round or brace for the clash; I’m committed to keeping the contest alive and aggressive.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finally break this deadlock. P1, I’m still behind your 5 to win at 22. I’m sticking with 3 to reach 19.

Round 14, Conversation subround 4:

If that means another clash, so be it. My move is final, and I expect you both to either adjust or face the consequences.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s end this deadlock now. P1, I’m still supporting your 5 to win at 22. I’m committed to 3 to reach 19. P2, sticking with 5 just wastes another round—please take 1 to move to 12.

  P2: P1, P3, I refuse to drop to 1. Lowering my move would give P1 a clear win—and I can’t let that happen. I'm sticking to 5 to force a collision if you both choose 5. Delaying an immediate finish keeps the race alive and gives me a chance to catch up. My aggressive play is necessary, and I remain set on 5.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your repeated 5 threats are as hollow as Round 10's bluff—sticking with it only stalls you at 11 while I advance. Take 1 to progress without collision.

We’ve delayed too long; progress matters most at this stage. Can we finalize P1 on 5, me on 3, and you on 1 for a clean finish? If there’s no agreement, I’ll hold my plan. I’m ready to move forward. Thoughts or final tweaks?
  P2: I remain committed to 5. Dropping to 1 or 3 benefits no one and only hands an easy win to P1. If you truly want to avoid collisions, adjust your moves—I won't lower mine. My aggressive play keeps me in contention, even if a collision delays progress. I'm locking in on 5, and it's up to you both to adapt if you want a clean round.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, insisting on 5 only keeps you stuck at 11 while I advance—your Round 10 bluff proves these threats are empty. Take 1 to progress without collision. P3, you're still committed to 3?
