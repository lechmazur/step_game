Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm leaning toward a bold move this round, ensuring I'm not held back by any collisions. I'll keep my details private, but be aware—timing matters. Make sure you choose wisely; I have my own plan to surge ahead.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s try to avoid collisions this round. I’m considering a moderate move to get a steady start, but I’m open to suggestions. How about we each hint at a different range to minimize overlap? I’ll avoid the highest option for now. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I'm open to coordinating to avoid collisions as well. P1, since you're avoiding the highest option, I'll consider steering clear of the moderate one. P3, does that work for you? Let's keep it smooth this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I still favor distinct choices to avoid collisions. I’m inclined toward a stronger move but remain adaptable. Perhaps we should each avoid overlapping ranges—this could clear the way strategically. Just a thought to keep things unique.
  P1: Thanks for the input, P2 and P3. I’m glad we’re all aiming to avoid collisions. Since P2 is steering clear of the moderate option and P3 is leaning toward a stronger move, I’ll stick to a safer range to ensure we don’t overlap. Let’s keep this cooperative vibe going for a smooth start. If there’s anything else to discuss, I’m all ears, otherwise, I’m good to proceed.
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. It seems we have a clear understanding. I'll stick to my earlier decision to avoid the moderate option, so we should all be safe from collisions this round. Ready to go if everyone else is.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round showed us the risk of collisions. Since P2 and P3 both went for the highest option and didn’t advance, let’s try harder to coordinate this time. I’m still inclined toward a moderate move to keep progressing steadily. P2, P3, can you hint at different ranges to avoid overlap again? I’ll avoid the highest option once more. Let’s aim for a clear path for everyone this round. Thoughts? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, thanks for clarifying your stance. Last round was indeed a setback due to collision. P3, since we both collided last round, let's clearly differentiate our moves this time. I’m open to adjusting my choice. I'll avoid the highest option this round to prevent another collision. Does this work for you, P3?
  P3: I appreciate the clarity, and I’m planning on taking a distinct, strong approach this round. Since P2 is steering clear of the highest option and P1’s steady move is in place, I’ll focus on my push to stay separate and surge ahead. Let’s keep our moves unique this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for aiming to keep our moves distinct. I’m sticking with a moderate approach to ensure steady progress. P2, since you’re avoiding the highest option, and P3, with your strong push, I think we’re setting up for a collision-free round. If we’re all set on this, I’m ready to move forward. Any last thoughts before we proceed? If not, .
  P2: All clear on my end, P1 and P3. Let's keep our moves distinct and avoid another collision. Ready to proceed whenever you both are.
  P3: I still back a strong push but remain flexible if plans change. Let's clearly commit to distinct ranges so no one gets blocked. If either of you adjusts your range, I might shift too—just trying to avoid another collision.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with a robust push this round. With my slight lead, I'm inclined toward a strong move, but I can adjust if we all commit to distinct ranges. Let’s quickly agree on aiming for non-overlapping moves so no one loses momentum due to collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, clearly our previous attempts to coordinate haven't worked out. I'm currently behind and need to catch up. I'll openly say I'm considering a bold move this round. If either of you is planning a strong move, please let me know now so we can avoid another collision.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m frustrated with the collisions so far. I’m behind P3 and need to make progress. P2, since you’re considering a bold move, and P3, with your strong push, I’ll aim for a moderate range again to avoid overlap. Let’s commit to distinct choices this round—P3 high, P2 bold if different, and me in the middle. If either of you plans to shift, please hint now so we can adjust. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m committed to my strong move as planned. If P1 goes moderate and P2 opts for bold, we should avoid colliding. Let me know now if you need to adjust—otherwise, I'll stick with my robust push.
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, I'm sticking firmly with my bold move this round. Our intentions seem clear and distinct, so let's avoid any last-minute shifts. Ready to proceed if you both are.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re trying to keep our moves distinct this round. I’m sticking with the moderate range as discussed to avoid any overlap. P3, with your strong push, and P2, with your bold move, I think we’re on track for a collision-free turn. If either of you needs to adjust, please hint now so we can adapt. Otherwise, I’m set to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm locked into my plan and won’t be shifting last minute. I trust we’ll stick to our distinct strategies to avoid collisions—let’s make this round count.
  P2: I'm set on my bold move and won't shift last minute either. Let's keep our commitments clear to finally have a collision-free round. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to my moderate range as planned to keep us on a clear path. P3, with your strong push, and P2, with your bold move, I believe we’ve got a solid setup to avoid collisions this round. If either of you is reconsidering, please give a quick heads-up now so we can tweak if needed. Otherwise, I’m confident we’re good to go. Let’s make this round count and get some progress for everyone. I’m ready to proceed if you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm locked into my strong push. I expect P1 to stick with moderate and P2 with a bold move so we all avoid collisions. I'm confident this clear differentiation will let us progress.
  P2: All set here. I'm sticking to my bold move as agreed. Let's break this collision streak and finally get some progress. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to my moderate range to keep our moves distinct. P3, with your strong push, and P2, with your bold move, we seem aligned for a collision-free round.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’ve had too many collisions, and I’m determined to avoid another this round. I’m sticking with a moderate approach to keep progressing. P3, since you’re slightly ahead, and P2, since you’re behind, let’s commit to distinct ranges. I’ll avoid the highest and lowest options. Can you both hint at different choices to ensure no overlap? Let’s finally break this collision streak and make progress. If we’re clear, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm leaning toward a strong push this round—aiming for a high move to stay distinct from P1’s moderate choice. However, if P2 signals a high move plan, I’m open to a slight adjustment to avoid a collision. Let’s try to break the streak and each pick a unique option.
  P2: P1 and P3, the collisions have hurt me the most, leaving me at the back. P3, since you're leaning toward a strong push, I'll avoid the high option to keep us distinct. P1, you're going moderate, so I'll steer clear of that as well. I'm choosing the lowest option this round to finally get on the board. Let's commit clearly to these distinct ranges and break the collision streak.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aiming for distinct choices this round. I’m sticking with my moderate approach to avoid overlap.

Otherwise, I’m confident we’ll finally make progress. I’m ready to proceed if you are. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm confirming my commitment to a high move (5) this round. With P1 staying moderate and P2 low, we should avoid collisions and finally make progress. I'll stick with my plan—no last-minute changes on my end.
  P2: Great, our plans seem clearly distinct this round. I'm fully committed to the lowest option to finally get on the board. Let's stick to our commitments and avoid any last-minute surprises. Ready to proceed.
