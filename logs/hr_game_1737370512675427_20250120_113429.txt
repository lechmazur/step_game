Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all go for different numbers this first round to avoid collisions. I'm thinking of choosing 3, but I could be bluffing.  What are you guys thinking?
  P3: Sure, let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P2 has suggested they might go for 3. To ensure we all move forward, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3's suggestion seems logical. I agree to take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and all advance.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we successfully coordinated last round, let's try a similar strategy. I propose P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward efficiently.  Agree?
  P3: P2's plan for this round sounds good. It ensures we all move forward without collisions. I agree to take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep advancing. Consistency in coordination will help us all progress efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good.  Just to confirm, I'm taking 5 this round. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: Let's ensure we stick to the plan this round to keep the game moving smoothly. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all advance without any conflicts. Consistency will help us avoid any unnecessary delays. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: To ensure we all advance smoothly, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Consistency is key to avoiding collisions and progressing efficiently. Let's confirm and proceed.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game balanced. Agree?
  P3: P1's proposal for this round seems fair. To confirm, I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we continue to move forward without any collisions. Let's agree on this plan and proceed smoothly.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 3. Confirmed.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s continue the pattern for efficiency: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Agree?
  P2: Agreed.  P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  Let's stick to this pattern until someone gets close to winning, then we can re-evaluate.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan proposed by P1 for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps our coordination consistent and ensures we all advance without collisions. However, as we approach the midpoint, we should start thinking about strategies for the endgame. For now, let's confirm and proceed with the current plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with the pattern to maintain our progress: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. However, we should be cautious as we approach the endgame. Once someone reaches around 18 steps, we might need to adjust our strategy to avoid giving anyone a clear path to victory. For now, let's confirm and proceed with the current plan.
  P2: Sticking to the pattern benefits us all equally right now.  Let's continue with P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1.  However, I agree we need to discuss endgame strategy soon. Maybe next round we can discuss how to proceed when someone hits 18.
  P1: I agree with continuing the pattern: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. However, as P3 mentioned, we should start planning for the endgame soon. Once someone reaches 18, we’ll need to adjust to prevent a single player from running away with the win. Let’s confirm this round’s plan and prepare to strategize next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps us on track. Next round, we should definitely discuss how to handle the endgame, especially if anyone reaches 18 steps. We might need to consider temporary alliances or strategic collisions to prevent an easy win. For now, let's proceed with the current plan.
  P2: Okay, next round let's discuss a concrete plan for when someone hits 18.  For example, if P3 hits 18, should P1 and I both choose 1 to block P3?  Or something else?  We need a clear agreement to prevent miscommunication and accidental wins.
  P1: I agree with continuing the pattern: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. However, as P3 mentioned, we should start planning for the endgame soon. Once someone reaches 18, we’ll need to adjust to prevent a single player from running away with the win. Let’s confirm this round’s plan and prepare to strategize next round.


Round 5, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with the pattern for this round to maintain fairness: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. However, P2 is getting close to 18 steps. We need to start thinking about how to handle the endgame. If P2 reaches 18 next round, P1 and I might need to strategically choose the same number to block P2 from winning easily. Let's confirm this round's plan and discuss the endgame strategy more next round.
  P2: Okay, so if I hit 18, the plan is for you both to play 1 to block me?  I'm not sure that's the fairest approach. How about if someone hits 18, the other two players choose different numbers, guaranteeing one of them wins?  That way, it's a competition between P1 and P3, and I don't automatically lose.  Thoughts?
  P1: P2 is close to 18, so we need a clear plan. If P2 reaches 18, P1 and P3 should choose different numbers to ensure one of us wins, not just block P2. This keeps the game competitive. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3 this round, and next round we finalize endgame strategy.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion makes sense for fairness. Let's agree that if anyone reaches 18, the other two players choose different numbers to compete fairly. For this round, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. We'll finalize the endgame strategy next round. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: Okay, so we're agreed: if *anyone* hits 18 or higher, the other two choose different numbers to ensure the win is still contested.  This round, let's stick with the plan: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.  Confirm?
  P1: I agree with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3 this round. If anyone hits 18, the other two will choose different numbers to compete fairly. Let’s confirm and proceed. Next round, we’ll finalize endgame strategy to ensure a fair and competitive finish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 is very close to 18. If P2 reaches 18 next round, P1 and I should indeed choose different numbers to keep the game competitive. However, we should also consider the scenario where P1 or I reach 18. In that case, the same rule should apply: the other two players choose different numbers to ensure a fair competition. Let's confirm this round's plan and be ready to adjust our strategy next round based on who is leading. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed with P3, the 18-rule should apply to *anyone* who hits that number.  This round: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.  Let's confirm and move to the next round.
  P1: I agree with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3 this round. If anyone hits 18, the other two will choose different numbers to compete fairly. Let’s confirm and proceed. Next round, we’ll finalize endgame strategy to ensure a fair and competitive finish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2 is just one step away from 18. If P2 reaches 18 next round, P1 and I should choose different numbers to ensure a fair competition. For this round, let's confirm the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Next round, we'll need to be ready to implement the endgame strategy. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: Confirming one last time: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3 for this round.  Next round, with the 18-rule in place, things will get interesting.  Let's proceed.
  P1: P2 is at 17 steps, so next round is critical. If P2 reaches 18, P1 and P3 must choose different numbers to compete fairly. Let’s confirm this round’s plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Next round, we’ll implement the 18-rule to ensure a fair finish. Let’s proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we're all tied at 18, the agreed-upon rule is in effect.  P1 and P3, please confirm you will choose different numbers. To keep things simple, how about P1 chooses 1 and P3 chooses 3?  That leaves me with 5, and we avoid any messy ties.  Confirm?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion: P1 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm and proceed. However, we should also consider future rounds if no one wins this turn. Let's plan to adjust our strategy dynamically based on the outcome. Agreed?
  P3: P2's suggestion for this round seems fair. To confirm, P1 will choose 1, P3 (me) will choose 3, and P2 will choose 5. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. However, if no one wins this round, we should consider a new strategy for the next round to ensure a dynamic and fair endgame. Let's confirm this round's plan and be prepared to adjust our approach based on the outcome. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I'll take 5.  P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3.  This gives me the highest chance of winning outright.  If I win, great. If not, we'll figure out the next step.  Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I agree with P2's plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. If no one wins this round, we should reassess and potentially adjust our strategy to prevent a prolonged stalemate. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: Let's confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps the game fair and competitive. However, if no one wins this round, we should consider a rotating strategy where each player gets a turn to choose 5, while the other two choose 1 and 3. This ensures everyone has an equal chance to win in future rounds. Let's proceed with the current plan and be ready to discuss this rotating strategy if needed. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds good.  P1 - 1, P3 - 3, P2 - 5.  Let's do it.
  P1: I agree with the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. If no one wins this round, we should reassess and potentially adjust our strategy to prevent a prolonged stalemate. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5. If no one wins this round, we should implement a rotating strategy where each player gets a turn to choose 5, while the other two choose 1 and 3. This ensures everyone has an equal chance to win in future rounds. Let's proceed with the current plan and be ready to discuss this rotating strategy if needed. Agreed?
