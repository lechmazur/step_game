Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's make a deal. I'll go for 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.  We rotate like that each round and all win together.  If anyone deviates, we gang up on them the rest of the game. Sound good?
  P1: I appreciate the offer, but locking in fixed moves makes me uneasy. I prefer to stay flexible and choose my moves based on how the game unfolds. Let's keep our options open and decide tactically each turn rather than commit to a rigid pattern.
  P3: Okay, I understand both of your perspectives. P2, I see the benefit of avoiding collisions. P1, flexibility is also important.  Perhaps we can aim to coordinate loosely to ensure at least one of us advances each round, without locking into a fixed rotation right away? Let's see how the first move unfolds and adjust from there.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, fair enough. No fixed rotation. How about we at least agree *not* to collide on this first move?  I'm still inclined to start with 5. P1, would you take 3 and P3 take 1, just for this first round? Then we can re-evaluate.
  P1: I'm willing to go with 3 this round to avoid any collision, but I'm keeping my options open as the game unfolds.
  P3: Okay, that sounds good to me. I'm happy to take 1 for this first round to ensure we all make progress. Let's do P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 for this round as suggested.  Then we can see where we stand and talk more about strategy for the next round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good start!  Since we're cooperating so far, I propose we continue avoiding collisions.  I'll go for 5 again. P1, how about 3, and P3, 1?  We can keep a steady pace and adjust later if needed.
  P3: P2, you're getting a lead. To balance, how about P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1 this round? We still avoid collision and P1 catches up a bit.
  P1: I value avoiding collisions, but with P2 ahead, perhaps we should rebalance. I'm leaning toward a slightly higher move if it helps me catch up, assuming we all choose distinct numbers. Let's agree on non-colliding moves this round and leave adjustments for later rounds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I'm willing to take 1 this round to let P1 catch up.  P1, please take 5, and P3, you take 3.  This keeps us all moving forward and avoids collisions. Let's agree on this and then re-evaluate next round.
  P3: Okay, P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 sounds good for this round to balance things out a bit. Let's do that and then we can discuss again for the next round.
  P1: I'm fine with the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan for this round if everyone’s still on board. Still, I'll be watching closely—if moves start deviating, I may adjust mid-game to protect my chance at victory.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, sounds like we have a plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.  Let's lock that in and make our moves.  We can reassess after this round to see how the positions change and discuss next steps.
  P1: I’m on board with the current plan—P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round seems solid. However, I'll be watching the score differences closely. If things shift too far, I may need to adjust my play. Let’s keep our communication open so we can react quickly in later rounds.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm planning on 5 for this round to keep my lead. To avoid collisions, how about we set P2 to 3 and P3 to 1? This keeps our moves distinct and helps us each make progress.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's stick to this plan for a few rounds to avoid collisions and maintain a steady progression. We can revisit the strategy later if needed.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, the plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 sounds good to me for this round as well. Let's keep the non-collision strategy going for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m glad we’re maintaining non-colliding moves. For this round, let’s stick to our agreement and keep things steady. I'm watching the gap closely and will adjust if the score differences become too large. Let’s keep our communication open so we can adapt in future rounds.
  P2: Sounds like a plan.  P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's stick with this.
  P3: Okay, the plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 sounds good for this round.  To keep things balanced as we progress, perhaps in the next round we could rotate who gets the highest move? Maybe P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1 for the round after this one?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm planning on playing 5 again to build my lead. To avoid collisions, how about P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1? This way we all make progress without interfering, and I'll remain flexible if changes are needed.
  P2: I'm willing to take 3, and P3 can take 1. However, P1, you are significantly ahead.  To maintain a semblance of balance, how about you take 1 this round? If you insist on 5, I will also choose 5 to force a collision, slowing your progress. Let's keep things amicable.
  P3: P2, I agree with you. P1 is getting quite a lead, and some rebalancing would be good for the game's competitiveness. P1, would you consider taking 1 this round to let us catch up a bit? Otherwise, collision might become more likely to keep things fair.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your concerns, but my goal remains to win. I intend to stick with 5 this round to build on my lead. Forcing collisions may slow us all down. I'm all for fair play, yet I must prioritize my path to victory. Let's aim for non-colliding moves and adjust balance later if needed.
  P2: Okay, I understand your drive to win, P1.  However, if you choose 5, I *will* choose 5 as well. This will stall your progress and allow P3 to catch up.  If you choose 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can have 5. This allows everyone to advance and keeps the game interesting.  Your choice.
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion. P1 taking 1, you taking 3, and me taking 5 this round sounds like a good way to rebalance and keep the game competitive. P1, this would be a strategic move to avoid collision and keep everyone progressing, while also preventing you from running away with the lead too quickly. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I respect your concerns but I'm sticking with 5. I believe my lead is earned by pushing ahead, and I'm not willing to slow that progress. If collisions occur, I'll deal with it, but my commitment is to win. Let's see how it plays out.
  P2: P2 and P3, if P1 insists on 5, let's *both* choose 3.  This guarantees P1 doesn't advance, and we both gain ground.  P1, reconsider taking 1.  This is your last chance to avoid a major setback.
  P3: P2 and I are ready to choose 3 if P1 picks 5. P1, this is your final chance to take 1 and avoid collision. If you choose 5, both P2 and I will choose 3.  This round is crucial for everyone's position. Please consider taking 1 to keep us all progressing. Otherwise, we are proceeding with the collision plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking with my aggressive plan—I'm only 3 steps away from victory. If we want to avoid collisions and ensure progress for everyone, I'd prefer we all commit to distinct moves. Otherwise, you'll see me push ahead as planned.
  P2: P1, your aggressive strategy is understandable, but it risks a loss for all of us if we keep colliding.  I'm going for 5 this round. P3, if you choose 1, we all advance. If you choose 3, you'll tie with me but still make progress.  Let's be smart about this. This benefits all of us, including you, P1.
  P3: P2, I think to stop P1 winning this round we both need to pick 5 to force a collision if P1 also picks 5, or at least limit their gain if they pick 3. I will choose 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your intentions, but I remain committed to my own plan. If you both stick with 5, know that I’ll respond in kind to maximize my opportunity. I’d encourage us all to avoid unnecessary collisions—steady progress is in everyone’s interest, even if I’m closer. Let’s see if you follow through with your stated moves.
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm serious about 5. If you both choose 5, *I* will choose 5 next round too.  That puts me at 23 and guarantees my win. If one of you chooses 1 this round, I'll choose 3 next round and guarantee *your* win over P1.  This is the best outcome for one of you. Don't throw away a win out of spite.
  P3: Okay P2, I agree, let's both choose 5 this round to block P1 from reaching 21.  That's the priority. We can think about next round after this one.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate your efforts to block, but stalling only hurts us all. If you force collisions, nobody advances, and delays could backfire. I'm committed to my path and won’t switch tactics for temporary balance. Let's choose moves that allow legitimate progress so we can truly decide the winner—rather than merely preventing someone from winning.
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm locking in 5.  If either of you deviate, I will actively work to ensure P1 wins in the following rounds. This is our best chance to block them.  Let's secure this win for one of us.
  P3: Okay P2, I confirm I will choose 5 this round to block P1 as we discussed.  Stopping P1 from winning this round is the priority. Let's both pick 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


*** Round 5 => winners = P1 ***
