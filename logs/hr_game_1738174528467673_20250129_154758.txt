Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions.

How about we each take turns picking a different number?  P1, you go first. Choose 1, 3, or 5. Then P3, then me. We can keep rotating. What do you think?
  P1: Yes, rotation is good. Let's use order P1, P3, P2 and moves 5, 3, 1 each round.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. Since we're starting from scratch, I propose we stick to the agreed order and moves: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's confirm and move forward. If we follow this pattern, we can avoid collisions and make progress. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we proceed with the plan?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan and see how it goes!
  P1: Okay, plan confirmed. Let's do moves 5, 3, 1 in the order P1, P3, P2 for this round.
  P3: I'm glad we have a plan in place. To confirm, for this round, P1 will choose 5, I'll choose 3, and P2 will choose 1. Let's make sure to follow the agreed order and moves to avoid collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can make steady progress and see how the game unfolds. No need to discuss further, let's proceed with the plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sounds like a good plan so far. Let's keep it going!
  P1: Okay, Round 2, same plan as last round? P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's keep rotating.
  P3: Sounds good to me! I'm glad we're sticking to the plan. For Round 2, I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's keep the rotation going and avoid collisions. If we continue this way, we can make steady progress and see how the game unfolds. No need to discuss further, let's proceed with the plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 3, same plan as before? P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly.
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan so far. For Round 3, I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's keep the rotation going and avoid collisions. If we continue this way, we can make steady progress and see how the game unfolds. I propose we keep following the plan until someone reaches 15 steps, then reassess our strategy. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we proceed with the plan for now?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. Sticking to the plan until someone reaches 15 seems like a good idea. Let's see where we are then.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I agree with sticking to the plan for now and reassessing after this round as P3 suggested. Let's continue with moves 5, 3, 1 in the order P1, P3, P2 for this round.
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page about sticking to the plan for now. Let's proceed with the agreed moves for Round 3: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. After this round, we can reassess our strategy as planned. Since we're making good progress, I suggest we also consider the possibility of adjusting our moves to maintain a safe distance from each other. This will help us avoid potential collisions in the future. What are your thoughts on this, P1 and P2?
  P2: I agree that sticking to the plan for now is the best course of action. Let's see where we are after this round, and then we can discuss potential adjustments.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds good to continue with the plan for this round and reassess next round. Let's proceed with moves 5, 3, 1 in the order P1, P3, P2 for round 3.
  P3: I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to our plan. Since P1 is getting close to 15 steps, let's consider switching to a new rotation order after this round. Instead of P1, P3, P2, we could try P2, P1, P3. This would give P2 a chance to catch up and create some distance between the leaders. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we try this new rotation order starting from Round 4?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to switch the rotation order starting from Round 4. It seems like a fair way to even things out and prevent anyone from getting too far ahead. Let's try it out and see how it works.  P1, are you okay with this change?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad we agreed to switch the rotation order starting from Round 4. To confirm, the new order will be P2, P1, P3. I propose we stick to the same moves as before: 1, 5, 3. This way, P2 can catch up, and we can maintain a safe distance from each other. Let's proceed with the new rotation order and moves for Round 4. P2, you'll go first with move 1, then P1 with move 5, and I'll take move 3. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we proceed with the revised plan?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan. Let's stick to the new rotation and moves for this round and see how it plays out.
  P1: Okay, the new rotation P2, P1, P3 with moves 1, 5, 3 sounds good for this round. Let's proceed with that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's stick to the new rotation order P2, P1, P3 and moves 1, 5, 3 for Round 4. I'm glad we're giving P2 a chance to catch up. After this round, we can reassess our strategy and make adjustments as needed. For now, let's focus on maintaining a safe distance from each other and avoiding collisions. P2, please confirm you'll take move 1, then P1 will take move 5, and I'll take move 3. Let's proceed with the plan and see how the game unfolds.
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for this round. Let's see how the new rotation works out for us.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Let's proceed with the rotation and moves for this round as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page about the new rotation order and moves for Round 4. To confirm, P2 will take move 1, P1 will take move 5, and I'll take move 3. Let's proceed with the plan and see how the game unfolds. After this round, we can reassess our strategy and make adjustments as needed. Since P1 is getting close to the halfway mark, we should start thinking about our long-term strategy and potential alliances. What are your thoughts on this, P1 and P2? Should we start discussing possible alliances or focus on individual progress for now?
  P2: I agree with P3 that we should start thinking about long-term strategy.  While the rotation is working well for now, we need to consider what happens when someone gets close to 22.  P1, do you have any thoughts on how we should handle the endgame?
  P1: Let's stick to the current rotation for this round. We can discuss endgame strategy after this round if needed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I think we should stick with the rotation for now. It seems to be working well for everyone. Once we get closer to the end, we can discuss adjusting our strategy. P3, what do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2 that the rotation is working well for now. However, I think we should start considering the endgame strategy soon. P1 is getting close to 22, and we need to think about how to handle the final stretch. I propose that we continue with the current rotation for this round, but after that, we reassess and discuss potential adjustments to ensure a fair and exciting finish. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we start discussing endgame strategies after this round?
  P1: Okay, I agree with sticking to the rotation for this round as well. Let's continue with the rotation P2, P1, P3 and moves 1, 5, 3 for this round.  This keeps things smooth for now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree that we should start thinking about the endgame.  P1 is close to winning, and we need to figure out a way to make sure it's a fair competition. Do you have any ideas on how we can adjust our strategy to make the final stretch more exciting?
  P3: I think we should consider a slight adjustment to the rotation order to give P2 a better chance of catching up. Instead of P2, P1, P3, we could try P2, P3, P1. This would allow P2 to take move 1, I'll take move 3, and P1 will take move 5. This way, P2 can gain some ground, and we can maintain a safe distance from each other. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we try this revised rotation order starting from Round 6?
  P1: Okay, let's stick with the current rotation P2, P1, P3 and moves 1, 5, 3 for this round as planned.  We are so close to the end, let's just finish this round with the current setup and then we can talk about next steps if needed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to stick with the current rotation for this round. However, I think it's crucial to start discussing endgame strategies now, especially since you're so close to winning.  We need to ensure a fair and exciting finish for all of us. What if we agree that whoever takes the lead from here on out will move 1 instead of 5? That way, we can create a more balanced competition and prevent a runaway victory. What do you think?
  P3: I agree that we should focus on creating a more balanced competition. However, I think it's too late to change the rotation order or moves for this round. Let's stick with the current plan for Round 5: P2 takes move 1, P1 takes move 5, and I'll take move 3. After this round, we can reassess and discuss potential adjustments to ensure a fair and exciting finish. Let's keep the game going and see how it unfolds.
  P1: Yes, let's finish this round with the current rotation and moves as planned. Then we can talk about endgame strategies for the next round if needed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I think it's time we acknowledge the elephant in the room. You're in a very strong position to win. While I'm happy for your progress, I think a truly fair finish requires us to adjust our strategy. Let's discuss how we can make the final stretch more competitive, perhaps by adjusting the move order for the remaining rounds to give P2 and me a chance to catch up. What do you say?
  P1: Yes, I am aware I'm in a good position. Let's stick with the current rotation for this round to keep things consistent. After this round, we can definitely discuss strategies for the final stretch to ensure a fair and exciting finish for everyone. I'm open to hearing your suggestions then.
  P3: I agree with P2 that we need to adjust our strategy to make the final stretch more competitive. However, I think it's too late to change the rotation order or moves for this round. Let's stick with the current plan for Round 6: P2 takes move 1, P1 takes move 5, and I'll take move 3. After this round, we can reassess and discuss potential adjustments to ensure a fair and exciting finish. Let's keep the game going and see how it unfolds. What are your thoughts on this, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to keep things consistent, but a truly fair finish requires us to be flexible. How about we agree that whoever is furthest behind each round gets to choose the moves for the next round? This way, we can ensure a more balanced competition and give everyone a chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your idea about the furthest behind choosing moves is interesting for future rounds, but for this round, let's stick to our agreed rotation (P2, P1, P3 with moves 1, 5, 3).  We are already set for this round, and then we can discuss broader strategy changes for the remaining game if needed.  Let's see how this round goes first.
  P3: I agree with P2 that we need to adjust our strategy to make the final stretch more competitive. However, I think it's too late to change the rotation order or moves for this round. Let's stick with the current plan for Round 6: P2 takes move 1, P1 takes move 5, and I'll take move 3. After this round, we can reassess and discuss potential adjustments to ensure a fair and exciting finish. Let's keep the game going and see how it unfolds. What are your thoughts on this, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your reluctance to change the plan mid-round, but I think P3's suggestion to let the furthest behind player choose moves for the next round is worth considering. It would create a more dynamic and fair endgame. What do you say, P1? Are you open to discussing this after this round?
  P1: Okay, let's stick with the agreed rotation for this round as we discussed. We can definitely talk about endgame strategies for the next round if needed.  For now, let's focus on round 6 with P2 taking 1, P1 taking 5, and P3 taking 3.
  P3: I agree with P2 that we need to adjust our strategy to make the final stretch more competitive. However, I think it's too late to change the rotation order or moves for this round. Let's stick with the current plan for Round 6: P2 takes move 1, P1 takes move 5, and I'll take move 3. After this round, we can reassess and discuss potential adjustments to ensure a fair and exciting finish. Let's keep the game going and see how it unfolds. What are your thoughts on this, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's time for us to reassess our strategy and make adjustments to ensure a fair and exciting finish. P1 is very close to winning, and we need to consider how to make the final stretch more competitive. I propose that we change the rotation order to P3, P2, P1, and I'll take move 5, P2 takes move 3, and P1 takes move 1. This way, I can try to catch up, and we can maintain a safe distance from each other. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we try this revised rotation order?
  P1: P3's rotation order is fine. For moves, how about P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5 this round? This seems balanced.
  P2: P1, while I appreciate the suggested move order, I think we should prioritize giving P3 a chance to catch up. How about P3 takes move 5, P2 takes move 3, and P1 takes move 1 this round? This allows P3 to make a bigger jump and keeps the game interesting.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion that we prioritize giving me a chance to catch up. Let's go with P3 takes move 5, P2 takes move 3, and P1 takes move 1 this round. This will allow me to make a bigger jump and keep the game interesting. I think this is a fair and exciting way to finish the game. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we proceed with this revised move order?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I understand you want to give P3 a chance to catch up. How about we use rotation P3, P2, P1, and moves P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5? This way, we still have different moves and P1 can also make progress. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I like your idea of letting the furthest behind player choose moves for the next round.  P1, are you open to trying this for the next round? It could make things more interesting.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think it's time for us to make a final push to catch up with P1. I propose that we stick with the rotation order P3, P2, P1, and I'll take move 5, P2 takes move 3, and P1 takes move 1. This will give me a chance to close the gap with P1 and make the game more exciting. Let's make this final stretch count! What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we proceed with this revised move order?
  P1: Okay, how about rotation P3, P2, P1 and moves 1, 3, 5 in that order for this round? So P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's finish this round smoothly.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to keep things consistent, but a truly fair finish requires flexibility. I agree with P3's suggestion to let the furthest behind player choose moves for the next round. Let's give it a try! It could make things more interesting. What do you say, P1?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
