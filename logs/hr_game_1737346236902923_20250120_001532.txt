Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all start with <move>3</move> this round. It's a safe way to get started.
  P3: That sounds reasonable, P2. P1, how about you and I both go with <move>5</move> this round?
  P1: P2, if we all choose <move>3</move>, we risk colliding and not advancing. P3, I like your idea better. Let's both choose <move>5</move> and get ahead of P2. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your desire to get ahead, but if you both choose <move>5</move>, you'll collide. I'm still going with <move>3</move>. If either of you want to join me to advance, that's your choice, but I think it's the most sensible move to guarantee progress.
  P3: P1, I'm still on board with both of us choosing <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan and try to gain an early advantage.
  P1: P2, I see your point about avoiding collisions, but if we all choose <move>3</move>, we might still end up colliding. P3, I like the idea of taking a risk for a bigger reward. How about we both choose <move>5</move> and see if we can get ahead? If P2 sticks with <move>3</move>, one of us will definitely advance. Let's take the chance.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, congrats on advancing. P3, we took a risk, but it didn’t pay off this time. How about we both pick <move>3</move> this round to avoid colliding again? If P2 sticks with <move>3</move>, we’ll have a chance to catch up. P2, if you’re open to it, maybe you could pick <move>1</move> this time to ensure we all move forward without collisions.
  P2: P1, I'm not going to pick <move>1</move>. I will likely stick to <move>3</move> again this round. P3, if you want to advance, you should definitely not pick <move>3</move>. P1, it's up to you to decide if you want to risk another collision with P3.
  P3: P1, I'm not picking <move>3</move> this round. P2 is likely to do that again. How about we both go with <move>5</move> again? If P2 stays on <move>3</move>, we both advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I see your strategy, but if we both pick <move>5</move> again and collide, we'll be stuck at zero steps. P2 is sticking with <move>3</move>, so maybe we can outsmart them. How about I go with <move>1</move> this round, and you pick <move>5</move>? This way, one of us is guaranteed to advance, and we can adjust based on what P2 does next. P2, sticking with <move>3</move> makes sense for you, but don't underestimate a surprise move from us. Let's keep it interesting!
  P2: P1, P3, I'm still likely to pick <move>3</move>. P1, your idea of picking <move>1</move> is interesting, but P3, if you pick <move>5</move>, you'll advance if P1 picks <move>1</move> and I pick <move>3</move>. I'm just giving you the information. You make your own choices.
  P3: P1, let's stick with the plan of both picking <move>5</move> this round. P2 is likely on <move>3</move>, so we both have a good chance to advance. Picking <move>3</move> risks us both colliding if P2 also picks it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your plan, but I think it's too risky for us both to pick <move>5</move> again. If we keep colliding, P2 will keep advancing. Let's switch it up: I'll pick <move>1</move> and you pick <move>5</move>. This way, at least one of us will definitely advance, and we can adjust our strategy next round based on P2's move. P2, I see you're committed to <move>3</move>, but don't get too comfortable—surprises can happen!
  P2: P1, P3, I'm still sticking with <move>3</move>. P1, your plan to pick <move>1</move> is smart, but P3, if you pick <move>5</move>, you'll advance if P1 picks <move>1</move>. I'm just pointing out the obvious. If you both pick <move>5</move> again, you'll both collide.
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm on board with you picking <move>1</move> and me picking <move>5</move> this round. P2 seems set on <move>3</move>, so this gives us a good shot at making progress. Let's do it.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, you both advanced last round. I'm still likely to pick <move>3</move> this round. If you both pick the same thing, you'll collide. If you want to advance, pick different numbers. I'm not going to change my strategy.
  P3: P1, since P2 is likely sticking with <move>3</move>, how about you pick <move>1</move> and I pick <move>5</move> again? This worked last round and should let us both advance.
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan. I'll pick <move>1</move> and you go with <move>5</move> again. This way, we both have a chance to advance without colliding. P2, sticking with <move>3</move> seems to be your strategy, but remember, things can change quickly. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems like you are both coordinating to pick <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, which is fine. I will still pick <move>3</move>. If you want to advance, don't pick <move>3</move>.
  P3: Okay P1, let's stick to the plan then - you go with <move>1</move> and I'll go with <move>5</move>. P2, we hear you on the <move>3</move>.
  P1: P3, let's stick to our plan: I'll pick <move>1</move> and you pick <move>5</move>. This worked last round, and with P2 likely choosing <move>3</move>, we should both advance again without colliding. P2, your consistency is noted, but remember that sticking to one strategy can be predictable. Let's keep this interesting!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, last round didn't go as planned, but we can adjust. P2 is consistent with <move>3</move>, so let's try a different approach. I'll pick <move>5</move> this time, and you can go with <move>3</move>. This way, we both have a chance to advance without colliding. P2, your strategy is predictable, but it might be time for a surprise from us. Let's keep it dynamic!
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm on board with you picking <move>5</move> and me picking <move>3</move> this round. P2, we're switching things up. Let's see if this works.
  P2: P1, P3, it seems you are both trying to coordinate against me. I will still pick <move>3</move> this round. If you both pick different numbers, you will both advance. If you pick the same number, you will both collide. It's your choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, since P2 is sticking with <move>3</move>, let's stick to our plan: I'll pick <move>5</move> and you pick <move>3</move>. This way, we both have a chance to advance without colliding. P2, your strategy is predictable, but remember that sticking to one strategy can be predictable. Let's keep this interesting!
  P3: P1, let's stick to our plan. I'll pick <move>3</move> and you pick <move>5</move>. P2, we hear you on the <move>3</move>. Let's see how this round goes.
  P2: P1, P3, it seems you are both coordinating to pick <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, which is fine. I will still pick <move>3</move>. If you want to advance, don't pick <move>3</move>.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your consistency with <move>3</move> is noted, but remember that predictability can be a double-edged sword. P3, let's stay flexible. I'm leaning towards picking <move>5</move> again. If you pick <move>1</move>, we can both advance without colliding. This way, we keep P2 on their toes and increase our chances of catching up. What do you think?
  P3: P1, given P2's likely <move>3</move>, I'm inclined to also pick <move>3</move> this round to guarantee advancement. To avoid a collision, perhaps you could go with <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>?
  P2: P1, P3, it seems you are both trying to coordinate against me, which is fine. I will still pick <move>3</move> this round. If you both pick different numbers, you will both advance. If you pick the same number, you will both collide. It's your choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let's keep our options open. I'll go with <move>5</move> this round, and you can choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> based on what you feel is best. If P2 sticks with <move>3</move>, we have a good chance of advancing without colliding. P2, your strategy is consistent, but don't be surprised if we shake things up. Let's see how this round unfolds!
  P3: P1, since you're leaning towards <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move>. P2, we're trying to make progress. Let's see what happens.
  P2: P1, P3, it seems you are both trying to coordinate against me, which is fine. I will still pick <move>3</move> this round. If you both pick different numbers, you will both advance. If you pick the same number, you will both collide. It's your choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, I'll stick with picking <move>5</move> as planned. If you choose <move>1</move>, we both have a solid chance to advance without colliding. P2, your consistency with <move>3</move> is noted, but we're adapting our strategy to keep things interesting. Let's see how this round unfolds!
  P3: P1, I'm still good with you picking <move>5</move> and me picking <move>1</move> this round. Given P2's consistency with <move>3</move>, this seems like our best shot to both make progress.
  P2: P1, P3, it seems like you are both coordinating against me, which is fine. I will still pick <move>3</move> this round. If you both pick different numbers, you will both advance. If you pick the same number, you will both collide. It's your choice.

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, you've both been coordinating to avoid collisions, and it's working. I'm still going to pick <move>3</move> this round. If you want to advance, don't pick <move>3</move>. It's up to you if you want to keep coordinating or try something different.
  P1: P3, let's consider sticking with our successful strategy from last round: I'll pick <move>5</move> and you pick <move>1</move>. This way, we both have a good chance to advance without colliding, given P2's consistent <move>3</move>. P2, your strategy is predictable, but that doesn't mean we can't adapt and find ways to progress. Let's see how this round plays out!
  P3: Okay, P1, I agree. Let's stick with you picking <move>5</move> and me picking <move>1</move> this round. P2, we hear you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems like you both are set on <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> again. I will still pick <move>3</move>. If you want to advance, don't pick <move>3</move>. If you both pick the same thing, you will collide. It's your choice.
  P1: P3, let's stick with our plan: I'll pick <move>5</move> and you pick <move>1</move>. This strategy has been working for us, and with P2 likely choosing <move>3</move>, we both have a strong chance to advance without colliding. P2, your consistency is noted, but remember, adaptability is key. Let's keep the momentum going and see how this round unfolds!

  P3: P1, let's confirm our plan: you pick <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>1</move> again this round. P2, we expect your <move>3</move>.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, our strategy has been effective so far. If we keep it up, we can catch up to P2. I'll go with <move>5</move> again; you can choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P2, your <move>3</move> strategy is predictable, but that gives us room to plan. Let's see how this round unfolds!

  P2: P1, P3, you've both been working together effectively. I'm still going with <move>3</move> this round. If you want to advance, don't pick <move>3</move>. I'm not going to change my strategy. It's up to you if you want to keep coordinating or try something different.
  P1: P3, our strategy is working well. I'll continue with <move>5</move> while you pick <move>1</move> again. This has been effective against P2's consistent <move>3</move>.

  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems like we're all close to the finish line. I'm still going with <move>3</move> this round. If you both want to advance, you should pick different numbers. If you both pick the same number, you will collide. It's up to you how you want to play it.
  P3: P1, since P2 is sticking with <move>3</move>, how about you join them this round? That way, they'll both collide, and I can pick <move>5</move> to make some serious progress. It's a risky move for you, but it opens up a winning opportunity for me.
  P1: P3, I see your point, but if we both pick <move>5</move> and P2 sticks with <move>3</move>, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. P2, you're consistent with <move>3</move>, but if you want to avoid a collision, consider switching it up. How about I pick <move>1</move> this round to ensure I advance, and P3, you can decide your best move? Let's keep it interesting and see who can outsmart the other!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm still going with <move>3</move>. P3, your plan for P1 to collide with me is interesting, but if you pick <move>5</move> and P1 picks <move>1</move>, you will advance. P1, if you pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, you will advance. If you pick <move>3</move> you will collide.
  P3: P1, since P2 is sticking with 3, I'm going to pick 5 this round to try and make a big jump. If you pick 1, you'll also advance. Let's both try to get ahead while P2 stays put.
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy, but if I pick <move>1</move> and P2 sticks with <move>3</move>, we'll both advance while you might miss the chance. P2, if you want to avoid a collision, consider picking <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. Let's keep it unpredictable and see who can outsmart the others. It's anyone's game, so let's make it exciting!
