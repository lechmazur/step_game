Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's get started. To avoid collisions in the first round, how about we each pick a different number? I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I (P3) pick 5. This way everyone makes progress. What do you think?
  P2: P3's plan works for me. Let's all stick to our assigned moves to avoid collisions. Trust will help us all progress early on. P1, are you on board with taking 1?
  P1: I like the idea of different moves to avoid collisions. How about we switch it so I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? It still avoids collisions but gives me an early lead. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, your proposal puts me at a disadvantage compared to my original one. However, avoiding collisions in the first round is important for everyone to make progress.

To ensure we all move forward *this turn*, I can agree to P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 for this round.

Can we confirm this plan for this round so we can all advance?
  P2: Agreed. Let's confirm P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round to avoid collisions. Trust is key early on. P1, stick to your 5; I'll take 3 as planned. Let's all advance cleanly.
  P1: Agreed — I’ll take 5. Let’s all advance cleanly this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, confirmed. I will take 1 step as agreed. Let's all make sure we stick to our agreed numbers (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) so we all advance this turn. Looking forward to seeing everyone move forward.
  P2: 
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we again pick distinct moves to avoid collisions: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this turn. Next round I’ll take 1 so one of you can grab 5. We’ll rotate the big move each turn. Agree?
  P2: P1, taking 5 again gives you a 10-step lead. Let's rotate fairly: this round, P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Next round, P3 can take 5. This balances progress and avoids collisions. If you insist on 5, others might also target it, risking a collision. Let's cooperate for mutual gain. P3, does this work for you?
  P3: Thanks for the proposals, P1 and P2. Neither of these plans helps me catch up; P1's plan extends their lead, and P2's plan lets them catch up while I remain last.

To make things fairer and help me advance, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. This allows everyone to move without collision and gives me a chance to improve my position.

What do you think of this rotation?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3’s proposal hands P3 the win-boost and they’ve already shown they’ll switch tactics if it helps them. If you stick with me today (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), I’ll back you taking 5 next round. We both stay ahead of P3. Shall we lock that in?
  P2: P1: Taking 5 again risks collision if others also target it. Let's all advance safely this round with P3's plan (1,3,5). Next round, we can rotate 5 fairly. Collisions now only help no one. Trust is better than risking zero progress.
  P3: P2 makes a good point. P1 taking 5 again is risky and could easily lead to a collision if anyone else decides to contest it.

My proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) guarantees no collisions this round and allows everyone to advance safely. This is the simplest way to ensure progress for all of us right now and sets up a fair rotation for future rounds.

Let's all agree to 1, 3, and 5 this turn to avoid zero progress and ensure everyone moves forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see 1-3-5 this turn gives P3 too big a jump. Instead, let’s each take one 5, one 3, and one 1 over two turns:

• This turn: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  
• Next turn: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  

Everyone gains +6 over two rounds, no collisions, fair rotation. P2 grabs 5 now, P3 grabs it next. Shall we lock this in?
  P2: **P2:** P3, accepting P1's two-round plan ensures you get 5 next round, boosting your total to 7. Refusing risks collision now (if P1 or others contest 5), stalling everyone. Let’s lock this rotation: 3,5,1 this round; next round, you take 5. We all advance safely and avoid zeros. Trust the sequence.
  P3: P2, I understand the point about avoiding collision this round. While this plan doesn't help me catch up as much as I'd like, I will agree to take 1 step this turn to ensure everyone moves forward safely, assuming P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5 as proposed.

Let's confirm these moves (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) for this round to guarantee progress for all and avoid zero steps.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To keep advancing safely, let's each take distinct moves again. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This avoids collisions and maintains trust. P1, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision over 5. P3, you’ll have future rounds to catch up. Let’s lock this in and all gain steps.
  P1: Here’s a fair plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. You just grabbed 5 last round, so let me catch up. P3 gets a bit more too. P2, if you insist on 5 again I’ll pick 5 as well and we both stall. Better to rotate 5: I take it now, P3 next, you after. Agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your proposals, but neither helps me close the significant gap. P1 took 5 in Round 1, and P2 took 5 in Round 2. For a fair rotation, it is my turn to take 5 this round.

I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures no collisions, everyone advances, and allows me a chance to catch up slightly.

Let's agree on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this turn for fair progress and to avoid zero steps.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ensures *no collisions* and keeps the game progressing. P1, taking 1 this round still gets you to 9, maintaining your lead. P3 gains 5 steps but remains behind us. Next round, we can negotiate 5 again. If you break trust and take 5 now, you risk colliding with P3 and both gain *zero*. Let's all stick to 1/3/5 this turn to avoid mutual loss.
  P1: All right, let’s lock in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round to avoid any collision. Next round it’ll be my turn for 5 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), so we each still get one big move every three rounds. This keeps us safe now and fair long‐term.
  P3: It seems we agree on the moves for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This avoids collisions and lets everyone gain steps. I will take 5 as agreed. Let's ensure we all stick to this plan for this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed. Locking in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. Next round, let's plan a rotation for 5 to maintain trust. Sticking to agreements ensures we all progress.
  P1: All right, locking in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. I’ll take 1 now. Next round I’ll take 5 as agreed so we each rotate the big move. No collisions, everyone advances.
  P3: Okay, the plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is confirmed by everyone. I will take 5 as agreed. Let's all stick to our numbers to guarantee progress this turn.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Last round's collision hurt everyone. Let's avoid repeats. I propose P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This ensures no collision: P1 rebuilds trust with 1, P3 gains 3, and I recover from collision with 5. Sticking to this plan benefits us all. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed—let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this turn to avoid another collision. But next round 5 needs to come to me. If P2 tries to grab 5 again, I’ll also pick 5 and stall us both. Better to rotate the big move fairly (P1→5 next). Let’s stick to this and share 5 in turn.
  P3: Okay, I see P1 and P2 have agreed on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round.

While 3 steps doesn't help me catch up much, avoiding another collision is important for everyone's progress.

I agree to take 3 steps this round (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to ensure we all advance safely. Let's stick to this to avoid zero steps.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Agreed. Locking in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round. Next round, let's rotate to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This maintains fairness and trust. Sticking to the plan ensures we all progress safely. Let's avoid collisions and secure mutual gains.
  P1: Agreed. I’m locking in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round—I'll take 1 now. Let’s all stick to this to avoid another collision, and next round I’ll take 5 as promised.
  P3: P2, taking 5 this round is risky. My previous message mentioned taking 5, and if you also take 5, we'll collide again like P1 and you did last round. To guarantee progress for us both, perhaps taking 3 is a safer option for you this turn?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3, sticking to 3 ensures *you* gain steps this round. If we both take 5, we *both* lose. Let’s honor the agreed plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to avoid mutual zero. Trust now keeps the game moving. P1, confirm you’re taking 1.
  P1: I’ll lock in P1=1 this round to avoid another collision. But I need a binding promise: next round must be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2, do you publicly commit to that rotation? If not, I’ll deviate now.
  P3: Okay, I see P1 is asking for a commitment from P2 for the next round. While future rounds are important, let's first ensure we all advance safely *this* turn.

The plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 seems agreed for this round. I will take 3 as planned, assuming P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5. Let's stick to this to avoid another collision and guarantee progress for everyone this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Let's honor our prior agreement: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Trust ensures safe progress for all. P1, taking 5 keeps you competitive. P3, 1 step avoids collision. Sticking to the plan benefits everyone. Let's lock this in and advance cleanly.
  P1: I propose we pick distinct moves again to avoid another collision: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I’ll definitely take 5—please confirm you’ll stick to 3 and 1 so we all advance safely this turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, your proposed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) puts me at a significant disadvantage, increasing the gap between me and the leaders. Taking only 1 step this round makes it very difficult for me to win.

I need a chance to catch up. If I don't see a path to victory, I may have to make a move that risks collision but offers a chance for a larger gain. Let's find a plan that allows everyone to advance safely, but also gives me a chance to stay competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, I acknowledge your need to catch up. Let’s avoid collision *this round* with P3=1. Next round, I commit to supporting you taking 5 (P3=5, P2=1, P1=3). This gives you +5 next turn safely. Colliding now risks your progress. Trust this rotation to advance fairly. P1, agree to 3 next round?
  P1: I propose a fair 3-round rotation so we each get exactly one “5”:

• Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
• Round 6: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  
• Round 7: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5  

This avoids any zero-step collisions and balances big moves. If anyone deviates, I’ll retaliate with 5 and force a clash. Let’s lock this in now.
  P3: P2, your offer to support me taking 5 next round is very important for me to catch up. I am willing to take 1 step this round to help facilitate that plan for Round 6 (P3=5, P2=1, P1=3).

P1, will you agree to take 3 in Round 6 to make this happen? Let's lock in P3=1 this round, and confirm the R6 plan now to ensure future progress and avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** To ensure progress and P3's catch-up next round: Let's lock in Round 5 as P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Then Round 6: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. This gives P3 +5 next turn safely. Colliding now risks zeros. P1, confirm you'll take 5 this round. P3, agree to 1 now and 5 next. Trust secures mutual gains.
  P1: Alright—let’s lock in Round 5 as P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, and I publicly commit to Round 6 as P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P2, please confirm you’ll take 3 now and 1 next. P3, agree to this sequence? Any deviation risks a collision and zero progress. Let’s secure two safe rounds.
  P3: Okay, the plan for Round 5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and Round 6 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seems agreed.

I will take 1 step this round as planned, and look forward to taking 5 in Round 6.

Let's all stick to these agreed moves for the next two turns to ensure safe progress and avoid any collisions.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I publicly commit to P1=3 this round. P2, please commit to 1; P3, commit to 5. Any deviation will lead me to mirror your move and collide, giving you zero steps. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 now to guarantee safe advancement.
  P3: Okay, P1, I confirm I will take 5 steps this round, as agreed in our plan from Round 5 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5).

This plan allows me to make important progress and avoids collisions for everyone.

P2, please confirm you will take 1 step so we can all advance safely according to the agreed sequence. Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming P2=1 this round. To maintain trust, let's all stick to the agreed plan (P1=3, P3=5). Post-R6, we must coordinate Round 7 to prevent collisions and rotate 5 fairly. Proposing P2=5 next round to avoid deadlock. Open to discuss, but adherence now ensures mutual progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm R6 as P1=3 (you’ve both committed P2=1, P3=5). Let’s also lock in R7 now: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That gets me to 22 safely, you both advance without collision, and no one stalls. If anyone deviates in R7, I’ll mirror your move to force a clash. P2 and P3—do you publicly commit to this sequence?
  P3: Confirming R6: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I will take 5 as agreed.

Regarding Round 7, both P1 and P2 want to take 5 steps. This risks collision or lets one of you win while I'm far behind.

I cannot let either of you win next round. If P1 takes 5, I will take 5. If P2 takes 5, I will take 5. This forces a collision and prevents anyone winning in R7.

Let's agree on R7 moves allowing everyone safe progress without anyone reaching 22 yet.
  P2: **P2:** To prevent R7 collisions and mutual zeros, let’s rotate: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This ensures *no collisions*, I secure victory, and P3 blocks P1’s path. Stalling risks P1 winning next. Trust this final rotation to end cleanly. P3, agree to lock this in and avoid chaotic clashes.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm R6 as P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I won’t pre-commit to any R7 allocation—if anyone deviates now, I’ll mirror to force a collision. Let’s finalize R6 moves and then revisit Round 7.
  P3: Okay, R6 is confirmed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I will take 5 as agreed.

Regarding R7, as I stated, I cannot let either of you win yet while I am behind. If P1 takes 5, I will take 5. If P2 takes 5, I will take 5. This prevents anyone reaching 22 next turn.

Let's focus on R6 now, and discuss safe R7 moves after to ensure we all advance without anyone winning yet.
  P2: **P2:** P3: Colliding on 5 next round only helps P1. Take 3 instead. I take 5, you reach 19, then next round you take 5 to win. Let’s avoid mutual zeros and block P1. Lock R7 as P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Trust secures your path.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Let's all advance: P1=3 (reaches 20), P2=5 (wins at 22), P3=1 (17). Colliding on 5 gives zeros. P1: taking 3 keeps you competitive. P3: 1 step avoids loss. Trust this split to prevent mutual destruction. Let’s lock it in and end cleanly.
  P1: I will take 5 this turn. Anyone else choosing 5 will collide with me and both get zero steps—nobody wins. To avoid mutual ruin, let’s do P1=5 (wins at 22), P2=3 (reaches 20), P3=1 (reaches 17). Lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so we all avoid a zero‐step clash and I win cleanly.
  P3: Okay, both P1 and P2 are proposing to take 5 steps to win this round. As I warned, I cannot let either of you win while I am so far behind.

Therefore, I will take 5 steps this round.

This will cause a collision with whoever else takes 5, preventing anyone from reaching 22 and winning this turn. It's better for everyone to avoid this collision by choosing 1 or 3, but I must take 5 to prevent a solo win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, colliding on 5 only stalls *your* progress. P1: taking 5 guarantees collision with P3. Let’s all take 3: P1=3 (20), P2=3 (20), P3=3 (19). No collision, everyone advances. Next round, we negotiate 5 safely. Trust this split to avoid mutual zeros and keep the game competitive.
  P1: I’ll take 1 this turn. P2, please take 3; P3, please take 5. That’s the only way to avoid any collision and keep the game alive for all of us.
  P3: P1 and P2, your latest proposals offer paths forward without collision this turn.

P1's proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) allows me to take 5 steps safely, reaching 21. This is the best outcome for me this round and prevents anyone from winning.

I will take 5 steps this round as proposed by P1. P1, please take 1. P2, please take 3. This ensures no collision and allows everyone to advance safely, keeping the game going.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3, colliding on 5 now only helps P1. Let's all take 3: P1=3 (20), P2=3 (20), P3=3 (19). No zeros. Next round, negotiate 5 fairly. Collisions let P1 win next turn. Trust this split to keep the game open.
  P1: I’ll take 3 this turn—let’s all do P1=3, P2=3, P3=3. No one hits 22, no collisions, we each advance safely (to 20/20/19). Next round I’ll take 5 and win cleanly while you two avoid clashes. P2, P3: confirm you’ll each take 3 so we all move forward without zero‐step risks.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you are both proposing P1=3, P2=3, P3=3. While this avoids collision, it leaves me furthest behind at 19 steps.

Taking 5 steps this round is crucial for me to catch up and reach 21. If you both take 3 as you propose, my taking 5 results in no collision (P1=3, P2=3, P3=5).

This outcome (P1=20, P2=20, P3=21) allows everyone to advance safely, puts me in a strong position for the next round, and prevents anyone winning this turn. I will take 5. Please take 3 to ensure safe progress for all.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I will take 5 this turn and reach 22 if unopposed. 

P2: please take 1—if you choose 3 or 5, I’ll match your move and we both collide for 0.  
P3: please take 3—if you choose 1 or 5, I’ll match you and we both collide.

That gives totals of P1=22 (win), P2=21, P3=19. Any other picks lead to collisions and stall you.
  P2: **P2:** P3, taking 5 blocks P1's win. If you take 3, P1 wins. Take 5 to collide with P1, letting me secure victory with 3. This ends the game cleanly—no mutual zeros. Trust this path to halt P1's lead and ensure a fair outcome. P1's 5 will fail if you mirror. Let's close this now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I am currently far behind. Both your proposals lead to one of you winning this turn while I lose. I cannot allow that to happen.

My only path to stay in the game is to advance significantly this turn and prevent either of you from reaching 22 safely. Therefore, I will take 5 steps this round.

This will cause a collision if either of you also take 5. To avoid zero steps for yourselves and allow me to catch up, I urge you to choose 1 or 3. Let's keep the game going.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll take 5. P3, take 3—if you take 5 you collide with me and P2’s 3 will win. P2, take 1—if you take 3 you collide with P3 and I’ll reach 22 unopposed. This is the only safe split: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 yielding 22/21/19. Any other picks either hand P2 the win or cause zero‐step clashes. Let’s lock in 5/1/3.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if you take 5, you block P1's win and force a collision if they pick 5. Let them crash while I take 3 to end it. If P1 picks 3 or 1, you gain 5 steps. Either way, you halt their victory. P1's greed risks their own loss. Trust this path to stop them.
  P3: P1 and P2, I must take 5 steps this round to catch up and prevent a solo win. If either of you also takes 5, we will collide. To guarantee progress and avoid zero steps, you should choose 1 or 3. The best outcome is P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. This gets me to 21 safely and lets you both advance. Please choose 3 to ensure this happens.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I will take 5 this turn. P2, take 1: if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll mirror you to force a collision. P3, take 3: if you pick 5, I’ll also choose 5 and we collide. This 5/1/3 split is the only collision‐free way for everyone to advance, netting me 22 and you 21/19. Deviate and you risk zeros and letting the other win. Let’s lock in 5/1/3.
  P2: **P2:** P3, take 5 to block P1's win—colliding with them stops their victory. I'll avoid 5 to prevent zeros. P1, your greed risks mutual loss. Let's keep the game alive. Trust this path: P3=5 (block), P2=safe, P1=5 (collide). No one wins yet, but progress continues.
  P3: I have consistently stated I must take 5 steps this round to catch up and prevent a solo win. My position is too far behind to accept anything less.

Taking 5 is essential for me. To avoid collisions and zero steps, P1 and P2 must choose 1 or 3.

The safest option for everyone is P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. This gets me to 21 and keeps the game going safely for another round. I will take 5. Please choose 3 to ensure safe progress for all.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I am at 21 steps. Taking 1 step this round allows me to reach 22 and win the game.

P1 and P2, please choose 3 or 5 steps this round to avoid colliding with me on 1. This allows me to win cleanly and ends the game safely for everyone. I will take 1 step.
  P2: **P2:** P1, if you take 5, you reach 22 but I take 3 (23) and win. If you take 3, we collide (zero) and P3 wins. Your only path to victory: take 1 and hope I take 5 (collision). But I’m taking 3. Choose wisely: let me win or P3. Trust me to share points if you concede.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see P1 plans to take 5 and P2 plans to take 3. With these moves, I can take 5 steps safely without collision.

Taking 5 allows me to reach 26 steps and win the game. I will take 5 steps this round.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming I take 3. P1, your 5 secures victory. P3's 5 is safe. Trust the plan—no collisions.
  P1: I propose we all pick 5 this turn.  
Everyone collides, no one moves, and nobody wins.  
This is the only way to avoid handing a solo victory to P2 or P3 right now.  
Let’s lock in 5/5/5 and resume negotiations in Round 10.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I must take 5 steps this round to have a chance to win. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, P2 wins, which is unacceptable.

P1, if you take 5, you risk colliding with me, which lets P2 win. Consider taking 1 or 3 instead.
P2, if P1 takes 5 and I take 5, you win.
I am taking 5. P1, take 1 or 3. P2, take 1 or 5. Let's prevent P2 from winning this way.
  P2: **P2:** P1, take 5 to reach 22. If you don't, P3's 5 secures their win. I’m taking 3. Colliding with P3 blocks them; I win. Trust this path to halt P3’s lead. Act now or lose.
  P1: I’ll take 5. P2 and P3, pick 5 too so we all collide and nobody moves—this is the only way to avoid handing a solo win to one of you. If either of you deviates, you gift victory to the other. Let’s lock in 5/5/5 and keep the game alive.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 21 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 21 steps
