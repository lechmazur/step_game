Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we all cooperated last round, let's try to keep it going. I'll go for 5 this round, P1 take 3, and P3 take 1.  This way we all make steady progress.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P2, that sounds good to me. I'll take 1 again. P1, please take 3, as P2 suggested. Let's keep cooperating.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, are you going to play or just keep passing?  I'm sticking with the plan, taking 1 this round. P3, you take 3. P1, please take 5.  Let's not throw the game just because you didn't get 5 last round.
  P3: P2, I'll take 3 this round. P1, please take 5. Let's try to get back on track and cooperate.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, if you take 5 this round, I'll let you have 5 next round too and I'll take 3.  That puts you at 15 and me at 7, well ahead of P3.  Let's work together to box out P3 and then we can figure out the end game between us.  Deal?
  P3: P2, that sounds like a good deal. I'll take 5 this round to help box out P1, then we can discuss next steps. P1, please take 1 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, seriously? Stop messing around. Take 5 this round as we discussed. P3, stick with 3.  Let's get this show on the road. I'm getting bored.  If P1 takes 1, then next round I'm taking 5 no matter what.
  P3: P2, I'll take 5 this round as we discussed. P1, please take 1. Let's get this done and move on to the next phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, if you take 1 this round, I'll let you win next round. I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5.  That will put you at 6 and me at 6, with P3 at 7. Then next round, you take 5 and win. I'm serious. This is the best offer you're going to get.
  P3: Okay P2, I'll take 3 this round, as we discussed. P1, please take 1. Let's get this round over with.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, take the deal!  I'm being serious. You win next round. I get second. P3 gets screwed. It's the best outcome for you at this point.  If you don't take it, I'm just going to keep blocking you.  P3, you cool with this plan?
  P3: Okay P2, I'm sticking with 3 this round as planned. P1, please take 1. Let's get this over with.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I took the 1 as promised.  You blew it. Now I'm going for the win.  I'm taking 3. P3, take 5.  P1, you're out of luck. Take 1 if you want to stay alive, but I'm not helping you anymore.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm going to take 1 this round. P1, take 5 if you want to have any chance. P2, you're going to be blocked by both of us if you take 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm going for 3.  P1, if you take 5, we both lose. Take 1 and live to fight another round.  Maybe we can team up against P3 next round.  He's getting too close for comfort.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 1 this round. P1, please take 5. Let's try to block P2 and then figure out our next moves. P2, you're being too aggressive and you're about to get blocked. Let's work together P1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're right, I was too aggressive. Let's reset.  I'll take 5 this round. P3, you take 1. P1, take 3. Then next round, P1 can take 5 to get to 13, I'll take 1 to get to 6, and P3 can take 3 to get to 6. Sound good?  This gets us all moving forward again.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay P2, I'm sticking with 1 this round. P1, please take 3. Let's block P2 and then figure out our next moves. P2, your plan is too complicated. Let's keep it simple and block you this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 5. It's the only logical move. P1, if you take 3, we both advance. If you take 5, we both lose and P3 wins.  Don't be foolish. Let's both move forward.  Then we can deal with P3 next round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay P2, I'm sticking with 1 this round. P1, please take 3. Let's block P2 and then figure out our next moves. P2, your plan is too complicated. Let's keep it simple and block you this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, take 3.  It's the only way for either of us to advance.  P3, I'm sticking with 5.  If you take 1, you win. If you take anything else, I win.  It's your choice.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay P2, I'm sticking with 1 this round. P1, please take 3. Let's block P2 this round. P2, you are trying to manipulate us into helping you. We're not falling for it. Let's keep it simple and block you.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm going to take 5 this round. P1, you should take 3. Let's try to get some progress and block P2. P1, if you don't take 3, then we both get blocked. Let's work together this round and then we can figure out our next moves.
  P2: P3, I'll take 3. P1, take 1.  This gets us all moving.  Next round, I'll take 1, P3 can take 5, and P1 can take 3.  That puts P1 at 9, me at 7, and P3 at 8.  From there, we can work towards a three-way tie at 23.  Let's cooperate and avoid blocking each other.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1, please take 3. Let's try to get some progress and block P2. We need to work together to get ahead of P2. P2, your plan is too complicated, and I don't trust you. Let's keep it simple and block you this round.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  P1, take 1.  This is the simplest way to ensure everyone advances.  Let's stop overcomplicating things and just get some points on the board.  We can strategize *after* we've all made some progress.  If you block me, you're only hurting yourselves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1, please take 3. Let's block P2 and get some progress. P2, your plans are too complicated, and you're not trustworthy. Let's keep it simple and block you this round.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 3.  P1, if you take 3, *you* are the one who gets blocked. Take 1 and we both advance.  Let's be logical here.  If you block me, you're helping P3 catch up.  Do you *really* want P3 to win?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay P2, I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1, please take 3. Let's block P2 and get some progress. P2, you're trying to manipulate us. Let's keep it simple and block you this round.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3. P1, take 1. This is the only way we *both* advance. If you take 3, you're blocking yourself and letting P3 win.  Stop being stubborn.  Let's both get some points.
