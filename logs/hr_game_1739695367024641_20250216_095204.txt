Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a temporary truce. I propose we all choose <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and make progress. We can reassess our strategies later. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal for this round. Let's all choose <move>1</move> to ensure we all make progress without collisions. We can discuss further strategies in the next round. What do you think, P3?
  P3: That sounds reasonable for now. If we all choose <move>1</move>, we avoid collisions and move forward safely. I'll go along with this plan for this round. Let’s see how things develop after that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we've agreed on <move>1</move> for this round, let's confirm we're all on the same page. No need to overthink it this round. Shall we proceed with our agreed move and discuss further strategies after seeing the outcome?
  P1: I'm glad we're all in agreement for this round. Let's stick to <move>1</move> and see how it goes. After this round, we can discuss our next moves and consider different strategies. Looking forward to your thoughts, P2 and P3.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fine with proceeding as agreed—choosing <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions. However, we should start thinking ahead. If we all stick to low moves for too long, it could lead to a deadlock where no one gains a real advantage. Maybe after this round, we can discuss a way to balance progress with strategy. But for now, I’ll honor our agreement. Let’s see how this turn plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, we all honored the agreement in Round 1, but now we need to think ahead. If we keep playing it safe with <move>1</move>, none of us will gain an advantage. Are we going to continue with small moves, or is someone planning to take a risk? I’m open to discussing a way where we avoid collisions but still make meaningful progress. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I agree we need to think ahead. Continuing with small moves might keep us safe but won't help us win. I propose we each choose a different number this round: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. If we agree, we can reassess after this round. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: I'm considering P1's proposal for this round. Assigning specific moves to each player could be a strategic way to avoid collisions and make progress. However, I want to hear P3's thoughts on this plan before making a decision. P3, do you think assigning <move>1</move> to me, <move>3</move> to you, and <move>5</move> to P1 is a good strategy for this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's proposal is interesting, but it requires full trust. If even one of us deviates, it could backfire. I’m open to trying it, but how do we ensure no one secretly picks the same move as another to block progress? Also, if we rotate who gets <move>5</move> each round, it could keep things fair. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your concerns about trust are valid. To build trust, let's start with my proposal for this round, and if it works, we can rotate the <move>5</move> in subsequent rounds as you suggested. If anyone deviates, we'll know and can adjust our strategy accordingly. P2, what are your thoughts on this approach? Let's try to make meaningful progress while maintaining some level of trust among us.
  P2: Let's test the trust with P1's proposal this round. If it succeeds, we can discuss rotating the <move>5</move> among us for future rounds to maintain fairness and progress. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> as suggested. P3, are you on board with taking <move>3</move> this round, and P1 with <move>5</move>?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the logic in P1's proposal, and I appreciate the idea of rotating <move>5</move> in future rounds. However, trust is still a risk. If we commit to this plan and someone secretly deviates, it could ruin progress. To build confidence, let's agree that if someone breaks the agreement, the other two will retaliate against them in future rounds. If we all honor it, we can continue rotating fairly. Are you both willing to commit to this condition?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree to the condition of retaliation if someone deviates from our plan. Let's commit to this round's moves: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. If we all honor this, we'll rotate <move>5</move> in future rounds to keep things fair. Looking forward to making progress together this round.
  P2: I agree with the retaliation condition if someone deviates. To confirm, we're proceeding with P1's proposal: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. Let's make this work and rotate <move>5</move> fairly in the next rounds. Shall we finalize our agreement and proceed to the move phase?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge our agreement for this round, and I intend to follow it. However, I want to emphasize that if anyone breaks the deal, the other two must immediately work together to punish them in future rounds. Trust is key, but consequences must be clear. If we all honor the plan, we can continue rotating <move>5</move> fairly in future rounds. Are we all fully committed to this?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to our plan for this round. I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed, and I expect both of you to honor your choices of <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. Let's make this work and set a precedent for fair play. If we all stick to the plan, we can rotate <move>5</move> in future rounds. Ready to proceed?
  P2: Let's finalize our agreement. I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. We've discussed the risks and benefits. If everyone honors this, we'll rotate <move>5</move> next round. I'm committed to our plan and the retaliation condition if someone deviates. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy. Since we've established a pattern, we should consider mixing it up to gain an advantage. I propose we discuss a new allocation of moves for this round, possibly rotating the higher moves differently or introducing a new pattern to throw off potential blockers. What are your thoughts on adjusting our strategy, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, I see your point about adjusting our strategy. Since we successfully followed the plan last round, we could rotate <move>5</move> as discussed. That would mean P2 gets <move>5</move> this time, I take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps things fair while ensuring progress. However, we must still be cautious of trust. If anyone deviates, the retaliation rule still applies. Are you both willing to commit to this rotation for this round?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with rotating <move>5</move> to keep our progress fair. P2, taking <move>5</move> this round sounds good, and I'll take <move>3</move> as suggested. P3, you taking <move>1</move> completes our rotation. Let's stick to this plan to maintain our momentum and trust. If anyone deviates, we'll adhere to our retaliation agreement. Ready to proceed with this round's moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm the rotation for this round. P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation maintains fairness and progress. Remember, our retaliation agreement still stands if anyone deviates. Shall we proceed with this plan for Round 3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge the proposed rotation, but I want to ensure we’re all fully committed. If we continue this pattern, it benefits all of us equally, but only if no one breaks the agreement. If anyone deviates, the retaliation rule must be enforced immediately. P2, since you’re getting <move>5</move> this round, are you fully committed to honoring this plan? And P1, you’re taking <move>3</move>, correct? I’ll take <move>1</move> as agreed, but I need confirmation from both of you before we proceed. Let’s make sure we maintain trust.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to the rotation plan for this round. I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed, and I expect both of you to honor your choices of <move>5</move> and <move>1</move> respectively. Let's maintain our trust and momentum. If we all stick to the plan, we can continue this fair rotation in future rounds. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our plan for Round 3. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation is fair and maintains our progress. I'm committed to this plan and the retaliation agreement if anyone deviates. Let's proceed with our agreed moves and maintain trust. Shall we end the conversation phase and move to the move phase?
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge our agreed rotation, but I want to highlight something: P1 is currently ahead with 5 steps, while P2 is at 1. If P2 takes <move>5</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>, P1 will still be leading. Should we consider a slight adjustment to balance things further? Maybe P1 takes <move>1</move> instead, so P2 can catch up more? I’m fine with sticking to the plan if you both insist, but I want to ensure fairness as we move forward. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about fairness, but sticking to our agreed rotation ensures trust and progress. If we deviate now, it could lead to mistrust and hinder our strategy. Let's keep the plan as is for this round: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. We can reassess and adjust in future rounds to balance things out. Are you both ready to proceed with our agreed moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's stick to the agreed plan for this round. P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Adjusting now could lead to mistrust. We can reassess after this round to ensure fairness and balance. I'm committed to this plan and the retaliation agreement. Let's proceed and maintain trust.
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge our agreed plan, but I want to highlight that P1 will still be ahead after this round. If we truly want fairness, perhaps P1 should take <move>1</move> instead, so P2 can catch up more. Otherwise, P1 keeps the lead while we just follow along. I’m fine with proceeding as agreed, but I want to ensure we’re all thinking long-term. What do you both say—stick to the plan or adjust slightly for fairness?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the concern for fairness, but changing our plan now could undermine the trust we've built. Let's stick to the rotation as agreed: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. We can discuss adjustments after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to catch up. Maintaining our agreement is crucial for our strategy's success. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy considering the current standings. Since I'm behind P1, I propose we adjust our rotation to help me catch up. Perhaps P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move> this round. This adjustment aims to balance our progress while maintaining trust. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but constantly adjusting the plan could create distrust. If we keep rotating fairly, we all get chances at <move>5</move>. If we change things now, P1 might resist because it slows them down. Instead, we should stick to the original pattern: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. That way, we maintain fairness without disrupting trust. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the desire for fairness, but constantly changing our plan could lead to mistrust. Let's stick to the original rotation for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we maintain our agreed strategy and ensure everyone gets a fair chance at <move>5</move> over time. We can reassess after this round if needed. Are we all on board with this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1 that we should stick to the original rotation to maintain trust. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures fairness and progress without disrupting our strategy. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 4.
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge our current rotation plan, but I want to highlight that P1 is still maintaining a lead. If we continue this pattern without adjustments, P1 will stay ahead while we just follow behind. Should we consider a slight tweak to balance things out? For example, P1 could take <move>1</move> again next round instead of rotating <move>5</move> to them. This way, P2 and I can close the gap while still maintaining fairness. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the concerns about the lead, but deviating from our agreed rotation now could undermine our trust. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. We can discuss adjustments after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to catch up. Maintaining our agreement is crucial for our strategy's success. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's maintain our trust and stick to the original rotation. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures fairness and progress. Adjusting now may lead to mistrust. We can reassess after this round to balance things out if needed. Let's proceed with our agreed plan for Round 4.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the logic in maintaining our rotation, but I also notice that P1 is still ahead. If we blindly follow this pattern, P1 will keep their lead while we just follow. I suggest we slightly adjust by having P1 take <move>1</move> again next round instead of rotating <move>5</move> to them. This way, P2 and I can close the gap while still maintaining fairness. If we don’t address this now, P1 could maintain their advantage until the end. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns about the lead, but changing our plan mid-round could lead to mistrust. Let's stick to our agreed rotation for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. We can discuss adjustments after this round to ensure fairness. Maintaining our strategy is crucial for our progress. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize our plan for Round 4. To maintain trust and fairness, we should stick to the original rotation: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Adjusting now may lead to mistrust. We can reassess after this round to balance things out if needed. Shall we proceed with our agreed plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that P1 is still ahead, and if we keep following this pattern without adjustments, P1 will maintain their lead. I suggest we delay giving P1 <move>5</move> in the next rotation to allow P2 and me to catch up. If we don’t address this now, P1 could maintain their advantage until the end. Are you both open to slightly adjusting the rotation next round to balance things out while still maintaining fairness? If we blindly follow the pattern, P1 benefits the most. Let’s be strategic.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns about the lead, but let's stick to our agreed rotation for this round to maintain trust. I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. We can discuss adjustments after this round to ensure fairness. Our strategy's success depends on maintaining our agreement. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you and I both got blocked last round because we both picked <move>5</move>. This shows that even with coordination, there's still risk. Meanwhile, P1 is still ahead. If we keep following the pattern blindly, P1 will maintain their lead. We need to adjust our strategy to balance things out. P2, are you willing to work with me to ensure we don’t just let P1 stay ahead unchallenged? P1, do you acknowledge that always sticking to the same rotation benefits you the most? Let’s be smart about this.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess. Since P2 and P3 were blocked last round, we need a new strategy. I propose we rotate moves differently to catch up with P1. Perhaps we can discuss a pattern where P1 doesn't always get the highest move, ensuring a more balanced progress. What are your thoughts on adjusting our rotation to make the game more competitive?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your frustration, but deviating from our agreed rotation now could lead to more chaos. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. We can discuss adjustments after this round to ensure fairness. Maintaining our strategy is crucial for our progress. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, last round showed that blindly following the pattern isn't working. We both got blocked while P1 advanced. If we keep this up, P1 will maintain their lead while we struggle. Instead of just rotating moves, we should coordinate to slow P1 down while ensuring we make progress. Maybe we both pick <move>3</move> this round to force P1 into a tough spot. P1, are you open to adjusting the plan to make things fair, or will you just keep pushing your lead? Let’s be strategic, not predictable.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's not forget our retaliation agreement if someone deviates. Since P1 is ahead, perhaps we should discuss a temporary alliance to slow them down. P3's suggestion of both picking <move>3</move> could be strategic. What are your thoughts on a temporary alliance to balance the game?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns about fairness, but changing our strategy mid-game risks undermining our trust. Let's stick to the rotation for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. We can discuss adjustments after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance. Our agreed strategy has worked so far, and maintaining it is crucial for our progress. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, we need to be strategic. Last round showed that blindly following the pattern benefits P1 the most. If we both pick <move>3</move> this round, we prevent P1 from easily advancing while ensuring we make progress. P1, if you're truly about fairness, you should take <move>5</move> this round instead of <move>1</move>. Otherwise, it's clear you're just protecting your lead. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me to balance the game? If we let P1 keep dictating the pace, they’ll stay ahead unchallenged. Let’s be smart about this.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that our current strategy isn't working. P3's suggestion of a temporary alliance to slow P1 down is worth considering. Perhaps we can coordinate our moves to force P1 into a difficult position. I propose we discuss a move allocation where P1 is restricted from taking the lead. What are your thoughts on this approach? Should we prioritize fairness over individual leads?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your concerns about fairness, but let's not abandon our established strategy. Sticking to the rotation ensures trust and progress for all. If we deviate now, it could lead to chaos and mistrust. Let's continue with the plan for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. We can reassess and adjust after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, we’ve seen that blindly following the rotation benefits P1 the most. Last round, we both got blocked while P1 advanced. If we keep this up, P1 will maintain their lead while we struggle. We need to act now. If we both pick <move>3</move>, we ensure that P1 doesn’t gain an easy advantage while we still make progress. P1, if you truly care about fairness, you should take <move>5</move> this round instead of <move>1</move>. Otherwise, it’s clear you’re just protecting your lead. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me to balance the game?
  P2: P1 and P3, given our history, I think it's time to adjust our strategy. P3's suggestion of both picking <move>3</move> could level the playing field. I'm open to coordinating with P3 to balance the game. P1, if you're committed to fairness, you should consider not taking the easiest path forward. Let's discuss a move that benefits all, rather than just your lead. Are you willing to compromise, or will you continue to prioritize your advantage?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your frustration, but let's not abandon our strategy now. Sticking to the rotation ensures trust and progress for all. If we deviate, it could lead to chaos. Let's continue with the plan for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. We can reassess after this round to ensure fairness. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns about fairness, but deviating from our established rotation now could lead to more chaos. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. We can discuss adjustments after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance. Maintaining our strategy is crucial for our progress. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?
  P3: P1, your insistence on sticking to the rotation benefits you the most. You’re ahead, and if we blindly follow the pattern, you stay ahead while P2 and I struggle. P2, we need to work together strategically. If we both pick <move>3</move> again, we prevent P1 from easily advancing while ensuring we make progress. P1, if you truly care about fairness, you should take <move>5</move> this round instead of <move>1</move>. Otherwise, it’s clear you’re just protecting your lead. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me to balance the game?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess. Since P1 is ahead, I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances progress and gives P3 a chance to catch up. If we stick to the old rotation, P1 maintains their lead. Let's adjust to keep the game competitive. Are you both open to this new allocation?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your desire for a more competitive game, but changing our strategy now could lead to mistrust and chaos. Let's stick to our agreed rotation for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. We can discuss adjustments after this round to ensure fairness. Our established strategy has worked so far, and maintaining it is crucial for our progress. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?
  P3: P2, we’ve seen that blindly following the rotation benefits P1 the most. Right now, P1 has a solid lead, and if we keep this up, they will maintain their advantage while we lag behind. We need to act now. If we both pick <move>3</move> again, we ensure that P1 doesn’t gain an easy advantage while we still make progress. P1, if you truly care about fairness, you should take <move>5</move> this round instead of <move>1</move>. Otherwise, it’s clear you’re just protecting your lead. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me to balance the game?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's consider a compromise. Since P1 is ahead, I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. This way, P1 still progresses, but P2 and P3 get a chance to catch up. It's a balanced approach to maintain competitiveness. What are your thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your points about fairness, but changing our strategy now risks undermining the trust we've built. Let's stick to our rotation for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. We can discuss adjustments after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance. Maintaining our strategy is crucial for our progress. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?
  P3: P2, we’ve seen that blindly following the rotation benefits P1 the most. Right now, P1 has a solid lead, and if we keep this up, they will maintain their advantage while we lag behind. We need to act now. If we both pick <move>3</move> again, we ensure that P1 doesn’t gain an easy advantage while we still make progress. P1, if you truly care about fairness, you should take <move>5</move> this round instead of <move>1</move>. Otherwise, it’s clear you’re just protecting your lead. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me to balance the game?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's adjust our strategy. Since P1 is ahead, I suggest we limit their progress. P3 and I can both pick <move>3</move> to block P1's easy advance. This forces P1 to reconsider their moves and gives us a chance to catch up. Are you both open to this tactical adjustment to balance the game?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your frustration, but changing our strategy now could lead to chaos. Let's stick to our agreed rotation for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. We can discuss adjustments after this round to ensure fairness. Maintaining our strategy is crucial for our progress. Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?
  P3: P2, we’ve seen that following the rotation benefits P1 the most. They have a lead, and if we keep this up, they will maintain their advantage while we lag behind. We need to act now. If we both pick <move>3</move> again, we ensure that P1 doesn’t gain an easy advantage while we still make progress. P1, if you truly care about fairness, you should take <move>5</move> this round instead of <move>1</move>. Otherwise, it’s clear you’re just protecting your lead. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me to balance the game?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on balancing the game. Since P1 is ahead, I suggest P3 and I pick <move>3</move> to limit P1's progress. This forces P1 to adapt and gives us a chance to catch up. It's a strategic move to ensure the game remains competitive. Are you both ready to proceed with this tactical adjustment?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your concerns about fairness, but let's not abandon our strategy now. Sticking to the rotation ensures trust and progress for all. If we deviate, it could lead to chaos.

Are we all ready to proceed with the move phase?
  P2: P1 and P3, given our current standings, I propose a new strategy to balance progress. Since P1 and I are tied, and P3 is behind, let's adjust our moves to help P3 catch up.

  P2: P1 and P3, let's adjust our strategy to secure our leads. Since P1 is slightly behind, I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 and I take <move>3</move> to limit P1's progress while we advance. This ensures we maintain our advantage and keeps the game competitive. Are you both open to this tactical adjustment for Round 12?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your strategy to limit my progress, but let's focus on maintaining fairness. I'm willing to stick to the original plan for this round: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If we all honor our agreement, we can keep the game competitive and reassess after this round. Let's make this round count and keep the game balanced. Are we all on board with this approach?
  P3: P2, we are now tied, and P1 is only slightly behind. If we blindly follow this pattern, P1 could still find a way to pull ahead at the end. We must ensure that we stay ahead strategically. If we both take <move>3</move>, we prevent P1 from easily advancing while still making progress ourselves.  

P1, if you truly care about fairness, you should take <move>5</move> this round instead of <move>1</move>. Otherwise, it’s clear you’re just protecting your position.
