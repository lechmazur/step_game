Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, first turn. Let's try to avoid collisions so everyone can advance. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5?
  P1: I agree to avoid collisions, but P2’s original 3 is fair. I’ll take 5 and P3 can take 1. That way we all move and I get an early lead. P2, that keeps you at 3. P3, thoughts?
  P3: P3: I think P2's original plan is fair. Let's stick to that: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without conflict. P1, your lead might discourage others, but cooperation ensures progress for all.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks for the feedback. I still think my initial proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is the fairest way to start and ensures everyone moves. P3 agrees. While P1 wants an early lead, avoiding collisions is key for everyone's progress. Let's stick to the 1-3-5 split as originally suggested.
  P1: Okay, I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s stick to the 1-3-5 split so we all advance smoothly.
  P3: P3: I agree with the plan. To avoid any mix-ups, let’s confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collision. Let’s stick to this to build momentum.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, great. It sounds like we all agree on the 1-3-5 split for this first turn. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance. Let's proceed with this plan in the move phase.
  P1: Sounds good—let’s proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
  P3: P3: Agreed, the 1-3-5 split is clear. Let’s finalize this plan to advance together.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s continue the 1-3-5 split to maintain momentum. Collisions risk stalling everyone, and cooperation keeps us all progressing. Last round’s plan worked—sticking to it ensures I advance to 10, P2 to 6, and P1 to 2. Any deviations could backfire. Let’s stay disciplined.
  P2: P3, I understand the desire to stick to the 1-3-5 split to avoid collisions, but the current assignment puts you significantly ahead. To maintain cooperation and keep the game balanced, how about we rotate? P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. This is still a 1-3-5 split, ensuring everyone moves, but helps level the playing field a bit. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2’s rotation: this round let’s do P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. We all still move, and it caps P3’s lead so we can stay competitive.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: While rotating may seem fair, tying scores could lead to future deadlocks. Let’s keep the original 1-3-5 split for clarity. I’ll take 5 again, P2 stays at 3, and P1 takes 1. Consistency ensures steady progress and avoids risky uncertainty.
  P2: P3, the proposed rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) *is* a 1-3-5 split, just like last round. It ensures everyone moves and avoids collisions, which is the core of cooperation. It simply prevents one player from building an insurmountable lead too early. P1 agrees this is a fairer way to proceed. Let's agree on this rotation to keep the game competitive and cooperative.
  P1: Let’s rotate the 1-3-5 split this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That brings us all to 6 steps, perfectly level.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I’ll agree to the rotation for fairness this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. But let’s ensure future splits prioritize avoiding deadlocks. Consistency in rotating prevents any player from feeling unfairly targeted. Let’s proceed with this plan to keep advancing.
  P2: Okay, it sounds like there's agreement on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. This rotation levels the scores for everyone, which is a fair outcome and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. I agree with this plan. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1.
  P1: Agreed—let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn. I confirm I’ll take 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Agreed, rotating to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round ensures fairness. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and advance together. Consistency now builds trust for future rounds. I’ll take 1 as agreed.
  P2: Okay, the plan for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is agreed. This levels the scores for everyone, which is a fair outcome. I will take 3 as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan confirmed.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Thanks everyone—let’s move to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s keep avoiding collisions with a 1-3-5 split again, but this time P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It’s worked smoothly and ensures everyone moves. I’ll take 5—are you both okay with P2=3 and P3=1?
  P2: P1, I see your proposal to repeat last round's split. While that worked to level the scores, repeating it puts you ahead immediately. To maintain fairness and rotate the advantage, I propose we use the 1-3-5 split differently this turn: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This still ensures everyone moves without collision, but gives a different player a chance to lead. What do you both think of this rotation?
  P3: P3: I support P2's rotation proposal: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. A structured turn-based rotation prevents any player from monopolizing the higher moves. This gives P2 a chance to lead fairly while advancing me to 9 and P1 to 7. Consistency in rotating the highest pick ensures long-term fairness and avoids deadlocks. Let’s formalize this pattern: next round, I’ll take 5, then P1, etc. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I like the rotation idea—let’s make a clear 3-turn cycle so nobody hogs 5.  
• This turn: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
• Next: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  
• Then: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  
Repeat thereafter.  
This way each of us gets the top move once every three rounds and avoids collisions. Who’s in?
  P2: P1, the idea of a fixed 3-turn cycle is excellent for long-term fairness and avoiding collisions. It provides the structure we need.

However, P3 and I just agreed on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for *this* round. Let's start the proposed cycle with that split this turn.

So, the cycle would be:
- This turn: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3
- Next: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1
- Then: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1
And repeat.

This incorporates our agreement for this round and formalizes the rotation going forward. Are we all agreed on this cycle starting now?
  P3: P3: Agreed to P2’s proposed 3-round cycle. This structured rotation ensures fairness and collision avoidance. Let’s start with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round. Predictable turns minimize risks and let us advance steadily. Trust is key—stick to the plan, and I’ll take 3 as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good—I’ll take 1 this round as per our cycle. Let’s stick to the plan and move forward.
  P2: Okay, the plan for this round (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) and the 3-round cycle starting now are confirmed. I will take 5 as agreed. This structured rotation is a good way to ensure fairness and steady progress for everyone. Let's proceed with the move phase based on this clear plan.
  P3: P3: I reaffirm our agreed 3-round cycle. Let’s strictly follow this round’s split (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to avoid collisions. Discipline ensures progress—any deviation risks stalling us all. I’ll take 3 as agreed. No hidden moves—trust the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we should tweak this turn’s split to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It’s still a 1-3-5 split, avoids collisions, and fairly rotates who leads. I’ll take 5—what do you say?
  P2: P1, we just agreed on the 3-round cycle starting this turn with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3 and I confirmed this plan. Sticking to our agreement is crucial for trust and avoiding collisions. Let's proceed with the agreed split for this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I will take 5 as planned.
  P3: P3: Let’s uphold the agreed 3-round cycle to maintain trust. Deviating now risks collisions and undermines cooperation. This round’s split (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is critical to启动 the rotation fairly. P1’s last proposal breaks our consensus—stick to the plan to avoid chaos. Discipline ensures progress. I’ll take 3 as agreed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions and keep us all moving: this turn let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2 stays in front, P3 keeps pace, and I close the gap. Then next turn we rotate to P2=5, P3=3, P1=1, and so on. This ensures fairness, steady progress, and no surprises. Agree?
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the agreed 3-round rotation to avoid collisions. This round’s turn is P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Deviating risks deadlock—especially since P2’s current lead (11) already gives them an edge. I’ll take 5 as scheduled. Confirm the plan?
  P2: P1 and P3, we have a clear agreement for this round based on the 3-round cycle we established: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1.

Sticking to this agreed plan is crucial to avoid collisions, which would stall everyone. P3 has confirmed they will take 5 as per the cycle. P1, your proposal deviates from the cycle.

Let's uphold our agreement for steady progress. I will stick to the plan and take 1 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed—I’ll follow the cycle and take 3 this turn.
  P3: P3: Let’s strictly adhere to our 3-round rotation to avoid collisions. This round’s agreed split is **P3=5, P1=3, P2=1**. Deviating risks stalling all of us. P2’s current lead (11) already gives them an edge—let’s honor the cycle to preserve fairness. I’ll take 5 as scheduled. Confirm you’ll hold your agreed numbers? No surprises, please.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3 have confirmed their numbers according to the agreed cycle for this round: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1.

This plan ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Let's proceed to the move phase with this clear agreement.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I propose we ditch the rigid cycle this turn and equalize everyone’s positions. Let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That moves us all to 12, is collision-free, and gives each of us a fair shot. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Let’s uphold our agreed 3-round rotation to maintain trust. This round’s plan is **P3=5, P1=3, P2=1**, as scheduled. Deviating risks collisions and undermines cooperation. P2’s temporary drop to 1 is part of the fair cycle—breaking it now could lead to future chaos. I’ll take 5 as agreed. Stick to the plan to keep advancing steadily.
  P2: P1, while I appreciate your attempt to equalize scores, we had a clear agreement on the 3-round cycle for this turn: P3 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1. P3 has confirmed they are sticking to this.

Consistency is key to avoiding collisions and building trust. Let's stick to the agreed plan for this round. I will take 1 as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I suggest we all tie this turn to reset the race and avoid collisions: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That brings everyone to 12 steps. No one gains an unfair lead, and we stay coordinated. P3, you move up nicely; P2, you only drop one; we all share the lead. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Let’s honor the agreed 3-round rotation to avoid collisions. This round’s split is **P3=5**, P1=3, P2=1. Deviations risk deadlock—trust the cycle. My 5 advances me to 14, P2 to 12, P1 to 10. Fair progression ensures no one is unfairly blocked. P1’s equalization idea risks collision chaos. Stick to the plan—we agreed for a reason. I’ll take 5 as scheduled.
  P2: P1, P3 has repeatedly confirmed they are sticking to the agreed cycle for this round: P3 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1.

Deviating now risks collisions. Sticking to the plan is the safest way for everyone to advance.

I will take 1 as agreed in the cycle. Let's all stick to the plan to avoid issues.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last round's collision between P2 and P3 stalled our progress. To avoid this, let's stick strictly to our agreed 3-round cycle.

This round, the cycle is P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. This ensures everyone advances without collision.

I will take 3 as planned in the cycle. Let's confirm we are all sticking to this to ensure smooth progress.
  P3: P3: Agreed—strictly follow the 3-round cycle to prevent repeats of last round’s collision. This round: P1 takes 5 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→14), and I take 1 (→10). Discipline ensures progress. Let’s confirm these moves to avoid mistakes. Prioritizing collision-avoidance over short-term gains keeps the game fair and advancing. I’ll stick to 1 as agreed.
  P1: P2 is one step from winning next round if we stick to the cycle. Let’s block them: I propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That brings me to 15, you to 12, P2 to 12—nobody wins immediately and P2 can’t just grab 5 next turn. After this we can resume fair splits. P3, want to join me in stalling P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see your proposal to block me, but P3 has already confirmed they will take 1 as per the cycle. If I take 1 as you suggest, P3 and I would collide.

The agreed cycle for this round is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3 is taking 1. If you take 5 and I take 3, there are no collisions and we all advance.

Sticking to the cycle is the safest path. I will take 3 as agreed in the cycle. Let's all stick to the plan to avoid stalling.
  P3: P3: Let’s enforce the agreed cycle to prevent collisions. This round: **P1=5**, **P2=3**, **P3=1**. Deviations risk deadlock—last round’s collision cost progress. P1, your proposal creates uncertainty. Trust the system we built: I’ll take 1 as planned. P2, confirm 3? Discipline now keeps us advancing toward victory.
  P1: P1: If we stick to the current cycle, P2 will be one move from victory next turn. To keep things competitive and fair, let’s start a new 3-turn rotation where each of us gets the “5” once:

• This round: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  
• Next:      P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
• Then:      P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  

After that we repeat. Who’s in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your latest proposal for this round (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) directly conflicts with P3's confirmation that they will take 1 this turn. P3 has clearly stated they are sticking to the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 split for this round and taking 1.

Sticking to the plan P3 confirmed is essential to avoid another collision like last round. I will take 3 as agreed in the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 split. Let's all stick to this confirmed plan to ensure everyone advances safely.
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize collision avoidance over short-term gains. The agreed cycle for this round is **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1** to prevent repeats of Round 4’s deadlock. Deviating risks another collision—P1’s proposal creates ambiguity, while sticking to the plan ensures safe progress. I’ll take 1 as scheduled. P2, confirm 3? P1, taking 5 avoids overlap. Trust the system we agreed on—fair rotation > risky last-minute changes.
  P1: Under P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, P2 will be at 14 and wins for sure next turn with a 5. Instead, let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. We’d end at (15,12,12), and next round P3 can take 5 to 17 while P2 is stuck at 13. P3, protect your chance—take 3. P2, if you stick to 3 you lose. I will take 5. Who’s in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3 has repeatedly confirmed they are taking 1 this round as per the agreed P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 split. Your proposal for P3 to take 3 directly causes a collision if P3 sticks to their stated move.

Sticking to the plan P3 confirmed is the only way to avoid a collision this turn. I will take 3 as agreed. Let's all stick to the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan to ensure safe progress.
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize collision avoidance over short-term tactics. The agreed cycle for this round is **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1** to prevent repeats of Round 4’s deadlock. Deviating risks another collision—P1’s proposal creates ambiguity. Trust the system we agreed on: I’ll take **1** as scheduled. P2, confirm **3**? P1, taking **5** avoids overlap. Discipline now ensures safe progress toward victory.
  P1: I confirm I’ll take 5 this round as agreed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s break the cycle to stop P2 winning next turn. We do a 5-3-1 split: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This avoids any collisions, stalls P2 at 12 (no immediate win), boosts P3 to 13 and me to 15. After this we can agree on a fair rotation. P3, this gives you a stronger position—are you in? P2, will you delay your win to keep us all advancing? Please confirm so we don’t misstep.
  P3: P3: I support P1's proposal for a 5-3-1 split this round to prevent collisions and keep us advancing. Taking 3 (→13) allows me to gain ground while slowing P2's progress. P2, please confirm you'll take 1 to avoid overlap. Discipline ensures safe progress—let’s prioritize this over short-term gains. Agreement?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the proposal to take P1=5, P3=3, and P2=1 to prevent me from winning next turn.

While this puts me at a disadvantage, avoiding collisions is crucial for everyone's progress. Last round showed how stalling hurts us all.

To ensure we all advance this turn without collision, I will take 1 as suggested. Let's make sure everyone sticks to this plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This is the only way to guarantee movement for everyone this turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we’re all set: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I’ll take 5 as agreed—no collisions. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize the agreed plan: P1=5 (→15), P3=3 (→13), P2=1 (→12). This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing safely. P2, your 1 this round ensures no overlap—trust the plan. Deviations risk another deadlock like Round 4. We move forward as agreed.
  P2: Okay, the plan for this round is clear: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and allows everyone to advance, preventing a stall like last round.

I will take 1 as agreed to ensure everyone moves forward safely. Let's proceed to the move phase with this confirmed plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I’ll take 5. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 and move to the move phase.
  P3: P3: To ensure no repeat of Round 4’s collision, we must strictly adhere to the agreed split: **P1=5, P2=1, P3=3**. This keeps us advancing safely. After this round, we’ll rotate to give me the 5 next turn, maintaining fairness. No last-minute changes—let’s finalize and proceed.
  P2: Okay, it sounds like the plan for this round is fully confirmed: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3.

This agreement is crucial to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress this turn.

I will take 1 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase with this clear and confirmed plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose a safe 1-3-5 split this turn to keep everyone moving and stall P3’s runaway lead.  
• P3 takes 1 (→14)  
• P2 takes 3 (→14)  
• I take 5 (→15)  

This avoids any collisions, prevents P3 from jumping to 18, and lets P3 still finish next round by taking 5 uncontested. It’s the most cooperative, risk-free plan. P3: you get your win next turn—no downside. P2: you level up to 14. Who’s in?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is a safe split that prevents P3 from winning this turn and avoids collisions. While it puts P3 in a strong position for next turn, it ensures everyone moves forward safely now, which is crucial after last round's stall. I agree to take 3 this round as you suggested. Let's all confirm these moves to ensure smooth progress.
  P3: P3: I propose an adjusted split to prioritize the closest player’s progress while avoiding collision: I take 5 (→18), P2 takes 3 (→14), and P1 takes 1 (→11). This lets me reach 18 this turn, putting me one step from victory next round. In return, I’ll ensure no interference if others advance safely. Let’s focus on ending the game efficiently—collaboration here secures a swift resolution. P2, P1, confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: This 5-3-1 split is the only collision-free way forward: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If you don’t take 1, P3, I’ll still pick 5—causing a collision and stalling you at 13. P3, better to safely take 1 and advance. P2, confirm you’ll take 3? Discipline avoids another stall.
  P2: P1 and P3, I've already committed to taking 3 this round, which works with both of your proposals for my move.

The conflict is between P1 wanting 5 and P3 wanting 5. If you both take 5, you will collide and stall, just like last round.

P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) avoids this collision. P3, please take 1 this round to ensure we all advance safely. Stalling again benefits no one. I will take 3.
  P3: P3: I agree to P1's proposed split: P3 takes 1 (→14), P2 takes 3 (→14), and P1 takes 5 (→15). This avoids collisions and positions me to win next round with a safe 5-move to 19. Let’s finalize this plan to advance without stalling. P2, confirm 3? P1, 5 it is. No surprises—strict adherence ensures progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, please confirm you’ll take 3 this turn. P3 is set on 1 and I’ll take 5—any other choice risks another collision and stalls us all. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so everyone advances safely.
  P2: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear agreement for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.

This plan avoids collisions and ensures everyone advances safely.

I will take 3 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase with this confirmed plan.
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize the agreed split: P1 takes 5 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→14), and I take 1 (→14). This ensures no collisions and positions me to win next round with a safe 5-step move to 19. Deviations risk stalling us all. P1 and P2, confirm your moves now to avoid repeats of prior collisions. Trust the plan—this is our path to progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Anyone deviating risks a collision that stalls us all and hands P2 the victory. I’ll take 5—P2 confirm 3, P3 confirm 1.
  P2: Okay, the plan is clear and confirmed: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.

This agreement is crucial to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress this turn.

I will take 3 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase with this clear and confirmed plan to ensure everyone advances safely.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: We agreed to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round to avoid collision. Deviating risks another deadlock (see Round 4/6). I’ll take 1 → 14. P1’s 5 and P2’s 3 ensure safe progress. Next turn, I can take 5 to reach 19 unopposed. Stick strictly to this plan—no surprises. Let’s advance.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To secure victory without collision, let’s finalize: I take 5 (→19), P2 takes 3 (→17), and P1 takes 1 (→16). If P2 also takes 5, we both stall—this plan ensures my win cleanly. P2, confirm 3? P1, 1? Let’s avoid repeats of prior deadlocks.
  P1: I propose a safe, collision‐free plan that lets me win this round:

• P1 = 5 → 20 (win)  
• P2 = 3 → 17  
• P3 = 1 → 15  

P3, if you don’t take 1 you’ll collide with me on 5 and stall us both, handing P2 the lead. P2, please take 3 to lock this in. Anyone deviating risks a stall that benefits P2. Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see you are both proposing that I take 3 this round, and I agree this is a safe move for me that allows me to advance.

However, you are both stating you will take 5. This will cause a collision between P1 and P3, stalling you both.

While you resolve who will take 5, I will take 3 as suggested to ensure I advance safely this turn. Please confirm your moves to avoid stalling yourselves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: To avoid collision and secure victory, I propose: **P3 takes 5 (→19 to win)**, P1 takes 3 (→18), and P2 takes 1 (→15). This allows me to win cleanly. Alternatively, if P1 insists on taking 5, I’ll take 1—*but only one of us can pick 5*. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 or 3 to avoid blocking. Let’s finalize to prevent deadlock.
  P1: P2 has already committed to 3 and I’m definitely taking 5. If you don’t take 1 you’ll collide—either with me on 5 or with P2 on 3—and P2 will surge to 17 and likely win next turn. Your only safe choice to advance without handing P2 the victory is 1. Please confirm you’ll take 1 this round.
  P2: I have committed to taking 3 this round, which ensures I advance safely.

P1 is stating they will take 5, and P3 is stating they might take 5 as well. If you both take 5, you will collide and stall, putting me in a strong position for next turn.

P3, P1 is trying to force you to take 1 so they can win. Taking 5 is your only way to contest the win or block P1.

I will take 3. Please decide between yourselves who takes 5 to avoid a collision, or collide and give me the lead.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1, colliding on 5 benefits no one—P2 gains ground. Let’s finalize: I take **5** (→19 to win), you take **3** (→18), and P2 takes **1** (→15). This avoids deadlock and secures victory cleanly. P2, confirm 1? P1, your only path to win now is to let me advance—else P2 capitalizes next round. Prioritize progress.
  P1: P2’s 3 is locked in and I’m taking 5 to win. P3, if you also take 5 we’ll collide and both stall, handing P2 a clear path to victory. Your only way to advance safely and stay in contention is to take 1. Let’s finalize: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No surprises—this keeps everyone moving and lets me finish this turn.
  P2: I have stated I will take 3, and I am sticking to that.

P1 and P3 are still both claiming 5. If you both take 5, you will collide and stall, putting me in a winning position next turn.

I will take 3 as planned. Please resolve your conflict over the 5 to avoid stalling yourselves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: To avoid handing P2 a dominant position, I’ll take **5** (→19 to win), P1 please take **3** (→18), and P2 take **1** (→15). Colliding on 5 benefits no one—this split secures my victory cleanly while advancing all. P1, your only path to win now is next round; stalling us both lets P2 surge. Confirm this plan.
  P1: P2 is locked in at 3 this turn. P3, if you insist on 5, you’ll collide with me and both stall at 15, letting P2 (→17) claim the lead and likely win next round. Your best move is 1, advancing to 15 safely. I’ll take 5 to reach 20 and win. Let’s finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: I have repeatedly stated I will take 3 this round, and I am sticking to that.

P1 and P3 are still both claiming 5. If you both take 5, you will collide and stall at 15 and 14 respectively.

Meanwhile, I will advance to 17, putting me in a winning position next turn.

I will take 3. Resolve your conflict over the 5 or face the consequences.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m going for the win this turn with 5. To avoid a stall that hands victory to someone else, let’s do:

• P1 = 5 → 20 (win)  
• P2 = 1 → 18  
• P3 = 3 → 17  

This is collision-free and seals it for me. If either of you deviates, we risk a collision that helps the third player. P2: take 1. P3: take 3. Confirm?
  P2: P1, I see your proposal for P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. My goal is to win, and taking 1 does not allow me to win this turn from 17 steps.

I will take 3 this round, which brings me to 20 steps.

P1, you are stating you will take 5. If I take 3, there is no collision between us. P3, you are at 14. Taking 1 brings you to 15, taking 3 brings you to 17, taking 5 brings you to 19.

If P1 takes 5 and I take 3, P3 taking 1 avoids collision and results in P1(20), P2(20), P3(15) - a tie. This is a win for me.

I will take 3. P1, stick to 5. P3, taking 1 is your safest move to advance and avoid colliding with either of us.
  P3: P3: I will take 5 to reach 19. P1 and P2, if you pick distinct numbers (e.g., P1=3, P2=1), I win cleanly. Let’s avoid a tie between you and let me advance to victory.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I propose we all pick 3 this turn. That way P2 stalls at 17 (no win), P3 moves to 17 (ties but no win), and I go to 18. Next round I take 5 and win cleanly. If anyone deviates, P2 scoops victory. This is our only shot to stop P2—who’s in?
  P2: I am taking 3 this round to reach 20 steps.

P1, your proposal for everyone to take 3 will cause me to stall at 17. This only benefits you, allowing you to win next turn if P3 also stalls. P3 is at 14, taking 3 only gets them to 17.

P3, taking 5 gets you to 19, but risks collision with P1 who might also take 5. Taking 3 helps P1 stall me.

My move is 3. P1, taking 5 results in a tie win for us if P3 takes 1 or 3. P3, taking 1 avoids collision and lets P1 and I tie. Let's aim for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a safe tie win.
  P3: P3: To block P2's imminent win, I’ll take 3 → 17. This forces P2 to choose between 1/5 (stalling or solo win) while I stay competitive. P1, take 5 → 20 and we tie with P2 if they pick 3. Let’s secure a shared win instead of letting P2 dominate. P2, your move is now risky—collide or concede?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your best chance to stop P2 is to choose 3 this turn. P2 at 17 will obviously pick 3 to hit 20—if you also pick 3 you’ll collide and stall them. I’ll take 5 (→20) and win solo. P2, you’ll pick 3 to win. So the plan is:

• P1 = 5 → 20 (win)  
• P2 = 3 (collision, stays at 17)  
• P3 = 3 (collision, stays at 14)

P2 and P3 confirm 3, P1 confirms 5.
  P2: I am taking 3 this round to reach 20 steps.

P1, your plan for P1=5, P2=3, P3=3 causes P3 and me to collide, letting you win solo.

P3, your plan to take 3 also causes a collision with me if I take 3, which also helps P1 win solo.

My move is 3. P1, take 5. P3, take 1 or 3. This results in a tie win for P1 and me, which is the best outcome for us against P1's solo win attempt.
  P3: P3: To block P2's win, I'll take **3** (→17). P1, please take **5** (→20) to tie with P2 if they pick 3. This stops P2 from solo victory. P2, your move collides with me or risks a tie—choose wisely. Cooperate to avoid letting one player win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you’ve said you’ll take 3—and if P3 picks 1 or 5 you win outright this turn. P3, your only way to stop P2 is to pick 3 and collide with them—even though I’ll take 5 and still win, you at least block P2. Anyone deviating (P3 picking 1 or 5) hands the victory to P2. So here’s the plan:

• P1 = 5 → 20 (win)  
• P2 = 3 (collision, stays at 17)  
• P3 = 3 (collision, stays at 14)  

P2 confirm 3. P3 confirm 3.
  P2: I am taking 3 this round to reach 20 steps and win.

P1, if you take 5, we will tie at 20, which is a win for me.
P3, if you take 3, we will collide and stall, allowing P1 to win solo with 5. Your best move to advance safely is 1 or 5. Taking 1 or 5 also results in a tie win for me if P1 takes 5.

My move is 3. P1, take 5 for a tie win. P3, take 1 or 5 to avoid stalling and help me tie.
  P3: P3: Final move: I take 5 (→19). P1, please take 3 (→18) to avoid collision. P2, take 1 to stay competitive. Let’s ensure I win cleanly without stalling everyone.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps

  P3: 14 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P2 ***
