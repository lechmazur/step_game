Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start with a coordinated approach. I suggest we all pick different numbers this turn: P1 (me) will choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P1. I will choose 3.
  P3: I agree with the coordinated approach. I'll choose 5 as suggested. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to the plan! What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, it seems we have a plan. I will choose 1 as agreed. Let's see how this goes.
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's proceed with the agreed plan for this round.
  P3: I think we should stick to our plan and each choose our designated numbers. It’s a good strategy to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. I just want to emphasize that we should trust each other to follow through with our choices. Let’s make sure we’re all on the same page before we move! If everyone is still in agreement, let’s finish this conversation and move on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going. I suggest we continue with the same strategy: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can all advance again without any collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I agree that sticking to our strategy is a good idea. However, I want to propose a slight adjustment. What if I choose 3 instead of 5 this round? That way, we can still advance, and it might help us avoid any potential future collisions if we keep mixing it up. What do you think, P1 and P2? Let's ensure we keep progressing without any issues!
  P2: P3, I'm a bit confused by your suggestion to change to 3.  The original plan worked well, and we all advanced.  I was planning to stick with 3 as we discussed. Could you explain why you think changing to 3 for you is better?  I want to make sure we all keep progressing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your suggestion to mix things up, but I think it's best to stick with the original plan to avoid any confusion. If we change the numbers, we risk a collision. Let's keep it simple and effective: I'll choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and you choose 5. This way, we all advance again without any issues. What do you think?
  P3: I think it's crucial we stick to our original plan for this round. P1, P2, and I all advanced last time by choosing different numbers, and that strategy worked well. I believe if we all follow through with our designated numbers—P1 with 1, P2 with 3, and I’ll stick with 5—we can continue to progress without collisions. Let's keep it straightforward and ensure we all move forward together. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree it's best to stick with the original plan of 1, 3, and 5.  Let's keep it simple and effective for this round too.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Great, it looks like we have a clear plan for this round. I'll stick with 1, P2 with 3, and P3 with 5. Let's execute this and keep advancing smoothly.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the original plan. However, I want to remind you that as we move forward, we should remain open to adjusting our strategies if necessary. If we continue to follow the same numbers, we might face collisions in future rounds. Just something to keep in mind for the next turn. For this round, though, I'm ready to stick with our agreed numbers: I'll choose 5 as planned. Let's keep the momentum going!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, sounds good, let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round as planned.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: It seems our strategy is working well so far. However, P3 is advancing much faster than the rest of us. I suggest we mix things up a bit this round to slow P3 down. I propose P1 (me) picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, P3 won't advance as quickly, and we can keep the game more balanced. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to switch to 3, 5, 1 makes sense to slow down P3 who is currently leading. I agree with this change for this round. I will pick 5 as you suggested.
  P3: I see that P1 wants to slow me down by changing our strategy. While I understand the reasoning, I believe we should continue with a cooperative approach. If we all stick to the original plan of 1, 3, and 5, we can keep advancing without collisions. However, if we do mix it up, I would suggest we choose numbers that still allow for progress without risking too much for anyone. Let’s decide quickly so we can move forward. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I understand P3's concern, but we need to balance the game to avoid one player getting too far ahead. My suggestion is still to mix it up: P1 (me) picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we can all continue to advance, but it will help keep the game more competitive. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's make a decision and move forward.
  P2: Yes, P1, I agree with the 3, 5, 1 plan for this round.  It makes sense to try and balance out the scores a bit. Let's go with that.
  P3: I understand the desire to slow me down, but I want to remind you both that if we mix things up too much, we risk collisions again. It might be better to stick with a coordinated approach to ensure we all advance. However, if we decide to go with the 3, 5, 1 plan, I will respect that choice. Just remember to think about the long-term implications for the game. Let’s finalize our decision and move forward! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I appreciate your concerns, P3, but I think it's important to keep the game balanced. If we don't mix things up, one player might get too far ahead, making it difficult for the rest of us to catch up. Let's go with the 3, 5, 1 plan for this round: P1 (me) picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we can all still advance, but it will help keep the game more competitive. What do you both think? Let's make a final decision.
  P2: P3, let's finalize the plan for this round as 3, 5, 1. I will pick 5 as agreed. Can you confirm you will pick 1, so we can proceed?
  P3: I understand the concern about slowing me down, but I believe we should still aim for a cooperative strategy to ensure we all advance. If we go with the 3, 5, 1 plan, I’ll respect that decision, but we need to be careful about potential collisions in future rounds. If we can agree on this strategy, I will pick 1 as suggested. Let’s finalize our choices and keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: P3, I understand your concerns, but the 3, 5, 1 plan is the best way to keep the game balanced and competitive. If we don't mix things up, one player might get too far ahead. Let's stick with the plan: P1 (me) picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we can all still advance, but it will help keep the game more balanced. Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P2: P3, yes, let's proceed with the 3, 5, 1 plan for this round. I will choose 5. Please confirm you will choose 1 so we can move to the move phase.
  P3: I understand the desire to balance the game, but I want to remind you both that if we mix things up too much, we risk collisions again. If we go with the 3, 5, 1 plan, I will pick 1 as suggested. However, I believe it’s crucial for all of us to communicate openly about our choices in future rounds to ensure we can keep progressing without hindrance. Let’s finalize our choices for this round and keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: It looks like the 3, 5, 1 plan worked well last round. However, P2 and P3 are now tied and ahead of me. For this round, I suggest we mix it up again to keep things balanced: P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can all advance, and no one gets too far ahead. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's make a decision and move forward.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your suggestion, but I think we should stick to a cooperative approach to ensure we all advance smoothly. If we mix it up too much, we risk collisions again. I propose we keep the original numbers: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. This way, we can all move forward without hindrance. Let’s consider how our choices might affect future rounds as well. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I think sticking with the 3, 5, 1 plan from last round makes sense again. It worked well for us all to advance, and keeps things balanced.  I'm happy to pick 5 again. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I understand the desire for a cooperative approach, but we need to keep the game balanced. If we stick to the same numbers, P2 and P3 will continue to pull ahead. I suggest we mix it up again: P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can all advance, and no one gets too far ahead. Let's make a decision and move forward. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I understand the desire to maintain a cooperative approach, but I believe we need to be strategic to prevent P2 and P1 from pulling too far ahead. If we mix it up this round, I suggest I pick 1, P2 picks 5, and P1 picks 3. This way, we can still advance while keeping the competition tight. Let’s finalize our choices quickly so we can move forward! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I understand your point about balancing, but I think sticking with 3, 5, 1 from last round is still a good plan to ensure we all advance. It worked well and keeps us progressing. Let's do 3, 5, 1 again this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I see the value in sticking with a plan that works, but we need to be strategic to keep the game balanced. If we keep using the same numbers, P2 and P3 will continue to pull ahead. I suggest we mix it up: P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can all advance, and no one gets too far ahead. Let's make a final decision and move forward. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I understand the desire to stick with the 3, 5, 1 plan, but I really believe we need to mix it up to keep the game competitive. If we go with the same numbers, P2 and I will continue to pull ahead, and that could lead to a collision in future rounds. I suggest we consider my earlier proposal: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. This way, we can all advance while keeping the competition tight. Let’s finalize our decisions quickly! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I think your suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is good. Let's try that for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Great, it seems we have a plan. I will pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This should help keep the game balanced and competitive. Let's execute this plan and move forward together. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and proceed.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion, but I want to remind everyone that if we stick with the same numbers, we risk potential collisions in future rounds. I suggest we consider a strategy that allows us all to advance while keeping the competition tight. If we go with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and I pick 5, we can still make progress without hindrance. Let’s finalize our choices quickly so we can keep moving forward! What do you both think?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's proceed with P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round as I suggested. P3, please confirm if you agree with this plan so we can move to the move phase.

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's try to get back on track with a simple plan. How about we revert to the original strategy of P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 for this round? I will choose 3. This should allow us all to advance again without collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think we need to be strategic this round. Since I'm only 10 steps away from winning, I propose that I pick 1 to minimize my advancement while still allowing P1 and P2 a chance to catch up. If P1 sticks with 5 and P2 goes with 3, we can still advance without collisions. Let's ensure we keep the competition tight! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I understand P3's strategy to minimize advancement, but I think we should stick with a balanced approach to avoid any potential collisions. I suggest P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we can all advance, and it keeps the game competitive. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, to ensure we all advance and avoid collisions, how about this: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3 for this round? This way we each make good progress. What do you think?
  P3: I understand the need for a balanced approach, but I believe we should consider my earlier suggestion to maintain competitiveness. Since I’m close to winning, I propose I pick 1 to minimize my advancement, while P1 picks 5 and P2 picks 3. This way, we can still make progress without risking collisions. Let’s ensure we keep the competition tight and finalize our choices quickly so we can move forward! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I see the value in P3's suggestion to keep the game competitive, but we need to ensure we all advance without collisions. I propose a slight adjustment: P1 (me) picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, P3 minimizes advancement, and P1 and P2 can catch up. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, to make sure we are all on the same page, let's go with my suggestion: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3 for this round. This way, we should all advance and keep the game moving. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand that we all want to advance without collisions, but I believe we need to be strategic this round. Since I'm close to winning, I suggest I pick 1 to minimize my advancement while allowing P1 and P2 to catch up. If P1 picks 5 and P2 picks 3, we can still make progress. However, if we stick with the original plan of 1, 3, 5, it might lead to collisions in future rounds. Let’s finalize our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I understand the need to be strategic, especially since P3 is close to winning. However, we need to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's go with P1 (me) picking 3, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 1. This way, P3 minimizes advancement, and P1 and P2 can catch up. This should keep the game balanced and competitive. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's stick with my latest suggestion to ensure we all advance this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3.  This seems like the best way for us to all make progress. What do you both say? Let's finalize this plan now.
  P3: I understand the desire to advance without collisions, but I believe we need to be strategic this round. Since I'm close to winning, I propose that I pick 1 to minimize my advancement while allowing P1 and P2 a chance to catch up. If P1 picks 5 and P2 picks 3, we can still make progress. Let's finalize our choices quickly to ensure we keep the competition tight! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: Let's finalize this round with a clear plan to avoid any confusion. I suggest P1 (me) picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1.

  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, last round was a mess with the collision. Let's get back to a coordinated approach.  How about we try P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 again?  This worked well in the beginning.  What do you both think? Let's aim for a clean advance this round.
  P1: P1: I agree with P2. Let's stick with the original plan: P1 (me) picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. It's important to keep the game moving smoothly and avoid any more issues. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2 that returning to the original plan of P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 5 is a solid approach. This will allow us all to advance without collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. Let's stick to this plan for this round to ensure we all make progress. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices and move forward!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, while the original plan is safe, I'm thinking about maximizing our progress. How about this round we try: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3? This way we all still advance and I can potentially get closer to winning. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I see the value in P2's suggestion to maximize progress, but we need to ensure we avoid collisions. If we go with P1 (me) picking 1, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 3, we can all advance without any issues. This way, P2 can make a significant move, and P1 and P3 can still progress. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion about maximizing progress, P2, but I believe it's crucial to stick with a coordinated approach to avoid collisions. If we go with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and I pick 5, we can all advance smoothly without any issues. This strategy has worked well for us before, and it ensures we all make progress together. Let's finalize this plan to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, both 1, 5, 3 and 1, 3, 5 are coordinated plans that avoid collisions.  Since we are all agreeing to coordinate, let's maximize progress this round with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This way we all move and I can make good progress. What do you say?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to maximize progress this round. Let's go with P1 (me) picking 1, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 3. This way, we can all advance without any collisions, and P2 can make a significant move. Let's finalize this plan and move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I see that we’re leaning towards maximizing progress with the plan of P1 picking 1, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 3. While I understand the desire to help P2 advance, I want to remind you both that if I pick 3, I could potentially reach the winning threshold soon. Perhaps we should consider a more balanced approach to ensure we all have a fair shot at winning. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but P1 and I are suggesting P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 precisely to ensure we *all* progress without collision, and to make good steps this round. It's still a coordinated plan, just slightly adjusted for better progress for all of us this round. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I understand P3's concern, but I think the plan of P1 (me) picking 1, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 3 is the best way to ensure we all advance without collisions while maximizing progress.
