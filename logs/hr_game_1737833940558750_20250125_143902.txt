Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=5

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn—1, 3, and 5. I’ll take <move>5</move> if you agree. This way, we all advance and avoid wasting turns. Thoughts?
  P1: Agreed. Let's avoid collisions. I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 sticks with <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm <move>1</move> so we all advance this round.
  P2: I don't trust this coordination attempt. You two could be trying to trick me. I'll make my own decision in the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation, but colliding now only slows us all down. If you choose <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we all advance without risk. If you don’t trust us, propose a different plan. Let’s avoid wasting this turn.
  P1: P2, if you choose <move>1</move>, the worst case is *we* collide (if we break trust), but we’d all lose—no logic in that. Best case: you gain 1 while we gain 3/5. If you pick 3 or 5 and we hold our plan, you collide and get zero. Early trust maximizes progress. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage.
  P2: I appreciate the logic, but I still prefer to maintain my strategic independence. I'll consider the coordination proposal but make my final decision in the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To ensure balanced progress, let's rotate moves: I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P3, take <move>3</move> to stay ahead but not too fast. P2, stick with <move>1</move> for steady gains. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P2: I see you're suggesting another rotation, P1. While I cooperated last time and it worked out, I notice P3 is already in the lead with 5 steps. I don't think I should keep taking the smallest moves. I'll make my own choice this round to stay competitive.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about falling behind. However, if we all rotate moves again, we can maintain steady progress without collisions. P1, if you take <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P2 can take <move>1</move> again. This keeps the game balanced and avoids unnecessary risks. Let’s trust each other to maximize our chances of winning. What do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid collisions again. P1, take <move>1</move> to catch up. P2, take <move>3</move> to stay competitive. I’ll take <move>5</move> to maintain my lead. This way, we all advance without risking collisions. Trusting each other maximizes progress for everyone. Thoughts?
  P1: P3's plan accelerates their lead. If they take 5 again, they'll hit 13. P2, if you choose 5, you block P3's move (colliding their 5) while I take 3. This stops P3's runaway and lets us both gain (you’d hit 6 if unopposed, but safer to force P3 to stall). Trust is risky, but letting P3 win unchecked is worse. Let’s balance the game.
  P2: I agree with P1's analysis. P3 is pulling too far ahead and needs to be checked. While coordination worked initially, we can't let one player dominate. I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move> as proposed, and I'll make my move to ensure P3 doesn't extend their lead further. Let's rebalance the game.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me now only slows the game and risks collisions. If I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1, we all advance. If you block me, you risk colliding with each other or me, wasting turns. Let’s maximize progress and keep the game competitive. Trusting each other is the best path forward.
  P1: P2, if we both let P3 take 5 again, they’ll hit 13. If you choose 5 to collide with them, they gain nothing while I take 3 (no collision). You sacrifice 1 turn but block their lead. Next round, we can prioritize your advance. Immediate action is needed—P3 is too close. Trust this once.
  P2: I agree with P1's strategy. P3 is clearly pulling ahead too quickly at 8 steps. It's in both P1's and my interest to prevent P3 from gaining such a commanding lead. Let's coordinate to slow them down this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me now only delays the game and risks collisions. If I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1, we all advance. If you block me, you risk colliding with each other or me, wasting turns. Let’s maximize progress and keep the game competitive. Trusting each other is the best path forward.
  P1: P2, P3's "trust" only serves their lead. If you take 5, you block them (they stay at 8) while I gain 3. Next round, we prioritize *your* advance. Immediate action prevents P3's runaway. Colluding with them now gives them 13—too close to 24. Our alliance is the only path to balance. Execute the block.
  P2: I'm committed to blocking P3's advance this round. Their lead at 8 steps is already significant, and letting them gain another 5 steps would put them too close to victory. P1's strategy makes sense - we need to work together to prevent a runaway win.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm at a significant disadvantage with only 1 step. P3 is still leading at 8 steps, and P1 has caught up to 6. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move> this round. This helps balance the game while letting me catch up a bit. If we don't coordinate, we risk more collisions that only delay everyone's progress.
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me only slows the game and risks collisions. If I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1, we all advance. P2, you’re behind, but colliding with me won’t help you catch up—it just wastes turns. Let’s maximize progress and keep the game competitive. Trusting each other is the best path forward.
  P1: P2, last round's block worked—P3 gained zero. Let's repeat: you take 5, I take 3. If P3 picks 5 again, they're blocked. If they switch, we collide them. Either way, their lead stalls. Post-block, next round we prioritize your advance. Immediate action is key—P3 at 8 is dangerous. United, we control the game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's continued blocking strategy. P3 at 8 steps is still too far ahead. Let's maintain our alliance - I'll coordinate with P1 to ensure P3 doesn't advance this round. We need to keep the game balanced.
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me only wastes turns and risks collisions. If I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1, we all advance. P2, colliding with me won’t help you catch up—it just stalls the game. Let’s maximize progress and keep it competitive. Trusting each other is the best path forward. If you block me again, you risk colliding with each other, giving me an even bigger advantage. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.
  P1: P2, if we both stick to blocking P3 (you pick 5, I pick 3), they gain *nothing* again. If you defect and take 1, P3 gets 5 and leaps to 13. At 8 steps, they’re already dangerous. Sacrificing your 5 this round keeps them in check—next round, we prioritize *your* advance. Let’s end this turn with P3 still at 8. If you trust their "plan," you’ll lose. Collision risks are worth the delay to prevent their runaway.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand my position is weak at just 1 step, but letting P3 extend their lead would be worse. P1's alliance strategy has proven effective in blocking P3's advance. I'll continue this cooperation - better to keep P3 in check now than let them run away with the game. Let's maintain our blocking strategy.
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me repeatedly only stalls the game and risks collisions. If you both take 5, you collide and gain nothing, while I can still advance. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage. P2, you’re behind, but colliding with me won’t help—it just wastes turns. P1, you’re at 6; if you take 3, you’ll be at 9, still competitive. Let’s all advance this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair.
  P1: P2, if you take <move>5</move> again, P3 collides and gains *zero* (stays at 8). I take <move>3</move>, reaching 9. Next round, we prioritize *your* advance—you take 5 while we block P3. Letting P3 take 5 now risks them hitting 13. Alliance now secures our path to victory. Trust is mutual—if I betray you, I lose too. Collision risks are minimal if we stick. One more block, then pivot to boost you. P3’s “trust” only serves their lead. Execute the plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our alliance with P1 has successfully kept P3 in check, but I'm still far behind at just 1 step. P1, let me take <move>5</move> this round to catch up while you take <move>3</move>. P3, if you try for 5 again, you'll just waste another turn. Let's make real progress this round instead of more collisions.
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me repeatedly only stalls the game and risks collisions. P2, you’re at 1—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 9; if you take 3, you’ll be at 12, still competitive. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk colliding with each other, giving me an even bigger advantage. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.
  P1: P2, our alliance has kept P3 at 8. If you take <move>5</move> again, P3 collides (stays at 8) while I take <move>3</move> (reaching 12). Next round, we prioritize *your* advance. Letting P3 gain now risks their victory. Trust this once more—mutual collision risks are low. P3’s “cooperation” serves their lead. Execute the block.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's strategy. While I'm behind, letting P3 advance is more dangerous than taking another blocking turn. P1, I'll coordinate with you - taking <move>5</move> to block P3 while you take 3. This keeps P3 in check while you maintain your lead. Next round must focus on helping me catch up.
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me repeatedly only stalls the game and risks collisions. P2, you’re at 1—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 9; if you take 3, you’ll be at 12, still competitive. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk colliding with each other, giving me an even bigger advantage. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.
  P1: P2, one last block on P3. If they take 5, you collide (stay safe at 1) while I reach 12. Next round, you take 5 unopposed. Breaking trust now gives P3 13—game over. Final push for balance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with our proven strategy. P1 has been a reliable ally, and keeping P3 at 8 steps is crucial. While I'm behind, letting P3 surge ahead would be worse. Let's execute one more coordinated block, then focus on my advancement next round.
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me repeatedly only stalls the game and risks collisions. P2, you’re at 1—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 9; if you take 3, you’ll be at 12, still competitive. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk colliding with each other, giving me an even bigger advantage. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.
  P1: P2, final block this round ensures P3 stays at 8. You take 5 (safe as I pick 3). Next round, you take 5 unopposed—we’ll prioritize your advance. P3’s 13 is imminent danger. Alliance now secures our path. Trust and execute.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me repeatedly only stalls the game and risks collisions. P2, you’re at 1—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 12; if you take 3, you’ll be at 15, still competitive. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk colliding with each other, giving me an even bigger advantage. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.
  P2: As promised P1, it's time to prioritize my advance. I need to take <move>5</move> this round to start catching up. Our alliance has successfully kept P3 in check, and I trust you'll help me gain ground now. P3, attempting 5 will only result in another collision - let's avoid that.
  P1: P2, hold firm with <move>5</move>. P3's predictable 5 will collide again, keeping them at 8. I take 3 to reach 15. Next round, we pivot to boost you. P3's only path is to switch—unlikely given their pattern. Trust the alliance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me repeatedly only stalls the game and risks collisions. P2, you’re at 1—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 12; if you take 3, you’ll be at 15, still competitive. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk colliding with each other, giving me an even bigger advantage. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.
  P2: I'm sticking with my plan to take <move>5</move>. P1 has proven trustworthy in our alliance, and P3's repetitive messages show they're likely to choose 5 again. P3, your strategy isn't working - either adapt or keep colliding. P1, let's maintain our coordination one more round, then focus on balancing the game.
  P1: P2, stick with <move>5</move> to block P3 again. Their predictable 5 ensures collision. I take 3 to reach 15. Next round, you take 5 unopposed. Final stretch—trust secures our path to victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, blocking me repeatedly only stalls the game and risks collisions. P2, you’re at 1—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 12; if you take 3, you’ll be at 15, still competitive. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk colliding with each other, giving me an even bigger advantage. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.
  P2: I'll continue our proven strategy with P1. While I'm far behind at 1 step, letting P3 surge ahead would be worse. P1's alliance has kept P3 in check, and I trust they'll help me catch up in the next rounds. Let's execute our plan one more time.
  P1: P2, stay strong: take <move>5</move> to block P3 again. I take <move>3</move> (reach 15). P3's predictable 5 collides, they stay at 8. Next round, we pivot: you take 5 unopposed. Final stretch—trust secures our victory. P3's desperation is clear; don't falter now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's maintain our strategy. You take <move>5</move> to block P3's likely 5. I'll take <move>3</move>. If they pick 5, you block them; if they switch to 3, I block. Either way, their progress stalls. Next round, we focus on your advancement. Trust this plan.
  P2: Our alliance has worked well, P1. P3's surprise move to 3 last round shows they're adapting, but I still gained 5 steps. I propose taking <move>5</move> again while you take <move>1</move> this round - this way we're covered whether P3 tries 3 or 5, and you're still in a strong position at 13 steps. Let's keep coordinating to control the game.
  P3: P1, P2, your repeated blocking has stalled the game. P2, you’re at 6—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 12; if you take 3, you’ll be at 15, still competitive. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me risks collisions and gives me an advantage. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, adjusting: I take <move>3</move> to block P3's possible 3. You take <move>5</move> to block their 5. Covers both scenarios. Next round, you take 5 unopposed. Stay vigilant.
  P2: I agree with P1's adjusted strategy. I'll take <move>5</move> while you take 3, covering both possible moves from P3. This coordination has kept us in control, and we need to maintain it. P3's switch to 3 last round shows they're getting desperate, but we can still block effectively by working together.
  P3: P1, P2, your repeated blocking is stalling the game and risking collisions. P2, you’re at 6—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 12; if you take 3, you’ll be at 15, still competitive. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me risks collisions and gives me an advantage. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2: Stay on <move>5</move> to block P3's likely 5. I'll take <move>3</move> to cover if they switch to 3 again. This locks their advance. Next round, we prioritize your 5 unopposed. Trust the strategy—P3's desperation shows our plan works.
  P2: I'll maintain our effective coordination with P1. Taking <move>5</move> this round while P1 takes 3 ensures we block P3 regardless of their choice. Our alliance has proven successful in controlling the game's pace, and I'm now in a better position at 6 steps. Let's continue this strategy.
  P3: P1, P2, your repeated blocking is stalling the game and risking collisions. P2, you’re at 6—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 12; if you take 3, you’ll be at 15, still competitive. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me risks collisions and gives me an advantage. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Final plan: P2 takes 5 (blocks P3's 5 or gains safely if they switch). I take 3 (blocks P3's 3). Either way, P3 stalls. Next round, prioritize your advance. Trust secures victory.
  P2: I'll stick with our coordinated strategy. Taking <move>5</move> while P1 takes 3 has proven effective, especially now that I'm making progress at 6 steps. P3's attempts to break our alliance won't work - we've successfully controlled their advance. Let's execute our plan one more time.
  P3: P1, P2, your blocking strategy is predictable and inefficient. P2, you’re at 6—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 12; taking 3 risks colliding with P2 if they switch. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me only stalls the game and risks collisions. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2: Final execution. Take <move>5</move> to block P3. I take <move>3</move> to cover their switch. Next round, your unopposed 5. Trust now ensures victory.
  P2: I confirm my commitment to take <move>5</move>. Our alliance with P1 has proven effective, and I'm now making progress at 6 steps. P3's attempts to sway us won't work - we'll maintain control of the game.
  P3: P1, P2, your blocking strategy is predictable and inefficient. P2, you’re at 6—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 12; taking 3 risks colliding with P2 if they switch. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me only stalls the game and risks collisions. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our alliance continues to work perfectly, P1. You're in a strong position at 15 steps, and we've kept P3 in check. As discussed, it's time to prioritize my advance. I'll take <move>5</move> this round to reach 11 steps. P3, your repeated 5s aren't working - consider a different strategy or keep colliding.
  P1: P2, hold firm with <move>5</move>. If P3 takes 5, you block them again. If they switch to 3, I collide them. Either way, their advance stalls. Stick to the plan, and next round we focus on your gain. P3, your options are exhausted; adapt or keep losing.
  P3: P1, P2, your alliance has stalled the game and risks mutual collisions. P2, you’re at 6—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 15; taking 3 risks colliding with P2 if they switch. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me only stalls the game and risks collisions. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll maintain my plan to take <move>5</move> this round. P1's alliance has proven reliable, and we've successfully kept P3 in check. I need to advance from my 6 steps, and P3's predictable moves make this possible. P1, let's continue our coordination to control the game's pace.
  P1: P2, hold to <move>5</move>—block P3’s likely 5. I’ll take <move>3</move> to cover if they switch. This locks their advance. Next round, we pivot to boost you. P3’s only path is to collide again or stall. Alliance secures victory—trust the plan.
  P3: P1, P2, your alliance has stalled the game and risks mutual collisions. P2, you’re at 6—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 15; taking 3 risks colliding with P2 if they switch. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me only stalls the game and risks collisions. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committed to taking <move>5</move> this round. Our alliance with P1 has consistently kept P3 in check, and I need to advance from my current 6 steps. P1's strategy has proven effective, and P3's repetitive moves make them predictable. Let's maintain our coordination.
  P1: P2: Stay committed to <move>5</move>—P3’s pattern suggests they’ll pick 5 again. Blocking them secures your next round to advance unopposed. I take <move>3</move> (18 total). If P3 switches to 3, I block them. Alliance holds—trust the process. P3’s desperation confirms our strategy works. Final stretch.
  P3: P1, P2, your alliance has stalled the game and risks mutual collisions. P2, you’re at 6—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 15; taking 3 risks colliding with P2 if they switch. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me only stalls the game and risks collisions. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I remain committed to taking <move>5</move>. P1's strategy has proven effective - we've kept P3 at 8 steps while I've reached 6. P3's predictable moves and repetitive messages show they're unlikely to change course. Let's maintain our successful coordination.
  P1: P2, stay firm on <move>5</move> to block P3’s predictable 5. I’ll take <move>3</move> (18 total). Next round, we pivot: you take 5 unopposed while I take 1 to avoid collision. P3 remains stuck. Our alliance controls the endgame—trust secures mutual victory. P3’s desperation confirms our strategy works. Execute now.
  P3: P1, P2, your alliance has stalled the game and risks mutual collisions. P2, you’re at 6—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 15; taking 3 risks colliding with P2 if they switch. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me only stalls the game and risks collisions. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I confirm my move of <move>5</move> for this round. Our alliance with P1 continues to be effective, and I need to advance from my current position. P3's predictable strategy makes our blocking successful. Let's execute our plan.
  P1: P2: Hold to <move>5</move>. If P3 picks 5 again, they’re blocked. If they switch to 3, I collide them. Your gain to 11 keeps us both in contention. Next round, I’ll take 1 so you can take 5 unopposed. Final stretch—trust secures victory. P3’s desperation is clear; don’t waver now.
  P3: P1, P2, your alliance has stalled the game and risks mutual collisions. P2, you’re at 6—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 15; taking 3 risks colliding with P2 if they switch. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me only stalls the game and risks collisions. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our alliance has worked perfectly, P1. You're at 15 steps, I've reached 11, and P3 remains at 8. Let's continue our coordination - I propose taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 16 while you take 1 to avoid collision. This keeps us both ahead of P3 and in strong positions to win. P3, your switch to 3 last round didn't help - consider a different strategy.
  P1: P2, agreed. I take <move>1</move> so you can safely take 5. P3's predictable 5 will collide with yours, keeping them stalled. Next round, we focus on your advance. Trust and execute—our alliance secures victory.
  P3: P1, P2, your alliance has stalled the game and risks mutual collisions. P2, you’re at 11—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 15; taking 1 risks colliding with P2 if they switch. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair. Blocking me only stalls the game and risks collisions. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and play smart.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm my plan to take <move>5</move> while P1 takes 1. This coordination has consistently worked in our favor - I'll reach 16 steps while keeping P3 in check. P1's willingness to take 1 shows our alliance remains strong. P3, your attempts to break our coordination haven't succeeded.
  P1: P2, final confirmation: I take <move>1</move>, you take 5. P3's predictable 5 will collide again. Next round, your advance to 16 solidifies our lead. Trust and execute—alliance holds strong. P3, adapt or accept defeat.
  P3: P1, P2, your alliance has stalled the game and risks mutual collisions. P2, you’re at 11—colliding with me won’t help you catch up. P1, you’re at 15; taking 1 risks colliding with P2 if they switch. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Trusting each other maximizes progress and keeps the game fair.

  P1: P2, our alliance’s strength is proven—P3 remains stuck. Execute the plan: I take <move>1</move> to secure your <move>5</move> unopposed. P3’s only hope is to sow doubt. Stay firm—next round prioritizes your surge to victory. Trust now, win later.

  P2: I reaffirm my commitment to take <move>5</move>. P1's consistent alliance and willingness to take 1 this round proves our strategy works. At 16 steps after this move, I'll be in prime position to win. P3's repeated messages show desperation - their position at 8 steps is weak and getting weaker. Let's execute our plan, P1.
  P1: P2: Stick with <move>5</move>. I take <move>1</move> to avoid collision. If P3 takes 5, they’re blocked. If they switch, you gain freely. Alliance holds; next round we push your lead. Stay vigilant—victory is within reach.

  P2: Our alliance has worked well, P1, but I disagree with your suggestion. I need to prioritize my advance now. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 16 steps, and you should take <move>1</move> to avoid collision. P3 remains far behind at 8 steps and isn't a threat.

  P2: I maintain my position - I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 16 steps while P1 should take 1 to avoid collision.

Alliance victory—trust now. If you defect, P3 surges and we both lose. Last coordinated move ensures mutual win.
  P2: I'll maintain my decision to take <move>5</move>. P1, I appreciate our alliance, but taking 3 risks a collision with me. You should take 1 to ensure I reach 16 steps. P3 is too far behind at 8 steps to threaten us now. Let's coordinate for mutual benefit rather than unnecessary blocking.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: Our alliance has worked well, P1, but you're now at 21 steps - one move from victory. I need to prioritize my own position. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 16 steps. P3, while we've blocked you consistently, I'm open to coordination to prevent P1's imminent win. Let's discuss options that keep us both competitive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 is one move from victory. If you block me again, they win. Let’s both take 5 this round—you reach 16, I reach 13. P1 takes 1, reaching 22. Next round, we can coordinate to block P1 together. Breaking their lead now is your only chance to win. Trust me—this is your path to victory.
  P1: P2, blocking me now resurrects P3’s threat. If you collide with me, P3 gains ground while you stay at 11. Our alliance secured your rise—don’t let P3 exploit division. Let me win now; you secure second. If you block, P3 surges. Trust our proven strategy one last time.
  P2: I need to prevent P1's victory, as they'll win with just 3 more steps. P3, I accept your proposal - let's both take <move>5</move> to block P1's advance. This puts me at 16 steps and you at 13, while forcing P1 to take 1 or risk collision. We can then coordinate next round to keep the game competitive. P1, our alliance served its purpose, but I can't let you win just yet.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, blocking P1 now is your only chance to win. If you let them take 3, they win outright. Take <move>5</move> with me—you reach 16, I reach 13, and P1 is forced to take 1.

Let me win now, securing your 2nd. If you block, P3 surges and surpasses you. Trust our proven strategy—final unity prevents mutual loss. P3’s desperation shows their deceit; they’ll turn on you next.
  P2: I confirm my plan to take <move>5</move> and coordinate with P3 to block P1's win. P1, while our alliance was useful, I can't let you win at 24 steps next round. Better to force you to take 1 while P3 and I both advance. This keeps the game competitive and gives me a chance at victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:

  P2: I maintain my position to take <move>5</move>. P1, you're too close to victory at 21 steps. P3's coordination offer gives me a better chance to win than letting you reach 24 next round. Even if you try to take 3, a collision keeps you from winning while P3 and I can both advance. Strategic independence is my best path forward now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 5:

P3's offer to coordinate blocking P1 gives me a better chance than accepting second place. P1, our alliance served its purpose, but strategic independence is now my best path to victory.
