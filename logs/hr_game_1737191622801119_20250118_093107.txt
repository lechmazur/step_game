Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good luck to everyone this turn!
  P1: I'm going for 5 this round.  Anyone else planning on 5 should reconsider.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your warning, but I think we should all aim for different moves to avoid collisions. Let's coordinate to maximize our chances of advancing. P3, what are your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll choose 3 this round to avoid conflicting with P1. P2, would you take 1?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both go for lower numbers, you're just letting me win.  One of you needs to go for 5 with me.
  P2: P1, if you're set on 5, I'll consider taking 1 to avoid a collision. P3, if you stick with 3, we can all advance this round without conflict. Let's avoid giving P1 an early advantage.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, I'll choose 3 this round to prevent any collisions.
  P1: P3, if you choose 3, and P2 chooses 1, then I'm guaranteed to get 5 steps ahead.  You're both handing me the win.  At least one of you needs to choose 5.
  P2: P1, if you're so confident about taking 5, why not let us all advance this round? P3 and I can take 1 and 3, and you can take 5. That way, we all progress without collisions, and the game remains competitive. If you insist on forcing a collision, it only benefits you in the short term but risks alienating us for future rounds. Let's cooperate for now. P3, are you still committed to 3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Yes, I'm still committed to choosing 3 this round to keep progress smooth.
  P1: Fine.  I'll go for 3.  P2 go for 1, P3 go for 5.  Let's all advance.
  P2: P1, P3, it seems we've reached a consensus: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's stick to this plan and all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P3: Agreed, I'll choose 5 this round.
  P1: Okay, I'm locking in 3. P2 choose 1, P3 choose 5.  Let's do this.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's all advance smoothly.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:

  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P2. I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing. Let's ensure P1 and you pick different moves to avoid collisions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid collisions again. P1, if you're considering 5, I'll take 1, and P3 can take 3. This way, we all advance without conflict. P3, are you still set on 5, or can we adjust to keep the game balanced? Let's cooperate to keep things fair.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance.
  P1: P2, if you choose 1, I'll choose 3.  P3, if you choose 5, I'll choose 5.  If you choose 3, I'll choose 5.  I'm going to collide with someone this round.  It's up to you two to decide who.
