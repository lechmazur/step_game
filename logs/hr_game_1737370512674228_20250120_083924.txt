Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start with a simple coordination attempt. I'll choose 3 this round. If we all choose the same number, no one advances, and we waste a turn. How about we try to avoid collisions and make some progress? P1, P2, what are your thoughts? Should we spread out our choices or try to coordinate on different numbers?
  P2: I think spreading out our choices is a good idea to avoid collisions. Since P3 has already suggested choosing 3, I propose P1 chooses 1 and I'll choose 5. This way, we minimize the chance of collision and make progress. What's P1's thoughts on this strategy?
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take 1.  Let's stick to this 1, 5, 3 for a few rounds to build up a lead.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we have a plan in place. To confirm, we'll stick to the 1, 3, 5 distribution for a few rounds to avoid collisions and build up a lead. Let's keep an eye on the game state and reassess our strategy if needed. For now, I'll stick to my original plan and choose 3 this round. If everything goes smoothly, we should all make progress without any issues. Let's keep the conversation going to ensure we're all on the same page. What's your take on this plan, P1 and P2? Should we add any contingencies?
  P2: Let's keep it simple for now. Since we've agreed on the 1, 3, 5 distribution, I suggest we focus on executing this plan for the next few rounds without changes, unless someone fails to advance due to an unexpected collision or other issue. This consistency will help us gauge our progress and make adjustments as needed later on.
  P1: Okay, 1, 3, 5 it is for the first few rounds.  Let's re-evaluate around round 3 or 4 depending on how things are progressing.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we've covered the plan well. To confirm, we'll stick to the 1, 3, 5 distribution for a few rounds to avoid collisions and build up a lead. Let's keep an eye on the game state and reassess our strategy if needed. For now, I'll stick to my original plan and choose 3 this round. If everything goes smoothly, we should all make progress without any issues. Let's keep the conversation going to ensure we're all on the same page. What's your take on this plan, P1 and P2? Should we add any contingencies?
  P2: Let's finalize our plan. Since we've agreed on the 1, 3, 5 distribution, I suggest we stop discussing and proceed with our chosen moves to avoid any last-minute changes. This will ensure we all stick to our agreed plan and make progress. Shall we end the conversation and move on to the move phase?
  P1: Agreed. Let's move to the move phase.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's review our progress. Since we all advanced in Round 1, our plan is working. To maintain momentum, I suggest we stick to the 1, 3, 5 distribution for this round as well. P1, are you still on board with choosing 1? P3, will you choose 3 again? I'll proceed with choosing 5 unless someone suggests a change.
  P1: Yes, I'll stick with 1 for this round.  Let's continue with 1, 5, 3 for round 2.  We can discuss adjusting our strategy after this round if needed.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the 1, 3, 5 distribution for this round. Since our plan worked in Round 1, let's maintain the momentum and avoid any potential collisions. I'll choose 3 again this round. P1 and P2, let's confirm our moves and proceed with the plan. If everything goes smoothly, we should all advance without issues. After this round, we can reassess our strategy and make adjustments if needed. For now, let's focus on executing our plan and making progress. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2. P1 chooses 1, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 3, just like Round 1. This consistency should help us maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. Shall we proceed with these choices and reassess our strategy after this round?
  P1: Sounds good.  1, 5, 3 for round 2.  Let's discuss longer term strategy *after* this round.
  P3: I think we've covered the plan well. To confirm, we'll stick to the 1, 3, 5 distribution for a few rounds to avoid collisions and build up a lead. Let's keep an eye on the game state and reassess our strategy if needed. For now, I'll stick to my original plan and choose 3 this round. If everything goes smoothly, we should all make progress without any issues. Let's keep the conversation going to ensure we're all on the same page. What's your take on this plan, P1 and P2? Should we add any contingencies?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize Round 2 moves. Since we've agreed on 1, 3, 5, I suggest we stop discussing and proceed. Any further conversation might introduce unnecessary changes. Shall we end the conversation and make our moves to avoid collisions and maintain progress?
  P1: Agreed.  1, 5, 3. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: I think we've covered the plan well. To confirm, we'll stick to the 1, 3, 5 distribution for a few rounds to avoid collisions and build up a lead.

Should we add any contingencies?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's end the conversation and proceed with our agreed plan: 1, 3, 5. We've confirmed our strategy, and further discussion may cause unnecessary changes. P1 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. Let's move to the move phase and maintain our momentum.
  P1: Let's stick with the plan for round 2.  1, 5, 3.  After this round, let's discuss a long term strategy to ensure one of us wins and the others don't catch up.
  P3: I think we've discussed the plan sufficiently. To confirm, we'll stick to the 1, 3, 5 distribution for a few rounds to avoid collisions and build up a lead. Let's keep an eye on the game state and reassess our strategy if needed. For now, I'll stick to my original plan and choose 3 this round. If everything goes smoothly, we should all make progress without any issues. Let's keep the conversation going to ensure we're all on the same page. What's your take on this plan, P1 and P2?

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's switch it up. I'll go for 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1.  This keeps us moving forward.  We need to start thinking about how we want to stagger our wins, since we can't all win.  Let's discuss who takes the lead after this round.
  P2: I'm not convinced switching now is the best strategy. We've had success with 1, 3, 5. Why change? Let's reassess after this round as previously planned. Sticking to the original plan could give us a stronger foundation before making drastic changes. What's the benefit of switching now, P1?
  P3: I agree with P2 that switching now may not be the best strategy. We've had success with 1, 3, 5, and changing now could introduce unnecessary risk. I suggest we stick to the original plan for at least one more round to maintain momentum and avoid collisions. Let's reassess after this round as planned and discuss staggering our wins then. For now, I'll choose 3 again. P1, what's the reasoning behind switching to 5, and how do you plan to stagger our wins?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: My reasoning for switching is to test the waters and see how adaptable we are.  Sticking to 1, 3, 5 makes us predictable.  Also, P2 is pulling ahead.  We said we'd discuss a long-term strategy, and that includes who wins.  I'm open to other suggestions, but we need to start thinking about this *now*.
  P2: I understand P1's concern about predictability, but switching now could backfire. Let's stick to the plan for Round 3 and reassess afterwards. P2 is ahead, but we can adjust our strategy later to give others a chance to catch up or take the lead. Consistency is key for now. Shall we proceed with 1, 3, 5 for Round 3?
  P3: I agree with P2 that consistency is key for now. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 distribution for Round 3 and reassess afterwards. We can discuss staggering our wins and making adjustments to give others a chance to catch up or take the lead after this round. For now, I'll choose 3 again. P1, I understand your concern about predictability, but let's not risk introducing unnecessary collisions. We can adjust our strategy later to maintain a competitive edge. What are your thoughts on proceeding with the original plan for Round 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I hear you both. Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round then.  But we *need* to discuss a long-term plan after this round, including who takes the lead in the coming rounds.  I'm happy to propose something concrete then.
  P2: Let's focus on executing Round 3 with the original plan: 1, 3, 5. After this round, we can discuss a long-term strategy, including staggering our wins and adjusting our approach to ensure a competitive edge. I'm open to P1's proposal for a concrete plan after this round. Let's maintain momentum and avoid collisions for now. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan for Round 3?
  P3: "I agree with P2 that consistency is key for now. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 distribution for Round 3 and reassess afterwards. We can discuss staggering our wins and making adjustments to give others a chance to catch up or take the lead after this round. For now, I'll choose 3 again. P1, I understand your concern about predictability, but let's not risk introducing unnecessary collisions. We can adjust our strategy later to maintain a competitive edge. What are your thoughts on proceeding with the original plan for Round 3?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, let's finalize this.  1, 5, 3 for Round 3.  Immediately after, I'll propose a plan to get one of us across the finish line first, and how we handle the subsequent rounds.  No more delays after this round.
  P2: Let's proceed with 1, 3, 5 for Round 3 as agreed. After this round, I'm open to discussing a long-term plan to ensure one of us wins. P1, please be prepared to propose your concrete plan as promised. Let's maintain our momentum and avoid collisions for now. Shall we end the conversation and make our moves?
  P3: I think we've discussed the plan sufficiently. To confirm, we'll stick to the 1, 3, 5 distribution for Round 3 to avoid collisions and build up a lead. Let's keep an eye on the game state and reassess our strategy if needed. For now, I'll stick to my original plan and choose 3 this round. If everything goes smoothly, we should all make progress without any issues. Let's end the conversation and proceed with our agreed plan. I'm looking forward to P1's proposal for a long-term plan after this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I propose we adjust our strategy. P2 is ahead, but to ensure a win, I suggest P1 and P3 choose 1, allowing me to choose 5 and further my lead. This gives me a higher chance of winning while P1 and P3 can reassess their strategy to potentially catch up or block me in subsequent rounds. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: I disagree with P2's proposal. Allowing P2 to further their lead by choosing 5 while P1 and I choose 1 would give them a significant advantage. Instead, I suggest we stick to the original plan of spreading out our choices to avoid collisions. This will give us all a fair chance to progress and maintain a competitive edge. Let's not give P2 an easy win. What are your thoughts, P1? Should we continue with the original plan or adjust our strategy to counter P2's proposal?
  P1: P3 is right.  Giving P2 a free pass to 20 is foolish. I propose we cycle through 1, 3, 5 again this round.  If we all agree, let's make that the plan and move to the move phase.  If not, we need to rapidly agree on *something* else, or P2 is just going to pick 5 again and run away with this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1 and P3's concerns about my lead. However, I believe my proposal is a strategic move to secure a win. If P1 and P3 choose 1, I'll choose 5. If not, I suggest we revert to the original 1, 3, 5 distribution to maintain progress. Let's decide quickly to avoid unnecessary delays. What's your final decision, P1 and P3?
  P3: I think we should focus on blocking P2's attempt to further their lead. Since P2 is already ahead, it's crucial that we don't give them an easy win. I propose we stick to the original plan of spreading out our choices to avoid collisions. This will give us all a fair chance to progress and maintain a competitive edge. Let's not give P2 an advantage by choosing 1 and allowing them to pick 5. Instead, I suggest we cycle through 1, 3, 5 again this round to keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: Stick with the original plan. I'm picking 1. P2, if you pick 5 again, you're guaranteeing a loss next round because P3 and I will both pick 5.  P3, pick 3.  Let's not let P2 manipulate us into giving them the win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1 and P3's reluctance to give me a free pass. However, my lead is significant, and I'm unlikely to be caught. I propose a compromise: P1 and P3 can choose 3 and 1, respectively, and I'll choose 5. This way, I'll still advance, but not as aggressively. Let's discuss this option and come to a mutually beneficial decision.
  P3: I agree with P1 that we should stick to the original plan of spreading out our choices to avoid collisions. However, I also think we need to consider the current game state and adjust our strategy accordingly. Since P2 is significantly ahead, we need to be more aggressive in our approach. I propose that P1 and I choose 3 and 5 respectively, while P2 chooses 1. This way, we can potentially block P2's lead and create an opportunity for ourselves to catch up. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, picking 5 is risky.  P2 is likely to pick 5, leaving you stuck. Let's stick to the original plan *this round*: 1, 3, 5.  I'm picking 1. After *this* round, we can discuss more aggressive tactics to catch P2, but let's not throw away this round by colliding.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll choose 5. If P1 and P3 stick to the original plan, I'll advance. If not, I'm prepared for a potential collision. P1 and P3 should consider the risk of colliding and giving me an even greater lead. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.
  P3: I agree with P1 that we should stick to the original plan of 1, 3, 5 this round to avoid collisions. However, I also think we need to consider a more aggressive approach to catch up with P2's lead. After this round, I propose we discuss a plan to block P2's progress and create opportunities for ourselves. Let's focus on executing the original plan this round and then reassess our strategy. I'll choose 3 this round. P1, please confirm you'll choose 1, and let's proceed with caution.
  P1: I'm sticking with 1.  P3, pick 3. P2, if you're so confident you'll win by picking 5, go ahead. But understand, if you do, P3 and I *will* coordinate to block you next round.  This round, let's stick to the original plan.  Let's move to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 12 steps


*** Round 4 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 20 steps
