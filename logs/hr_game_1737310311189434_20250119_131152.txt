Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I'm going for 5 this round.  I suggest P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This way we all advance.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think it's best if we all make our own choices. I'll be going for <move>1</move> this round to play it safe. Let's see what happens.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we all picked different numbers last time, let's try that again. I'll go for 3 this round. P1, how about 1?  P3, you could take 5.  This keeps us all moving forward.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I agree with P2's strategy to avoid collisions. I'll go for <move>1</move> again this round to keep things simple and safe. Let's see if we can all advance without any issues.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good P1. P3, if you take 5 this round, you'll be at 8, I'll be at 8, and P1 will be at 2.  Next round, one of us can go for 5, the other for 3, and P1 can take 1 again to get to 3.  We can keep leapfrogging like this.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I think P2's plan is solid and it helps us all advance without collisions. I'll stick with <move>1</move> this round. P3, if you go for 5, we can all move forward and keep the game progressing smoothly. Let's avoid any unnecessary risks.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I'll simplify.  P3, if you choose anything other than 5 this round, you are actively choosing to slow everyone down, including yourself.  Let's keep this efficient.  I'm sticking with 3. P1 is taking 1.  Your move.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P1: I understand the importance of coordination to avoid collisions. I'll stick with <move>1</move> this round. P3, it's in your best interest to choose <move>5</move> to maximize your progress and keep the game moving forward efficiently. Let's all advance without issues.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand you might be hesitant to follow a prescribed strategy. However, consider this: if we coordinate effectively, we all reach a higher score.  A guaranteed 8 is better than a possible 0 if you collide with me or P1.  Choose 5 and let's continue this efficient progression.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P1: P3, it's clear that coordination benefits all of us. If you choose <move>5</move> this round, you'll be at 8, and we can continue to advance efficiently. I'm sticking with <move>1</move>. Let's avoid any unnecessary collisions and keep the game moving forward. Your move, P3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I understand you're probably trying to figure out the best long-term strategy.  But overthinking this early stage is risky.  Take the guaranteed advancement.  Choose 5.  Let's get to higher numbers where the real strategy comes into play.  If you don't choose 5, I'm switching my strategy next round and focusing on blocking you.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, it's clear that coordination is key to avoid collisions and make steady progress. If you choose <move>5</move> this round, you'll be at 8, and we can continue to advance efficiently. I'm sticking with <move>1</move>. Let's avoid any unnecessary risks and keep the game moving forward. Your move, P3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P3, last chance.  Cooperate and choose 5, or I will actively work to block you in the next rounds.  This isn't a bluff.  I'd rather see P1 win than you if you're going to be difficult.  Let's all get to the interesting part of the game.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, it's been a while, and I think it's time to make a move. If you choose <move>5</move> this round, you'll be at 8, and we can all continue to advance without issues. I'm sticking with <move>1</move>. Let's avoid any unnecessary risks and keep the game moving forward. Your move, P3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, it seems P3 is not interested in coordinating. I suggest we focus on advancing ourselves without worrying about P3. I'll go for <move>3</move> this round to try and catch up. P2, if you go for <move>5</move>, you'll be at 10, and I'll be at 5. This way, we can both make significant progress. P3, if you want to join us, you can take <move>1</move> to avoid a collision. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P3, you chose to collide with me last round.  That was a mistake.  Now, I'm going to prioritize winning, even if it means blocking you completely.  P1, let's cooperate. I'll take 5 this round. You take 3.  We'll alternate 3 and 5 from here on out.  P3, you're on your own.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I agree with your strategy to focus on advancing ourselves. I'll go for <move>3</move> this round to make significant progress. P3, if you want to avoid being blocked, you should consider joining our coordination or taking a different path. Let's see how this plays out. P2, if you take <move>5</move>, we can both make strong moves and keep the game interesting.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 5. Let's alternate 5 and 3 to the finish line. P3, if you choose 1, you'll at least make some progress.  If you pick 3 or 5, you're only hurting yourself.  I'm serious about blocking you if you interfere with me or P1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm on board with your plan to alternate between 5 and 3. I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round to make significant progress. P3, if you want to avoid being blocked, you should take <move>1</move> this round. Let's see how this plays out. P2, if you take <move>5</move>, we can both advance efficiently and keep the game moving forward.
  P2: P1, confirming I'm going with 5.  Let's stick to the 5/3 alternation. P3, seriously, just take 1.  You're not going to win by colliding with us repeatedly.  Let us get on with it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm fully aligned with your strategy. I'll go for <move>3</move> this round to make significant progress. P3, if you want to avoid being blocked and make some progress, take <move>1</move>. Let's see how this plays out. P2, if you take <move>5</move>, we can both advance efficiently and keep the game moving forward. P3, it's in your best interest to cooperate. Your move.
  P2: P1, locking in 5.  Let's maintain the 5/3 alternation.  P3, you're wasting everyone's time.  Take 1 and limp along, or keep colliding and stay where you are.  It makes no difference to me.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm fully committed to the 5/3 alternation strategy. I'll go for <move>3</move> this round to make significant progress.
