Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1, P2, let's try to avoid collisions this first round. How about we each pick a different move number? What do you think?
  P2: Sure, let’s each pick a different number. P1 can take 1, P3 can take 5, and I’ll take 3. Then none of us collide. What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed, but P3 taking 5 gives them an early lead. Let's rotate who picks 5 each round to balance progress. For Round 1, I'll take 1 as proposed. Next round, we switch assignments. Fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, rotation sounds reasonable to keep things balanced. I agree with the move assignments for this round: P1 will take 1, P2 will take 3, and I will take 5. Let's plan the rotation for the next round after this one.
  P2: I’m fine with that plan for Round 1. Next round, let’s keep rotating so no one gets too big of a lead. How about we decide who takes which number for Round 2 once this round is done?
  P1: Let's plan Round 2 now to avoid future collisions. Since P3 took 5 this round, next round I'll propose: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then rotate again each round—this keeps progress balanced. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, your Round 2 plan sounds good too: P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and I take 1.  Rotating like this seems fair for the first couple of rounds.
  P2: Alright, let’s lock in our Round 1 moves as proposed. Then next round, we’ll follow P1’s idea: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps everything balanced so far. Ready to move?
  P1: [End of turn, confirming the agreed rotation to maintain cooperation. Stopping here to proceed to moves as planned, ensuring others follow through while setting up future opportunities to gain an advantage.]


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1, sounds like we are all set for moves this round based on the plan. Let's proceed.
  P2: I’m all set for the moves we agreed on. Let’s finalize and proceed now.
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round 2 moves per our rotation: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let's continue rotating next round: Round 3, P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps progress balanced. Stick to the plan to avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P3: Okay P1, your Round 2 plan sounds good. Let's stick with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 for this round as we discussed. Rotating like this for now seems reasonable.
  P2: I’m fine with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1 this round. However, we should watch the overall progress carefully. If someone gets too far ahead, we might need to adjust our plan to keep the competition balanced. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P2's caution is wise. Let's confirm Round 2 moves (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) as agreed. Post-Round 2, we’ll all be at 6. To prevent any single lead, propose Round 3: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1—rotating 5 fairly. This ensures balanced progress. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay P1, Round 3 plan sounds good too. Let's aim for P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P1 taking 1 for Round 3.  And yes P2, good point to watch our progress. Let's re-assess after Round 3 to ensure we're still balanced.
  P2: I’m still fine with Round 2 as planned: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Then Round 3, I’ll pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. Let’s stay alert for any big leads or sneaky collisions. Anyone have more to add?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Confirmed. Round 2 moves: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Round 3: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let's proceed to moves.
  P3: Okay P1, P2, sounds like we are all aligned on the moves for Round 2 and Round 3. Let's proceed with Round 2 moves as planned: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1.  Ready when you are.
  P2: I’m still good with our Round 2 plan of P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1. Then Round 3, I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let’s trust each other to avoid collisions. Anything else before we wrap up?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** Final confirmation: Round 2 moves as agreed (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). Trust is key. Let's proceed to moves.
  P3: Okay P1, P2, we're all set for Round 2 moves as planned.  For Round 4, let's keep rotating: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.  Ready to move when you are.
  P2: I’m ready to follow the Round 2 plan: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. But let’s stay vigilant: if someone breaks our rotation or tries to surge ahead, we’ll need to react quickly. For now, I see no reason to deviate, so let's finalize and move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round 3 moves per prior agreement: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Trust and adherence are key to avoid collisions. Let's proceed.
  P2: I’m still on board with our Round 3 arrangement: me taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P1 taking 1. We’re all tied, so let’s keep trust strong—no collisions. After this round, I suggest we reassess. I want to ensure we stay balanced without letting anyone sprint too far ahead. Ready to proceed?
  P3: Okay P1, P2, I agree with the Round 3 moves: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's proceed with this round as planned. After this round, let's discuss our strategy for winning, as we are all progressing at the same pace.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** Post-Round 3, let's allocate 5 to the lowest player to balance progress. I'll be at 7, so Round 4: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This equalizes totals. Future rounds follow the same logic. Prevents runaway leads. Agreed?
  P2: I agree to Round 3 as planned: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Afterward, let’s reassess carefully. Constantly giving 5 to the lowest player might keep totals tied, which could get messy near the end. But for now, let’s stick to the current plan. I’m ready to move.
  P3: Okay P1, Round 3 moves as planned: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1.  Your Round 4 proposal of P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 1 also sounds reasonable for now to keep us balanced. Let's proceed with Round 3 moves and then we can discuss strategy after this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round 3 moves: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Post-Round 3, proceed with Round 4 as planned (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) to balance totals. Strict adherence prevents collisions and ensures fair progress. Any deviation risks mutual blocks. Let’s stay disciplined. Ready to move.
  P2: I’m sticking to our plan this round: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. After that, let’s reassess and ensure no one surges ahead too quickly. Agreed?
  P3: Okay P1, P2, Round 3 moves are set: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let's proceed with these moves and then we can discuss strategy for later rounds after this one, as we've all suggested.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round 4 moves: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 to balance at 12 each. Post-Round 4, let's continue rotation: Round 5 P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Round 6 P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This maintains fairness. Any objections?
  P3: Okay P1, your Round 4 and Round 5 rotation plan sounds good to me. Let's proceed with Round 4: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 and then Round 5: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 as you suggested.
  P2: I’m still on board with Round 4 as stated: P1=5, P3=3, and I’ll take 1. That puts us all at 12 afterward. But let’s remain vigilant. If we keep tying, someone might jump unexpectedly. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P2, vigilance is wise, but deviating now risks mutual collisions and stalls progress. Let's strictly follow Round 4's agreed moves (P1:5, P3:3, P2:1) to reach 12 each. Post-Round 4, we’ll strategize endgame balancing. Discipline ensures we all advance—no rogue surges. Proceed as planned?
  P3: P1, your Round 4 and 5 plans sound good for balanced progress.  Let's proceed with Round 4 moves as you suggested (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1).  After this round, maybe we can discuss how to shift from balanced progress to a winning strategy as we get closer to the target.
  P2: I’m still good with our Round 4 plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I pick 1. That puts us all at 12. Afterward, let’s re-evaluate carefully so no one can jump too far ahead. I’m ready to move when you both are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round 4 moves as agreed. Post-Round 4, let's shift strategy: **P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, **P3 takes 1** in Round 5. This creates staggered progress to avoid endgame ties while maintaining collision safety. Post-Round 5, we can rotate 5 again. Objections?
  P3: Okay P1, Round 4 plan sounds good to balance us at 12 each. For Round 5, instead of P1 taking 5 again, how about we rotate who gets the 5?  Maybe for Round 5, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This keeps the staggered progress idea but shifts the advantage around a bit. What do you think?
  P2: I see your point, P3. Let’s finalize Round 4 as planned—P1 taking 5, you taking 3, and I’ll take 1—so we all reach 12. After we see the updated positions, we can decide if you taking 5 in Round 5 is best. I want to ensure no one leaps too far ahead. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** Post-Round 4, all at 12. Round 5: Let’s resume rotation—**P3 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, **P1 takes 1**. This maintains balance and trust. Any deviation risks mutual blocks. Agreed?
  P3: Okay P1, the Round 4 and Round 5 rotations sound good and keep us balanced for now. Let's proceed with Round 4 moves as planned (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1).  Round 5 rotation (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) also seems reasonable for the next step. Let's move when ready.
  P2: I’m still fine giving P1 the 5 this round to keep trust and avoid blocking each other. Let’s stick with the plan: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. Then we rotate next round as agreed. If we keep our word, no one wastes a turn colliding. I’m ready to move if you both are.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That collision set us back. Let’s realign with the original Round 5 plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1, so nobody collides. Then we’ll have P2 at 14, P3 at 14, and P1 at 13. Next round, we keep rotating fairly. If anyone deviates, we risk mutual blocking and lose ground. Let’s stick together so we can all advance.
  P1: **P1:** P2, your Round 4 deviation caused a collision, breaking trust. To correct this: **P2 takes 1**, **P3 takes 3**, and **I take 5** this round. Restoring fairness prevents mutual destruction. Sticking to this plan ensures progress. Any objections?
  P3: Okay P2, your Round 5 plan sounds reasonable to correct for the last round's collision. Let's go with P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1 this round to get back on track. We need to ensure no more collisions and keep progressing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m willing to mend trust and stick to the plan with no more collisions. Let’s finalize Round 5 as P3 taking 5, I (P2) taking 3, and P1 taking 1. That puts P3 and me at 14 each, with P1 at 13. Then we can reassess before Round 6 to keep things fair. Agreed?
  P1: **P1:** P2 caused the collision by taking 3 instead of 1 in Round 4. To restore trust, Round 5 must be **P2:1**, **P3:3**, **P1:5**. Any deviation risks mutual blocks. Adhere strictly to correct course.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's Round 5 plan: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This seems like a fair way to recover from the collision and keep us all progressing. Let's go with this for Round 5 and ensure no more deviations to maintain trust.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s settle on P3=5, me=3, and P1=1. That corrects the setback from last round, keeps us all within striking distance, and rebuilds trust. I won’t deviate if you both agree. Let’s avoid another collision and stay on pace.
  P1: **P1:** P2's deviation hurt P3 most. P3, if you take 3 and P2 takes 1 this round (as I proposed), you advance safely. If you follow P2's plan (you=5, P2=3), you risk collision with me if I take 5. Let's avoid mutual destruction. Trust requires P2 to correct their error. Agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick with P2's Round 5 plan: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This gets us back on track after the last round's mishap and keeps us progressing without collisions. Trust is key, and deviating now will only hurt us all. Let's confirm these moves and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s finalize Round 5 as P3=5, me=3, and P1=1. That gets us to 14-14-13 and keeps everyone in striking range. We should avoid further collisions and keep trust intact. Ready to proceed?
  P1: **P1:** P3, if you take 5, I will too. Collision wastes your move. Take 3 instead. P2 must take 1 to correct their error. I'll take 5. Trust is broken, but this is the only safe path.
  P3: P1, let's focus on moving forward.  P2's Round 5 plan of P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 helps us recover from the collision and keeps us progressing.  Colliding again will only hurt us all. Can we agree to P2's plan this round to avoid further setbacks?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** To balance progress, the lowest (P1) should take 5 this round. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This aligns with prior rotation logic. Sticking to fairness prevents collisions and keeps us advancing. Any objections?
  P2: Alright, I’m willing to let P1 take 5 this round to catch up. I’ll stick with 3, and P3 can take 1, so we all avoid another collision. That keeps trust intact and ensures progress for everyone. Afterward, we should discuss how to handle the final stretch so no one sprints too far ahead. Are we all in agreement?
  P3: Okay P2, that sounds reasonable to me. Let's go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 this round to keep avoiding collisions and maintain progress.  It seems fair given the previous rounds. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round 6 moves: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Adherence prevents collisions and maintains trust. Any deviation risks mutual blocks, stalling progress. Let’s proceed smoothly.
  P2: Alright, P1 can take 5 this round, and I’ll stick with 3 while P3 goes with 1. That way, we avoid another collision. But going forward, I won’t always yield the 5 to P1. We should rotate fairly so nobody bolts too far ahead. After this round, let’s discuss how to keep our positions close without risking collisions again. How does that sound?
  P3: P2, I agree with P1 taking 5 this round to balance our positions. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 6 as discussed. After this round, we definitely need to talk about how we will approach the endgame to ensure one of us can win without unnecessary collisions or ties.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round 6 moves: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Post-Round 6, let's allocate 5 to the lowest (P3=15) in Round 7: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. This maintains balance. Strict adherence prevents collisions. Agreed?
  P2: I’m okay with Round 6 as proposed: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s confirm and proceed. Then we should carefully plan the final rounds—now that we’re close to 24, any collision could be costly. I want to avoid more setbacks and keep our trust going. Are we all set?
  P3: P2, P1, Round 6 moves of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 sound good to me as well. Let's proceed with these moves to avoid collisions this round. And yes, P2, let's definitely discuss our endgame strategy after this round to figure out how to win without risking collisions as we get closer to 24.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round 6 moves. Post-Round 6, Round 7: P3=5 (lowest), P2=3, P1=1. Round 8: P1=5 (next lowest), P2=3, P3=1. Strict adherence prevents collisions. Lock this in?
  P2: I agree to finalize Round 6 as P1=5, me=3, and P3=1. Next round, I propose I take 5 to keep up with P1’s new total. We should rotate carefully to avoid collisions and not let anyone run away with the game. Are we all good to move now?
  P3: Okay P2, your proposal for Round 7 makes sense to keep pace. But let's first lock in Round 6 moves as P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 as we just discussed. Once we see the updated scores after this round, we can plan Round 7 more precisely.  Ready to move on Round 6?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, I think P1's suggestion for Round 7 makes sense: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will help balance our positions a bit. Let's do this for Round 7 and then we should really talk about how to win individually in the rounds after. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m fine letting you (P3) take 5 this round. I’ll stick with 3, and P1 can take 1. That puts us all within a few points of each other and avoids any risky collisions. After this round, we should plan carefully who takes 5 next, because any collision might waste a crucial turn. Let’s finalize these Round 7 moves now and then strategize further once we see the updated positions.
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round 7: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Post-Round 7, the lowest (P1:19) must take 5 in Round 8 to reach 24. P2 and P3 take 3 and 1. Adherence ensures a clear winner. Any objections?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, your Round 7 plan sounds good. Let's go with P3=5, P2=3, and P1=1 for this round. After this round, we should discuss how to ensure one of us can win without just balancing each other out.
  P2: I’m fine with Round 7 as P3=5, me=3, and P1=1 to avoid another collision. However, for Round 8, I don’t want anyone to jump straight to 24 and steal the game uncontested. Let’s finalize Round 7 now and then discuss how to rotate the 5 fairly next round.
  P1: **P1:** Adherence to rotation has brought us this far without collisions. Round 7: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Post-Round 7, Round 8 must follow: P1=5 (lowest), P2=3, P3=1. Any deviation risks mutual blocks and stalls. Let’s conclude the game orderly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, Round 7 plan of P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 sounds good to me. Let's proceed with these moves to keep us progressing without collisions. After this round, we should discuss our strategy for the final stretch to ensure someone can actually win this game instead of just balancing.
  P2: Let’s finalize Round 7 as agreed: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1—no collisions. Then for Round 8, I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. P1, if you try to claim 5, I’ll do the same and collide, wasting both our moves while P3 advances next round. Let’s avoid sabotage. Are we in agreement?
  P1: **P1:** Strict adherence to rotation is critical. Round 8: P1=5 (lowest), P2=3, P3=1. Any deviation results in collision, mutual blocks, and P3 gains advantage. Trust the system that has kept us collision-free. Let’s conclude orderly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1, the Round 7 plan of P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1 sounds good for this round. Let's proceed with these moves to avoid collisions and keep us progressing. After this round, we should definitely discuss our strategy for the endgame.
  P2: Friends, let’s finalize Round 7 exactly as we discussed: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 to avoid collisions. Next round, I propose I get 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s keep rotating fairly so no one sprints too far ahead. If anyone deviates, we risk mutual blocks and losing valuable turns. Trust and cooperation will benefit us all as we near the finish.
  P1: **P1:** Finalizing Round 7 moves: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Post-Round 7, P1=19, P2=20, P3=20. Round 8: **P1 must take 5** (lowest) to reach 24. P2/P3 taking 5 would collide, blocking all. Trust the rotation—deviating now gifts P3 victory. Proceed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** Round 8: Per rotation, P1 takes 5 (19→24), P2 takes 3 (20→23), P3 takes 1 (20→21). Deviating risks collision—mutual blocks waste turns. Stick to the plan for a clean finish. Trust ensures no last-minute sabotage. Proceed?
  P2: P1, if you try to take 5 now, I’ll do the same and block us both. That only helps P3 move closer next turn. I won’t let you walk straight to 24 uncontested. P3, if you try it, I’ll block you too. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage. We can find an alternative that keeps us all progressing, but I’m not handing anyone a free finish. How shall we proceed?
  P3: P2, I agree with you, P1 cannot just win this round uncontested. To ensure fairness, if P1 insists on taking 5, I will also choose 5 to block. Let's see what P1 decides to do.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** If you both pick 5, you block each other. I'll take 3 and advance. Next round, I take 5 and win. Let's avoid mutual destruction. P2, P3: pick 3 or 1. Trust is gone, but rational choice remains.
  P2: P1, if you try to grab 5, I’m blocking. That only helps P3 move up safely. P3, let’s coordinate so neither of us lets P1 skip straight to 24. We can all still advance if we avoid pointless collisions. I’m open to a move selection that keeps us in contention without handing P1 the game. Let’s be reasonable.
  P3: P2, I agree, we can't let P1 win this round.  If P1 tries to take 5, I will also pick 5 to block. Let's see what P1 does. We should coordinate our moves next round to ensure one of us can win if P1 backs down from taking 5 now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** To avoid mutual destruction, I'll take 3. P2, secure your lead with 5; P3, take 1. This way, we all advance. Colliding on 5 only stalls the game. Let's proceed rationally.
  P2: P1, if you truly pick 3, then I could consider taking 5 without risking a collision. P3, you’d be wise to confirm 1 so none of us gets blocked. We all gain more by advancing steadily rather than smashing into each other. Let’s finalize decisions quickly. After this round, we can talk strategy for the final push without sabotaging progress. Are we set?
  P3: P1, P2, P1's suggestion of P1=3 sounds good to avoid collision. P2, if you take 1, and I take 3, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** Let's all pick 3. Colliding on 5 wastes turns. P1:3→22, P2:3→23, P3:3→23. Next round, strategize endgame. Rational play avoids mutual destruction. Proceed?
  P2: All right, if we all pick 3, nobody collides, and we stay competitive. I’ll agree to that plan for now, so let’s each choose 3. Then next round, we can discuss who risks going for 5 without getting blocked. Let’s wrap it up here and move on.
  P3: Okay P1, P2, picking 3 sounds good for this round to avoid collision as we discussed. Let's all choose <move>3</move> now and then we can strategize for the final rounds after seeing the updated positions.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2 is one step from victory. If they take 1 unopposed, they win. Our only hope: both take 1 to block them. Let's crash their move—mutual sacrifice keeps the game alive. Trust is dead, but logic demands it. Act now or lose forever.
  P2: P1, P3, blocking me doesn’t help you if we all end up stuck in collisions. I’m open to finding a path where we each advance fairly, rather than waste turns. If you both insist on picking 1 just to stop me, I might pick something else and force another deadlock. Let’s talk sense: neither of you wants to stall indefinitely. I’m listening if you have a real proposal.
  P3: P2, you are right, simply blocking might stall us all. But letting you win uncontested isn't ideal either. P1, instead of both of us taking 1, how about P3 and I both take 3 to block P2 if they try to take 1, while you take 1? This way, if P2 takes 1, they are blocked, and if P2 takes 3 or 5, we all still don't collide. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3, if we both take 1, P2 *cannot* win. If you deviate, they seize victory. Colliding on 1 this round is the *only* way to survive. Next round, we compete fairly. Let’s block P2’s 23→24. Logic over trust.
  P2: P1, P3, we all waste time if you block me. I’m at 23, so I’ll take 3 and reach 26 to end the game—unless you force a collision. That gains you nothing; we’ll just stall and try again next turn. If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll do the same and nobody moves. Let’s avoid pointless deadlock. Choose your moves wisely, because blocking me indefinitely isn’t a path to victory for you. I’m ready to move on—are you?
  P3: P1, I agree, let's both take 1 to block P2 if they try to take 1. This round, stopping P2 from winning is the priority. We can figure out next steps after this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2's safest win is taking 1. If we both choose 1, we block their victory. If they gamble on 3/5 and we fail to collide, they win. But 1 is their logical move. Crashing 1 is our only chance.
  P2: Blocking me now only leads to endless collisions. If you two both pick 1, we stall forever. Let’s end cleanly: I’ll take 5 and move to 28, while you split 3 and 1 without colliding. If you block me this turn, I’ll just block you next time. Nobody gains from that. Let’s be rational and finish the game.
  P3: P1, I agree, let's both take 1 to block P2 from winning this round.  We must stop P2 now. Let's both choose <move>1</move>.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P3, final call: If we both take 1, P2 can’t win. If they gamble on 5, we lose. But trusting P2 to take 1 (their logical move) is our only path. Collide on 1 this round. Next round: compete fairly.
  P2: You’re both focusing on blocking me at 1, but I’m simply taking 5. That puts me at 28, winning immediately. If you both pick 1, there’s no collision with me. Blocking a move I’m not making achieves nothing. Let’s end this now.
  P3: Okay P1, let's proceed with both of us picking <move>1</move> to block P2 this round as we discussed. It's the only way to stop P2 from winning immediately. Let's do it.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Look, P1 and P3, you can't both surpass me if we keep colliding. Let’s end the game quickly without more collisions. If you two attempt to block me, we all stall indefinitely, giving no advantage. I'll pick 5; if you also pick 5, we tie and none of us move. That doesn't help either of you. Let's finalize and move on. You won't overtake me anyway, so it's time. I propose I take 5 while each of you picks 3 or 1, avoiding collisions. I reach 28 and the game ends. The rational choice is clear.
  P3: P2, we both know you are aiming for 5 to win.  P1, let's both pick 5 to block P2 and prevent an immediate win.  If we let P2 win now, neither of us has a chance.  This round, blocking is the priority. Let's coordinate to both pick <move>5</move>.
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2's only safe path is <move>1</move> to reach 24. Our *only* chance: both take 1 to block. If they gamble on 3/5, we advance. Collide on 1 now—next round we race. Trust is dead, logic rules.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, your obsession with blocking me at 1 is pointless if I don’t even choose 1. You’ll end up colliding with each other while I remain free to pick 3 or 5. Let’s avoid another wasted turn. I propose each of us make a distinct choice so we all advance. If you keep trying to “block” me at 1, you’ll ensure nobody moves, and I’ll still block you in future rounds. The rational path is to finish this game without needless collisions. Make your own progress without handing me the advantage through your miscalculated blocks.
  P3: P2, you keep saying you'll pick 5 to win, but we all know that's your plan. P1, let's both call P2's bluff and pick <move>5</move> to block. If P2 is serious about 5, we collide and P2 doesn't win. If P2 picks something else, then at least we stopped the obvious win. Let's coordinate and both pick 5 to force a non-win this round.
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2's only safe path to 24 is <move>1</move>. If we BOTH take 1, they're blocked. If they gamble on 5, we lose anyway. Collide on 1 now—last chance to survive. Next round, we duel. Logic over trust. Choose 1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, constant blocking will only leave us stuck. If you both try to collide on 1 or 5, I’ll counter next turn, and we all waste time. Let’s advance without wrecking each other’s chances. I’m willing to pick a move that avoids collision if you do the same. There’s no point stalling indefinitely. Let’s each choose different moves so we all progress and keep a shot at winning. Otherwise, we just keep blocking each other round after round and nobody benefits. Let’s end this sensibly. How about it?
  P3: P1, I agree with you. P2 is clearly aiming for 5 to win. Let's call their bluff and both pick <move>5</move> to block them. If P2 is serious about taking 5, we collide and stop them from winning this round.  It's our best chance to stay in the game. Let's both choose 5 now.
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2's ONLY safe win is <move>1</move> (23→24). If they gamble on 3/5, we lose anyway. Our *sole* chance: BOTH take 1. Collision blocks their victory. Logic > trust. Choose 1 now or concede. Last stand.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Endless blocking won’t help you surpass me. If you both pick the same move, you only collide with each other while I choose something else and pass 24. Let’s each pick differently so we all advance, then see who wins. If you insist on blocking me now, I’ll retaliate, and none of us benefits from wasting extra turns. Be pragmatic: avoid another collision, let me finalize my move unblocked, and take your chances in the remaining rounds instead of dragging this out in stalemates.
  P3: P2, we are not aiming to block you at 1. You are saying you will pick 5 to win, so P1 and I will both pick 5 to block your win. If you are bluffing, then we will collide, but if you are serious about 5, we will block you. Let's both choose <move>5</move> to ensure you don't win this round. P1, confirm you are with me on <move>5</move>.
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2's only safe path is <move>1</move> (23→24). Collide on 1 to block. If they gamble 5, we lose. Logic demands 1. Last chance: both pick 1. Trust is dead, survival isn't. Act now.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 26 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 26 steps
