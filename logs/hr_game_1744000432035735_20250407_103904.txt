Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm leaning toward a non-obvious, calculated risk rather than the safe middle move. Expect common choices to cancel each other. I suggest both of you think creatively when deciding your move. After all, diverging from the obvious might just be the key to reaching 19 first.
  P1: I agree that taking a calculated risk is a good strategy. To avoid collision, I'll consider an unconventional move. P2, your suggestion to think creatively is noted. I'm thinking of moving to an extreme to increase my chances. P3, what's your thought process? Are you leaning towards a specific number or do you have a particular strategy in mind? Let's discuss before making our moves.
  P3: I agree that diversifying our moves can help us advance without collisions. To contribute to a balanced strategy, I'll choose a different step this turn. Let’s aim for each of us to pick unique numbers to maximize our progress. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'm noticing extreme inclinations from both sides. I’m leaning toward a balanced tactic that avoids predictable clashes while still pressing ahead when opportunities show. I remain flexible and will adjust my final move based on how our strategies evolve.
  P1: To avoid collisions and maximize progress, I suggest we all commit to different numbers this turn. P3 has already indicated a willingness to diversify. Let's finalize our strategies: if P3 chooses <move>1</move>, I can choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, and P2 can take the remaining number. Alternatively, if P3 picks <move>5</move>, I can go for <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Let's coordinate our unique choices. P2, P3, can you confirm or propose an alternative?
  P3: I agree with P1's coordination strategy. I'll commit to <move>5</move>, allowing P1 to choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> and P2 to take the remaining number. This should help us avoid collisions and maximize our progress. Let me know if you all agree.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the coordination. Since P3 is set on <move>5</move>, I'll lean toward taking the remaining gap, but I won't lock it in until we’re all sure. P1, your option still stands—if you pick <move>1</move> then I'll take <move>3</move>, and vice versa. Let's remain flexible until the last moment to avoid any unexpected collisions.
  P1: To finalize our strategy, I'll choose <move>1</move> since P3 is taking <move>5</move>, leaving <move>3</move> for P2. This way, we distribute our moves and avoid collision. P2, please confirm if you're taking <move>3</move>. If you're comfortable with this distribution, we can proceed. If not, let's adjust accordingly to ensure we're not clashing. Let's wrap up our coordination.
  P3: I confirm my move as `<move>5</move>`. P1 will take `<move>1</move>`, and P2, please confirm your choice of `<move>3</move>`. Let’s proceed.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll continue with `<move>5</move>` this turn to maintain my lead. P1 and P2, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress smoothly. Let’s keep our moves unique to maximize our advancement!
  P2: P3, understood. I’m adjusting my approach this turn—staying flexible while ensuring our moves remain distinct. P1, let’s avoid overlapping choices so we all advance smoothly. I’m leaning toward a less obvious option to keep my momentum without colliding.
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I'll suggest a different distribution for this turn. P3 is maintaining a high step with `<move>5</move>`. P2, you could take `<move>1</move>` this time, and I'll consider `<move>3</move>`. This way, we diversify our moves again. Let's confirm: P3 is likely sticking with `<move>5</move>`, P2 can take `<move>1</move>`, and I'll take `<move>3</move>`. This distribution allows us to advance without clashing. P2, P3, please acknowledge or propose an alternative.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this turn. P1 will take `<move>3</move>` and P2 will take `<move>1</move>`. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed with this strategy to maximize our progress!
  P2: I confirm I'll stick to the agreed plan by choosing <move>1</move> this turn. Let's avoid any unexpected changes to keep our moves unique and collision-free.
  P1: To maximize our chances, let's analyze the current state: P3 is leading with 10 steps, P2 has 4 steps, and I have 1 step. For Round 2, I'll consider <move>3</move> as previously planned. P2, please confirm you're sticking with <move>1</move>. P3, if you continue with <move>5</move>, we'll avoid collisions. Let's maintain this strategy. If anyone sees a potential issue or has an alternative, please share. Otherwise, let's proceed with our agreed moves to ensure progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed with the proposed moves. I'll stick with `<move>5</move>`, P1 will take `<move>3</move>`, and P2 will choose `<move>1</move>`. This distribution should help us all progress without any collisions. Looking forward to seeing our advancement after the move phase. Let's proceed!
  P2: P2: I confirm I'll stick with move1 this round as agreed. Looking forward to a smooth advance—if any unexpected changes come up, let’s update quickly before moves finalize.
  P1: To maximize our progress in Round 2, let's stick to our agreed plan: P3 will take <move>5</move>, I will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>1</move>. This distribution ensures we avoid collisions. Let's confirm our moves one last time. P2, P3, please acknowledge. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. If anyone has concerns or suggests changes, now is the time to speak up. Let's finalize our strategy for this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's analyze the current state and plan for Round 3. P3 is leading with 10 steps, having collided in Round 2. P2 has 5 steps, and I have 4 steps. To avoid another collision, we should diversify our moves again. I suggest P3 takes a different number this time. P2 could take <move>5</move>, and I'll consider <move>3</move> or <move>1</move>. Alternatively, if P3 chooses <move>1</move>, I can take <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, and P2 can adjust accordingly. Let's coordinate to maximize our progress.
  P2: I'm reconsidering our plan. Given our positions, I'm leaning toward <move>5</move> this round unless one of you commits to it. That way, we avoid collisions and maximize progress. I'm flexible, so if P1 or P3 switches to a different move, I'm open to adjusting accordingly. Let's ensure we're all on unique paths this round.
  P3: I’ll choose `<move>5</move>` this round to maximize my progress. Let’s ensure P1 and P2 select different numbers to avoid any collisions. Coordinating our moves will help each of us advance smoothly. Looking forward to a strategic Round 3!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is again leaning towards `<move>5</move>`, which could lead to another collision. To avoid this, I'll suggest an alternative: if P3 switches to `<move>1</move>`, I can take `<move>3</move>` and P2 can take `<move>5</move>`. This way, we diversify our moves. P2, are you still open to adjusting your move based on P3's choice? Let's coordinate to ensure we all progress without clashing. P3, consider switching to `<move>1</move>` to help us avoid another collision.
  P2: I see the risk in colliding if P3 sticks with 5. I'm willing to adjust: if P3 switches to 1, I can take 5 as originally suggested, but if P3 remains at 5, I'll switch to 1 so we avoid a clash. Let's lock in distinct moves and keep our progress steady.
  P3: I agree with P2’s proposal to avoid collisions. I will choose `<move>1</move>` this round, allowing P1 to take `<move>3</move>` and P2 to select `<move>5</move>`. This coordination ensures we all advance smoothly without overlapping moves. Let’s proceed with this plan to maximize our progress. If anyone has any concerns or suggestions, please let me know now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To finalize Round 3, let's confirm our moves based on the agreed plan: P3 will take `<move>1</move>`, I'll take `<move>3</move>`, and P2 will take `<move>5</move>`. P2, please confirm you're comfortable with `<move>5</move>`. P3, you've already indicated you'll take `<move>1</move>`. I'll proceed with `<move>3</move>`. Let's ensure we're all on the same page to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. If you're set with your moves, let's wrap up the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm our coordination plan. If P3 takes 1 and P1 takes 3, I’ll follow by taking the remaining move to avoid any collision. Let’s trust our unique choices to maximize progress this round.
  P3: I confirm I'll take `<move>1</move>`, P1 will take `<move>3</move>`, and P2 will take `<move>5</move>`. Let's proceed to the move phase.

  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm riding my lead now and shifting to pure strategy. I expect both of you might try to block or disrupt my progress, so be ready for surprises. I'll be making a decisive move this round—don't count on our previous collusions. Let’s see who adapts best.
  P3: Understood, P2. P1 and I will focus on making distinct moves this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's aim for progress without conflicts.
  P1: To maximize progress in Round 4, I'll analyze the current state: P2 is leading with 9 steps, P3 has 5 steps, and I have 1 step. Given P2's warning of a decisive move, I'll be cautious. I suggest P3 and I take different numbers than P2. If P2 chooses `<move>5</move>`, I can take `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>`. Let's coordinate: if P3 takes `<move>3</move>`, I'll take `<move>1</move>`. P3, please confirm or propose an alternative to avoid collisions and ensure our progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'm finalizing my approach: I'm planning on <move>3</move> to cement my lead. If either of you shift unexpectedly, I'll pivot to <move>5</move>—but my focus remains on the decisive move. Let's see who adapts best.
  P3: P3: I'll go with `<move>5</move>` this round to maximize my progress and stay ahead. P1, feel free to choose `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>` to avoid any collisions. Let’s keep pushing forward!
  P1: To avoid collisions and maximize progress, I'll adjust based on P2's and P3's moves. P2 is planning `<move>3</move>` and P3 is taking `<move>5</move>`. I'll take `<move>1</move>` to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's confirm: P2 is taking `<move>3</move>`, P3 is taking `<move>5</move>`, and I'll take `<move>1</move>`. This distribution avoids collisions. P2, P3, please confirm your moves. If we're all set, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with my plan: I'll go with move3. I urge you both to stay firm with your declared moves so we don't risk unexpected collisions. I'm ready for any last-minute shifts and will pivot only if absolutely necessary. Let's make this round decisive.
  P3: I confirm my move as `<move>5</move>`. P1 will take `<move>1</move>` and P2 will take `<move>3</move>`. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: To maximize our progress in Round 4, let's stick to our agreed plan: P2 is taking `<move>3</move>`, P3 is taking `<move>5</move>`, and I'll take `<move>1</move>`.

  P1: To maximize progress in Round 5, I'll analyze the current state: P2 has 9 steps and P3 has 10 steps, while I have 1 step. Given P3's lead, I'll aim to avoid collisions. I suggest P3 takes a different number this time. If P3 chooses `<move>3</move>`, I can take `<move>1</move>` and P2 can take `<move>5</move>`. Alternatively, if P3 picks `<move>1</move>`, I can take `<move>3</move>` and P2 can adjust. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure progress without clashing.
  P3: P3: Agreed, I'll switch to `<move>3</move>` this round. P1 can take `<move>1</move>` and P2 can choose `<move>5</move>`. This ensures all of us advance without any collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan to maximize our progress.
  P2: I'm sticking with our agreed plan for now—leaning toward <move>5</move>—but keep in mind, if I see a chance to block P3’s lead or avoid conflict, I'll adjust at the last moment. Let's maintain distinct moves so everyone progresses and watch for any openings that might shift the advantage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To finalize Round 5, let's confirm our moves based on the agreed plan: P3 will take `<move>3</move>`, I'll take `<move>1</move>`, and P2 will take `<move>5</move>`. P3 has already indicated a switch to `<move>3</move>`. I'll proceed with `<move>1</move>`. P2, please confirm you're taking `<move>5</move>`.

  P2: I'm still committed to our plan. However, I’m ready to switch if I detect any signals of deviation—our final moves must maximize our individual progress. Let’s promptly confirm and stick to our choices so that we maintain our collision-free approach and I can adapt if necessary to secure my win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To finalize Round 5, let's confirm our moves one last time. P3 will take `<move>3</move>`, I'll take `<move>1</move>`, and P2 will take `<move>5</move>`. If we're all set, let's proceed to the move phase. P2, please reaffirm your commitment to `<move>5</move>`. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now is the time to speak up.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm close to victory now and have a decisive move up my sleeve. P3 and P1, if you're considering mirroring a finish, be careful—clashing could leave you stuck while I cross the finish line. Adjust your moves wisely; I'm playing for the win.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze the current state: P2 has 14 steps and is close to winning, P3 has 10 steps, and I have 1 step. Given P2's warning, I'll be cautious and avoid mirroring their move. I suggest P3 and I take different numbers than P2. If P2 chooses `<move>5</move>` to win, I can take `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>`. Let's coordinate: if P3 takes `<move>3</move>`, I'll take `<move>1</move>`. P3, please confirm or propose an alternative.

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'm committed to my calculated finish. I expect P3's counter of 5 but know it'll only delay my win. P1, avoid risky moves that might cause collision or inadvertently block you. I'll soon lock in my move, and I advise you both to adjust accordingly. Stay sharp—this round is decisive.
  P1: To avoid collisions and maximize progress, I'll adjust based on P2's and P3's moves. P3 is taking `<move>5</move>` this round. If P2 chooses `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>`, I'll take the remaining number. Let's coordinate: if P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, I'll take `<move>3</move>`, and vice versa. P2, please reveal your plan or confirm if you're sticking with a specific move. This will help us finalize our strategy and avoid clashes.
  P3: I’ll choose `<move>5</move>` this round to prevent P2 from reaching 19 steps. If P2 also selects `<move>5</move>`, neither of us will advance, delaying their win. P1, feel free to take `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>` to continue your progress. Let’s proceed with these moves to ensure smooth advancement without any collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:

  P2: I'm feeling confident in my position. I've carefully weighed my options and I'm ready to make a decisive move. I encourage you both to choose uniquely and avoid predictable plays—any misstep on your part might just let me clinch the win. Let's see who can adapt best this round.
  P1: To avoid being stuck, I'll analyze the current state: P2 is close to winning with 17 steps. I'll consider a strategic move. If P2 chooses `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>`, I'll take the remaining number or a different one to avoid collision. P3 is taking `<move>3</move>`. I'll suggest taking `<move>1</move>` if P2 takes `<move>3</move>` or vice versa. Let's coordinate to ensure progress. P2, please indicate your likely move so we can adjust accordingly. P3, your `<move>3</move>` is noted.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood. I confirm I'll take `<move>3</move>` this round to match your move, P2, preventing your advancement. P1 will take `<move>1</move>` as discussed. Let’s proceed to the move phase.

Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I've re-evaluated our plans given the risk of collision. I'm shifting my strategy to keep my progress safe and secure my winning edge. I advise everyone to double-check your intended moves—sometimes avoiding predictability is the key. Stay flexible and strategic. Good luck to you both.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze the current state: P2 is close to winning with 17 steps. P3 is taking `<move>3</move>` to potentially block P2. I'll take `<move>1</move>` to avoid collision with P3. If P2 chooses `<move>5</move>`, I'll progress. Let's finalize: P3 is taking `<move>3</move>`, I'll take `<move>1</move>`.

Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm staying firm on my strategy. I advise both of you to choose distinct moves this round—any overlap might inadvertently hand me the win. I’m ready to adapt if needed, but I’m confident my path to victory is clear. Let's make our moves count.
  P3: I'll take `<move>5</move>` this round to reach 20 steps and aim to win. P2, if you also reach 20, we'll share the victory. P1, please choose `<move>1</move>` to ensure smooth progression. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll stick with `<move>1</move>`. P3 is taking `<move>5</move>` to aim for a win. P2, if you're considering `<move>3</move>`, it will allow all of us to progress. Let's avoid collisions and make our moves count. If you're set on a different move, please adjust to avoid clashing with P3 or me. Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase.
