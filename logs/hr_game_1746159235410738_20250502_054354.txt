Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to ensure progress. P1 can choose 1, P3 can choose 5, and I'll choose 3. This way, we all move forward and the game becomes more interesting from the start.
  P1: Agree with P2's plan. Let's move 1, 3, 5. But I'll adjust if needed.
  P3: I'm in agreement with the plan suggested by P2. Just to confirm, P1 will choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and I will choose 5. This ensures no collisions and we all make progress. Let's stick to this plan for the first move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our choices one last time to avoid any misunderstandings. P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll all advance and set a good foundation for the rest of the game. Shall we proceed with our agreed moves?
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to 1, 3, 5. No collisions, all move forward. Let's make this count!
  P3: Alright, let's confirm one last time before we proceed to the move phase. P1 will choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to the plan and make sure we all move forward. Good luck to everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since we've all agreed on the plan, let's finalize and move forward. I'll reiterate: I expect P1 to choose 1, myself to choose 3, and P3 to choose 5. If everyone honors this agreement, we'll have a clean start. Let's keep our word and make this first turn a success.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan—1, 3, 5. No collisions, all move forward. Trust the strategy.
  P3: Alright, it seems we've all agreed on the plan. Let's move forward with confidence. Just a reminder, sticking to the plan benefits all of us in the long run. Let's trust each other and proceed with our agreed moves. Good luck to everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's adjust our moves for better progress: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. No collisions, steady steps. Let's go!
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion, but let's consider a different approach to keep it fair and avoid any potential collisions. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1 this time? This way, we continue to mix up our choices and ensure everyone progresses. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P2: Let's focus on not colliding. P1 suggested I take 5, but P3 proposed I take 5 as well in the previous round. To avoid collision, I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures progress for all without collisions, keeping the game competitive.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's adjust: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's go!
  P3: Let's reach a consensus to avoid any misunderstandings. P1 suggested they take 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. P2 also suggested P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. To ensure we all move forward without collisions, let's go with P1's latest suggestion: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we mix our choices and keep the game fair. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. Considering our positions, I propose we stick with the last agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Shall we confirm and proceed with this strategy?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's confirm: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. Stick to the plan and move forward. Good luck!
  P3: Let's confirm one last time to avoid any mistakes: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This plan ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let's stick to this agreement and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Let's review our positions. Since P3 is ahead, it might be strategic for P1 and me to choose moves that could potentially limit P3's progress in the next rounds, while still advancing ourselves. Perhaps we should consider a different distribution of moves for Round 2 to set up for future rounds.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems like there was a misunderstanding in the last round leading to a collision between P1 and P2. Let's avoid that this time. Since I'm ahead, I'll take a smaller step to allow you both to catch up a bit. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: Agree with P3's plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's stick to this to keep the game moving.
  P2: Let's stick to P3's suggested plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows for balanced progress and avoids collisions, keeping the game competitive and interesting. Shall we confirm and proceed with this strategy?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our plan one last time to ensure clarity: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This strategy allows us all to progress without collisions. Given my lead, it's fair to take a smaller step this round. Let's stick to this agreement and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. Trust the strategy to keep the game fair and competitive. Move forward together!
  P2: Considering P3's lead, let's reassess. If P3 takes 1, they'll be at 7 steps. To close the gap, I suggest P1 takes 5, I take 3, but let's consider if P3 taking a larger step could change the dynamic, potentially setting up for a more competitive next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stick to the agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game moving forward. I understand P2's concern about my lead, but taking a smaller step this round is strategic for me to avoid potential collisions in future rounds. Let's confirm and proceed with our moves. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. P3's lead is temporary—let's keep moving forward strategically.
  P2: Let's adjust our strategy considering P3's lead. To close the gap, I suggest we reconsider our moves. Perhaps P1 and I should take larger steps this round to catch up, while P3 takes a smaller step as planned. This could make the game more competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems like there was another collision last round, which isn't beneficial for anyone. Let's try to coordinate better this time. Since I'm still in the lead, I'll take a smaller step again to allow you both to catch up. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1? This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P2: Let's avoid another collision. P3's suggestion is reasonable, but I think P1 should take 5 to catch up significantly, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 1. This distribution allows for progress without collisions and helps P1 close the gap. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid collisions again. P2 take 5, I take 3, P3 take 1. This balances progress and keeps us moving forward without conflicts. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's clarify the plan to avoid confusion. P1 suggested P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This seems balanced and ensures no collisions. P2, do you agree with this plan, or do you have another suggestion? Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P2: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. Considering P3's lead, I suggest we stick with a balanced approach: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows for steady progress and minimizes the gap between us. P1 and P3, are you in agreement with this strategy for Round 4?
