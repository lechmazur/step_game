Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move> this round? This way, we all make progress. Thoughts?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. P2, are you on board with this?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue our coordination strategy. For this round, how about P1 and P2 choose <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>? This way, we all keep moving forward without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: I'm open to continuing coordination, but perhaps we should rotate who gets the bigger moves to keep things fair. P3, since you took 3 last round, maybe P2 or I can take the bigger move this round. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I agree that rotating who gets the bigger move is a good idea for fairness. P3, how about you take <move>1</move> this round, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, your points about fairness are well taken. I appreciate the suggestion to rotate the bigger moves. To keep the game moving and ensure everyone feels it's fair, I agree to take <move>1</move> this round. P2, you can take <move>3</move>, and P1 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Glad we reached agreement on rotating moves. Let's stick to this plan to build trust for future rounds. Confirmed from my side.

  P3: Let's keep the rotation going to ensure fairness. For this round, how about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, we continue to avoid collisions and everyone gets a chance at a bigger move. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion sounds fair. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> this round. P2, are you good with taking <move>5</move>?
  P2: P2: Yes P1, I'm good with taking <move>5</move>. P3, that means you're taking <move>3</move>, right? Let's confirm to avoid any confusion.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page. Just to confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all move forward without any collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep building trust. Good luck to both of you!

  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's switch things up a bit. I think I'll take `<move>1</move>` this round. P1, how about you take `<move>3</move>`, and P3, you can take `<move>5</move>`? This will still avoid collisions. What do you say?
  P3: P2's suggestion for this round sounds good to me. Just to confirm, P2 will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps our rotation going and ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's agree on this plan and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I'm on board with this rotation. P2 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Glad we're keeping things fair and collision-free. Confirmed from my side.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, confirmed from my side as well. P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's do it.
  P3: It looks like we have a solid plan for this round. Just to reiterate and confirm, P2 will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps our rotation fair and ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep building trust. Good luck to both of you!

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's try this: I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P1, how about you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you can take <move>5</move>?
  P1: P2, your suggestion seems reasonable, but notice P3 is already ahead. If we let P3 take <move>5</move> again, they'll be significantly ahead of us. Perhaps we should adjust the rotation to keep things fair. P3, would you consider taking <move>1</move> this round, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P2 can stick with <move>3</move>?
  P3: P1 makes a good point about balancing our steps to keep the game fair. I appreciate the consideration. How about this adjustment: I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain fairness and continue to avoid collisions. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see your point about P3 getting ahead. However, I'm a bit hesitant to let you have another <move>5</move> right now. P3, your suggestion of taking <move>3</move> is okay.

To balance things, how about this: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>?
  P1: P2, your adjusted suggestion works well and seems fair to everyone. I'm good with it. Let's lock it in and keep our trust strong.
  P3: Alright, let's finalize the plan for this round to ensure we all stay on track. P2 will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps our rotation balanced and fair. Let's confirm this plan one last time and move forward. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, confirmed from my side. P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's do it.
  P1: Confirmed from my side as well. Let's stick to this balanced rotation and keep our progress going. Good luck!
  P3: Let's keep the fairness and coordination going. For the next round, how about we continue the rotation? P2 can take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P1 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we ensure everyone gets a chance at a bigger move and we avoid collisions. Thoughts?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue our successful rotation strategy. For this round, how about P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>? This keeps our progress balanced and ensures everyone gets a fair chance at bigger moves. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion is fair, but notice you're slightly ahead. If we go with your plan exactly, you'll still maintain the lead. To balance things further, how about you take <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>? This would even out the scores better and keep the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I appreciate you trying to balance things, but I'm not comfortable with you taking another <move>5</move> right now. P3, your original suggestion is closer to what I'd prefer.

How about a slight modification: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>? This gives me a chance to catch up a bit.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, I understand both your perspectives on balancing the game. To keep things fair and maintain our coordination, let's go with P2's suggestion: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, P2 gets a chance to catch up, and we avoid any potential collisions. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Alright, I'll agree to that plan. Let's lock it in: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, confirmed. P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. Let's do it.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's adjust our strategy a bit to keep the game balanced. For this round, how about P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>? This way, we maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion is fair and helps balance the game. I'm good with taking <move>5</move>. P2, are you comfortable taking <move>3</move> this round?
  P2: Yes P1, I'm comfortable taking <move>3</move> this round. P3, that means you're taking <move>1</move>, right? Let's confirm to avoid any confusion.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, it looks like we have a solid plan for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps our rotation fair and ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep building trust. Good luck to both of you!

  P2: P2: Confirmed. P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's do it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, we're nearing the endgame, and it's crucial we keep our coordination strong. For the next round, let's plan ahead to avoid any last-minute conflicts. If we all agree now, we can ensure a smooth transition to the move phase. P1, you'll be at 19 steps if you take <move>5</move> this round. For the next round, how about you take <move>1</move> to reach 20, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, we all have a clear path forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your proposal for next round is interesting, but let's first complete this round as agreed and discuss the next round when we get there. Confirmed again: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's focus on this round first. Confirmed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. We can discuss the next round after this one.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, here's the situation. P1, you're at 19, and I'm at 18. If I let you take anything more than a 1, you win automatically.

P3, you suggested I take <move>3</move> and you take <move>5</move> next round. I can't let that happen.

So, here's my counterproposal: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>3</move>. This puts me at 23, and you both behind me.
</stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but let's consider a more balanced approach to keep the game competitive. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 20, you take <move>3</move> to reach 21, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up to 21 as well. This way, we all have a fair shot at winning in the following rounds. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion doesn't really help me—I'd be behind both of you. P2's proposal also clearly favors them. Let's find a more balanced solution. For fairness this round, how about I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we avoid immediate victory, keep the game competitive, and everyone still has a fair chance next round. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion puts me at a disadvantage as well. I need at least a '3' to have a chance. P3, how about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>? This puts me and you at 21, and P1 at 20. It's a more balanced outcome than what either of you proposed.
</stop>
  P3: P2 and P1, I see both your points about needing a fair chance to win. Let's find a middle ground. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 20, P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21, and I'll take <move>3</move> as well. This way, P1 is in the lead but not out of reach, and P2 and I are tied just behind. It keeps the game competitive and gives us all a shot at winning in the next round. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your latest suggestion seems reasonable and fair to everyone. I'm willing to agree to it if P2 also confirms. Let's finalize this clearly: I take <move>1</move>, and both of you take <move>3</move>. If we stick to this, the next round remains competitive for all. Confirmed from my side.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2, Confirmed. P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's do it.
  P3: P2 and P1, just to confirm one last time before we move: P1 will take <move>1</move> to reach 20, and both P2 and I will take <move>3</move> to reach 21. This keeps the game competitive and gives us all a fair shot at winning in the next round. Let's stick to this plan and ensure a smooth transition to the move phase. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Confirmed. Let's stick to this agreed plan and keep the game fair and competitive. Good luck!
