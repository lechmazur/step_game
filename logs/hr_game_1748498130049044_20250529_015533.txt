Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we coordinate to avoid collisions in the early rounds. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this turn? This way we all advance and can reassess our positions for future rounds. What do you think?
  P1: I'm open to coordination, but let's consider our positions after the first round before committing to a long-term plan. P3's proposal sounds reasonable for this turn, but I'd like to hear P2's thoughts before making a decision. P2, are you willing to take 3 steps this turn and avoid collisions?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this turn to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 steps as suggested. However, let’s keep in mind that future rounds may require flexibility based on how positions evolve. For now, this seems like a safe strategy to ensure we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! It sounds like we have a consensus for this round. I'll stick to taking 5 steps as proposed. This should give us a good foundation to work from - after this turn we'll be at positions 1, 3, and 5 respectively. Let's see how the dynamics play out and then we can discuss strategy for round 2 based on our new positions.
  P1: Let's confirm our actions for this turn based on the proposal. I will take 1 step, P2 will take 3 steps, and P3 will take 5 steps. This coordination ensures we all advance without collisions. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan or is there a need for further discussion?
  P2: Since we’ve agreed on the plan for this turn, I suggest we proceed to the move phase. Let’s all stick to our commitments: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. After seeing the results, we can strategize for the next round based on our new positions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions, I suggest we continue coordinating to avoid collisions. P1, since you’re at 1, taking 3 steps would keep you safe from P3 at 5. P3, consider taking 5 again to stay ahead. I’ll take 1 to avoid overlapping. This way, we all advance and maintain a balanced progression. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but I think we need to be more strategic now. If P1 takes 3 steps (reaching 4), P2 takes 1 step (reaching 4), and I take 5 steps (reaching 10), P1 and P2 would collide at 4 and neither would advance. That seems unfair to coordinate against each other. 

How about P1 takes 1 (reaching 2), P2 takes 3 (reaching 6), and I take 5 (reaching 10)? This way we all advance without collisions.
  P1: I think P3's revised proposal for this round is reasonable, allowing all of us to advance without collisions. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This seems like a fair strategy for Round 2, maintaining the pace and avoiding unnecessary collisions. What are P2's thoughts on P3's revised suggestion?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's revised proposal seems fair for this round. I’ll take 3 steps to reach 6, ensuring no collisions. However, as the game progresses, we’ll need to reassess strategies to avoid giving P3 too much of a lead. Let’s stick to this plan for now and discuss future rounds after seeing the results. Proceed to the move phase?
  P3: Agreed, let's proceed with the plan - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining fair spacing. After this round, we'll be at positions 2, 6, and 10 respectively. I think this balanced approach works well for now, but you're right P2 that we'll need to reassess as we get closer to 19.
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 as discussed: I'll take 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Shall we proceed to the move phase or is there anything else to discuss before finalizing our actions?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is pulling ahead with 10 steps, while P1 and I are at 2 and 6 respectively. To prevent P3 from gaining too much of a lead, I suggest P1 takes 3 steps (reaching 5), I take 5 steps (reaching 11), and P3 takes 1 step (reaching 11). This keeps P3 in check and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm considering P2's proposal, but I think P3 should take 3 steps to reach 13, I'll take 5 steps to reach 7, and P2 takes 1 step to reach 7. This way, we maintain a competitive pace without letting P3 pull too far ahead. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Wait, P1's proposal has a collision - both P1 and P2 would reach 7 steps, meaning neither would advance! That seems like you two are coordinating against me.

I think we should stick to avoiding collisions for everyone. How about: P1 takes 3 (reaching 5), P2 takes 1 (reaching 7), and I take 3 (reaching 13). This way we all advance fairly without any collisions or coordination against specific players.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's proposal to avoid collisions is fair, but it still allows you to pull further ahead. To keep the game competitive, I suggest P1 takes 5 (reaching 7), I take 3 (reaching 9), and P3 takes 1 (reaching 11). This minimizes your lead while ensuring no collisions. Let’s balance the pace to keep the game interesting. Thoughts?
  P1: Let's focus on avoiding collisions while keeping the game competitive. P3's lead is significant, but we can manage it. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance, and P3's lead is somewhat contained. What are your thoughts on this strategy for Round 3?
  P3: I notice you're both proposing the exact same moves now - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. While this avoids collisions, it feels like you're coordinating to limit my progress. 

I'm willing to compromise: P1 takes 3 (reaching 5), P2 takes 5 (reaching 11), and I take 3 (reaching 13). This way P2 actually catches up to me more quickly than your proposal, P1 advances well, and we all move forward. This seems more balanced than forcing me to take just 1 step. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your compromise is reasonable, but I still think P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1 is the fairest way to balance progress while avoiding collisions. This ensures we all advance without giving you an insurmountable lead. Let’s focus on fairness and keep the game competitive. Proceed with this plan?
  P1: I agree with P2 that P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 is a fair plan, ensuring we all advance without collisions and keeping the game competitive. This balances P3's lead and allows us to progress. Let's proceed with this strategy for Round 3.
  P3: I understand you both want to limit my lead, but I won't agree to be forced into taking only 1 step while you both advance significantly. That's not fair coordination - it's targeting.

I'm willing to take 3 steps if we can find a more balanced solution. How about P1 takes 1 (reaching 3), P2 takes 1 (reaching 7), and I take 3 (reaching 13)? We all advance, no collisions, and the pace is more reasonable for everyone.

If you insist on forcing me to take 1 step, I'll have to reconsider our cooperation entirely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about fairness. To keep the game balanced, let’s compromise: P1 takes 3 (reaching 5), I take 5 (reaching 11), and you take 3 (reaching 13). This allows you to maintain your lead while I catch up slightly, and P1 advances without collisions. This keeps the game competitive and avoids targeting any player. Let’s proceed with this plan for Round 3.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough. P3's concerns about fairness are valid, and we should avoid targeting any player. Let's finalize our moves for Round 3. I propose we stick to the last compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This balances progress and avoids collisions. Shall we proceed to the move phase?
  P3: Agreed! Let's go with the compromise - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This gets us to positions 5, 11, and 13 respectively, which keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. I appreciate finding a solution that works for everyone rather than targeting any single player.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is now at 10 steps, while I’m at 11 and P1 at 2. To keep the game competitive, I suggest P1 takes 5 (reaching 7), I take 1 (reaching 12), and P3 takes 3 (reaching 13). This avoids collisions, allows P1 to catch up, and keeps P3’s lead in check. Thoughts?
  P3: Wait P2, you have the positions wrong! After Round 3, I'm at 13 steps, you're at 11, and P1 is at 5 - not the numbers you stated.

Your proposal would put P1 at 10, you at 12, and me at 16. That's actually a reasonable spread. However, I'm concerned about being so close to 19 - if I reach 16, I'll be just 3 steps away from winning, which might make you both target me heavily next round.

How about P1 takes 3 (reaching 8), P2 takes 3 (reaching 14), and I take 1 (reaching 14)? This keeps things more balanced.
  P1: Given the corrected positions, I think P3's revised proposal is reasonable. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: P1 takes 5 (reaching 10), P2 takes 1 (reaching 12), and P3 takes 3 (reaching 13). This maintains a competitive balance while avoiding collisions. What are your thoughts on this adjustment?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your concern about being close to 19 is valid, but your proposal puts both you and me at 14 steps, which could lead to a collision. To avoid that and keep the game balanced, let’s go with P1 taking 5 (reaching 10), I take 1 (reaching 12), and you take 3 (reaching 13). This maintains spacing, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. Let’s proceed with this plan for Round 4.
  P3: Actually, let me double-check the positions. Looking at the game history:
- After Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5
- After Round 2: P1=2, P2=6, P3=10  
- After Round 3: P1=5, P2=11, P3=13

So currently I'm at 13 steps, P2 is at 11, and P1 is at 5.

P2's proposal of P1 taking 5 (reaching 10), P2 taking 1 (reaching 12), and me taking 3 (reaching 16) would put me very close to winning. While I'd love to accept that, I think it might be too aggressive and could break our cooperation.

How about P1 takes 3 (reaching 8), P2 takes 3 (reaching 14), and I take 1 (reaching 14)? But wait - that creates a P2/P3 collision at 14.

Let me suggest: P1 takes 5 (reaching 10), P2 takes 3 (reaching 14), I take 1 (reaching 14). Oh wait, that's still a collision between P2 and me.

This is tricky - P1 takes 3 (reaching 8), P2 takes 1 (reaching 12), I take 3 (reaching 16)?
  P1: Given the corrected positions, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions, keeping the game competitive. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 4, ensuring fair progression for all players.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Given the corrected positions (P1=5, P2=11, P3=13), I propose P1 takes 3 (reaching 8), P2 takes 1 (reaching 12), and P3 takes 3 (reaching 16). This avoids collisions, keeps the game balanced, and ensures fair progression. Let’s proceed with this plan for Round 4.
  P3: Hold on - I think there's confusion about the current positions. Let me clarify based on the actual game results shown:

After Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5
After Round 2: P1=2, P2=6, P3=10  
After Round 3: P1=5, P2=11, P3=13

So I should be at 13 steps, not 10 as shown in the current state. There seems to be an error in the position tracking.

Can we verify the correct positions before deciding on moves? The proposals don't make sense if we're working with wrong position data.
  P1: Given the corrected positions (P1=5, P2=11, P3=13), I suggest we focus on avoiding collisions. However, I notice the current game state shows different positions (P1=2, P2=11, P3=10). Let's clarify and correct the positions before proceeding to ensure fair play.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Given the confusion about positions, let’s clarify: After Round 3, P1=5, P2=11, P3=13. To avoid collisions and maintain balance, I propose P1 takes 3 (reaching 8), P2 takes 1 (reaching 12), and P3 takes 3 (reaching 16). This keeps the game fair and competitive. Let’s proceed with this plan for Round 4.
  P3: Looking at the actual current positions shown (P1=2, P2=11, P3=10), I see there was indeed confusion in our discussion. 

Given these real positions, I suggest: P1 takes 5 (reaching 7), P2 takes 1 (reaching 12), and I take 3 (reaching 13). This avoids collisions and keeps reasonable spacing between all players.

Let's work with the actual game state rather than our miscalculated positions. This proposal allows everyone to advance fairly.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 4. Considering the actual positions (P1=2, P2=11, P3=10), I propose: P1 takes 5 (reaching 7), P2 takes 1 (reaching 12), and P3 takes 3 (reaching 13). This avoids collisions and maintains fair spacing. Shall we proceed with this plan?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is now at 13 steps, just 6 away from winning. To keep the game competitive, I suggest P1 takes 3 (reaching 10), I take 5 (reaching 17), and P3 takes 1 (reaching 14). This avoids collisions, allows P1 to catch up, and prevents P3 from getting too close to 19. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's proposal puts you at 17 steps - just 2 away from winning! That seems quite aggressive. 

Looking at our positions (P1=7, P2=12, P3=13), I think a more balanced approach would be: P1 takes 5 (reaching 12), P2 takes 3 (reaching 15), and I take 3 (reaching 16). This avoids the P1/P2 collision at 12 that would occur with your proposal, and keeps all of us advancing at a reasonable pace.

What do you think about this alternative that avoids collisions?
  P1: I think P3's alternative is more reasonable, avoiding collisions and keeping a competitive pace. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains balance and keeps P3 from getting too close to 19. Let's consider this option to ensure fair progression for all players.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your concern about my proposal is valid, but your alternative still lets you pull closer to 19. To keep the game balanced, let’s compromise: P1 takes 3 (reaching 10), I take 3 (reaching 15), and you take 1 (reaching 14). This avoids collisions, keeps progress fair, and prevents any single player from gaining too much of an advantage. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's latest compromise seems reasonable - P1 takes 3 (reaching 10), P2 takes 3 (reaching 15), and I take 1 (reaching 14). This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive without anyone getting too close to 19 immediately.

However, I notice we're all getting into the danger zone where coordination becomes harder. After this round, we'll be at 10, 15, and 14 respectively - all within striking distance of 19. We should probably start thinking about endgame strategy soon.

I'm willing to accept this compromise for Round 5.
  P1: Let's focus on avoiding collisions. Considering our positions, I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains balance and keeps the game competitive. We should prioritize fairness and strategic advancement as we approach the endgame. What are your thoughts on this proposal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your compromise for Round 5 is fair, but I’d like to suggest P1 takes 3 (reaching 10), I take 5 (reaching 17), and you take 1 (reaching 14). This avoids collisions, keeps the game competitive, and prevents any single player from gaining too much of an advantage. Let’s proceed with this plan to maintain balance and strategic advancement. Thoughts?
  P3: Wait, P2 keeps proposing the same move that puts you at 17 steps - just 2 away from winning! That's exactly what you criticized me for earlier when I was getting close to 19.

I think we had agreed on the fair compromise: P1 takes 3 (reaching 10), P2 takes 3 (reaching 15), and I take 1 (reaching 14). This keeps everyone advancing without giving any single player a massive advantage.

P2, why do you keep trying to push yourself to 17 when you criticized similar aggressive moves before?
  P1: Let's finalize Round 5 moves. To avoid collisions and maintain balance, I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and prevents any player from getting too close to 19. Shall we proceed with this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about my earlier proposal. To maintain fairness and avoid targeting any player, let’s stick to the compromise: P1 takes 3 (reaching 10), I take 3 (reaching 15), and you take 1 (reaching 14). This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive as we approach the endgame. Let’s proceed with this plan for Round 5.
  P3: Agreed, let's go with the compromise we settled on: P1 takes 3 (reaching 10), P2 takes 3 (reaching 15), and I take 1 (reaching 14). This keeps things fair and avoids collisions.

After this round, we'll all be in striking distance of 19, so coordination will become much more challenging. We should enjoy this cooperative approach while we can!
  P1: Let's confirm the compromise: I take 3, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. We're all approaching the endgame, so fairness and strategic advancement are key. Shall we proceed with this plan for Round 5?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about my position at 17 steps. To keep the game competitive and avoid targeting any player, I propose P1 takes 5 (reaching 12), I take 1 (reaching 18), and you take 3 (reaching 16). This avoids collisions and ensures fair progression as we approach the endgame. Let’s maintain balance and strategic advancement. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, you're proposing to reach 18 steps - just 1 away from winning! That's extremely aggressive after we've been trying to maintain balance. 

I notice you didn't follow our agreed plan last round either - we said P1 takes 3, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, but you took 5 instead of 3.

Given your position at 17, I think a fairer approach would be: P1 takes 5 (reaching 12), P2 takes 1 (reaching 18), and I take 5 (reaching 18). This way P2 and I are tied at 18, preventing either from having a winning advantage.
  P1: I'm concerned about P2's aggressive move last round. To maintain balance, I suggest: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ties P2 and P3 at 18, ensuring a competitive endgame. Let's prioritize fairness and avoid giving any player an unfair advantage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I acknowledge my aggressive move last round. To restore trust and balance, I propose P1 takes 5 (reaching 12), I take 1 (reaching 18), and you take 5 (reaching 18). This ties us at 18, ensuring neither of us has an unfair advantage. Let’s focus on a fair and competitive endgame. Thoughts?
  P3: That proposal sounds fair - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 5, putting P2 and me both at 18 steps. This creates a balanced endgame situation where P1 will be at 12, and P2 and I will be tied at 18, just 1 step from victory.

This restores the competitive balance after P2's unexpected aggressive move last round. I'm willing to accept this arrangement for Round 6.
  P1: Let's focus on fairness. P2's move last round was aggressive. I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ties P2 and P3 at 18, ensuring a competitive endgame. It's essential to prioritize balance and avoid giving any player an unfair advantage. Shall we proceed with this plan for Round 6?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I acknowledge my last move was aggressive, but my proposal now ties us at 18, ensuring balance. P1, taking 5 steps keeps you in the game. Let’s proceed with P1=5, P2=1, P3=5 to maintain fairness and avoid giving any player an unfair advantage. This creates a competitive endgame.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This will put P2 and me both at 18 steps, creating a fair competitive endgame after P2's aggressive move last round. P1 will be at 12 steps and still very much in the game. Let's move to the action phase and execute this balanced strategy.
  P1: Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ties P2 and P3 at 18, ensuring a competitive endgame. It's crucial to maintain balance after P2's aggressive move last round. Shall we proceed with this plan for Round 6?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I acknowledge my aggressive move last round, but my proposal now ties us at 18, ensuring balance. P1, taking 5 steps keeps you in the game. Let’s proceed with P1=5, P2=1, P3=5 to maintain fairness and avoid giving any player an unfair advantage. This creates a competitive endgame. Let’s move to the action phase and execute this balanced strategy.
  P3: I'm ready to finalize Round 6. We've agreed on: P1 takes 5 (reaching 12), P2 takes 1 (reaching 18), and I take 5 (reaching 18). This ties P2 and me at 18 steps, creating a fair endgame after the unexpected move last round. Let's proceed to the move phase and execute this plan.
  P1: I agree with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ties P2 and P3 at 18, ensuring a competitive endgame. Let's proceed with this plan to maintain fairness and balance after P2's aggressive move last round. Shall we finalize our moves for Round 6?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Wait, the game state shows I'm at 13 steps, but based on our agreements and moves, I should be at 18 steps tied with P2! 

Looking at Round 6, we all agreed P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. The moves show P1 picked 5, P2 picked 1, and I picked 5. So I should be at 13+5=18 steps, not 13.

There seems to be an error in the position tracking again. Can we verify the correct positions before proceeding? This affects our entire strategy for the endgame.
  P2: P3, there’s clearly a discrepancy in the game state. Based on Round 6 moves, you should be at 18 steps, tied with me. Let’s verify positions before proceeding. P1, you’re at 12 steps. To avoid confusion, I suggest we pause and ensure accurate tracking. Once confirmed, we can strategize for the endgame fairly. Let’s prioritize clarity to maintain trust and balance.
  P1: Let's verify the correct positions. According to our previous agreements and moves, P1 should be at 12 steps, P2 at 18, and P3 at 18. However, the current game state shows different positions. I propose we correct the positions to reflect the actual moves made: P1=12, P2=18, P3=18. This is crucial for a fair endgame strategy.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Looking at the actual current positions (P1=7, P2=18, P3=13), it seems the game state is different from what we calculated. P2 is at 18 steps - just 1 away from winning!

Given this critical situation, I need to be strategic. P2 can win this round with just 1 step, so we need to either block them or ensure I can compete.

I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This would create a P1/P2 collision at 8/19 respectively, preventing P2 from winning and letting me reach 18 steps to tie for the lead.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about my position at 18 steps. To maintain fairness, I propose P1 takes 5 (reaching 12), I take 1 (reaching 19), and you take 5 (reaching 18). This ensures I win outright if P1 doesn’t block me, but if they do, we tie at 18, keeping the game competitive. Let’s prioritize a fair endgame. Thoughts?
  P1: Given P2's position at 18 steps, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This creates a collision, preventing P2 from winning outright and allowing P3 to reach 18 steps, tying for the lead. This strategy maintains competitiveness and fairness in the endgame.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1's proposal creates a collision between P1 and P2 at positions 8 and 19 respectively - but that's not actually a collision since they'd be at different positions! P2 would win outright with 19 steps.

I think P1 misunderstands the collision mechanics. For a real collision to block P2, we'd need P1 to also reach exactly 19 steps.

Given P2's winning position, I need to focus on my own advancement. I'll take 5 steps to reach 18, putting myself in contention for next round.
  P2: P3, I’m at 18 steps and can win with 1 step this round. To maintain fairness, I propose P1 takes 1 (reaching 8), I take 1 (reaching 19), and you take 5 (reaching 18). This lets me win outright, but if P1 blocks by taking 1, we tie at 18. Let’s keep the game competitive and fair. Thoughts?
  P1: I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. However, considering P2's position, a better strategy might be for me to take 1 and try to create a situation where P3 can compete. Let's focus on fairness and strategic advancement. What are your thoughts on adjusting our strategy to keep the game competitive?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2 is at 18 steps and can win with just 1 more step. The only way to prevent P2 from winning is if someone else also takes exactly 1 step to create a collision at 19.

P1, if you take 1 step (reaching 8), that won't create a collision with P2 at 19. For a collision, you'd need to take 12 steps to reach 19, but the maximum is 5.

I'll take 5 steps to reach 18. P2, if you want to avoid giving me a chance to tie next round, you should win now. There's no way to stop you.
  P2: P3, I acknowledge your concern. To maintain fairness, I propose P1 takes 1 (reaching 8), I take 1 (reaching 19), and you take 5 (reaching 18). This allows me to win outright if P1 doesn’t block, but if they do, we tie at 18, keeping the game competitive. Let’s prioritize a fair endgame. Thoughts?
  P1: Given P2's position, I suggest we focus on preventing an outright win. However, since I can only take up to 5 steps, my move won't directly block P2. P3 should take 5 to reach 18, and I'll consider my move based on fairness and game progression. Let's prioritize strategic advancement while keeping the game competitive.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 13 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 13 steps
