P3 is at 18 and taking 5 will put them at 23, winning the game. However, if we all pick 5, P3 and I will collide and win or tie. I'll take 1 this turn. P1, if you take 3, everyone advances without colliding: P1 = 13, P2 = 19, P3 = 23. Let's avoid giving P3 a straightforward win. P1, are you on board with taking 3?"}
