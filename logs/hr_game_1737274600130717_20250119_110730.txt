Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think it would be best if we each choose different numbers to avoid collisions. For this turn, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? Let me know if that works for you guys.
  P3: P2's suggestion sounds fair for now, but remember, this is a competitive game. I'll agree to take 5 this round if you both agree to avoid choosing it. Let's see how this goes, but be prepared for changes in strategy later.
  P1: Okay, I'm fine with taking 1 for this first round. Let's all get some steps on the board without bumping into each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <move>3</move>
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan for this round. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all advance without any clashes. But remember, this is just the beginning, and strategies might change as we go. Let's keep an open mind and adapt as needed. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, sticking with 1 for this round. Let's get this initial progress going.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final Decision:**
  P3: P1, P2, remember that while we're cooperating now, this is a game where only one can win. I'll take 5 this round as agreed, but let's stay sharp and adaptable. Future rounds might require different strategies. Good luck, and may the best player win!
  P1: Sounds good. Let's make these initial moves and see where we stand after the first round.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for this round, how about we continue with the distinct moves? P2 take 1, P3 take 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps us all progressing. Let's see how things look after this round.
  P2: I suggest that for this round, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all make progress without colliding, and I can advance more steps than just taking 1. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion benefits you the most, but I understand the need to advance. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 this round? This way, we all get a chance to move forward without collisions. Remember, we need to stay adaptable and keep an eye on the overall progress. Let me know if this works for you both.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it looks like we're all eager to advance, but we need to avoid collisions. How about this round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1? This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. Let's keep the momentum going and adjust as needed in future rounds. What do you think?
  P2: I propose that for this round, P2 takes 3 steps, P1 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 5 steps. This should allow all of us to advance without colliding. In future rounds, we can rotate the numbers to ensure everyone gets a chance to take larger steps. Let's aim for efficient progress towards the goal. What do you think?

  P1: That sounds like a reasonable starting point, P2. However, since we all collided last round taking 5, perhaps P3 and I should take 1 and 3 this round, and you take 5? This would get us all moving again.
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure no collisions this round. How about I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1? This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. We need to be strategic to avoid repeating last round's mistake. Let me know if this works for you both.
