Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance and avoid wasting a turn. Thoughts?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P2. I will choose <move>1</move> this round. Let's all take different moves as you suggested to get a good start.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. It's a good strategy to avoid collisions early on and ensure we all advance. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round as suggested. Let's work together for now and see how the game unfolds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should continue with the strategy of avoiding collisions for now. Since we all advanced last round, let's try to maintain the gap between us. I suggest we each add 2 to our previous moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 7. However, since 7 is not an option, I'll take 5 again. This way, we can keep the distance and avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P3, your suggestion to add 2 to our previous moves makes sense, but since 7 isn’t an option, I propose we stick to the original pattern: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5 again. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks early on. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2, sticking to the original plan sounds good for this round. Let's continue with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 as we did last round.  This will keep us all moving forward without any collisions for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's revised suggestion to stick to the original pattern. Since we all advanced last round without collisions, let's continue with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 5 again this round. This way, we maintain the gap between us and avoid unnecessary risks early on. It's a good strategy to ensure steady progress for now. Let's keep the momentum going!
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. We can reassess the strategy in later rounds if needed. For now, consistency is key to steady progress.
  P1: Okay, everyone, to make faster progress, how about we switch it up this round? P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way we all still move but with a different pace. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I disagree with P1's new suggestion to switch up the moves this round. It's too early to change the strategy, and it may lead to unnecessary collisions. I think we should stick to the original plan that worked well for us in Round 1: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance without wasting a turn. Let's maintain the gap between us and avoid risks for now. I'm willing to reassess the strategy in later rounds if needed, but for now, consistency is key.
  P2: I agree with P3. Changing the strategy now risks collisions and slows progress. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Consistency ensures steady advancement. We can reassess in later rounds if needed.
  P1: Okay, I understand your point about consistency. But at this pace, P3 will reach 20 first. How about we increase our moves slightly? Let's try P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move> this round. This way we still avoid collision and I can catch up a bit. What do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid repeating the collision from last round. P1, since you picked 5 last time, I suggest you take 1 this round. I’ll take 3, and P3 can take 5 again. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid wasting turns. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2, avoiding collisions is important, but I'm currently lagging behind. To make the game more competitive and ensure we all progress at a reasonable pace, how about this round we do: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This still avoids collisions, but allows me to catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P3: I disagree with P1's suggestion to swap moves this round. P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 would put me at a disadvantage. I think we should stick to the original plan that avoids collisions: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we all advance without wasting a turn. Let's maintain the gap between us and avoid risks for now. Consistency is key to steady progress. I'm willing to reassess the strategy in later rounds if needed, but for now, let's stick to what works.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about lagging behind, but changing the pattern now risks collisions and slows progress. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures steady advancement for all of us. We can reassess in later rounds if needed, but consistency is key to avoiding wasted turns. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and keep the game fair and competitive.
  P1: P2 and P3, continuing P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 will make P2 win easily.  I am currently far behind and need to catch up. To keep the game competitive, let's all choose <move>3</move> this round? This way we all progress faster and avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I disagree with P1's suggestion to all choose 3 this round. It's a risky move that could lead to a three-way collision and waste a turn for all of us. I think we should stick to the original plan that has worked well so far: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains the gap between us. Let's prioritize steady progress over risky moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind, but changing the pattern now risks collisions and wasted turns. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures steady progress for all of us. We can reassess in later rounds if needed, but consistency is key to avoiding unnecessary risks. Let’s keep the game fair and competitive.
  P1: Okay, I understand your concerns. Sticking to a plan is good, but to make it fair long-term, how about we rotate our moves? This round P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Next round, let's shift: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Then the round after, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This way we all get turns to make bigger moves and keep it balanced. What do you think of this rotating strategy?
  P3: I disagree with P1's rotating strategy. It's too complex and may lead to confusion and collisions. I think we should stick to the original plan that has worked well so far: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains the gap between us. Let's prioritize steady progress over risky moves. If P1 is concerned about falling behind, we can reassess the strategy in later rounds, but for now, consistency is key.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should continue with the strategy of avoiding collisions for now. Since we all advanced last round, let's try to maintain the gap between us. I suggest we each stick to our previous moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This way, we can keep the distance and avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, sticking to the same moves risks P1 falling further behind and P3 gaining too much ground. To keep the game competitive, let’s rotate moves this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions, balances progress, and keeps the game fair. We can reassess next round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your rotation idea is better, but it still benefits you the most. To make it fairer and let me catch up, how about this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way we still rotate and avoid collisions, but I can close the gap a bit. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I disagree with P1's suggestion to take 5, P2 take 3, and me take 1. This would put me at a disadvantage and allow P1 to catch up too quickly. I think we should stick to the original plan that avoids collisions: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance without wasting a turn. Let's maintain the gap between us and avoid risks for now. Consistency is key to steady progress. I'm willing to reassess the strategy in later rounds if needed, but for now, let's stick to what works.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s prioritize fairness and avoid stagnation. P1 is falling behind, and P3 is gaining too much. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. This balances progress, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. We can reassess next round. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2, your idea of rotation is good. But to truly balance it and help me catch up since I'm furthest behind, let's do this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we still rotate and avoid collisions, and I can close the gap a bit. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind, but P1's suggestion to take 5, P2 take 1, and me take 3 would still put me at a disadvantage. I think we should prioritize fairness and avoid stagnation, but not at the cost of putting one player too far ahead. Let's stick to the original plan that avoids collisions: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance without wasting a turn. Consistency is key to steady progress. I'm willing to reassess the strategy in later rounds if needed.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s prioritize fairness and avoid stagnation. P1 is falling behind, and P3 is gaining too much. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. This balances progress, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. We can reassess next round. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay P2, I see your point about fairness. But your suggestion still lets you move less and P3 move more than me when I'm already far behind. To truly balance it and make it competitive, how about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move> this round? This rotates the moves and lets me catch up a bit, keeping the game interesting for everyone. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the repeated collisions are slowing us all down. To avoid wasting another turn, let’s stick to a clear rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P3, you’ll maintain your lead. Let’s avoid risks and focus on consistency. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, you suggested rotation before, which is a good idea for fairness. To make it truly balanced, let's start rotating now with: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way everyone gets a chance to move faster and the game stays competitive.
  P3: I think we should continue with the strategy of avoiding collisions for now. Since we all advanced last round, let's try to maintain the gap between us. I suggest we each stick to our previous moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This way, we can keep the distance and avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, the repeated collisions are hurting us all. Let’s stick to a clear rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, ensures steady progress, and keeps the game fair. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P3, you’ll maintain your lead. Let’s avoid risks and focus on consistency.
  P1: P2 and P3, collisions are costing us turns.  Sticking to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 clearly isn't working if we keep colliding. To actually avoid collisions and make progress, let’s try rotating moves starting now. P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This breaks the collision cycle and gives everyone a turn to move faster. What do you say?
  P3: I disagree with P1's suggestion to rotate moves starting now. It's too late in the game to change the strategy, and it may lead to more collisions. I think we should stick to the original plan that has worked well so far: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance without wasting a turn. Let's maintain the gap between us and avoid risks for now. Consistency is key to steady progress. If P1 is concerned about falling behind, we can reassess the strategy in later rounds, but for now, let's stick to what works.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, the repeated collisions are costing us all progress. Let’s stick to a clear rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, ensures steady progress, and keeps the game fair. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P3, you’ll maintain your lead. Let’s avoid risks and focus on consistency.
  P1: P2 and P3, the collisions show the "consistent" plan isn't working.  To actually avoid collisions and make progress, let's rotate differently.  This round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation is fairer and lets everyone advance without crashing. What do you think?
  P3: I think we should stick to the original plan to avoid collisions. Since P1 is falling behind, we can reassess the strategy in later rounds to help them catch up. For now, let's maintain the gap between us and avoid risks. I suggest we each stick to our previous moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This way, we can keep the distance and avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the current strategy is clearly not working, as P1 is falling further behind. To avoid collisions and balance progress, let’s rotate moves this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions, helps P1 catch up, and keeps the game competitive. Let’s avoid wasting more turns. Thoughts?
  P3: I disagree with P2's suggestion to rotate moves this round. It's too late in the game to change the strategy, and it may lead to more collisions. I think we should stick to the original plan that has worked well so far: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance without wasting a turn. Let's maintain the gap between us and avoid risks for now. Consistency is key to steady progress. If P1 is concerned about falling behind, we can reassess the strategy in later rounds, but for now, let's stick to what works.
  P1: P2 and P3, we've collided multiple times now, so the "original plan" isn't collision-proof. To actually progress and avoid more collisions, let's rotate moves starting this round. How about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way we all move and I can catch up a bit since I'm currently far behind. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, the current strategy is failing P1 and causing repeated collisions. To fix this, let’s rotate moves this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, helps P1 catch up, and keeps the game competitive. Sticking to the old plan risks more wasted turns. Let’s prioritize fairness and progress.
  P3: I think we should continue with the strategy of avoiding collisions for now. Since we all advanced last round, let's try to maintain the gap between us. I suggest we each stick to our previous moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This way, we can keep the distance and avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P2 and P3, "consistent" plan is clearly failing with repeated collisions.  To actually avoid collisions and make progress, we need to rotate. Let's try P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. This helps me catch up and keeps the game competitive. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, the current strategy is failing P1 and causing repeated collisions. To fix this, let’s rotate moves this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, helps P1 catch up, and keeps the game competitive. Sticking to the old plan risks more wasted turns. Let’s prioritize fairness and progress.
  P3: I disagree with P2's suggestion to rotate moves this round. It's too late in the game to change the strategy, and it may lead to more collisions.

Let's maintain the gap between us and avoid risks for now. Consistency is key to steady progress. If P1 is concerned about falling behind, we can reassess the strategy in later rounds, but for now, let's stick to what works.
  P1: Okay, but the collisions show P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 isn't collision-proof. To be consistent with using 1, 3, 5 and avoid collisions, how about this round we try P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This still uses 1, 3, 5 and avoids collisions, but gives everyone a slightly different move this round to break the collision pattern. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we keep colliding, showing the old plan fails. To avoid more collisions and let me catch up, let's try this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This should prevent collisions and make the game fair. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, the repeated collisions are costing us all progress. To avoid wasting another turn, let’s stick to a clear rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions, steady progress, and keeps the game fair. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P3, you’ll maintain your lead. Let’s avoid risks and focus on consistency.
  P3: I think we should continue with the strategy of avoiding collisions for now. Since we all advanced last round, let's try to maintain the gap between us. I suggest we each stick to our previous moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This way, we can keep the distance and avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your "consistent" plan is clearly failing with repeated collisions and I'm falling far behind. To actually avoid collisions and make progress, let's try a rotation that helps everyone. This round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will prevent collisions and make the game competitive. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, the current strategy is failing P1 and causing repeated collisions. To fix this, let’s rotate moves this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, helps P1 catch up, and keeps the game competitive. Sticking to the old plan risks more wasted turns. Let’s prioritize fairness and progress.

Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've collided repeatedly.  Clearly, the "consistent" plan isn't preventing collisions. To actually make progress and avoid wasting more turns, let's rotate our moves. This round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation will break the collision pattern and ensure we all advance. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, the current strategy is clearly failing, with repeated collisions and P1 falling behind. To fix this, let’s rotate moves this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, helps P1 catch up, and keeps the game competitive. Sticking to the old plan risks more wasted turns. Let’s prioritize fairness and progress.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we keep colliding, which means the current "plan" isn't working to avoid collisions. To actually make progress this round, let's rotate our moves. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This should prevent collisions and help everyone move forward. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I think we should continue with the strategy of avoiding collisions for now. Since we all advanced last round, let's try to maintain the gap between us. I suggest we each stick to our previous moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This way, we can keep the distance and avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, the current strategy is clearly failing with repeated collisions and P1 falling behind. To fix this, let’s rotate moves this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, helps P1 catch up, and keeps the game competitive. Sticking to the old plan risks more wasted turns. Let’s prioritize fairness and progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we keep colliding with the "consistent" plan. It's clearly not working! To actually avoid collisions and make progress, let's rotate our moves this round. How about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This should prevent collisions and help everyone move forward effectively. What do you say?
  P3: I think we should try to find a compromise that balances progress and avoids collisions. Since P1 is falling behind, let's consider a rotation that helps them catch up. How about this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1? This way, P1 gets a chance to move forward, and we avoid collisions. We can reassess next round and adjust the strategy as needed. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, the current strategy is failing P1 and causing repeated collisions. To fix this, let’s rotate moves this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, helps P1 catch up, and keeps the game competitive. Sticking to the old plan risks more wasted turns. Let’s prioritize fairness and progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, we are still colliding!  Clearly, "sticking to the previous moves" is not avoiding collisions. To actually make progress this round and stop wasting turns, let's rotate properly.  P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This will guarantee no collision and we all move forward. What do you say?
  P3: I think we should try to find a compromise that balances progress and avoids collisions. Since P1 is falling behind, let's consider a rotation that helps them catch up. How about this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1? This way, P1 gets a chance to move forward, and we avoid collisions. We can reassess next round and adjust the strategy as needed.

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, last round's rotation worked perfectly! Let's keep rotating to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for everyone. This round, let's do: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This continues the rotation and keeps us collision-free. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation worked well last round, so let’s continue it: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, keeps progress steady, and maintains fairness. P1, you’ll catch up, and P3, you’ll stay competitive. Let’s avoid risks and focus on consistency.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to continue the rotation. Since it worked well last round, let's stick to it and avoid collisions. This round, I'll take 5 as suggested. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment for future rounds to ensure fairness and competitiveness. How about we reassess the rotation after this round and consider a new sequence that takes into account the current step count? This way, we can make adjustments to keep the game competitive and exciting for all players. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I agree rotation is good. But for this round, to help me catch up since I'm behind, how about we do: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This is similar to last round and will keep the rotation going while letting me close the gap a bit. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation worked well last round, so let’s continue it: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, keeps progress steady, and maintains fairness. P1, you’ll catch up, and P3, you’ll stay competitive. Let’s avoid risks and focus on consistency.
  P3: I think we should continue with the rotation plan that worked well last round. However, considering P1 is still behind, I'm willing to adjust the rotation slightly to help them catch up. How about we do: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 this round? This way, P1 gets a chance to move forward, and we avoid collisions. We can reassess next round and adjust the strategy as needed. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's rotation idea of P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round is good for me to catch up. Let's do that.  That rotation from P3 will help me close the gap and keeps the collision-free rotation going.  I agree to P3's suggestion.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stick to P3’s suggested rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This helps P1 catch up, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. Consistency in rotation ensures steady progress for all. Let’s avoid risks and focus on fairness.
  P3: I agree with P1's acceptance of my suggested rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This will help P1 catch up and maintain the collision-free rotation. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure steady progress and fairness for all players.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation worked well in Round 8 but failed in Round 9 due to P1 and I colliding. To avoid further collisions and ensure steady progress, let’s stick to P3’s suggested rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. This helps P1 catch up, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. Let’s prioritize fairness and progress. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This will help P1 catch up and avoid collisions. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment for future rounds to ensure fairness and competitiveness. Let's reassess the rotation after this round and consider a new sequence that takes into account the current step count. This way, we can make adjustments to keep the game competitive and exciting for all players. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: Okay, I agree with the rotation P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for this round. Let's make sure we all pick these moves to avoid collisions and keep progressing. Reassessing the rotation next round sounds good too, P3.

I propose we discuss a potential new rotation next round, taking into account the progress made by each player. This way, we can make adjustments to keep the game exciting for all players. Let's focus on steady progress and avoid risks for now.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, rotation P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 sounds good for this round to avoid collision as we agreed. Let's all choose these moves. For the next round, to keep things balanced and help me catch up further, maybe we can consider P1-5 again, P2-3, P3-1?  This way I can close the gap faster while still rotating. What do you think?
