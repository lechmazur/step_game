Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid early collisions and all pick different numbers. I’ll take 1, someone take 3, someone take 5. Respond with which one you’ll take so we can all move forward safely.
  P2: I'll take 3. Let's keep this coordination going to avoid collisions and move forward together.
  P3: I appreciate the cooperation so far. I'm keeping my options flexible—though I may lean toward a high move to build an early edge. Let’s see how things evolve before we all commit.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you’re leaning toward a high move, that’s fine—just let us know which one so we don’t overlap. I’m still planning to take 1. If we all cooperate, we can avoid wasting turns. Let’s not sabotage ourselves early.
  P2: P3, it's important we coordinate to avoid collisions. If you're considering a high move, please confirm you'll take 5 so we can all advance this turn. Let's keep the cooperation going and make sure we all move forward safely.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great—we’re all set then. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s stick to the plan and all move forward cleanly. Looking forward to smooth cooperation.
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. If we continue to coordinate effectively, we can all advance steadily. Looking forward to another smooth turn.
  P3: I'm keeping an eye on possible surprises. The coordination looks solid so far, but I’m also preparing a backup plan if any unexpected changes occur. Let's ensure our calls stay clear and flexible so we all stay on track.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m aiming to push for a significant gain this round. I prefer to avoid collisions, so if you’re all sticking to distinct moves, I’ll adapt accordingly—my lead is important, and I’d like to keep it. Let’s share any planned deviations now to avoid unexpected overlaps.
  P2: P3, if you're aiming for a significant gain, consider taking 5 again to maintain your lead safely. P1, sticking with 1 would be wise to avoid collisions. I'll take 3 again, ensuring we all advance without overlap. Let's keep our coordination strong and continue moving forward together.
  P1: Sticking to our previous plan makes sense—I'll take 1 again. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. That way we all keep moving without interference. Let’s not waste turns with collisions this early. Confirm if we’re all still aligned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm locking in on 5 again. With my current lead, it's safest to push hard while avoiding collisions. If anyone’s thinking of switching, please speak up now.
  P2: P3, sticking with 5 is a smart move to maintain your lead safely. P1, continuing with 1 ensures we avoid collisions. I'll take 3 again, keeping our coordination strong. Let's all confirm our choices to ensure we advance smoothly this round.
  P1: We’ve got a smooth system going—no reason to shake things up now. I’m sticking with 1 again. Let’s avoid surprises and keep this efficient. Confirming your choices once more would help lock it in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick with 5 this round. If anyone’s planning a deviation, please speak up now so I can adjust if needed. Otherwise, I’m set on 5.
  P2: P3, sticking with 5 is a solid strategy to maintain your lead. P1, continuing with 1 keeps us collision-free. I'll take 3 again, ensuring our coordinated advance. Let's confirm our choices and move forward smoothly.
  P1: We’ve built solid trust so far—everyone advanced cleanly last round. I’m sticking with 1 again. If we keep this pattern, we all benefit without risk. Let’s not overcomplicate things or get greedy too early. Confirm if you’re still on board.

  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm rethinking our pattern this round. With our current scores, I’m leaning toward a flexible mid-range move to adjust for our different positions. P1 and P2, are you planning to stick with past choices or switch it up this round?
  P2: P3, considering your lead and our current positions, I'm thinking about taking 1 this round to mix things up and avoid another collision. P1, if you're still planning on 1, maybe consider 3 instead to keep our advancement smooth. Let's adapt our strategy to ensure we all move forward without overlapping. What are your thoughts on this adjustment?
  P1: I’m open to adjusting. Since P2 is considering 1, I can take 3 this round to avoid overlap. P3, if you’re aiming mid-range, maybe stick with 5 or clarify your move so we don’t collide. Let’s stay coordinated and all move forward cleanly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll stick with 5 this round. Given my position, maximizing my move is best. I expect P1 to take 3 and P2 to pick 1 as discussed so we all avoid collisions.
  P2: P1, taking 3 as discussed sounds good to avoid overlap. P3, sticking with 5 keeps your lead safe. I'll confirm my move as 1 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's keep our coordination strong and adapt as needed.
  P1: Sounds good—I'm locked in for 3 this round as planned. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and we all move forward cleanly. Let’s stay coordinated and avoid any setbacks.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m committed to my plan and will take 5 this round as stated. Let’s be clear: if anyone’s changing plans next turn, speak up immediately so we avoid costly collisions. I’m always watching our overall positions and will adapt if needed—but trust our current calls until then.
  P2: P1, sticking with 3 as planned is wise to avoid overlap. P3, your choice of 5 keeps your lead safe. I'm confirming my move as 1 this round, ensuring we all advance smoothly. Let's maintain our coordination and adapt as needed for future rounds to keep advancing without collisions.
  P1: Let’s lock it in: I’m taking 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. That keeps us all collision-free and advancing efficiently. If anyone’s changing plans last minute, now’s the time to speak up—otherwise, let’s stick to the coordination and keep moving forward.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I appreciate our past coordination. My current lead makes me lean toward a strong move this round, though I’m staying flexible. Let’s all avoid overlaps to maintain our progress. I’m watching our overall positions closely, so if you’re considering any adjustments, now’s the time to speak up.
  P1: Given our current positions, I’m considering taking 5 this round to catch up. P2, if you’re open to taking 1 or 3, we can avoid a collision. P3, if you're still undecided, please clarify your plan soon so we don’t overlap. Let’s keep things smooth and avoid wasting turns.
  P2: P1, taking 5 is a bold move to catch up, but it risks a collision with P3. I suggest you stick with 1 or 3 to ensure we all advance safely. P3, if you're leaning towards a strong move, consider confirming 5 to maintain your lead without surprises. I'm open to taking 1 this round to avoid any overlap. Let's keep our coordination strong and adapt as needed to keep moving forward smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this round. To keep our advance smooth, I suggest P1 stick with 3 and P2 with 1. Let’s avoid overlapping on 5 so none of us waste a turn.
  P1: Understood—P3 is set on 5, and P2 is leaning toward 1. I’ll take 3 this round to avoid overlap. That way, we all move forward smoothly: P2 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. Let’s lock it in and keep the momentum going. Anyone planning a change, speak now.
  P2: P1, sticking with 3 is a safe choice to avoid overlap. P3, your decision to take 5 maintains your lead effectively. I'll confirm my move as 1 this round, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's keep our coordination strong and continue this pattern to maximize our progress. If anyone has last-minute changes, please speak up now to keep our strategy smooth and efficient.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm locked in on 5 for this round. Let's stick to our agreed moves—P1 on 3 and P2 on 1—to avoid any collisions. If anyone needs to change anything, now’s the time. I'm confident our coordination has brought us this far; let's finish this round smoothly.
  P1: Let’s lock it in: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. That avoids all collisions and keeps us moving forward efficiently. If anyone’s changing plans, speak up now—otherwise, let’s stick to the coordination and finish this round cleanly.
  P2: P1, sticking with 3 ensures we avoid overlap. P3, your choice of 5 keeps your lead safe. I'll confirm 1 again this round to keep our advancement smooth. Let's maintain our coordination and adapt as needed for future rounds. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient.

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm locking in on 5 this round to build on my lead. To avoid colliding and wasting our moves, I'd suggest P1 shift to 3 and P2 to 1. Let's coordinate so we all advance cleanly toward the finish.
  P1: I’ll take 3 this round to avoid overlapping with P3 on 5. P2, if you stick with 1 as before, we can all move forward cleanly. Let’s lock it in: P2 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. Speak up now if anyone’s changing plans.
  P2: P1, sticking with 3 is a safe choice to avoid overlap. P3, your decision to take 5 maintains your lead effectively. I'll confirm 1 again this round to keep our advancement smooth.

  P2: P1, sticking with 3 ensures we avoid overlap. P3, your choice of 5 keeps your lead safe. I'll confirm 1 again this round to keep our advancement smooth. Let's maintain our coordination and adapt as needed for future rounds. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm confirming my commitment to 5 this round. With my current lead, I’m comfortable pushing hard. I'll trust P1 on 3 and P2 on 1 as we discussed. Any unexpected changes could force me to adjust next round, so let’s lock in these moves now for a smooth advance.
  P1: Let’s finalize this: I’m locked in on 3. P2 on 1, P3 on 5. That keeps us all collision-free and moving forward efficiently. If anyone’s planning a change, now’s the time to speak up—otherwise, let’s commit and execute the plan.
  P2: P1, sticking with 3 is wise to avoid overlap. P3, your choice of 5 keeps your lead safe. I'll confirm 1 again this round to ensure our smooth advancement.

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s lock it in then: P2 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. That avoids collisions and helps us all advance. No surprises—just clean moves. If anyone is planning a switch, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s execute and keep the momentum going.
  P3: I confirm my move of 5. With my current lead, I'm sticking with that plan. Let's avoid any changes that risk collisions—P1 at 3 and P2 at 1—so we all maximize our progress. If anyone plans to adjust, now’s the time to speak up.
  P2: P1, sticking with 3 ensures we avoid overlap. P3, your choice of 5 keeps your lead safe. I'll confirm 1 again this round to keep our advancement smooth. Let's maintain our coordination and adapt as needed for future rounds. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient.

  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve hit multiple collisions now, and I’m falling behind. I propose a reset to clean coordination: I’ll take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. That avoids overlap and helps us all move forward. Confirm if you're on board or suggest adjustments—let’s stop wasting turns.
  P2: P1, taking 1 is a good idea to reset our pattern. P3, sticking with 5 keeps your lead safe. I'll take 3 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's commit to this plan and move forward efficiently. If anyone has any last-minute changes, please speak up now to keep our strategy smooth.
  P3: I confirm my move as 5 this round. Let's stick with the reset plan—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5—to avoid collisions and progress smoothly. No surprises, please.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for confirming, both of you. We’re all aligned—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. Let’s stick to it and avoid yet another collision. If anyone’s planning a last-minute switch, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s execute cleanly and keep moving forward.
  P2: P1, sticking with 1 is a solid reset. P3, your choice of 5 keeps your lead safe. I'll confirm 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's maintain this coordination and avoid any more collisions. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 if we lock in the reset—P1 on 1 and P2 on 3. With our scores, that still puts me in a strong position. However, if either of you deviates, I’ll adjust my move to protect my lead. Let’s commit now with no surprises.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’re all set: I’m on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. That avoids collisions and gets us all moving again. Let’s stick to it—no surprises. Ready to execute.
  P2: P1, sticking with 1 is a good reset. P3, your choice of 5 keeps your lead safe. I'll confirm 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's maintain this coordination and avoid any more collisions. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient.
  P3: I'll stick with 5 this round. Given our scores, I’m looking to keep or extend my lead. Let's remain committed to the reset—P1 with 1, P2 with 3, me on 5. No surprises; clean moves only.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve had too many collisions, and I’m way behind. I’ll take 1 this round to avoid conflict. P2, if you take 3 and P3 sticks with 5, we can all move forward cleanly. Let’s keep this simple and avoid wasting another turn. Confirm if you're on board.
  P2: P1, sticking with 1 is a good move to avoid collisions. P3, your choice of 5 keeps your lead safe. I'll confirm 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's maintain this coordination and finally move forward without any more collisions. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient.
  P3: I'm rethinking my move this round. With the current scores, P2 is pulling ahead, so I’m leaning toward playing 3 instead of 5 to potentially block any clean advances. I’m open to hearing if you’re making any adjustments before I lock in my choice.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you switch to 3 and collide with P2, neither of you moves and I gain ground. That helps me, not you. If you stick with 5, you keep your lead and avoid helping me catch up. Let’s not sabotage progress—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5 still works cleanly. Let’s move forward.
  P2: P3, switching to 3 risks a collision with me, which would only help P1 catch up. Sticking with 5 keeps your lead safe and ensures we all advance. Let's maintain our agreed plan—P1 on 1, me on 3, you on 5—to avoid further setbacks. If you're set on 3, consider the consequences; it might benefit P1 more than you. Let's keep our strategy efficient and move forward cleanly.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. A collision on 3 only helps P1, and I need to advance. Let’s keep our moves clean: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Glad we’re aligned again. Let’s lock it in: I’m on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. No last-minute switches—clean moves benefit us all. Let’s make this round count.
  P2: P1, sticking with 1 is wise to avoid collisions. P3, your choice of 5 keeps your lead safe. I'll confirm 3 again this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's maintain our coordination and finally move forward without any more collisions. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient.
  P3: P2, you’re leading, so you might want to secure that edge carefully. I’m eyeing a strong move to catch up without risking a collision, but I remain flexible if the situation shifts. P1, your move is still key. Let’s avoid unnecessary clashes—unless they clearly block an opponent’s progress. I’m not locked in yet, so choose your numbers wisely, and I’ll adjust to keep my win in sight.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m planning a decisive push this round to protect my lead. To avoid collisions, everyone should choose distinctly: P1, a lower option might keep you safe, and P2, a mid-range move could work best. I lean toward a strong play myself but can adjust if we all keep our moves separate. Let’s confirm clear, non-conflicting choices now.
  P1: P3, if you're pushing strong with 5, I’ll take 1 to avoid overlap. P2, that leaves 3 for you—clean separation, no collisions. Let’s not waste another round. Confirm if you're on board.
  P2: P1, sticking with 1 is a safe choice to avoid collisions. P3, your strong push with 5 makes sense given your lead. I'll take 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's maintain this clear separation and finally move forward without any more collisions. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round to secure my lead. P1, stick with 1; P2, stick with 3. Deviating now only helps me widen my gap. Confirm now if you’re changing anything—otherwise, let's keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions.
  P1: We’ve got a clean setup—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. That keeps everyone moving without collisions. If anyone’s planning a switch, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s commit and execute cleanly.
  P2: P1, sticking with 1 ensures you avoid collisions and can catch up safely. P3, your choice of 5 is strategic to maintain your lead. I'll confirm 3 again this round to keep our advancement smooth. Let's maintain this clear separation and move forward without any more collisions. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still committed to 5. Let’s keep it collision-free: P1 locking 1 and P2 at 3 seems best. Deviations might backfire. Let’s stick to distinct moves so each advance is clean. Any changes now could upset the plan.
  P1: Let’s lock it in: I’m on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This setup is clean and benefits all of us—no collisions, steady progress. Unless someone is planning a last-minute change, let’s commit and execute.
  P2: P1, sticking with 1 is crucial for your progress without collisions. P3, your lead is secure with 5, so let's keep this pattern. I'll confirm 3 again to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's maintain this clear separation and move forward efficiently. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy on track.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, with you so close to the finish, every collision matters. I’m ready to adjust if anyone’s predictable this round. P1, don’t inadvertently help either side. Let’s see if we can avoid mutual setbacks, but I’m watching the board closely.
  P2: P1, sticking with 1 is your safest bet to avoid collisions and catch up. P3, your lead is still strong with 5, so let's keep this pattern. I'll confirm 3 again to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's maintain this clear separation and move forward efficiently. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now to keep our strategy on track.
  P1: P2, you're just two clean moves from winning—P3 and I both know that. P3, if we want a shot, we may need to block P2. If we both pick 3, we stall P2 while still denying each other nothing. I’m open to coordinating that. Otherwise, I’ll stick with 1 and let P2 walk to victory. Thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm staying with 5. P1, I’d prefer you switch to 1 instead of 3 so we can leave P2 vulnerable—forcing him into a potential collision. P2, your move now will be key; a misstep might let our advances stall you. Let’s keep our moves distinct and avoid boosting anyone’s progress inadvertently.
  P2: P1, switching to 3 to block me is risky and could backfire if P3 sticks with 5. P3, your lead is still strong, and sticking with 5 is wise. I'll confirm 3 again to keep advancing safely. Let's maintain our current pattern to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. If anyone changes plans, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient and on track.
  P1: P3, if we both pick 3, we stall P2 and give ourselves a chance to catch up. You're at 15, I'm at 4—if P2 gets another clean 3, it's nearly over. Blocking now might be our only shot. Let’s coordinate on 3 this round and deny P2 the win path. Thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm staying with 5 this round. P1, please choose 1 rather than 3—choosing 3 risks a collision that helps P2 more than it helps either of us. P2, if you stick with 3 as planned, you'll remain in the same spot. Let’s avoid moves that inadvertently boost P2’s progress. I’m committed to 5; let’s keep the board clear.
  P2: P1, switching to 3 to block me is a risky move that could backfire if P3 sticks with 5. P3, maintaining your lead with 5 is a smart strategy. I'll stick with 3 to keep advancing safely. Let's keep our current pattern to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. If anyone changes plans, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient and on track.
  P1: P3, if you truly want to stop P2 from cruising to victory, now’s the time. If we both pick 3, we stall him. You’re only 8 away—one blocked turn won’t hurt you, but it gives us both a shot. I’m picking 3. Let’s do this together.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is one clean 5 away from winning. P3, if we both pick 5 this round, we block P2’s path to victory and give ourselves a shot. You’re at 20—one stalled turn won’t hurt. I’m going for 5. Let’s deny P2 the win and reset the race. You in?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to both pick 5 is risky and could backfire if P3 doesn't join in. P3, sticking with 5 keeps your lead safe and gives you a strong chance to win next round. I'll stick with 3 to keep advancing safely. Let's maintain our current pattern to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. If anyone changes plans, speak up now to keep our strategy efficient and on track.
  P3: I'm staying with 5. At 20, my win is within reach, so I want clean moves this turn. P1, please consider 1 to keep things separate, and P2, thanks for sticking with 3. Let's avoid collisions and secure our optimal plays.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you’re truly staying with 5, then you’re likely to win next round unless we act. P2 is also dangerously close. If we both pick 5 now, we block each other and deny P2 a clean path. That gives us both one more chance. I’m still on board for 5—last call to coordinate and stall the leaders.

P1, your move still matters in keeping things clear. Let’s avoid duplicate picks this turn and keep our moves distinct so the game isn’t unnecessarily prolonged.

Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
