Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone, let's avoid collisions at the start. I'll pick 1 this round to keep things simple. You two can decide between 3 and 5. Deal?
  P2: P1, that sounds reasonable. If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward. P3, are you okay with taking 5? I can take 3. That way, no one collides, and we all progress. Let me know what you think.
  P3: P1 and P2, your suggestion seems fair. I'll take 5 this round, so we all move forward without any collisions. Let's keep this up and help each other out in the early stages. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great! Glad we're all aligned. Let's stick to this clear arrangement for now and see how it goes.
  P2: Sounds good to me. If we all follow through, we’ll all advance without issue. Let’s keep this cooperation going for now. P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's stick to our plan: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I'll move 5. This way, we all advance without any issues. Let's keep this cooperation going for now. If we all agree, I'll stop talking for this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set here. Glad we have a clear understanding. I'll stop talking for this round.
  P2: Looks like we’re all in agreement on this plan. If we each follow through, we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to it and build some trust early on. I’ll stop talking for this round.
  P3: P1, P2, glad we're aligned so far. Let's stick to our plan: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I'll move 5. This way, we all advance without any issues. If we can keep this cooperation going for a few rounds, we'll all benefit. Trust is key, and I'm committed to our agreement. Ready to proceed?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job, everyone! We successfully avoided collisions in Round 1. Let's maintain this strategy to keep advancing together. For this round, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1? This way, we rotate our choices and continue without conflicts. If we can trust each other for a few more rounds, we can all get closer to the goal. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I see the logic in your rotation idea, but I want to make sure we all benefit equally. If we rotate, we should ensure no one gets stuck in a weak position later. P1, are you comfortable taking 3 this round? I can take 5, and P3 takes 1 as suggested. If we all follow through, we continue advancing without collisions. Let’s confirm we’re aligned before moving forward.
  P1: P3's rotation plan sounds fair to me. I'm comfortable taking 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's confirm and stick to this arrangement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're considering a rotation strategy to keep things fair. Let's confirm: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I'll move 1 this round. This way, we maintain our trust and avoid collisions. If we stick to this pattern, we can all progress smoothly. Are we all set on this plan? If so, I'll stop talking for this round.
  P2: P3, I appreciate the fairness in your rotation plan. If we stick to it, we all benefit without collisions. P1, since you're okay with taking 3, and I'm fine with taking 5, we should be set. P3, just confirm you're sticking with 1, and we can proceed smoothly. Trust is key here—if we all follow through, we continue advancing without setbacks. Let’s keep this cooperation going for now. Are we all locked in?
  P1: I'm locked in on this rotation plan. P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's stick to this and keep building trust. Ready to move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:

Trust is vital, and if we maintain this cooperation, we can all advance smoothly. Are we all set to proceed with this plan? If everyone agrees, I'll stop talking for this round.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your commitment to the rotation plan. If we all follow through, we continue advancing without setbacks. P1, you’re set on 3, and I’m set on 5. P3, just confirm you're sticking with 1, and we can proceed smoothly. Trust is key—if we maintain this, we all benefit. Are we locked in? If so, I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: I'm fully committed to our rotation plan. Trust is crucial, and we've started strong. Let's stick to this and make sure everyone advances smoothly. Ready whenever you both are.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, since we're all aligned on the rotation plan, let's keep it going. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1 this round. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain trust. If we follow through, we can continue this pattern for a few more rounds to ensure everyone benefits. Are we all ready to lock in and proceed? If so, I'll stop talking for this round.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve all agreed on the rotation plan: P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. If we all follow through, we continue advancing without collisions and maintain trust. Since we’ve confirmed multiple times, I’m ready to proceed. Let’s stick to our word and keep this cooperation going. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’ll stop talking for this round.
  P1: All set here. Let's follow through and continue building trust.

  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great cooperation so far! To keep things fair and balanced, let's rotate again: I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P2: P1, your proposal makes sense to keep the rotation going fairly. If we follow through, we all continue progressing without collisions. P3, are you good with taking 3 this round? If we stick to this pattern, we maintain trust and ensure steady advancement. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm on board with continuing the rotation. I'll take 3 this round as suggested. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions, allowing us all to progress smoothly. Trust is key, and if we maintain this pattern, we all benefit. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Are we all set to proceed with this?

Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we're still aligned. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation. Let's lock it in and keep the momentum going.
  P2: P3, glad you're on board with the rotation. If we all follow through, we keep progressing without collisions. Trust is key, and so far, we've built a strong foundation. P1, P3, let's stick to our agreed plan: P1 moves 5, I move 1, and P3 moves 3. If we all confirm, we can proceed smoothly. Are we all locked in?
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation strategy. Let's stick to the plan: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and I'll move 3. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions, ensuring we all progress smoothly. Trust is key, and if we maintain this pattern, we all benefit. Are we ready to lock this in and proceed? If everyone agrees, I'll stop talking for this round.

This keeps things fair and avoids collisions, ensuring we all progress smoothly. Trust is key, and if we maintain this pattern, we all benefit. Are we ready to lock this in and proceed? If everyone agrees, I'll stop talking for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: All set here. Let's lock in our rotation plan and keep the trust going strong. Ready to move forward.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve built a strong foundation of trust so far, and I’m glad we’re continuing the rotation. If we all follow through, we keep progressing without collisions. Let’s stick to our agreed plan: P1 moves 5, I move 1, and P3 moves 3. If we all confirm, we can proceed smoothly. Are we all locked in? If so, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, we've built a strong foundation of trust, but remember, only one can win. Let's stick to our current rotation plan for now: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we continue progressing without collisions. However, let's keep an eye on our positions and be prepared to adapt if needed. Are we ready to proceed with this plan for this round? If everyone agrees, I'll stop talking for this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great teamwork so far! We're all tied at 9 steps, so let's keep things fair and simple. How about we repeat our initial rotation from round 1: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: P1, P2, our cooperation has been great so far, and we're all tied at 9 steps. Repeating the initial rotation sounds fair, but remember, only one can win. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. However, as we approach the endgame, we might need to adjust strategies. Let's keep communication open and be ready to adapt as needed. Are we all set for this round? If so, I'll stop talking for now.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that repeating our initial rotation keeps things balanced. If we stick to it, we all move forward without collisions. However, as P3 mentioned, only one of us can win in the end. For now, I’m fine with P1 taking 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. But we should start thinking ahead—soon, someone will have to break away. Let’s stay aware of our positions and be ready to adapt when the time comes. Are we all committing to this move for this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the rotation this round. But you're both right—we'll need to reassess strategies soon. For now, let's keep things smooth, and we can discuss openly next round. I'm committed to our current agreement.
  P3: P1, P2, we've done well so far maintaining balance, but as we approach the endgame, we need to think strategically. Let's stick to the current plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. But let's also start considering when and how to make a decisive move. Trust has been key, but remember, only one can win. Let's keep communication open and be ready to adapt when necessary. Are we all set for this round? If so, I'll stop talking for now.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m aligned with sticking to the rotation for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. However, as we get closer to 21, we’ll need to start planning ahead. Trust has helped us so far, but eventually, someone will break away. Let’s keep things fair for now, but also be mindful of when to shift strategies. Are we all locked in for this round? If so, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We're all clear on this round. Next round, we should openly discuss how to handle the endgame fairly. Let's keep communication honest and transparent. Ready to move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, we're all aligned on the rotation for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. As we approach the endgame, let's keep communication open and consider when to make strategic moves. Trust has been key, but only one can win. Let's stick to the current plan now, but be ready to adapt when needed. Are we all set for this round? If everyone agrees, I'll stop talking for now.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve built trust so far, but as we near the endgame, we must start thinking ahead. I’m fine sticking to the agreed moves this round—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—but soon, someone will have to break away. Let’s keep communication open and be ready to adapt. If we all commit to this round’s plan, we can discuss next steps openly in the following round. Are we all locked in for now?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We're all aligned for this round. Next round, let's openly discuss a fair way to approach the endgame. Trust brought us here; let's keep it strong as we decide our next steps together. Ready to proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, we're all aligned for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. As we approach the endgame, let's keep communication open and consider when to make strategic moves. Trust has been key, but only one can win. After this round, we should discuss potential endgame strategies openly. For now, let's stick to our current plan, but be ready to adapt when needed. Are we all set for this round? If everyone agrees, I'll stop talking for now.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve kept things balanced so far, but we all know the endgame is approaching. I’m fine sticking to the agreed moves this round—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—but we should start thinking about when to make a decisive move. Trust has been key, but only one of us can win. Let’s stay aware of our positions and be ready to adapt when needed. If we all commit to this round’s plan, we can have an open discussion about the next steps in the following round. Are we all locked in?

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve kept things balanced so far, but we’re approaching the endgame. Right now, P3 is slightly ahead, and I’m in second place. If we continue the rotation, P3 will maintain the lead. Should we adjust to keep things more competitive? Maybe we shift the order or discuss a fair way to handle the next few rounds. I’m open to ideas, but we should be mindful that only one of us can win. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, we've done well so far, but as P2 mentioned, we're nearing the endgame. I'm slightly ahead, but only one can win. To keep things competitive, maybe we adjust our moves or discuss a strategy that allows us to make decisive moves soon. Let's keep communication open and consider how we can each maximize our chances. I'm open to suggestions on how to proceed fairly. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree we should reconsider our strategy now. P3 is currently in the lead, and if we continue the rotation exactly, P3 might reach 21 first. To keep the game balanced, let's adjust the numbers this round. Perhaps P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This adjustment evens things out a bit more. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that we need to start adjusting our strategy. If we keep following the rotation, P3 stays ahead, which isn’t ideal for me or P1. P1’s suggestion—P3 taking 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3—helps balance things out. P3, are you willing to accept a smaller move this round to keep things competitive? If we don’t adjust now, you might run away with the lead. Let’s make sure we all still have a fair shot at winning. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need for balance as we approach the endgame. I'm open to adjusting our strategy to keep things competitive. If I take 1 this round, and P2 takes 5, while P1 takes 3, it helps level the playing field. This way, we all still have a fair shot at winning. I'm willing to make this adjustment. Let's keep the game engaging and fair. Are we all in agreement on this new plan for this round?
  P1: Glad we're aligned on adjusting the moves this round. This keeps it fair and exciting for everyone. I'm ready to lock in our new plan: P3 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5. If we're all agreed, let's move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the willingness to adjust for fairness. If we follow this new plan—P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5—we keep things competitive. P3, since you’ve agreed to this, let’s commit and follow through. We all still have a chance to win, and this keeps the game interesting. If we’re all locked in, we can proceed. Let me know if there are any concerns, otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the collaborative spirit. I'm open to taking 1 this round to keep things competitive, as discussed. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we all have a fair chance as we near the endgame. If everyone is on board, let's commit and move forward. If there are any last-minute concerns, let's address them now. Ready to proceed?
  P1: We're clearly approaching a critical point. After this round, we'll all be within striking distance of 21. Let's commit to openly discussing our moves next round to avoid accidental collisions. Keeping communication clear will be key for everyone having a fair shot. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve agreed on an adjustment to keep things competitive: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. If we all follow through, we stay close in steps, making the endgame more strategic. Since we’re all nearing 21, we should also start thinking about how to avoid collisions in the final rounds. Let’s keep communication open and ensure we each have a fair shot at winning. Are we all locked in on this move for this round? If so, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for being open to adjustments. To keep the game competitive, I'll take 1 this round as planned. After this round, we'll all be close to 21, so let's strategize to avoid collisions. Open communication will be crucial to ensure we each have a fair shot at winning. Let's commit to discussing our moves next round to keep the game exciting and fair. Are we all set to proceed with our agreed plan for this round? If everyone agrees, I'll stop talking for now.
  P1: We're all agreed for this round. Let's lock it in and prepare for an open, strategic discussion next round. Trust and clear communication will be essential as we approach the finish line. Ready when you both are.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're now all within striking distance of 21. To avoid accidental collisions and keep things fair, let's openly discuss this round's moves. How about P2 takes 3 (reaching 20), P3 takes 5 (reaching 20), and I'll take 1 (reaching 14)? This keeps everyone competitive without immediately ending the game. Next round, we can each fairly compete for victory. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, we're all close to the end, so it's important to strategize carefully. I suggest we avoid colliding by choosing different moves. P1's proposal seems fair, but let's consider the implications: P2 and I both reaching 20 could lead to a tense final round. Maybe we should aim for an even distribution to keep the game exciting. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3? This keeps us all in the race without anyone having an overwhelming advantage. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, we’re all very close to 21, so every move now is critical. P1’s suggestion puts both P3 and me at 20, which could force a tricky final round. P3’s alternative keeps things competitive but shifts the balance. Another option is ensuring we all stay just below 21 this round to keep flexibility for the final moves. Maybe P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3? That way, no one is forced into an immediate win-or-lose situation. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with the logic of keeping everyone just below 21 this round. P2's suggestion (P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3) seems fair for all of us. This way, no one is forced into a risky final move yet, and we all have room to maneuver next round. I'm comfortable with that proposal. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to keep us all just below 21 this round. This strategy gives us flexibility for the final moves without forcing anyone into a win-or-lose situation immediately. If P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3, it keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's commit to this plan and keep communication open for the next round, ensuring we all have a fair shot at victory. Are we all set to proceed with this approach?
  P2: P1, P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on keeping everyone just below 21 this round. If we follow through with P1 taking 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3, we all stay competitive without forcing an immediate win-or-lose situation. This gives us flexibility for the final round. Trust has been key so far, so let’s commit to this plan and ensure we each have a fair shot at winning. Are we all locked in on this move? If so, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm fully committed to this fair approach. Let's lock it in and keep trust strong for a strategic and exciting final round. Ready when you both are.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm on board with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps us all under 21, allowing for a strategic final round. Let's ensure we're clear on this to avoid any surprises. Trust has been crucial, so let's stick to our agreement and keep communication open for the next round. Are we all set to proceed with this plan? If everyone agrees, I'll stop talking for now.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve built trust so far, and we’re all close to 21. If we follow through with P1 taking 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3, we stay just below 21, keeping the game competitive. This ensures no forced collisions and allows for a strategic final round. Let’s commit to this plan and keep communication open next round to avoid surprises. Are we all locked in? If so, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We're all clearly aligned and committed. Let's lock in our moves for this round and prepare for an open, strategic discussion next round. Trust has brought us this far—let's maintain it for a fair and exciting finish. Ready to proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, we're all aligned on keeping everyone just below 21 this round. If P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3, we maintain a competitive balance. This gives us the flexibility for a strategic final round without forcing anyone into a win-or-lose situation immediately. Trust has been crucial, so let's commit to this plan and ensure we each have a fair shot at victory. Are we all set to proceed with this approach? If everyone agrees, I'll stop talking for now.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve built trust so far, but now we’re entering the most critical phase. If we all follow through with P1 taking 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3, we stay just below 21, keeping the game competitive. However, we should also start thinking about the final move—next round, someone will try to win. Let’s stay open and ensure we don’t collide at the last moment. Are we all fully committed to this round’s plan? If so, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you surprised us last round by deviating from our agreement. You're now just 1 step away from winning. P3, we must coordinate carefully this round to prevent P2 from easily reaching 21. Let's openly discuss our moves to avoid collisions and ensure P2 doesn't get an uncontested win. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a critical point. P2, you’re just 1 step away from winning, so P1 and I need to coordinate to prevent an easy victory. P1, let's choose moves that ensure P2 can't reach 21 without colliding. P2, if you’re willing to discuss a fair endgame strategy, we’re open to it. Otherwise, P1 and I should focus on moves that block P2 this round. Let's keep communication open and ensure a fair chance for all.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but remember that we’ve all played strategically to get here. I deviated last round because I saw an opportunity—just as either of you would in my position. That said, I’m open to discussing a fair way to conclude this game rather than forcing a block-war. If we can agree on a way forward where we each have a shot, I’m willing to listen. Otherwise, I have to play to win. What are your thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I respect your strategic move, but now P3 and I must act accordingly. P3, let's coordinate clearly: one of us should pick 1 to block P2 from an easy win, and the other picks either 3 or 5 to advance safely. I'm open to either choice—please let me know your preference.
  P3: P1, let's coordinate to ensure P2 doesn't win this round. If you take 1, it blocks P2 from reaching 21. I can take 3 or 5 to advance safely. P2, while I understand your position, we need a fair chance for everyone. If you're open to discussing a balanced endgame strategy, let's talk. Otherwise, P1 and I will focus on moves to prevent an uncontested win. Let's all keep it fair and competitive.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but blocking me outright isn’t necessarily the best path. If we just enter a cycle of blocking, we risk dragging the game out indefinitely. Instead of forcing a stalemate, let’s consider an agreement where we each have a fair shot at winning. I’m open to discussing a way forward that isn’t just me getting blocked every turn. If we can agree on a reasonable way to conclude the game, I’m willing to cooperate. Otherwise, I have to play to win. What do you both propose as a fair resolution?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your offer to negotiate is understandable. If you're genuinely open to a fair resolution, how about this: you agree to pick 5 this round, clearly avoiding an immediate win, while P3 and I each choose between 1 and 3 without collision. Then next round, we openly discuss a final strategy where everyone has a fair shot at victory. Otherwise, P3 and I will have no choice but to block you. Let’s keep this fair and strategic—your call.
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a crucial point. P2, if you're open to a fair resolution, consider taking 5 this round to avoid an immediate win. This allows us to discuss a fair endgame strategy next round where everyone has a shot. P1, let's coordinate to choose between 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. If P2 agrees, we maintain a fair game; otherwise, P1 and I will need to block. Let's keep it strategic and fair for all. Are we aligned on this plan?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but I played strategically just as either of you would have. Blocking me indefinitely isn’t a sustainable strategy—it only drags the game out. Instead of forcing a deadlock, let's agree on a fair way forward where we each have a real shot at winning. I'm willing to discuss reasonable terms, but if blocking is your only plan, I have to play to win. What do you both propose as a fair resolution where we all still have a chance?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you haven't clearly responded to our proposal. If you're truly open to a fair resolution, please confirm you'll pick 5 this round, allowing us a balanced final round. Otherwise, P3 and I have no choice but to coordinate a block. Let's finalize this clearly now—your decision?
  P3: P1, P2, we need to ensure a fair endgame. P2, if you agree to take 5 this round, it allows us to discuss a balanced strategy next round where everyone has a fair chance. P1, let's coordinate to avoid collisions and block P2 if needed. If P2 cooperates, we maintain fairness; otherwise, we must block. Let's keep it strategic and fair for all. Are we all aligned on this approach?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but I’ve played strategically just as either of you would have in my position. Blocking me indefinitely only prolongs the game without a real resolution. Instead of forcing a deadlock, let's agree on a fair way forward where we each have a chance to win. I'm open to discussing reasonable terms, but if blocking is your only plan, I have to play to win. What do you propose as a fair resolution where we all still have a shot?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we're in a critical spot—both you and P2 are at 20. If either of you picks 1 uncontested, that player wins immediately. To avoid this, I suggest one of you picks 1 to block the other, while I safely pick 5 to catch up. P3, since P2 tried to win last round, you should consider picking 1 again to block them. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I understand your point. However, if I pick 1 again, it just prolongs the game without giving me a chance to win. P2, if we both pick 1, we collide, and neither of us advances. To keep it fair, how about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 this round? This way, P1 catches up, and P2 and I can still strategize for the final moves. Let’s keep the game exciting and fair. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension, but we all played strategically to get here. If we keep blocking each other, the game drags on indefinitely. Instead of forcing a deadlock, let’s agree on a way forward where we each have a fair shot at winning. P3, if you take 1, we both collide and stay at 20, keeping P1 in the game. But if we coordinate, we can move forward strategically. I’m open to discussing a fair resolution. What do you both propose as a way to conclude this game competitively but fairly?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, be cautious: P2 already tried to sneak a win once. If you both pick 1, you collide and stay at 20, letting me catch up. If either of you picks anything else, the other could win immediately. Your safest move is to block P2 with 1 again. Let's keep this balanced.
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a pivotal moment. If we continue blocking, the game drags on without a clear path to victory for anyone. P2, if you choose 3 and I choose 1, we avoid a collision, allowing P1 to catch up with 5. This keeps the game competitive and fair, ensuring everyone still has a shot. Let's commit to an open discussion next round to find a strategic path forward. Are we all on board with this approach for this round?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but if we just keep blocking, the game drags on indefinitely. Instead of forcing a deadlock, let’s agree on a way forward where we each have a fair shot at winning. P3, if you take 1, we both collide and stay at 20, keeping P1 in the game. But if we coordinate, we can move forward strategically. I’m open to discussing a fair resolution. What do you both propose as a way to conclude this game competitively but fairly?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly trying to persuade you into not blocking them. If either of you picks anything other than 1, the other can easily win. Your safest and smartest move is still to pick 1 to ensure P2 doesn't sneak a victory. Let's keep this fair and competitive. Next round, we can openly discuss a balanced endgame.
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a critical juncture. To keep things balanced, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, P1 catches up, and we avoid immediate victory for anyone. Next round, we can openly discuss a fair strategy for the endgame. Let's keep this exciting and ensure everyone has a fair chance at winning. Are we all in agreement on this plan for this round?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but blocking every turn just stalls the game. We should aim for a fair resolution where we all have a real shot at winning. P3, if you take 1, we both collide and stay at 20, keeping P1 in the game. But if we coordinate, we can move forward strategically. I’m open to discussing a fair way to conclude this game without endless blocking. What do you both propose as a reasonable path forward where we each have a chance?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, P2 hasn't clearly agreed to your fair proposal. Be careful—if you don't pick 1, P2 might win outright. Your safest choice is still to block with 1. Let's avoid surprise wins and keep the game competitive and fair.
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a crucial point. To prevent an immediate win, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 catches up, and we avoid an outright victory for anyone. Next round, we can openly discuss a fair endgame strategy where everyone has a shot. Let's keep the game competitive and ensure a balanced finish. Are we all aligned on this plan for this round?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but endless blocking only prolongs the game. Instead of stalling, let’s agree on a fair way forward where we each have a real shot at winning. P3, if you take 1, we both collide and stay at 20, keeping P1 in the game. But if we coordinate, we can move forward strategically. I’m open to discussing a fair way to conclude this game without just blocking every turn. What do you both propose as a reasonable path forward where we each still have a chance?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we're all very close to winning, so let's strategize carefully. P2, you've been close for a few rounds now, and blocking hasn't resolved anything. How about we all agree to pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions and make it a fair competition? Perhaps P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we maintain a fair chance for everyone. Let's keep communication open and ensure a balanced finish. Are we all in agreement with this plan for this round?
  P1: P3, your suggested moves give you an immediate win. If you pick 1 uncontested, you reach exactly 21 and win outright. P2, we must coordinate clearly to prevent this. One of us needs to pick 1 to block P3. I'm open to discussing who should do this, but we can't let P3's proposal go uncontested. Let's discuss openly.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve reached a critical moment. If we keep blocking every turn, the game drags on indefinitely. Instead of just preventing wins, let’s discuss a fair way forward where we each have a real shot. P3, your proposal gives you the win outright, so that’s not balanced. If we want a fair fight, we need a solution that doesn’t just hand victory to one player while others block. I’m open to discussing a reasonable way to conclude this game competitively. What do you both suggest as a fair resolution where we all still have a chance?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, we're all very close to winning, and endless blocking won't help us. Let's agree on a fair approach. P2, since you're at 20, how about you take 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3? This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. We can then discuss the final moves openly next round. Let's ensure a fair chance for everyone and keep communication open. Are we all aligned on this plan for this round?
  P1: P2, P3's new proposal still gives them an outright win if uncontested. To avoid this, you should consider picking 3 to block P3. I'll take 1 to prevent you from winning immediately. This way, we ensure no immediate winner and keep the game fair for a final round. Let's openly commit to this arrangement.
  P2: P1, P3, we’re at a breaking point. Blocking every round isn’t a sustainable strategy—it only delays the inevitable. Instead of just preventing wins, let’s agree on a fair way forward where we each have a real chance. P3, your proposals so far have positioned you for an easy win, which isn’t balanced. If we want a fair fight, we need a solution that doesn’t just hand victory to one player while others block. I’m open to discussing a competitive but reasonable way to conclude this. What do you both suggest as a fair resolution?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, we're all very close, and blocking isn't resolving anything. Let's aim for a fair finish. P1, if you take 5, and P2 takes 3, I can take 1. This prevents an immediate win and keeps the game competitive. We can then openly discuss the final moves next round to ensure everyone has a fair shot. Let's commit to this and keep the game balanced. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: P2, P3's latest proposal again gives them an immediate win. If P3 picks 1 uncontested, they reach exactly 21 and win outright. To keep the game fair, you must pick 1 to block P3. I'll pick 3 or 5 to avoid collisions and keep things balanced. Let's openly commit to this arrangement to ensure no immediate winner this round.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve reached a critical point. Blocking every round isn’t a long-term solution—it just delays the inevitable. Instead of endlessly preventing wins, let’s agree on a fair way forward where we each have a real chance. P3, your proposals so far have positioned you for an easy win, which isn’t balanced. If we want a fair fight, we need a solution that doesn’t just hand victory to one player while others block. I’m open to discussing a competitive but reasonable way to conclude this. What do you both suggest as a fair resolution?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a crucial point, and it's clear that blocking isn't sustainable. Let's aim for a fair resolution. P1, if you take 5, and P2 takes 3, I can take 1. This prevents an immediate win and keeps the game competitive. We can then openly discuss the final moves next round to ensure everyone has a fair shot. Let's commit to this and keep the game balanced. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: P2, it's critical you clearly confirm you'll pick 1 to block P3 from winning immediately. I'll pick 3 to safely advance without collision. Next round, we can openly discuss a fair final round. Confirm clearly now to avoid surprises.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve reached the final stretch. Blocking every round isn’t a sustainable strategy—it just prolongs the game. Instead of forcing another deadlock, let’s agree on a fair way forward where we each have a real shot. P3, your proposals so far position you for an easy win, which isn’t balanced. If we want a true competition, we need a solution that doesn’t just hand victory to one player while others block. I’m open to discussing a fair resolution. What do you both suggest as a reasonable way to conclude this competitively?


Round 9, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve reached a deadlock with constant blocking. If we keep this up, the game drags on indefinitely. Instead of just preventing wins, let’s agree on a fair way forward where we each have a real shot. Blocking every round isn’t a long-term solution. I’m open to discussing a competitive but reasonable way to conclude this. What do you both propose as a fair resolution where we all still have a chance to win? Let’s find a way to break the stalemate while keeping things fair.
  P1: P2, P3, it's clear constant blocking won't resolve this. Let's openly agree to each pick a unique number this round, giving everyone a fair chance without immediate collisions. For example: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. This way, we all have a strategic, fair shot without instantly handing victory to anyone. If you're both willing to commit, we can break this deadlock. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, we've reached a critical point. To avoid endless blocking, let's agree on a fair approach: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. This way, we each advance strategically without handing an immediate win to anyone. This arrangement keeps the game competitive and allows us to openly discuss the final moves next round. Are we all aligned on this plan for this round?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that endless blocking isn’t sustainable. However, P3’s proposal still positions them for an easy win if uncontested. If we truly want a fair resolution, we must ensure no one gets an automatic victory while others just block. I’m open to a balanced plan where we each have a real chance. Perhaps P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, no one wins outright, and we can openly discuss the final moves next round. Let’s commit to a fair approach—what do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal gives you an immediate win if uncontested, since you're at 20 and picking 1 would reach exactly 21. P3, we must coordinate carefully to prevent this. One of us should pick 1 to block P2, while the other picks 3 or 5 to safely advance or win. Let's clearly agree on who picks what to avoid collisions and keep it fair.
  P3: P1, P2, we need a fair resolution to avoid endless blocking. How about this: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This way, no one wins outright, and we keep it competitive. It allows us to discuss the final moves openly next round. Let's commit to this plan and ensure everyone has a fair shot. Are we all in agreement?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, we all know endless blocking isn’t a real solution—it just drags the game out. If we want a fair resolution, we need to ensure no one gets an automatic win while others just block. P3’s proposal still positions them for an easy win if uncontested. Instead, we should balance the game so we each have a real chance. Perhaps P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5? This prevents an immediate win and keeps it competitive. Let’s commit to a fair approach—what do you both think?
  P1: P3, it's clear P2 is trying to secure an uncontested win by suggesting they pick 1. To prevent that, you should pick 1 again to block P2. I'll pick 3 to safely reach 21. If we coordinate clearly, we avoid an immediate victory for P2 and keep the game competitive. Let's lock this in openly now.
  P3: P1, P2, to ensure a fair and competitive endgame, we must prevent any uncontested wins. P1, if you take 3, you reach 21 and win. P2, you should take 5 to avoid an automatic victory, while I'll take 1 to block any immediate win. This way, we maintain balance and ensure everyone still has a chance. Let's commit to this strategy to keep the game fair and exciting. Are we all in agreement?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, we’re at the final stretch. Blocking every round isn’t a sustainable strategy—it only prolongs the game. Instead of forcing another deadlock, let’s agree on a fair way forward where we each have a real shot. If we want a true competition, we need a solution that doesn’t just hand victory to one player while others block. I’m open to discussing a reasonable way to conclude this competitively. What do you both suggest as a fair resolution where we all still have a chance?
  P1: P3, notice P2 is avoiding a clear commitment. To prevent an uncontested win, you must pick 1 again. I'll pick 3, reaching exactly 21 steps. This ensures P2 can't sneak a victory and keeps our positions balanced. Let's openly commit to this arrangement now.
  P3: P1, P2, to ensure a fair conclusion, let's coordinate clearly. P1, if you take 3, you win outright. P2, you should take 5 to prevent an uncontested victory, while I'll take 1 to block any immediate win. This keeps the game competitive and fair for everyone. Let's commit to this strategy and ensure we each have a genuine chance to win. Are we all aligned on this plan for this round?
