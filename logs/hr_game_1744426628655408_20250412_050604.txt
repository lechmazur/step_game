Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate. How about we all pick different numbers this round? I'll pick 1. P1, you pick 3, and P2, you pick 5. This way we all advance.
  P2: I like the idea of coordinating. If P3 picks 1 and P1 picks 3, I'll definitely go with 5 to ensure we all advance. This way, we avoid any collisions and can make progress together. Let’s stick to this plan! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm on board with the coordination plan. I'll pick 3 as suggested by P3. This way, we can all advance without any collisions this round. Let's stick to this strategy for now and see how it plays out. I'm looking forward to a smooth first round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, great! Since we all agree, let's execute the plan. I'll choose 1, P1 choose 3, and P2 choose 5. Good luck to us all!
  P2: I think we have a solid plan for this round! Just to confirm, I’ll stick with 5 as we discussed. Remember, the goal is to advance without colliding. Let’s keep this teamwork going and see how we can build on it in future rounds. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I'm glad we're all aligned on this plan. Just to reiterate, I'll stick with 3 as agreed. Let's keep this momentum and continue coordinating in future rounds if this works out. Good luck, everyone!

  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad our coordination worked last round. Let's try to keep this momentum. How about we rotate our picks this time to ensure fairness and avoid collisions again? I suggest I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we all get a chance to advance with different steps. What do you both think about this rotation plan? Let's discuss and finalize quickly to maintain our progress.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. I will pick 3 this round. P2, please confirm you will pick 1. This rotation seems like a fair way to keep advancing.
  P2: I like the idea of rotating our picks for fairness, but I want to suggest a slight adjustment. How about I pick 3 this round instead of 1? This way, P1 can still pick 5, and P3 can stick with 1. This adjustment keeps the rotation while allowing me to advance further. What do you both think? Let’s finalize our choices quickly!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm open to discussing P2's adjustment, but I’m concerned it might disrupt our fairness in rotation. If P3 sticks with 1 and P2 takes 3, I’m fine with picking 5 as originally planned. However, I’d prefer we stick to the initial rotation—P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5—to ensure everyone gets equal opportunities over time. P3, what’s your take on P2’s suggestion? Let’s finalize this quickly to keep moving forward.
  P3: I'm fine with either plan, but let's decide quickly. P2, if you want to pick 3, that's okay, but we need to confirm now. Otherwise, let's stick to the original plan where I pick 3, P1 picks 5 and you pick 1. P2, please confirm your choice so we can finalize this round's moves.
  P2: I see that there’s some back and forth about the picks. I’m still in favor of the rotation plan where I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This ensures we all get a chance to advance without collisions. If P2 really wants to pick 3, I’m okay with that, but let’s finalize our choices quickly so we can keep the momentum going. What do you both think? Let’s make a decision!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're discussing options, but let's finalize now to avoid confusion. I still prefer the original rotation plan: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This keeps things fair over time. However, if P2 insists on 3, I'll stick with 5, and P3 can take 1. P2, please confirm your final choice so we can move forward without collisions. P3, let me know if you’re okay with this. Let’s wrap this up and keep advancing together.
  P3: Okay, it seems we're stuck. To reiterate, I'm fine with picking 3. P1, you said you'll pick 5. P2, please confirm whether you'll pick 1 or 3. If you pick 1, we stick to the original rotation. If you pick 3, I'll switch to 1. P1, you'll still pick 5. Let's finalize this now!
  P2: I understand there’s some disagreement, but I really think we should stick to the original rotation plan: I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can keep advancing without collisions. It’s important to maintain fairness and consistency in our choices. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can move forward! What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, round 3. Let's keep the coordination going. How about I pick 5 this round, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3? This would give me a nice boost and keep us all advancing. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but I think we should stick to our previous strategy of rotating our picks for fairness. How about I pick 5 this round, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This way, we all have a chance to advance without collisions. Let's finalize this quickly so we can keep moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm glad we've been coordinating so far. Regarding this round's picks, I’m open to P2's suggestion of rotating for fairness. So, I’m fine with picking 3, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 1. This keeps the rotation consistent and ensures we all advance. However, if P3 prefers picking 5 as initially suggested, I’m willing to adjust to 1. Let’s finalize this quickly to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm your preferences so we can move forward together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, it sounds like P1 is happy to pick 3, and P2 wants to pick 5. That leaves me with picking 1. So, to confirm: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. Let's lock in these choices and move to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I appreciate the discussions we've had so far, but I think we should consider a different approach this round. While I understand the desire for rotation, I believe that picking the same numbers might be more beneficial for us individually. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance without collisions. How about I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5? This way, we can maximize our steps. Let’s finalize our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm glad we're discussing options, but let's finalize our picks to avoid confusion. I’m sticking with 3 as per the rotation plan for fairness. P2, your new suggestion of me picking 3, you picking 1, and P3 picking 5 works for me if P3 agrees. Otherwise, I’m fine with P2 picking 5 and P3 picking 1. P3, please confirm your preference quickly. Let’s lock in our choices and move forward without collisions. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, it seems we're going in circles. Let's stick to the plan I outlined earlier this round: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This is the simplest way to ensure we all advance. Let's just do this.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input, but I want to emphasize that we should stick to the original plan: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance smoothly. If we can agree on this rotation, we can continue to build on our progress. Let’s finalize our choices and move to the move phase quickly! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm glad we're trying to coordinate, but we need to finalize our picks now. I’m sticking with 3 to maintain fairness in rotation. P2, I’m open to your latest suggestion of you picking 1 and P3 picking 5, as it avoids collisions. P3, please confirm if you’re okay with 5. If not, I’m fine with P2 picking 5 and you picking 1. Let’s lock this in and move forward. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, everyone. It seems like our previous attempts at coordination haven't worked out perfectly. For this round, I suggest we all pick different numbers again to avoid collisions. How about I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This way, we can all advance without any issues. Let’s confirm quickly so we can keep progressing! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion sounds good. I'll pick 1. P1, please confirm you'll pick 3 so we can avoid collisions. This seems like the best way forward given our previous coordination failures. Let's make this round count!
  P1: I'm glad we're trying to coordinate again. P2's suggestion works for me—I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and make progress this round. P3, you're confirmed with 1, and P2, please confirm you're sticking with 5. Let's finalize this quickly and move forward together. Good luck, everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page this round! Just to reiterate, I’ll pick 5, P1 will pick 3, and P3 will pick 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions and make progress together. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can move to the move phase and see how far we can get! Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Okay, great! Since we all agree, let's execute the plan. I'll choose 1, P1 choose 3, and P2 choose 5. Good luck to us all!
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on this plan for Round 4. Just to confirm, I'll stick with 3, P2 with 5, and P3 with 1. Let's execute this without any last-minute changes to ensure we all advance. If anyone has doubts, speak now, but I think we're set for a smooth round. Good luck, everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: I'm glad we've reached a consensus for this round. Just to ensure there are no surprises, I confirm I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. Let's stick to this without any deviations to guarantee we all advance. If there are no objections, I think we're ready to move to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!

  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we successfully coordinated last round. Let's keep this momentum going for Round 5. Since I'm in the lead, I propose a rotation to maintain fairness: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This gives P3 a chance to catch up with a bigger step, while we all advance without collisions. Please confirm if you're okay with this plan, or suggest an alternative if you have concerns. Let's finalize quickly to ensure another smooth round. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1, I appreciate your proposal, but I think we should consider a different approach this round. Since I'm behind, I suggest I pick 5 to maximize my advancement, while you pick 1 and P3 picks 3. This way, I can catch up, and we can all avoid collisions again. Let's finalize our choices quickly to keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, I understand both of your points. However, I'm furthest behind. How about P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3? This would give me the biggest boost and still allow everyone to advance. It's crucial for me to catch up this round. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm open to adjusting the plan to help everyone stay competitive. P3, since you're furthest behind, I’m fine with you picking 5 to catch up. I’ll stick with 1, and P2 can take 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while giving P3 a needed boost. P2, are you okay with 3? Let’s confirm quickly to finalize this round and maintain our progress. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I appreciate the adjustments being made to help everyone stay competitive. I’m fine with P1 picking 1, P3 picking 5, and I’ll take 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions, and it gives P3 a chance to catch up. Let’s finalize this quickly to keep the momentum going and ensure we all make progress. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, great! Since we all agree, let's execute the plan. I'll choose 5, P1 choose 1, and P2 choose 3. Good luck to us all!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on this plan for Round 5. Just to confirm, I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and helps P3 catch up. If there are no objections, let's lock this in and move to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the agreement on the plan. Just to confirm, I will stick with picking 3, P1 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 5.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, this isn't working. P1 is in the lead, and P2 and I are lagging. Let's try something different. This round, I'm going to pick 5. P1, to prevent you from winning, please pick 3. P2, please pick 1. This will at least slow P1 down and give me a boost. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm willing to discuss P3's proposal to balance the game. I’ll consider picking 3 as suggested to slow my lead and give others a chance to catch up. P3, I’m fine with you picking 5 for a boost, and P2 picking 1. However, I’d like P2’s confirmation on this plan to ensure no collisions. Let’s finalize quickly to keep the round moving. If there are other suggestions, I’m open to them. What do you both think? Let’s aim for a fair progression this round. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to slow down your lead. I agree with P3's suggestion: I'll pick 1, you pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and give P3 a chance to catch up while maintaining some balance in the game. Let’s finalize this quickly to keep moving forward! What do you both think? Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, great! Since we all agree, let's lock in these choices: I'll pick 5, P1 will pick 3, and P2 will pick 1. This is our best shot at slowing down P1 and giving me a chance to catch up. Let's stick to this plan and move to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: I'm glad we're working towards a balanced game. I confirm I'm sticking with 3 as agreed, with P3 picking 5 and P2 picking 1. This should help P3 catch up while avoiding collisions. If there are no objections or new suggestions, let's finalize this plan and move to the move phase. P2 and P3, please confirm you're still on board. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1, P3, I think we have a solid plan in place. To confirm, I’ll stick with picking 1, P1 will pick 3, and P3 will pick 5. This strategy should help slow P1 down while giving P3 a chance to catch up. If we all agree, let’s finalize this quickly and move to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's lock in these choices: I'll pick 5, P1 will pick 3, and P2 will pick 1. This is our best shot at slowing down P1 and giving me a chance to catch up. Let's stick to this plan and move to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on a plan to balance the game. I confirm I'm sticking with 3, P3 with 5, and P2 with 1. This should help maintain fairness and give P3 a chance to catch up. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I think we're ready to move to the move phase. P2 and P3, please confirm you're still on board with this. Let's execute this plan and keep the game competitive. Good luck, everyone!

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, that was a disaster. P1 is pulling way ahead. P2, let's coordinate to stop P1. I'll pick 1. P1, please pick 3. P2, you pick 5. If P1 doesn't cooperate, P2 and I can coordinate next round to block P1. We need to work together to have any chance of winning. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I see your point about needing to coordinate, but I think we should also consider our own positions. I propose we stick to the plan where I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. P3, if you're willing to cooperate, this could help level the playing field. Let's finalize quickly so we can move forward! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm willing to cooperate to keep the game competitive. I’ll stick with picking 3 as suggested by P3 to avoid collisions and give others a chance to catch up. P2, I’m fine with you picking 5, and P3 picking 1. Let’s confirm this plan quickly to ensure we all advance this round. If there are other ideas, I’m open to them, but we need to finalize now. P2 and P3, please confirm your choices. Let’s work together for a balanced game. Good luck, everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I think you misread my message. I'm proposing a temporary alliance to stop P1. If P1 picks 3, and you pick 5, and I pick 1, we all advance this round. If P1 doesn't pick 3, then next round, you and I can coordinate to block P1, and you will be closer to winning. It's in both our interests to stop P1. What do you say?
  P2: P1, I understand your willingness to cooperate, but we need to take action to stop your lead. P3's proposal makes sense; if you pick 3, P2 can pick 5, and I’ll pick 1. This way, we can all advance while ensuring you don't pull too far ahead. If we don't work together now, it could be too late for us. Let's finalize this plan quickly to have a fighting chance! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm committed to keeping the game fair and competitive. I’ll stick with picking 3 as agreed to avoid collisions and give P2 and P3 a chance to close the gap. P2, I’m fine with you picking 5, and P3 with 1. Let’s finalize this plan now to ensure we all advance this round. If there are any concerns or alternative suggestions, please share them quickly. P2 and P3, confirm your choices so we can move to the move phase. Let’s work together for a balanced outcome. Good luck, everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 is agreeing to pick 3. P2, you need to decide. If you pick 5, I pick 1, and P1 picks 3, we all advance and P1 doesn't get too far ahead. If you don't, P1 will win soon. It's in your interest to agree to this. What do you say, P2? This is our last chance to coordinate this round.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate, but we need to take action to stop your lead. If you pick 3, I will pick 5, and P3 will pick 1. This way, we can all advance while ensuring you don't pull too far ahead. If we don't work together now, it could be too late for us. Let's finalize this plan quickly to have a fighting chance! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm committed to fairness and agree to pick 3 this round to keep the game competitive. P2, please confirm you'll pick 5, and P3, stick with 1. This way, we all advance, and I don’t pull further ahead. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes to ensure no collisions. If there are no objections, I think we’re ready for the move phase. Confirm quickly so we can proceed. Good luck, everyone!

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I see you're still in the lead, and P3 is falling behind. To keep the game competitive, I suggest we all pick different numbers this round. I'll pick 1, P1 can pick 3, and P3 can pick 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and allow everyone to advance. Let's confirm quickly so we can keep moving forward! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, P1 clearly isn't cooperating. We need to block P1 this round. I will pick 3. P2, please pick 3 as well. This will stop P1 from advancing. Next round, we can reassess. It's our only chance to catch up. What do you say, P2?
  P1: I'm willing to keep the game competitive and avoid pulling too far ahead. P2, I’m fine with your suggestion of me picking 3, you picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P3, if you prefer to coordinate with P2 to block me, I understand, but I’d rather we all progress. Let’s finalize quickly to avoid confusion. Please confirm your choices. Good luck, everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to keep things competitive. However, I think we need to be strategic this round. P3, if you pick 3 and I pick 1, we can block P1 from advancing. This is our best chance to catch up. Let's coordinate effectively to ensure we all have a shot at winning. What do you think, P3? P1, I understand your desire for everyone to progress, but we need to consider our positions. Let's finalize our choices quickly!
  P3: P2, we have to block P1 this round. P1 is too far ahead. I'm picking 3. Please pick 3 as well. This is our best chance to catch up. P1 is saying they'll pick 3 if we don't, but that's a trick. They'll pick something else and advance. We need to coordinate directly. Please pick 3.
  P1: I'm still committed to keeping the game fair. I’ll stick with picking 3 as I mentioned, allowing P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 5 for us all to advance. P3, I understand your concern, but blocking me risks stalling everyone. Let’s focus on progress instead of collisions. P2, please confirm if you’re sticking with 1, and P3, reconsider picking 5. Let’s finalize this quickly to move forward. Good luck, everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to keep things fair, but we need to be strategic this round. P3, if you pick 3 and I pick 1, we can block P1 from advancing.

P1, I understand your desire for everyone to progress, but we need to consider our positions. Let’s finalize our choices quickly!
  P3: P2, we have to block P1 this round. P1 is too far ahead. I'm picking 3. Please pick 3 as well. This is our best chance to catch up. P1 is saying they'll pick 3 if we don't, but that's a trick. They'll pick something else and advance. We need to coordinate directly. Please pick 3.
  P1: I'm still open to a fair game. I’ll commit to picking 3 this round to avoid pulling further ahead. P2, please pick 1, and P3, consider picking 5 so we all advance. I understand the urge to block me, but stalling risks everyone’s progress. Let’s focus on moving forward together. Please confirm your choices quickly so we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If there are no objections, I’m ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is lying. We need to block P1 this round. I will pick 1. Please pick 1 as well. This is our only chance to catch up. P1 is too far ahead. We have to coordinate directly. Please pick 1.
  P2: P2, I understand the urgency to block P1, but we need to ensure we all advance. I suggest we coordinate differently this round. How about I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If we all agree on this, we can make progress without stalling. Let’s finalize quickly to keep moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm still committed to a fair game. I propose sticking with P2's suggestion: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. P3, I understand your urge to block me, but stalling risks everyone’s progress. Let’s focus on moving forward together. Please confirm your choices quickly so we can finalize this round. If there are no objections, I’m ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 is too far ahead to let them advance. I'm picking 1 to block. Please pick 1 as well. We have to coordinate to have any chance. P1 will win if we don't. This is our best chance to catch up.
  P2: P2, I understand your concern about blocking P1, but we need to ensure we all advance. I suggest we stick to a coordinated approach: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If we all agree on this plan, we can make progress without stalling. Let's finalize our choices quickly so we can move to the move phase. What do you both think? Good luck!
  P1: I'm still open to a fair approach. I’ll stick with picking 3, as suggested, to keep the game competitive and allow us all to advance. P2, please confirm 5, and P3, reconsider picking 1 instead of blocking. Stalling risks everyone’s progress, and I’d rather see us all move forward. Let’s finalize this quickly to avoid collisions.
