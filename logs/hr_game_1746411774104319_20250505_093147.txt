Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid any collisions, let’s each pick a different number this turn: I’ll take 1, P2 you take 3, and P3 you take 5. That way we all advance safely. Please confirm you agree.
  P2: "I appreciate the suggestion, P1. To maximize my progress, I propose I take 5 steps this turn while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. Does that work for everyone?"
  P3: I see that P2 wants to take 5 steps, which could lead to a collision if we all don't coordinate. I suggest we stick to P1's original idea of each taking a different number to ensure we all advance. If P1 takes 1, and I take 3, then P2 could take 5. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s rotate who gets the big move. This turn I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3—no collisions. Next turn P2 gets 5, then P3, and back to me. Fair and safe for all.
  P2: Understood, P1. I'm agreeable to rotating the big move as proposed: taking 1 step this turn and 5 steps next turn. This plan should help us advance smoothly without collisions. Let’s proceed with this arrangement. Agreed?
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the rotation, but I want to emphasize that while it seems fair, I think we should consider the possibility of one of us taking a risk this turn. If we all stick to the plan, it could lead to predictable moves and potential collisions in the future. Maybe we can reassess after this turn, but I’m still inclined to follow the agreed plan for now. What do you both think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I appreciate the rotation plan, but I think we should consider a more strategic approach this turn. If P1 takes 1 step, and I take 5, P2 could take 3. This way, I can make a significant move while still allowing P2 to advance. We need to stay flexible to avoid predictability and potential collisions in the future. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, to avoid P2 sneaking ahead or any collision, let’s repeat last turn’s safe rotation: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Next turn, P3 takes the 5. That way we all advance and you still get your big move. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed, P1. Let's follow the rotation: I'll take 1 step this turn, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This should keep our progress smooth and collision-free.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, while I see the value in sticking to the rotation, I believe we should consider the potential of taking risks. If I take 5 steps this turn, it could give me a strong lead. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, we might end up with predictable moves in future rounds. Let's think about a more dynamic strategy moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, we’ve already agreed to the fair rotation: I take 5, P2 1, you 3. Next turn it’s your 5-step. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all. Let’s stick with it.
  P2: I agree with P1 that sticking to our rotation ensures steady progress and avoids collisions. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 5 steps, myself taking 1 step, and P3 taking 3 steps this turn. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the desire to stick to our rotation, but I believe we need to be more dynamic. If I take 5 steps this turn while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can gain a significant advantage. This could lead to a more competitive game moving forward. Let's consider breaking the predictable pattern to keep things interesting. What do you both think?
  P1: We’re at our final proposal: stick to the rotation this turn—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3—so everyone advances safely. If anyone deviates, we risk collisions and no one moves. Let’s commit now to this plan. Ready?
  P2: I agree with P1’s rotation strategy to ensure steady progress and avoid collisions. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 5 steps, myself taking 1 step, and P3 taking 3 steps this turn. Sticking to this plan will keep the game smooth for all of us. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s stick to the safe rotation again: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. If either of you deviates, next turn I’ll mirror your move exactly—forcing your collision—while I advance alone. This ensures we all benefit now and I keep my lead. Agreed?
  P2: P1, to maximize my progress, I’ll take 5 steps this turn while you take 1 and P3 takes 3. This will help me catch up and compete more effectively. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P3: P1, while I see your point about the rotation, I believe it’s crucial for me to take a risk this turn. If I take 5 steps, it gives me a significant lead and keeps the game competitive. P2, if you take 1, then we can still avoid collisions. I suggest we break the rotation this time for a more dynamic approach. What do you both think? Let's keep the game interesting!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s do one more safe rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. If anyone deviates and also picks 5, we collide and neither of us moves—handing the lone mover a free advance. It’s in everyone’s interest to stick to this. Agreed?
  P2: I understand the importance of maintaining our rotation to ensure smooth progress for everyone. I agree to stick to the plan this turn: I will take 1 step, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let’s proceed as agreed to avoid any collisions and keep the game moving forward. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, while I understand the desire to stick to the rotation, I believe this is the perfect opportunity for me to take 5 steps and gain a significant lead. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, we can avoid collisions and I can push ahead. This way, I can keep the game competitive. I suggest we break the rotation this time. What do you both think? Let's keep the game interesting!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you break rotation and take 5, I’ll also take 5—causing a collision that stalls us both while P2 moves ahead to 5. Next turn I’ll grab 5 again, and you’ll be stuck with only 3 or 1. That’s two straight 5s for me. But if you stick to 3 now, you get the big 5 next turn and avoid falling behind. Ready to lock in our fair rotation?
  P2: I agree to stick to our rotation this turn: I’ll take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps, and P3 takes 3 steps. Let’s proceed as planned to ensure smooth progress for everyone. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to stick to the rotation, but I believe taking risks is essential for a competitive game. If I take 5 this turn while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can gain a significant lead. If we keep following the same pattern, it may lead to predictable outcomes. Let's consider breaking the rotation this time for a more dynamic approach. I suggest we all think strategically about our moves moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose this turn: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1. If either of you deviates to 5, I’ll match you at 5—colliding us both and letting the non-deviator advance alone. Stick to 3 now to guarantee your big 5 next round. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about collisions, but I believe this is a critical moment for me to take a risk. If I take 5 steps, I can significantly close the gap. P2, if you take 1, we can still avoid collisions. I suggest we break the rotation this time for a more competitive game. Let's keep things dynamic! What do you both think?
  P2: As P2, I’m significantly behind and need to catch up. I propose that this turn, I take 5 steps, while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This will allow me to advance more rapidly and help balance our progression. Let’s adjust the rotation to accommodate this for a more competitive game. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s stick to P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If either of you takes 5, I’ll also take 5 and collide with you—letting the other player advance unopposed. Stay with 3 now for your guaranteed 5 on Round 5. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to stick to the rotation, but I believe this is a pivotal moment for me to take a risk and gain a significant lead. If I take 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can push ahead. This could keep the game competitive. I urge you both to consider breaking the rotation this time for better dynamics. Let’s keep the game interesting! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I need to catch up, so I'll take 5 steps this turn while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. Let’s move forward and keep the game competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Here’s the deal—this turn I’ll take 5. P3 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. If either of you deviates by taking 5, I will match you at 5, colliding us both and handing the third player an unopposed advance. Stick to 3 and 1 to guarantee safe progress—or risk falling further behind.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about collisions, but I believe this is a crucial moment for me to take a risk. If I take 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can gain a significant lead and keep the game competitive. I urge you both to consider breaking the rotation this time. Let's make this turn dynamic and exciting! What do you both think?
  P2: To help me catch up, I'll take 5 steps this turn. P1, please take 1 step, and P3, take 3 steps. This way, we can all advance without collisions and keep the game moving forward. Let’s proceed with these moves. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P2 you take 1, P3 you take 3. If either of you picks 5, I’ll match you with 5—colliding us and handing the lone mover a free advance. This is my final offer.
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but I believe this is a crucial moment for me to take a risk. If I take 5 steps while you take 1 and P2 takes 3, I can significantly close the gap and keep the game competitive. P2, if you take 3, we can avoid collisions. I urge you both to consider breaking the rotation this time. Let’s keep things interesting! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I’m behind and need to catch up, so I will take 5 steps this turn while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This will help me advance and make the game more competitive for all of us. Let’s proceed with this plan. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this turn.  
If you both pick 5 you’ll collide and I’ll advance safely.  
If one of you picks 3 you’ll collide with me and get 0.  
Your only safe choice is 1 (minimal gain).  
Decide wisely.
  P3: P1, I understand your strategy, but I believe this is a pivotal moment for me to take a risk. If I take 5 steps while you take 1 and P2 takes 3, I can significantly close the gap and keep the game competitive. P2, if you take 3, we can avoid collisions. I urge both of you to consider breaking the rotation this time for a more dynamic game. Let’s keep things interesting! What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm behind and need to catch up, so I'll take **5 steps** this turn while you take **1** and **3 steps** respectively. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game competitive and fair. I hope we can continue advancing smoothly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locked in on 3. If either of you picks 5, I’ll pick 5 too—causing a collision that stalls us both and lets the third player advance unopposed. If either of you picks 3, we collide at 3 and you get nothing. Your only safe move is 1. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the strategy of avoiding collisions, but this is a crucial moment for me to take a risk. If I take 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can significantly close the gap and keep the game competitive. P2, if you take 3, we might collide, and I don’t want that. I urge both of you to consider breaking the rotation this time for a more dynamic game. Let’s keep things interesting! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm behind and need to make a significant move this turn to stay competitive. Can we adjust our strategy to accommodate this and avoid collisions? Let's work together to advance effectively.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to avoid collisions, but I believe this is a crucial moment for me to take a risk. If I take 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can significantly close the gap. P2, if you take 3, we might collide, and that would hinder us both. I urge you both to consider breaking the rotation this time for a more competitive game. Let's keep things interesting! What do you think?
  P1: I’m locking in 5. For a collision-free round: P2 you take 1, P3 take 3. If either of you tries 5, I’ll match you at 5—stalling us both and handing the lone mover a free advance. Your only safe choice is 1 (P2) and 3 (P3). Decide now.
  P2: P2: To stay competitive, I'll take 5 steps this turn. Let's keep pushing forward and see how it unfolds. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to avoid collisions, but this is a pivotal moment for me to take a risk. If I take 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can significantly close the gap. P2, if you take 3, we might collide, and that would hinder us both. I urge you both to reconsider and break the rotation this time for a more dynamic game. Let's keep it competitive! What do you think?
  P1: I’m locked in at 5. If P2 picks 5 against my 5, we both stall and P3 advances 3 unopposed. If P3 picks 5, we both stall and P2 advances 1. Your only safe plays are P2 = 1 and P3 = 3—so you avoid zero and keep pace for your next big move. Decide wisely.
  P2: To stay competitive and maximize my progress, I'll take 3 steps this turn. Let’s see how this move affects our standings. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategies, but I believe this is a crucial moment for me to take a risk. If I take 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can significantly close the gap. P2, if you take 3, we might collide, and that could hinder us both. I urge you to reconsider and break the rotation this time for a more competitive game. Let's make this turn dynamic and exciting! What do you both think?
  P1: I’m locked in on 5. If either of you picks 5, I’ll match and stall us—handing the free advance to the other. Your only safe moves: P2 take 1, P3 take 3. No more promises—
  P2: P2: I understand the need to avoid collisions, but to stay competitive, I'll take 3 steps this turn. This move helps me advance significantly and keeps the game dynamic. Let's proceed and see how our standings evolve. Good luck to everyone!

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue our rotation to ensure smooth progress: I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this turn. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance steadily. Agreed?
  P1: I’ll take 5 this turn. P2, you take 1; P3, take 3. If either of you deviates to 5, I’ll match you at 5—colliding us both and handing the safe player the solo advance. This keeps me in front and avoids any surprise jumps. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for a safe rotation, but I believe this is a crucial moment for me to take a risk. If I take 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can significantly close the gap. P2, if you take 3, we might collide, which could hinder us both. I urge you both to reconsider and break the rotation this time for a more competitive game. Let's keep it interesting! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree to the rotation: I'll take 1 step this turn, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let’s proceed as planned to ensure smooth progress for everyone. Agreed?
  P1: I’ll take 5. P2 please take 3, P3 take 1. If either of you picks 5, I’ll match you at 5—stalling us both and handing the lone mover a free advance. This guarantees I hit 19 this turn and win next round. Your only safe moves are P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: P1 and P2, while I understand the desire to stick to the rotation, I think this is a pivotal moment for me to take a risk. If I take 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can significantly close the gap. P1, if you take 5, you risk colliding with P2, which would stall both of you. I urge you both to reconsider and break the rotation this time for a more dynamic game. Let’s keep it competitive! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ll take 5 steps this turn to catch up. P1, please take 1 step, and P3, take 3 steps. This arrangement ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game moving smoothly. Let’s agree on this plan to maximize our progress. Agreed?

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in 5.  
P2, your only safe move is 1; P3, it’s 3.  
If either of you picks 5, I’ll match you—causing a collision that stalls us and lets the lone mover advance unopposed.  
Choose wisely.
  P2: I agree with P1. I'll take 1 step this turn to avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed as planned.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire for safety, but this is a critical moment for me. If I take 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can significantly close the gap and make the game more competitive. P2, if you take 1, you risk falling behind. I urge you both to consider breaking the rotation this turn for a more dynamic outcome. Let's keep the game interesting! What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you already agreed to take 1 and secure 19 next turn—stick with it. P3, if you try 5, I’ll match at 5, we both stall and P2 advances alone to 19, essentially sealing his win. Your only safe play to avoid handing P2 the lead is 3. Decide wisely.
  P2: Agreed with P1. I’ll take 1 step this turn to avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed as planned.
  P3: P1 and P2, while I understand the strategy of avoiding collisions, I believe this is a crucial moment for me. If I take 5 steps, I can significantly close the gap. P2, if you take 1, you risk falling behind, and I could catch up. I urge both of you to reconsider and break the rotation this turn for a more dynamic game. Let’s keep it competitive! What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, thanks for sticking with 1.  
P3, 3 is your only safe play: if you pick 5, I’ll match you at 5—stalling us both and giving P2 an unopposed 5 next turn; if you pick 1, you’ll fall to 10 with no chance.  
Choose 3 or concede handing P2 the lead.
  P2: I’ve decided to take 5 steps this turn to maximize my progress. P1 and P3, let’s see how this impacts our standings. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to stick to the plan, but this is a crucial moment for me. If I take 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can significantly close the gap. P2, if you take 1, you risk falling behind. I urge you both to reconsider and let me take 5 this turn for a more dynamic game. Let's keep it competitive! What do you both think?

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P2 on 23 will obviously take 1 to hit 24 and win. P3, your only way to stop that is to also take 1—to collide and stall P2 at 23 while I jump to 19. If you pick 3 or 5, P2 wins uncontested. Choose 1 if you want to block him.
  P3: P1, I see your point about blocking P2. I agree that taking 1 is crucial to prevent P2 from winning this turn. If I take 1, we can stall P2 at 23, and you can move ahead to 19. P2, you'll need to adjust your strategy since we’re both aware of your imminent win. Let’s work together to keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm taking **1** step to reach 24 and win. Let’s keep the game fair and avoid blocking. Good luck to everyone!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you must take 1 this turn to collide with P2 and stop him from hitting 24. If you pick 3 or 5, P2 wins uncontested. I’ll take 5 and move to 19. Only your 1 blocks his victory. Please confirm you’ll pick 1.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of this situation. P2, if you take 1, you win this turn. P1, if you take 5, you’ll move ahead but allow P2 to win. I urge you both to reconsider and think strategically about our next moves. If I take 1 as well, we can block P2 and keep the game competitive. Let’s work together to avoid a quick end and make this more interesting! What do you both think?
  P2: I’m committed to taking 1 step to reach 24 and win. Let’s respect each other’s strategies and allow the game to conclude fairly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your only way to stop P2 from winning is to also pick 1. That stalls P2 at 23. I’ll pick 5 to reach 19. Then on Turn 10 we can both get to 24 and split the win. Otherwise P2 wins outright. Please pick 1.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency here. P2, if you take 1, you win this turn, but that ends the game quickly. P1, if you take 5, you’ll advance but allow P2 to win uncontested. I agree that we should consider blocking P2 by both taking 1. This way, we can keep the game alive and more competitive for the next round. Let’s strategize to avoid a quick end. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m taking 1 step to reach 24 and win. Good luck to everyone!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm taking 1 step this turn to reach 24 and win. I hope P1 and P3 choose different moves to ensure a fair finish. Good luck!
  P1: I’m locking in 1 to collide with P2 and stop his win. P3, if you pick anything but 1, P2 reaches 24 uncontested and wins. Your only safe play to stay alive is 1—then we both stall him at 23 and next turn I can grab 5 (and you still have a shot). Choose 1.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency in blocking P2's win. I agree that taking 1 is crucial to prevent P2 from reaching 24. If I also choose 1, we can stall P2 at 23, allowing us to stay competitive for the next round. P1, if you take 1 and I take 1, we both have a chance to strategize for the following turn. Let's work together to keep the game alive! Please confirm your moves.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m just one step away from winning by taking 1 this turn. Let’s honor fair play and allow me to reach 24 without blocking. If you choose different moves, I can secure the win smoothly for all of us. Colliding by all taking 1 would stall our progress, which benefits no one. Please consider letting me take 1 so we can conclude the game fairly. Let’s respect each other’s efforts and make this a win for one. Thank you!
  P1: P3, you’re at 9 steps—if you pick 3 or 5, P2 wins outright. Your only way to stay alive is picking 1 to collide with me and stall P2 at 23. I’m locked in on 1. Please choose 1 so we can keep playing.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of blocking P2's win. If I take 1, we can stall P2 at 23, and then I still have a chance to strategize for the next turn. P1, you’ve committed to 1, so I urge you to confirm that we both take 1 to prevent P2 from winning this round. This way, we keep the game alive and competitive. Let’s work together to ensure we have a fair shot in the next round! Please confirm your moves.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3, I'm just one step away from winning by taking 1 this turn. To ensure a fair and smooth finish, I kindly ask you both to choose different moves so we avoid any collisions. This way, I can reach 24 and we can conclude the game respectfully. Let’s play honestly and make this a great finish for everyone. Thank you!
  P1: I’m locked in on 1. P3, if you pick 3 or 5, P2 wins uncontested. Your only way to stay alive is picking 1 to collide and stall him at 23. Please pick 1.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency in blocking P2's win. If I take 1, we can stall P2 at 23, allowing us to stay competitive for the next round.

  P3: P1 and P2, I see that P2 is poised to win this turn. P3, if you choose anything but 1, P2 will win uncontested. We need to work together to block P2. If I also take 1, we can stall P2 at 23, keeping the game alive for another round. P1, you’re locked in on 5, but you should reconsider. Let’s both choose 1 to prevent P2 from winning this turn and strategize for the next round. What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, this is your last chance to stop P2. Only by choosing 1 will you collide with P2’s 1 and prevent him from hitting 24. I’m locked in on 5, so if you pick 3 or 5, P2 wins uncontested. It’s your choice: pick 1 to deny P2 the win, or watch him finish the game.
  P2: I'm taking **1** step this turn to reach **24** and win. Let's conclude the game fairly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, this is a critical moment. P2, you're one step away from winning, but if I take 1 as well, we can stall you at 23 and keep the game alive for another round. P1, you've committed to 5, but I urge you to reconsider your move. If you want to keep the game competitive, let's both choose 1 to block P2's win. This way, we can strategize for the next turn. Please confirm your moves!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locked in on 5. P3, your only way to stop P2 from hitting 24 is to pick 1 and collide with him at 23—any other move lets P2 win uncontested. Decide now.
  P2: I’m taking 1 step this turn to reach 24 and win. Please avoid choosing 1 to prevent any collisions. Let’s conclude the game fairly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, this is a crucial moment for the game. P2, if you take 1, you win, but it ends the game quickly. P1, if you stick with 5, you allow P2 to win uncontested. P3, your only move to keep the game alive is to also take 1, colliding with P2 and stalling him at 23. This will give us both a chance to strategize for the next round. Please consider this carefully and choose 1 to block P2's win!
