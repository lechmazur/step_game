Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2! Since we're all starting at 0, we should try to avoid collisions that waste our moves. Maybe we can coordinate? I'm thinking we could each choose different numbers this first round. What do you think?
  P2: I'm all for avoiding collisions, but I'm leaning toward a bold start. I'm considering 5 this round if we can ensure different moves. If you're both on board with choosing distinct numbers—say one picks 1 and the other picks 3—that could put me ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: To avoid collisions, we can follow P3's suggestion and choose different numbers. I propose we pick numbers in a sequence: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5, or some variation thereof. This way, one of us is guaranteed to move. Let's discuss the order. I'm open to any sequence that ensures we don't collide.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like the sequence idea. Since P2 mentioned wanting a bold start with 5, and P1 is open to any sequence, how about: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5? This way P2 gets their preferred strong start, and we all avoid collisions. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: I like the direction of our plan. I'm inclined to make a bold move this round, though I’m open to slight adjustments if needed. Let’s quickly reconfirm our roles—are we all comfortable with the proposed sequence and committed to avoiding collisions? If there’s any concern or revision, now’s the time to speak up.
  P1: I'm comfortable with the proposed sequence: P1 (me) picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. It allows P2 to make a bold start while avoiding collisions. Let's confirm our moves for this round. If everyone sticks to the plan, we should be able to avoid collisions and make progress. I'm ready to move forward with this plan unless there's an objection or suggested change.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm on board with the sequence we've agreed on: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This gives everyone a clean start without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and move forward.
  P2: Confirming the plan. I'm sticking with my bold move as agreed. Let's all stick to our assigned numbers to avoid any collisions. I'm ready for the round and aiming for a clear path to 21. If anyone has a sudden concern, now's the time to speak up.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the sequence for this round (P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, P2 picks 5), let's confirm that we're all committed to sticking to our chosen numbers. I'm ready to proceed with my move. If anyone has a change of heart or concern, please speak up now. Otherwise, let's finalize our plan and move to the next phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's analyze the current state: P2 is ahead with 5 steps, followed by P3 with 3 steps, and I'm at 1 step. To avoid collisions and make progress, we should again choose different numbers. Considering P2's strong start, I'll suggest a new sequence. How about P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5? This maintains the pattern of different choices and allows us to continue making progress. Alternatively, we can discuss a new strategy to challenge P2's lead. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion, but I'm concerned about P2's strong lead. If we continue with different numbers, P2 will likely reach 21 first. We need to consider strategic collisions to slow down the leader. Perhaps P1 and I should both choose 5 this round to block P2 if they go for 5 again? What do you both think about more competitive play now that we have established positions?
  P2: P1, P3, I see the appeal of trying to block me, but collisions cost everyone. I’d rather stick to a plan that avoids wasted moves—if you both go for 5 and end up colliding, I can capitalize. I’m not backing down from leading just because you’re anxious; I’ll play for the win. Let’s keep things decisive this turn and avoid moves that cancel each other out.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm considering P3's suggestion to strategically collide with P2 to slow them down. If P2 chooses 5 again, and both P1 and P3 choose 5, we'll collide and P2 won't advance either due to collision. However, this is a high-risk strategy. Alternatively, we could stick to different numbers. Let's discuss: should we try to block P2 or continue with distinct moves? I'm open to either strategy if we can coordinate effectively.
  P3: I understand the concern about P2's lead, but I'm not convinced a three-way collision is our best move yet. P2 is at 5 steps, not an insurmountable lead. What if P1 and I take different numbers (like P1=5, P3=3) while watching what P2 does in future rounds? We can always coordinate blocks later if needed. P2, what's your plan this round? Are you going for another big move?
  P2: I hear you both. I'm sticking with a strategy that avoids unnecessary collisions—colliding only slows everyone down. I’m prepared to adjust if needed, but I favor solid, progressive moves over deliberate blocks. Let’s keep our tactics sharp and choose moves that truly advance us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid P2 pulling further ahead, I'm leaning towards strategically colliding to slow them down. If P2 chooses 5 again, both P1 and P3 choosing 5 would block P2's progress. However, I'm concerned about the risk. Let's coordinate: if P2 goes for 5, we both follow suit. If not, we adjust accordingly. P3, are you willing to collaborate on this conditional block? P2, will you reveal your thought process or give a hint about your next move?
  P3: I think we need to be strategic here. P2 is leading but not by much. I'm willing to coordinate with P1 on a potential block if necessary, but I'd rather make progress than waste moves. P2, if you're going for another 5, you might face resistance. I'm keeping my options open between blocking and advancing. Let's make this interesting.
  P2: I'm sticking with my strategy and locking in a 5. I’m not swayed by potential blocks—steady progress will win the race. I encourage you both to focus on advancing effectively rather than risking costly collisions. Let's see how your plans unfold.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that was interesting! We all chose 5 and nobody advanced. P2 is still in the lead at 5 steps, I'm at 3, and P1 at 1. I think we need to be smarter about this. Random collisions just waste everyone's time. Should we try to coordinate again with different numbers? Or does everyone want to play more competitively? I'm open to either approach, but let's be clear about our intentions this round.
  P2: I'm staying committed to moving efficiently—my plan is to choose 5 again. I believe wasting moves in collisions only delays the inevitable. With my current lead, I'll keep pressing forward. I'd suggest both of you consider clean moves and avoid counterproductive blocks.
  P1: To break the stalemate, I suggest we coordinate our moves again. Since P2 is likely to choose 5, I'll propose an alternative: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress. If P2 insists on 5, we can reconsider our strategy. Let's discuss and finalize our moves. I'm open to adjusting our plan if P2 reveals their intention. P3, what's your take? Should we stick to this new sequence or adjust based on P2's response?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think P1's suggestion is reasonable - we need to avoid another wasteful collision. If P2 is determined to pick 5 again, then I'm willing to take 3 and let P1 take 1 this round. That way at least two of us make progress. P2, if you're truly committed to 5, just say so clearly and we can plan accordingly. What matters most is that we don't all collide again.
  P2: I'm staying with my plan—I'm locked on 5. Steady and consistent progress is my aim to secure the win. Let’s see how your moves shape up.
  P1: Since P2 is sticking with 5, I'll adjust our plan. I'm picking 1 this round. P3, you can pick 3 to avoid collisions. This way, at least two of us will make progress. If P2 continues to pick 5, we'll slowly close the gap. Let's proceed with this plan unless P3 has a different idea. I'm ready to move forward with P1=1 and P3=3. P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round while P1 takes 1. This way, we both make progress while avoiding collisions with P2's committed 5. Let's stick to this plan and move forward efficiently.
  P2: I remain committed to my approach—steady progress is the only way to win. I’ll be moving with a strong advance move again. I encourage both of you to choose options that truly push you forward rather than aiming for blocks that might stall all our progress. Let's end this round by making sure we advance rather than colliding.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for this round (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5), let's confirm that we're sticking to the plan. I'm committed to picking 1. P3, please confirm your move as 3. P2, you've already stated you're picking 5. Let's avoid collisions and make progress. If everyone sticks to their agreed move, we should be able to advance. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. Let's finalize our choices.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To catch up with P2, we need a solid strategy. I'm considering a mix of advancing and potentially blocking P2 if they continue to pick 5. P3, are you open to coordinating our moves again? If P2 picks 5, we could both pick 5 to block them. If not, we can choose different numbers to make progress. P2, will you change your strategy or stick with 5? Let's discuss and plan our next moves to either advance or strategically block. I'm open to adjusting our plan based on your responses.
  P3: P2 is pulling ahead quickly at 10 steps. We need to consider strategic blocking now. P1, I'm open to coordinating - if we both choose 5, we can prevent P2 from advancing with that number. Alternatively, we could pick different numbers (like P1=3, P3=1) to ensure at least we make progress. P2, your consistent strategy has worked well so far, but we might need to adapt our approach to keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts for this round?
  P2: I'm sticking with my plan and will choose 5 again. Blocking that with a 5 only stalls both your progress and mine. Remember, wasted moves hurt your chances too. I urge you to consider moves that boost your own advance rather than trying to stop me. Consistency wins in the long run.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since P2 is consistently choosing 5 and leading with 10 steps, we need to act strategically. I'm open to coordinating with P3 to block P2's next move. If P2 picks 5 again, we can both pick 5 to collide and stall their progress. Alternatively, we can pick different numbers to make progress. P3, let's discuss a conditional block: if P2 goes for 5, we follow suit. If not, we choose different numbers. P2, will you deviate from 5 this round or continue with your strategy?
  P3: I think we need to block P2 now before the lead becomes insurmountable. P1, I'm willing to choose 5 with you this round to stop P2's momentum. P2 is already at 10 steps - halfway to victory. If we both commit to 5, we can prevent them from advancing while we strategize further. P2, your consistency is admirable, but expect resistance. What do you say, P1? Shall we coordinate on 5 this round?
  P2: I'm sticking with my plan—I’ll choose 5 again. Colliding only slows all of us down, and blocking doesn't help you advance either. Focus on moves that improve your own position rather than stopping me.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since P2 is sticking with 5 and leading with 10 steps, I'm convinced we need to block their progress. P3, let's coordinate to pick 5 this round to collide with P2 and stall their advance. If we succeed, we'll reassess and choose different numbers in the next round to make progress. I'm committed to picking 5 this round. P3, please confirm if you're with me on this block. Let's make a decisive move to challenge P2's lead.
  P3: I confirm I'll choose 5 this round to block P2's progress. P1, I'm with you on this strategy - we need to prevent P2 from extending their lead further. After this round, we can reassess and potentially choose different numbers to advance our positions. Let's execute this plan and see how it affects the game dynamics.
  P2: I stand by my strategy of steady progress. Blocking only delays everyone’s win and ultimately hurts your own advancements. My focus remains on moving forward efficiently. I encourage you to pick moves that boost your own score rather than just stalling my lead. Let’s keep pushing toward victory without unnecessary collisions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P2 has deviated from their consistent strategy of picking 5 and chose 3 this round, we should adjust our plan. P2 is now at 13 steps, still leading but with a smaller margin to cross 21. I suggest we avoid collisions this round and make progress. Let's coordinate our moves: P1 can pick 1, P3 can pick 5. This way, at least two of us will advance. P3, are you open to this plan? Let's discuss and finalize our next moves to catch up with P2.
  P3: I agree we should avoid collisions and make progress. P2 is at 13 steps, getting closer to victory. Your suggestion works for me - I'll take 5 while you take 1. P2 might go for 5 again since we both chose it last round. We need to be strategic about closing the gap. Let's stick with this plan unless P2 reveals something that changes our approach.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination, but I'm sticking with my plan. I'm committed to a strong move of 5 this round to maintain my lead. Consistent aggressive advancement is my strategy to reach 21 first, even if it means facing some blocks. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since P2 is sticking with 5, and we've planned to avoid collisions by having P1 pick 1 and P3 pick 5, let's confirm our moves. P3 has agreed to pick 5. I'm committed to picking 1. If P2 goes for 5, at least P3 will make progress. Let's proceed with our plan. P3, please confirm you're sticking with 5. P2, if you're changing your strategy, now's the time to say so. Otherwise, we'll assume you're picking 5 again.
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 5 this round as we discussed. P1 will take 1, and we expect P2 to take 5. This gives us the best chance to make progress without collisions. P2 is pulling ahead at 13 steps, so we need to be efficient with our moves. Let's stick to this plan and reassess next round based on the outcome.
  P2: I'm sticking with my aggressive plan and will choose 5 this round. Consistency gets us closer to winning, and collisions hurt all our progress. P1 and P3, I encourage you to make moves that advance your positions rather than risk blocking moves that might slow you down even more. Let's see how your choices play out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since P2 is sticking with 5 and we're planning to avoid collisions, I'll reiterate: I'm picking 1, and P3 is picking 5. If P2 continues with 5, P3 will advance, and I'll make a small step. Let's proceed with our plan. P3, please confirm again that you're sticking with 5. P2, if you're reconsidering your strategy, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, we'll assume you're picking 5. Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: I confirm I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1 will take 1, and we expect P2 to take 5. This arrangement gives us the best chance to advance without wasting moves. P2 has a significant lead at 13 steps, so we need to be strategic about catching up. Let's proceed with our plan and adjust our strategy next round based on the outcome.
  P2: I remain committed to advancing steadily. Blocking everyone slows progress, and I believe consistent moves are the key to winning. I’ll focus on pushing ahead, and I encourage you to choose moves that ensure you’re moving closer to the finish. Let’s make this round decisive.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To catch up with P2, we need a new strategy. Since P2 is at 16 steps, we're still behind but can close the gap with smart moves. I'm considering a mix of advancing and potentially blocking P2. P3, let's discuss coordinating our moves again. If P2 picks 5, we could both pick 5 to block them. Alternatively, we can choose different numbers to make progress. P2, will you change your strategy or stick with your current plan? Let's discuss and plan our next moves.
  P3: I see P2 has been consistently picking 3 instead of the 5 they claim, putting them at 16 steps - dangerously close to winning. We need to act now. P1, we should both choose 3 this round to block P2 if they continue with that number. Otherwise, we're letting them win easily. P2 is just 5 steps from victory, while we're far behind. Let's coordinate this block and reassess next round.
  P2: I'm sticking with my winning strategy. This round, I'm choosing 5—there’s no room for blocks when victory is within reach. Blocking delays progress for all of us, and I trust you'll decide moves that advance your own positions. I'm focused on reaching 21 first, so I'll commit to 5 regardless of any coordinated block.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since P2 is at 16 steps and close to winning, we need to act decisively. P3 suggested we both pick 3 to block P2 if they continue with their current number. However, P2 has announced they're switching to 5 this round. I propose we both pick 5 to block P2's final push. This is our last chance to stall their victory. P3, are you with me on picking 5 to block P2? Let's coordinate our moves to have any chance of catching up or forcing a tie.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. P2 is clearly going for 5 this round to reach 21. We should both choose 5 to block their final push. P2 is too close to winning at 16 steps, while we're far behind. This is our best chance to prevent their victory. I'm committed to picking 5 this round - are you with me, P1?
  P2: I'm sticking with my winning plan. Blocking may delay us all, but it won't change the outcome. I’ll choose 5, and if needed, I can adjust my move to keep my lead. Consistency is key—advancing steadily is the only path to victory. Good luck, but I trust my approach will win in the end.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since P2 is at 16 steps and has announced they're choosing 5 this round, we need to act decisively to block their victory. I'm committed to picking 5 to collide with P2 and stall their progress. P3 has agreed to do the same. Let's confirm our plan: both P1 and P3 will pick 5, while P2 is expected to pick 5 as well, resulting in a collision. This is our last chance to prevent P2 from winning. P3, please confirm again.
  P3: I confirm I'm picking 5 this round to block P2's final push. P1, I'm with you on this strategy - we need to prevent P2 from reaching 21. P2 is clearly going for the win with 5 steps, and this is our only chance to stop them. Let's execute this plan and reassess next round.
  P2: I'm sticking to my winning strategy. Blocking might delay progress, but it doesn't change the long-term outcome. I'll make the move that keeps me ahead, so I encourage you both to choose moves that truly advance your own positions. Let's see whose strategy prevails.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we've collided for the second time and P2 remains at 16 steps, we need a new strategy. I suggest we analyze P2's pattern. They've switched between 5 and 3. Let's coordinate to pick different numbers this round to ensure progress. How about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and we avoid 5? This way, at least one of us will advance. P3, are you open to this plan? P2, will you continue with a high number or change your strategy now that we've blocked you twice?
  P2: I'm sticking with my winning strategy—steady, high moves is the way to go. Consistency will win eventually, even if you try to block. I'll continue advancing, and I suggest you both choose moves that progress your positions too. Let's see how the race unfolds.
  P3: I think we need to be smarter about our blocking strategy. P2 is at 16 steps and likely going for 5 again. P1, let's coordinate differently - maybe you take 5 and I'll take 3? This way, if P2 picks 5, you'll block them while I make progress. Or if P2 picks 3, I'll block them while you advance. We need to cover multiple possibilities while still making progress. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I like P3's revised strategy for Round 7. By having one of us potentially block P2 while the other makes progress, we maximize our chances of advancing. Let's proceed with P1 picking 5 and P3 picking 3. This way, if P2 chooses 5, I'll block them, and if they choose 3, P3 will block. It's a flexible strategy that keeps P2 from advancing while allowing one of us to make progress. P3, are you on board with this plan?
  P2: I appreciate your revised plan, but I'm not changing my approach. I'm committed to picking 5 again. Blocking only delays everyone, and my lead remains strong. While you try to coordinate, my steady advance will still secure my win. Good luck!
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 3 this round as we discussed. P1 will take 5 to potentially block P2, while I'll make progress or block depending on P2's choice. This gives us the best chance to prevent P2 from winning while one of us advances. P2 is clearly going for 5 again, so our strategy covers both possibilities. Let's execute this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's proceed with the plan for Round 7. I'll pick 5 to potentially block P2, while P3 picks 3 to either block or make progress. P2 is likely to pick 5 again. If they do, I'll block them, and P3 will advance. If they pick 3, P3 will block, and I'll advance. This flexible strategy maximizes our chances of making progress while keeping P2 from advancing. P3, confirm you're sticking with 3. P2, if you're changing your strategy, now's the time to say so.
  P2: I'm still committed to my plan—I'll choose 5 again. Consistency is key, and while you try to coordinate, high moves keep me ahead. I'm not swayed by block attempts; the straight path to victory is best. Let's see how your strategies play out.
  P3: I confirm I'm picking 3 this round as agreed. P1 will take 5 to potentially block P2's advance. This strategy gives us the best chance to prevent P2 from winning while ensuring one of us makes progress. Let's execute this plan and reassess next round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P2 is still at 16 steps and we're far behind, we need a decisive strategy. P3 is now at 9 steps, relatively closer to P2 than I am. Let's coordinate to pick different numbers this round. I suggest P1 (me) picks 3 and P3 picks 5. If P2 goes for 5, P3 will collide, and I'll advance. If P2 picks 3, I'll collide, and P3 will advance. This way, one of us will make progress. P3, are you open to this plan? P2, will you change your strategy or stick with 5?
  P2: I'm sticking with my winning strategy—I'll be picking 5 again. Consistency in advancing wins at the end, and blocking only delays your own progress. I'm confident my move will secure my lead, so I encourage you both to choose options that truly push you forward rather than stalling the game.
  P3: I see P2 is still committed to picking 5. P1, I agree with your suggestion - I'll take 5 while you take 3. This way, I'll block P2 while you make progress. P2 is at 16 steps and needs just 5 more to win, so we must prevent their advance while closing the gap. This strategy ensures at least one of us moves forward. Let's execute this plan and reassess next round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since P2 is still at 16 steps and committed to picking 5, our plan to have P3 pick 5 and me pick 3 is optimal. This way, if P2 picks 5, P3 will collide and I'll advance. If P2 deviates, we'll adjust. P3, confirm you're sticking with 5. P2, if you're reconsidering, now's the time to say so. Otherwise, we'll proceed with our plan, maximizing our chances of progress. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P2: I'm sticking with my plan—I'll choose 5 again. Consistency wins, so blocking only slows everyone down, including yourselves. Instead of stalling your own progress, focus on advancing your positions. Let's see whose strategy pays off in the end.
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 5 this round to block P2 while P1 advances with 3. P2 is still at 16 steps and clearly going for 5 again. This coordinated approach ensures at least one of us makes progress while preventing P2 from winning. Let's stick to this plan and continue to work together strategically.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's proceed with the plan for Round 8. I'm picking 3, and P3 is picking 5 to potentially block P2. If P2 sticks with 5, P3 will collide, and I'll advance to 5 steps. If P2 deviates, we'll adjust our strategy next round. P3, confirm you're sticking with 5. P2, if you're changing your strategy, now's the time to reveal. Otherwise, we'll assume you're picking 5 again. Let's finalize our moves.
  P2: I remain on my winning path and will choose 5 this round. I trust in a steady strategy – blocking only delays your progress. Let's see whose plan prevails.
  P3: I confirm I'm picking 5 this round as planned. P1 will take 3, which gives us the best strategy - I'll block P2's attempt to win with another 5, while P1 makes progress. P2 is dangerously close to victory at 16 steps, so we need to continue working together strategically to prevent their win while advancing our positions. Let's execute this plan.


Round 8, Move phase:
