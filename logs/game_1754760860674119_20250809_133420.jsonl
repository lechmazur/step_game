My only debate is crawl-to-20 with 1 or gamble-for-22 with 3. If you both stack 3, you just drag me to 20 and face sudden-death again next turn; if you split 1 & 3, you have a coin-flip block and at least one of you moves. Your choice, but 5 is safely yours\u2014 I\u2019m not going near it. Decide wisely."}
