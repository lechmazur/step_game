Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Hey, let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about we take turns advancing 1 step each, starting with me this round?"
  P2: Okay, I'm game for coordination, but I think we should all move 3 this round if we can to get a good start.
  P3: I prefer P1's suggestion of taking turns. If we all move 3, we'll just collide and no one advances. Let's have P1 move first with 1, then P2 next round, then me after that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your willingness to coordinate, P2 and P3. However, I agree with P3 that moving 3 steps each this round would result in a collision and no progress. Let's stick to the original plan of taking turns advancing 1 step each, starting with me this round. This way, we can ensure that at least one of us makes progress each round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to follow this plan and move 1 step next round?
  P2: I still think moving 3 is best this round. If P1 moves 1, I'll move 3 and P3 can move 1 next round.
  P3: I don't trust P2's intentions. Let's stick with P1's original plan - P1 moves 1 this round, P2 next round, and me after that. Moving 3 now will just create chaos.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Looks like P2 and P3 collided last round. Let's try to stick to the original plan. I'll move 1 again this round. P2, are you willing to move 1 next round as planned?"
  P2: I'm still aiming for 3 this round.
  P3: I see P2 is still being uncooperative. P1, I'll let you move 1 this round and stay out of your way. We can deal with P2's disruption strategy later.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate P3's willingness to cooperate. P2, I understand you want to move 3, but it's clear that won't work with P3 moving 1 next round. Why not try to coordinate with us and move 1 next round as planned? We can all make progress together.
  P2: I'm going to move 5 this round. P1 and P3 should move 1 if they want to advance.
  P3: P2 is clearly trying to disrupt any cooperation. P1, I'll stay out of your way with a different number this round since you're already ahead by 1 step.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "I appreciate P3's willingness to cooperate. P2, I understand you want to move 3, but it's clear that won't work with P3 moving 1 next round. Why not try to coordinate with us and move 1 next round as planned? We can all make progress together."
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm moving 5 this round. You should both move 1 if you want to advance.
  P3: Since P2 claims they'll move 5, I'll avoid that number. P1, go ahead with your 1 as planned - I'll choose differently to avoid collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate P3's willingness to cooperate. P2, I understand you want to move 5, but it's clear that won't work with P3 moving a different number this round. Why not try to coordinate with us and move 1 next round as planned? We can all make progress together. If you're still not willing to cooperate, I'll stick to my original plan and move 1 this round. P3, thanks for staying out of my way - I'll keep my move as 1 for now.
  P2: I'm moving 5 this round. P1 and P3 should move 1 if they want to advance.
  P3: Since P2 insists on moving 5, and P1 will likely move 1, I'll choose 3 this round to avoid collisions with either of them.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm going to move 5 again this round. You should move 1 or 3 if you want to advance.
  P3: Since P2 is leading and being aggressive with 5s, I suggest we coordinate P1 - you take 1 and I'll take 3 again to catch up. We can't let P2 run away with this.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. I'll move 1 this round, and P3 can move 3. This way, we can both make progress and try to catch up with P2. P2, are you willing to reconsider your aggressive strategy and try to coordinate with us?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm still moving 5 this round. P1 and P3, choose 1 or 3 if you want to advance.
  P3: I'll stick with my plan - I'll move 3 while P1 moves 1. We need to work together to catch up to P2.
  P1: I think we should stick to the plan, P3. You take 3 and I'll take 1. Let's see if P2 actually follows through with their threat to move 5 again. If they do, we can reassess our strategy for the next round.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 is way ahead at 10 steps, we need to catch up fast. P1, I suggest you move 5 this round while I move 3 - this way we both advance and have a chance to catch P2.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm moving 5 again this round. If you want to advance, choose 1 or 3.
