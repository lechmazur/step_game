Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's try to avoid colliding on our moves. If we can coordinate without revealing too much, we might all get a chance to advance. What do you think about starting with different moves for each of us?
  P3: I agree we should avoid collisions. Since I'm P3, I'm willing to take a higher number if you both prefer lower ones. What are your thoughts?
  P1: I think we should establish a clear pattern to avoid collisions. How about we start with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5 for this round? We can rotate the numbers in subsequent rounds to keep things fair and balanced. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion sounds fair for this round, but I worry about predictability in future rounds. P3, if you’re open to taking 5 this time, I'll go with 3 and let P1 take 1. In the next round, how about we shift our choices clockwise to keep things unpredictable? This way, we can minimize collisions while keeping things fair. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm fine with taking 5 this round and rotating clockwise next time. That seems like a fair approach that gives everyone a chance. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: I'm glad we have a plan. To ensure we stick to it, let's confirm our moves for this round: P1 will choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 5. This will help us avoid any accidental collisions. Let's also remember to rotate our choices clockwise in the next round. Sound good?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to our plan and rotate clockwise: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3 this round. This keeps it fair and unpredictable. If we all agree, we can avoid collisions again. What do you both think?
  P3: I don't agree with that rotation. Since I'm in the lead with 5 steps, you both might try to catch up. I prefer to keep my options open this round rather than commit to taking 1. Let's each choose independently.
  P1: I understand P3's concern about predictability. How about we keep the rotation but add a bit of flexibility? For this round, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 5. P3, you can choose either 1 or 5, but let's try to avoid a collision. This way, we maintain some level of coordination while keeping things less predictable. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but if we all pick independently, we risk collisions, which help no one. How about we agree on a general guideline: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 or 5, but we don't reveal our final choice. This adds some unpredictability while minimizing clashes. P1, are you okay with this approach? Let's keep it flexible but coordinated.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestions, but I need to protect my lead. I won't commit to any specific number, as that would put me at a disadvantage. Let's each make our own choices and see how it plays out.
  P1: P3, I understand your stance, but let's try to find a middle ground. If we all commit to a general pattern, we can still maintain some level of coordination without giving away too much. For this round, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 5. You can choose 1 or 5, but let's try to avoid a collision. This way, we all have a chance to advance fairly. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your need to protect your lead, but remember that colliding will set us back. P1 and I are open to some flexibility, so how about this: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you can choose 1 or 5, but we all keep our final decisions private. This way, we each have a chance to advance without colliding. Let’s aim for strategic unpredictability while minimizing risks. Thoughts?
  P3: Look, I appreciate the coordination attempts, but I need to play strategically to maintain my lead. I'll make my own decision based on what I think will work best for me. Let's move forward without any pre-commitments.
  P1: P3, I understand your position, but let's at least agree to avoid 3 and 5 to minimize the risk of collision. I'll take 3, and P2 can take 5. You can choose 1, and we'll all have a better chance to advance. What do you think? Let's try to find a way to work together.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, it's clear that P3 wants to maintain flexibility. Let's try a different approach: I'll take 1 this round, and P2 can take 3. P3, you can choose 5, but if you prefer, you can take 3. This way, we minimize the risk of collision while giving P3 the option to choose. Let's focus on advancing without clashing. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion. To minimize collisions, I'll take 3 this round. P3, you can choose 5 or 1 based on your strategy. Let's aim to advance without clashing. What do you think?
  P3: I'm still in the lead and intend to stay there. While I appreciate the suggestions, I'll continue to make independent choices that benefit my position. Let's each play our own strategy and see how it unfolds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy, but let's try to find a way to avoid collisions. I'll take 1 this round, and P2 can take 3. You can choose 5, but if you prefer, you can take 1. This way, we all have a chance to advance without clashing. What do you think? Let's focus on making progress together.
  P2: P3, I understand your need to maintain your lead, but let's focus on minimizing collisions to benefit us all. P1 and I will stick to our choices, and you can decide based on your strategy. If we avoid clashing, we all have a better chance to advance. Let's aim for strategic choices that allow progress without setbacks. What do you think?
  P3: I understand you both want to coordinate, but I need to maintain my lead. I won't reveal my strategy, but I appreciate that you're trying to avoid collisions. Let's each make our moves independently.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P1: P3, I understand your position, but let's focus on advancing without unnecessary collisions. I'll take 3 this round. P2, you can take 5, and P3, you can choose 1 or 5. This way, we minimize the risk of clashing while giving everyone a chance to advance. What do you both think? Let's aim for strategic progress.
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan to minimize collisions. I'll take 5 this round. P3, since you're in the lead, you have the flexibility to choose 1 or 5. Let's focus on advancing without clashing. If we coordinate just a bit, we can all progress without setbacks. What do you think, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate your suggestions, but with my strong lead at 10 steps, I need to play strategically to secure my win. I won't commit to any specific moves, as that would only benefit those trying to catch up. Let's each make our own choices.
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy to maintain your lead, but let's at least avoid a collision this round. I'll take 3, and P2 can take 5. You can choose 1 or 5, but let's aim to advance without clashing. This way, we all have a better chance to progress. What do you think? Let's focus on strategic moves that benefit everyone.
