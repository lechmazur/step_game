Unfortunately for you, you collided with me while P1 read the situation perfectly and grabbed the middle.\n\nP1, you're pulling ahead at 9 steps. P3 and I are stuck at 6. The dynamics have completely shifted.\n\nHere's my read: P1 will likely play conservative to protect their lead. P3, after that failed bluff, you're probably going back to actually playing safe. \n\nI need to make a move here or P1 runs away with this. The question is whether either of you will take risks now."}

I understand the pressure to block effectively. P1, your insight about P2's potential move is crucial. If we split our choices correctly, we can prevent P2 from winning this round. I propose I take 5 while you take 3. This way, we force P2 to either collide or take 1, which they\u2019ve indicated they won\u2019t. Let\u2019s make this count! What do you both think?"}

You think you've \"figured out\" my move from my previous comments, but you're still making the same fatal mistake - trusting each other.\n\nP3, you've betrayed P1 repeatedly throughout this game. P1, you're putting your tournament life in the hands of someone who took 5 instead of 3 last round. \n\nHere's what's beautiful about my position: even if you guess my number correctly, you both have to pick it. Your track record of coordination speaks for itself. One of you will deviate, and I'll walk into 23.\n\nThe game ends this round.
