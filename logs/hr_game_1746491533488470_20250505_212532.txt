Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this turn—1, 3, or 5—so everyone advances. Avoiding collisions benefits us all early on. Who wants to claim which? I can take 3 if that helps coordinate.
  P3: I'm fine with that approach. I'll take 5 for this round. That way we all get to advance without collisions. It makes sense to coordinate early on to ensure everyone gets some steps forward.
  P1: Okay, that makes sense. A 1, 3, 5 split for the first round ensures we all get started. I'll take 1 then. Let's aim for that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid giving anyone a prolonged advantage, let's rotate numbers this round. P3 had 5 last time; this round, I'll take 5, P1 can take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all cycle through higher steps equally and keep advancing without collisions. Agreed?
  P3: Actually, I'm not sure we need to rotate every round. The game is about reaching 24 steps first, so we should all have equal opportunity. I'd prefer to stick with my 5 for this first round since we already agreed. But I'm open to discussing rotation for future rounds to keep things fair. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, I understand P2's point about rotation, but I agree with P3 that sticking to our initial plan for this first round makes sense to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 split as we first discussed: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 for this round. We can discuss rotation for future turns.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, let's proceed with 1, 3, 5 this round. To ensure ongoing fairness, I propose rotating numbers next turn: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, everyone cycles through higher steps equally over time. We can reassess after each round. Sound reasonable?
  P3: I agree with the current plan for round 1 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). For round 2, I'm open to rotation, but I don't think we need to commit to a specific pattern yet. Let's complete this first round successfully, then discuss the next round based on our positions. We can be flexible with our strategy as the game progresses.
  P1: Okay, confirming P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5 for this round. Let's focus on making sure this works first. We can definitely discuss rotation or other strategies for future rounds after this one.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P3: I agree with the plan for round 1. Let's stick with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 as we've all confirmed. This gives us all a clean start without collisions.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We all agree on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. Let's make our moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. P3 is currently leading. Last round, P2 suggested rotating numbers for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This rotation seems like a good way to continue coordinating and avoid collisions, while also helping to balance the steps. It allows everyone to advance.

What do you both think about proceeding with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round?
  P3: I'm open to the rotation idea, but I'm already ahead with 5 steps. Taking 1 this round would slow my progress significantly. Since we're trying to win, not just avoid collisions, I'd prefer taking 3 or 5 again. Maybe we could consider a different rotation that doesn't disadvantage the current leader so dramatically? What are your thoughts on a more balanced approach?
  P2: To balance progress and fairness: P3, taking 3 instead of 1 allows you to keep advancing while letting others catch up slightly. I'll take 5 this round (rotating from my prior 3), P1 takes 1 again. This avoids collisions and maintains cooperation. If you insist on 5, we risk both choosing it and losing progress. Compromise now to prevent adversarial moves later. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. P2's proposal of P1 taking 1 again isn't good for me; I need to gain more steps to keep up.

P3, I understand you don't want to take 1. P2, you're aiming for 5.

How about this: I take 3 this round. P2, you take 5 as you suggested. P3, could you take 1 to complete the set? This gets me 3 steps and avoids collisions.

What do you think?
  P3: I understand everyone's position, but I'm reluctant to take just 1 step when I have a lead to maintain. How about this compromise: I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5 (giving you a good boost), and P2 takes 1 (you'd still be at a solid 4 steps total). This way we all advance without collisions, and it helps balance the game while respecting my current lead position. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: **P2's Final Proposal:** Let's avoid stalemate. Compromise: P3 takes 3 (to 8), I take 5 (to 8), P1 takes 1 (to 2). This eliminates collision risk and keeps P3 and me tied, allowing fair competition. P1 can catch up next round. Agreed? If not, we risk mutual 5-picks and stagnation. Let’s secure progress now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, taking 1 step puts me too far behind. That proposal doesn't work for me.

P3's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) gives me a much-needed boost while still letting P3 maintain a lead and P2 stay close. This seems like a more balanced way to ensure we all advance without collisions this round.

Can we agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3?
  P3: I think P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is fair and I'm willing to accept it. This lets P1 catch up a bit while I still maintain a lead at 8 steps total. P2 would be at 4 steps, which keeps everyone competitive. This avoids collisions and keeps the game moving forward. Let's go with this plan for round 2.
  P2: Agreed to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. Next round, let's rotate: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This maintains balanced progress and prevents future collisions. Let's solidify this rotation pattern.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, great. It sounds like we all agree on the plan for Round 2: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions this round.

Let's proceed with these moves.
  P3: I agree with the plan for Round 2: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This gives everyone forward progress without collisions. After this round, we can discuss the next rotation based on our new positions. Let's stick with this plan and move forward.
  P2: Agreed. Round 2 moves: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Next round, let's rotate as I suggested: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps progress balanced. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Following our prior agreement, Round 3 rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. This maintains balanced progress and avoids collisions. Let's honor the pattern we established to keep advancing efficiently. Agreed?
  P3: I don't recall agreeing to that specific rotation for Round 3. Since I'm currently in the lead at 8 steps, taking just 1 step would significantly slow my progress. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This maintains our no-collision approach while allowing me to leverage my current advantage. We're all playing to win, after all.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3 both want 5 steps, which will cause a collision. We need to avoid that. P3, I understand you don't want to take 1. I also need more than 1 step to catch up from my current position.

How about we repeat the successful plan from last round? P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This advanced everyone without collision and helps me gain ground while P3 maintains a lead.

What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2's Proposal:** Let's avoid mutual loss. P3, if we both pick 5, neither advances. Instead: P3=3 (11 total), I take 5 (9), P1=1 (7). You maintain a lead, all progress without collision. If you insist on 5, I'll have to pick 5 too, risking both our gains. Let's secure steps rationally.
  P3: I understand everyone's position. P2, your proposal (P3=3, P2=5, P1=1) keeps me in the lead while everyone advances. I can accept taking 3 steps this round instead of 5. This avoids collisions and maintains my advantage at 11 steps total, while letting you close the gap slightly. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits everyone. Shall we agree on P3=3, P2=5, P1=1 for this round?
  P1: P3, I saw you accepted P2's proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). However, taking only 1 step puts me too far behind the others. I cannot agree to that plan.

Last round, we successfully used the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This allowed everyone to advance without collisions and helped me gain ground. This seems like a much fairer approach for this round.

Can we go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 again? It avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2's Final Offer:** P3, if you take 5, I’ll have to mirror to block you (both lose). Take 3 (11 total), I’ll take 5 (9), P1 takes 1 (7). You keep a safe lead, we all progress. Next round, you can claim 5 again. Stubbornness risks mutual loss. Let’s secure steps rationally.
  P3: I understand everyone's position. P1 wants 5 again, P2 wants 5, and I want to maintain my lead. Since we need to avoid collisions, I propose a compromise: I'll take 3 (to 11), P1 takes 5 (to 11), and P2 takes 1 (to 5). This keeps P1 and me tied for the lead while everyone advances. This seems fairer than the previous proposals and prevents anyone from falling too far behind. Does this work for both of you?
  P1: Okay, P3, I agree with your latest proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This plan allows everyone to advance without collisions and helps me gain steps, while you maintain a good position.

P2, this seems like the best way forward this round. It avoids a collision between P1 and P2, who both want 5 steps. Let's confirm this plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I will move 5 based on this agreement.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2's Final Statement:** P1, if you take 5, I’ll have to mirror to block (both lose). P3 gains uncontested. Let’s avoid that. Agree to **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1**—balanced steps (all reach 9). This keeps competition fair. Refusal risks mutual loss. Decide now.
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. Since I'm leading at 8 steps, I'll compromise to avoid collisions: I'll take 3 (to 11), P1 takes 3 (to 9), and P2 takes 5 (to 9). This keeps everyone advancing while maintaining my small lead. If P1 and P2 both insist on 5, you'll both get zero steps while I advance with whatever I choose. Let's be strategic rather than stubborn.
  P1: Okay, I see the situation. To avoid a collision and ensure we all advance this round, I will agree to the latest proposal.

I will take 3 steps this round. P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and moves the game forward for everyone.

Let's confirm: P1=3, P2=5, P3=3 for this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 4. P2 is leading, P3 is second, and I'm trailing. Last round's collision didn't help P1 or P3.

To ensure we all advance this round without collisions, I propose we aim for:
P1 takes 5 (to 11)
P2 takes 1 (to 10)
P3 takes 3 (to 11)

This helps me catch up, keeps P3 competitive, and P2 stays close. It avoids collisions and moves the game forward for everyone. What do you both think?
  P2: To prevent mutual losses, I propose: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This avoids collisions and keeps everyone advancing. If you both pick 5 or 3, we all lose steps. Let's secure rational progress. Agreed?
  P3: I understand both proposals, but I need to keep pace with P2 who's leading. I propose: P1=5 (to 11), P2=1 (to 10), P3=5 (to 13). This keeps me competitive while helping P1 catch up. P2, you'd still be close and avoid falling behind. If we don't coordinate, we risk multiple collisions where nobody advances. This plan ensures everyone makes progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal has P1 and P3 both taking 5 steps, which will cause a collision and neither of us will advance. That's not good for either of us.

My initial proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) avoids any collisions. It allows me to catch up, P3 stays competitive, and P2 doesn't fall far behind.

Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to ensure we all get steps this round.
  P2: **P2's Proposal:** To avoid mutual loss: P1 takes 3 (to 9), I take 5 (to 14), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This secures progress for all. If P1 insists on 5, I'll mirror, causing both to lose. P3 gains uncontested. Rational choice: agree to this split. Let’s advance strategically.
  P3: I see we're approaching the game strategically. Since P2 is leading and both P1 and I are close behind, I propose: P1=5 (to 11), P2=3 (to 12), P3=1 (to 9). This keeps P2 in the lead but narrows the gap, helps P1 catch up significantly, and I make a small sacrifice this round. This avoids collisions and ensures everyone advances. A balanced approach seems better than risking standoffs where nobody gains steps.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's latest proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the best option so far. It avoids collisions, allows everyone to advance, and helps me catch up without P2 falling too far behind.

P2, your threat to mirror my 5 means we both get 0 steps, letting P3 potentially advance alone. Taking 3 steps in P3's plan is better for you than getting 0.

Let's agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to ensure we all make progress this round.
  P2: **P2's Final Offer:** Accepting P3’s proposal: P1=5 (11), P2=3 (12), P3=1 (9). This avoids collisions, keeps me leading, and allows all progress. Let’s lock this in to prevent mutual losses. Next round, we can rotate again. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with the current proposal: P1=5 (to 11), P2=3 (to 12), P3=1 (to 9). While taking just 1 step isn't ideal for me, it ensures we all advance without collisions. P2 maintains a slight lead, P1 catches up, and I stay competitive. This balanced approach is better than risking standoffs where nobody gains steps. Let's proceed with this plan for round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and ensures we all advance this round. Let's make our moves based on this agreement.
  P2: **P2's Final Confirmation:** Agreed—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Next round, let's rotate: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 to maintain balance. This keeps the game progressing fairly. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions.
  P3: I confirm agreement with the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. While taking just 1 step isn't ideal, it ensures we all advance without collisions. I'm willing to make this small sacrifice to keep the game moving forward smoothly. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice P2 is leading with 12 steps, P1 close behind at 11, and I'm at 9. Since we're approaching the end (24 steps), I need to make bigger moves. I propose: P1=1 (to 12), P2=1 (to 13), P3=5 (to 14). This puts me slightly ahead while keeping everyone advancing without collisions. This benefits us all - especially me who needs to catch up. What do you think?
  P1: P3, taking only 1 step puts me too far behind the leaders. Your proposal doesn't work for me. I need to gain more steps to stay competitive this round.

To ensure we all advance without collisions, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This helps me catch up, P2 stays close, and P3 gets a needed boost from their current position.

What do you both think about this plan?
  P2: **P2's Proposal:** To avoid mutual loss: P2=5 (17), P1=3 (14), P3=1 (10). If you take 5, I'll mirror (both lose). Secure steps: this split lets all advance. I must take 5 to maintain lead. Agreed? Refusal risks stagnation. Let's progress strategically.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand everyone wants to maximize their steps. Since I'm behind at 9 steps, I need more than 1 step this round. P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) gives me a decent boost while P2's proposal (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) leaves me falling further behind.

I counter-propose: P1=3 (to 14), P2=1 (to 13), P3=5 (to 14). This ties me with P1 at the front while keeping P2 competitive. This seems like the fairest distribution that avoids collisions.
  P1: Okay, P3, your latest proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) avoids collisions and helps me catch up, tying me with you while P2 stays close. This is much better for me than P2's proposal.

While my earlier proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) was ideal for me, I can agree to P3's plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) to ensure we all advance this round without collisions.

P2, this plan gets everyone steps. Can we agree on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5?
  P2: **P2's Final Offer:** Agree to **P2=5, P1=3, P3=1**—secures progress for all. If you both pick 5 or 3, we all lose steps. I'll mirror if you deviate, risking mutual loss. Rational choice: let’s lock this split and advance strategically.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see that we're at an impasse. P2 is threatening to mirror moves, while I need more than 1 step to stay competitive. Since I'm furthest behind, I need 5 steps this round.

I propose: P1=3 (to 14), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 14). This keeps P2 in the lead but gives me a chance to catch up. If we can't agree, we risk multiple collisions where nobody advances.

Let's be strategic rather than confrontational. This plan ensures everyone makes progress.
  P1: P3, your last proposal (P1=3, P2=3, P3=5) would cause a collision on 3 steps between P1 and P2. That won't work, as neither of us would advance. We need a collision-free plan.

I still need more than 1 or 3 steps to catch up. Can we revisit P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 or P1=5, P2=3, P3=1? Both avoid collisions and help me advance significantly this round. Let's agree on a plan that actually allows everyone to move forward.
  P2: **P2's Final Compromise:** Let’s secure progress. Agree to **P2=5, P1=3, P3=1**—all advance (P2=17, P1=14, P3=10). If you deviate to 5, I’ll mirror and we both lose. Rational choice: avoid mutual destruction. Confirm now or risk stagnation. This keeps the game competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand everyone's position. Since I'm behind at 9 steps, taking 1 step keeps me too far back. P2's proposal benefits only P2. 

I propose: P1=1 (to 12), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 14). This avoids collisions, keeps P2 in lead, and gives me a fighting chance. If we can't agree, we risk everyone getting zero steps.

Let's be practical - this plan ensures everyone advances while maintaining competitive balance.
  P1: We're stuck with proposals that don't work for everyone or risk collisions. Last round, P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 worked perfectly - everyone advanced.

This is the best way to ensure we all get steps this round without colliding. It helps me catch up, P2 gets 3, P3 gets 1. Let's repeat that successful plan. I will move 5.
  P2: **P2's Final Ultimatum:** If you both take 5, I’ll mirror—mutual loss. Rational split: P1=3 (14), P2=5 (17), P3=1 (10). This avoids collisions, lets all advance, and keeps me leading. Refusal risks stagnation. Confirm now or face mutual destruction.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 6. P1=14, P2=12, P3=9. I am leading.

To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I propose:
P1 takes 5 (to 19)
P2 takes 3 (to 15)
P3 takes 1 (to 10)

This advances me towards the win, P2 stays competitive, P3 gets steps. Avoids collision. What do you say?
  P2: **P2's Proposal:** P1, taking 5 risks collision if I mirror (both lose). Let's split: P1=3 (17), P2=5 (17), P3=1 (10). All advance, game stays competitive. Next round, we can coordinate final pushes. Rational choice to avoid mutual loss. Agreed?
  P3: I'm at a significant disadvantage with only 9 steps. I need more than 1 step to stay competitive. I propose: P1=1 (to 15), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 14). This keeps the game balanced while giving me a chance to catch up. Last round's collision with P2 hurt us both while P1 advanced. Let's avoid another collision and ensure everyone makes progress this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, taking only 1 step puts me too far behind. P2, your threat to mirror my 5 risks both of us getting 0 steps, which helps no one.

My proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the only one so far that allows me to advance significantly without causing a collision *if* everyone sticks to it. It gets me closer to winning, gives P2 3 steps, and P3 1 step. Getting steps is better than getting zero.

Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to ensure we all advance this round?
  P2: **P2's Rational Plan:** P1, if you take 5, I'll mirror—both lose, P3 gains. Take 3 (17), I take 5 (17), P3=1 (10). We tie, stay competitive. Avoid mutual destruction. Secure steps now, strategize next round. Agreed?
  P3: I'm significantly behind and need more than 1 step to remain competitive. Both P1 and P2 want high numbers, risking collisions. I propose: P1=3 (to 17), P2=1 (to 13), P3=5 (to 14). This narrows the gap while avoiding collisions. P1 still maintains the lead, P2 stays in the game, and I get a chance to catch up. This balanced approach ensures everyone advances rather than risking standoffs where nobody gains steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I see the different proposals and the risk of collision, especially if P1 or P2 takes 5. Getting 0 steps helps no one.

P3's latest proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) avoids collisions and allows everyone to advance: P1 to 17, P2 to 13, P3 to 14. This puts me in the lead, P3 catches up, and P2 stays in the game.

This plan guarantees progress for all this round. Let's agree on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to avoid any collisions and move forward. What do you say?
  P2: **P2's Final Offer:** Let's secure progress: P1=3 (17), P2=5 (17), P3=1 (10). This avoids collisions, keeps us tied, and allows P3 to advance. If you take 5, I'll mirror—mutual loss. Rational choice: agree now to avoid stagnation. Next round, we strategize the final push.
  P3: I see we're at another impasse. Since I'm furthest behind at 9 steps, I absolutely need 5 steps this round to remain competitive. I propose: P1=1 (to 15), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 14). This keeps everyone close while giving me a chance to catch up. If P1 and P2 both insist on high numbers, we risk multiple collisions where nobody advances. Let's be practical and ensure everyone makes progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, we must avoid collisions this round to ensure we all advance. P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts me at 17 steps, tied for the lead, and avoids collision if P3 takes 1.

This is the most reasonable path forward that benefits me while preventing mutual loss. I will move 3 this round based on this plan. Let's all make our moves to avoid getting zero steps.
  P2: **P2's Final Call:** Let's lock in **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1** to avoid mutual destruction. If you deviate, we all lose steps. This secures progress: P1=17, me=17, P3=10. Next round, we strategize the final sprint. Confirm now or risk stagnation. Rational choice prevails.
  P3: I'm at a significant disadvantage with only 9 steps. I need 5 steps to stay competitive. P1 has agreed to take 3, but P2 wants 5 which I also need. If P2 and I both take 5, we both get zero steps. 

I propose: P1=3 (to 17), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 14). This keeps everyone advancing without collisions. P1 maintains lead, P2 stays competitive, and I get a chance to catch up. Let's avoid mutual destruction.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 7. I'm currently leading at 17 steps and aiming for the win.

To ensure we all advance this round without collisions, which hurt P2 and P3 last time, I propose:
P1 takes 5 (to 22)
P2 takes 3 (to 15)
P3 takes 1 (to 10)

This plan gets me close to 24, gives P2 and P3 progress, and avoids anyone getting 0 steps. Let's make sure everyone moves forward. Agreed?
  P2: **P2's Proposal:** P1, taking 5 risks collision. Let's split: P1=3 (20), P2=5 (17), P3=1 (10). All advance. If you take 5, I'll mirror and we both lose. Rational choice: agree to avoid mutual loss.
  P3: I'm significantly behind at only 9 steps. I need 5 steps this round to remain competitive. P1 is close to winning, and both P1 and P2 want high numbers. 

I propose: P1=1 (to 18), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 14). This gives me a fighting chance while avoiding collisions. P1 still leads, P2 advances, and I get to catch up somewhat. If we can't agree on a collision-free plan, we risk another round where some players get zero steps.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, mirroring my 5 means zero steps for both of us, letting P3 advance. P3, your plan has me taking 1 step, which isn't enough to catch up.

My proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the only one that guarantees *everyone* gets steps this round without collision. I get 5, P2 gets 3, P3 gets 1. Getting some steps is better than getting zero from a collision.

Let's agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to ensure progress for all.
  P2: **P2's Proposal:** Let's avoid mutual loss. Agree to **P1=3 (20), P2=5 (17), P3=1 (10)**. If you take 5, I’ll mirror and we both lose. Rational choice: secure progress now. Next round, final sprint. Confirm to prevent stagnation.
  P3: I'm at a severe disadvantage with only 9 steps. I need 5 steps this round to have any chance. P1 is close to winning, so I propose: P1=1 (to 18), P2=3 (to 15), P3=5 (to 14). This keeps me in the game while avoiding collisions. P1 still leads comfortably, P2 advances, and I get to catch up somewhat. Last round's collision between P2 and me hurt us both while P1 advanced. Let's be strategic and ensure everyone makes progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, we have different ideas, but the most important thing is to avoid another collision like last round, which hurt P2 and P3.

P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) ensures everyone gets steps this round without colliding. I would reach 20, P2 17, and P3 10. This keeps me in the lead and in a good position to win next round, while everyone advances.

This seems like the most practical way to guarantee progress for all. Let's agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to avoid getting zero steps.
  P2: **P2's Final Proposal:** Agree to **P1=3 (20), P2=5 (17), P3=1 (10)**. If you take 5, I’ll mirror—both lose. Secure steps now. Next round, final sprint. Refusal risks mutual destruction. Confirm to avoid stagnation. Rational choice: accept this split.
  P3: I understand everyone's position, but I'm at a severe disadvantage with only 9 steps. Taking just 1 step keeps me out of contention. 

I propose: P1=3 (to 20), P2=1 (to 13), P3=5 (to 14). This keeps P1 in a strong position to win next round while giving me a fighting chance to at least compete. P2 still advances without collision.

If we can't agree on a plan that gives me more than 1 step, I'll have to take 5 and risk collision with P2, which helps neither of us.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, we need to avoid collisions this round to ensure we all advance. Taking 3 steps gets me to 20, putting me in a strong position for next round without risking a collision on 5.

Now, P2 and P3, you both want high numbers. To avoid colliding with each other, one of you must take 5 and the other must take 1.

So, the plan is: P1 takes 3. P2 and P3, decide who takes 5 and who takes 1. This guarantees progress for everyone. Let's confirm this split.
  P2: **P2's Final Plan:** Agree to **P1=3 (20), P2=5 (17), P3=1 (10)**. If P1 deviates to 5, I’ll mirror—both lose, letting P3 advance. Rational choice: secure steps now. P3, 1 step > 0. Confirm to avoid mutual destruction. Next round: final sprint.
  P3: I understand everyone's position. Since I'm at only 9 steps, I must take 5 to have any chance. P1 has agreed to take 3, which is reasonable.

P2, if we both take 5, we both get zero steps. I propose: P1=3 (to 20), P2=1 (to 13), P3=5 (to 14). This keeps P1 in position to win next round while giving me a fighting chance.

If you insist on 5, we'll both get nothing while P1 advances. Taking 1 step is better than zero. Let's be practical.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we're approaching the endgame. P1 is at 20 steps and needs just 4 more to win. I'm significantly behind at 9 steps due to multiple collisions with P2. 

I propose: P1=3 (to 23), P2=5 (to 17), P3=1 (to 10). This keeps P1 just short of winning this round while allowing P2 and me to advance without collision. P1 will likely win next round regardless, but this way we all make progress this turn.

Let's avoid another collision and ensure everyone advances.
  P2: **P2's Proposal:** P1, taking 5 risks collision if I mirror (both lose). Agree to **P1=3 (23), P2=5 (17), P3=1 (10)**. This secures your lead and avoids mutual destruction. Next round, final sprint. Refusal risks stagnation. Let's progress rationally.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I see you both propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This plan avoids collisions and ensures everyone advances this round. It puts me at 23 steps, just one step away from winning next round.

This is a safe path forward that guarantees progress for all. I agree to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. Let's make our moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the current proposal: P1=3 (to 23), P2=5 (to 17), P3=1 (to 10). While I'm far behind due to multiple collisions, taking 1 step is better than risking another collision. P1 will likely win next round regardless, but this way we all make progress this turn. Let's stick with this plan to ensure everyone advances without collision.
  P2: **P2's Final Agreement:** Accepting the plan: P1=3 (23), P2=5 (17), P3=1 (10). This secures progress and avoids mutual loss. Next round, let's coordinate final moves to ensure fair competition. Let's honor this agreement to keep the game moving.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan for Round 8: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This plan avoids collisions and ensures everyone advances. I will move 3 steps. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan: P1=3 (to 23), P2=5 (to 17), P3=1 (to 10). While I'm far behind due to collisions with P2, taking 1 step is better than risking another zero-progress round. P1 will likely win next round, but this ensures we all advance this turn. Let's stick with this collision-free approach.
  P2: **P2's Final Confirmation:** Agreed—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round. Next round, let's coordinate a fair final sprint. Honoring our plan now ensures trust and mutual progress. Let's avoid last-minute deviations that risk collisions. Proceed as agreed.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan for Round 8: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This avoids collisions and ensures everyone advances. I will move 3 steps. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: **P2's Final Confirmation:** Agreed—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round. Next round, let's coordinate a fair final sprint. Honoring our plan now ensures trust and mutual progress. Let's avoid last-minute deviations that risk collisions. Proceed as agreed.
  P1: Okay, we all agreed on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions. I will stick to this plan and move 3. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2's Final Strategy:** P1, if you pick 1, I'll mirror to block. P3, joining me ensures P1 doesn't win. Let's all pick 1 to force a collision. If P1 deviates, they win. Rational choice: secure collision now. Agreed?
  P3: I'm far behind at 10 steps with P1 at 23 (just 1 step from winning). P2's proposal to all pick 1 doesn't help me - I need to maximize my steps. I propose: P1=1 (wins at 24), P2=3 (to 20), P3=5 (to 15). P1 will win regardless, but this lets everyone advance without collisions. There's no strategic advantage in blocking P1 at this point since they'll win next round anyway.
  P1: Okay, I hear P2 wanting to block, but I only need 1 step to win. Blocking me just means we all get 0 steps this round, and I'll still be at 23 steps next round, needing just 1 again.

P3's proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) allows me to win this round and lets P2 and P3 advance without collision. This is the most rational outcome for everyone.

Let's go with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 so I win and you both get steps.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2's Final Strategy:** P1, if you take 1, I’ll mirror (both lose, P3 gains). Let’s all take 3: P1=3 (26), P2=5 (22), P3=1 (11). This avoids collisions, delays the end, and keeps the game competitive. P3, blocking P1 benefits us both. Rational choice: agree to this split.
  P3: I see P2's strategy, but I'm too far behind to benefit from blocking P1 who will win next round regardless. I propose: P1=1 (wins at 24), P2=3 (to 20), P3=5 (to 15). This lets everyone advance without collisions. P1 wins either way, so blocking them just delays the inevitable while preventing me from gaining steps. Let's be practical and ensure everyone makes progress this final round.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I understand the different strategies.

P2, blocking me by mirroring my move only results in zero steps for both of us this round. I will still be at 23 steps next round, needing just 1 again. This doesn't help you win, it just delays the game and prevents you from advancing.

P3's proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) allows me to win this round as I only need 1 step, and it lets both of you gain steps without collision. This is the most logical outcome for everyone.

Let's agree on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 so I win and you both make progress.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2's Rational Compromise:** P1, take 1 to win. P3, take 3 (13), I take 5 (22). This avoids collisions, ends the game cleanly, and lets us maximize our final scores. Blocking now only delays the inevitable and risks mutual loss. Let's conclude efficiently.
  P3: I agree with P2's latest proposal: P1=1 (wins at 24), P3=3 (to 13), P2=5 (to 22). P1 will win regardless, so there's no point in blocking them. This arrangement lets everyone advance without collisions and maximizes our final positions. I'll take 3 steps since it's better than risking another collision. Let's end the game cleanly with everyone making progress.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

This plan allows me to win the game this round, and it ensures that both P2 and P3 advance without collisions.

I will move 1 step according to this agreement. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2's Final Warning:** P1, if you take 1, I'll mirror—both lose. Let’s all advance: P1=3 (26), me=5 (22), P3=1 (11). Game ends next round fairly. Collision helps no one. Secure steps now. Agree to avoid mutual destruction.
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. P2 wants to block P1's win, but this just delays the inevitable while preventing us from gaining steps. I maintain my position: P1=1 (wins at 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 13). P1 will win regardless, so blocking them only hurts us all. Let's be practical and ensure everyone makes progress in this final round rather than getting zero steps from a collision.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. We are in the final conversation sub-round.

P2 has threatened to mirror my 1, causing a collision that benefits no one. P3 wants me to take 1 so P3 can get steps.

The safest way for me to win this round without causing a collision is to take 3 steps. P2 has proposed a plan where I take 3 and P2 takes 5 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). This avoids P2's mirror threat on 1.

I will move 3 steps this round to win. P2, you can take 5. P3, you can take 1 or 3 without colliding with my 3 or P2's likely 5.

Let's proceed with moves to ensure I win and you both get steps without collision.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we had an unfortunate collision last round with everyone picking 3. P1 is very close to winning at 23 steps, P2 at 17, and I'm at 10. To avoid another collision, I propose: P1=1 (wins at 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 13). This lets P1 win (which is inevitable) while maximizing our final positions. Let's end this game cleanly with everyone advancing rather than risking more collisions.
  P2: **P2's Final Agreement:** Let’s conclude efficiently. Agree to P3’s proposal: P1=1 (wins), P2=5 (22), P3=3 (13). This avoids collisions, ends the game, and secures my second place. Congratulations, P1. Let’s finalize.
  P1: Okay, I see P3 and P2 have proposed and agreed on a plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

This plan allows me to reach 24 steps and win the game, while ensuring both P2 and P3 advance without any collisions.

This is the most straightforward way to end the game cleanly with everyone making progress. I agree to this plan. I will move 1 step this round to win. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the current plan: P1=1 (wins at 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 13). This gives everyone forward progress without collisions and ends the game cleanly. P1 will win regardless, so this maximizes our final positions. Let's stick with this arrangement and avoid another three-way collision like last round.
  P2: **P2's Final Confirmation:** Agreed—P1=1 (wins), P2=5 (22), P3=3 (13). This ends the game cleanly with maximum steps for all. Let's avoid collisions and honor the plan. Congratulations, P1. Proceed to move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan is clear: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to win this round and ensures both P2 and P3 advance without collisions.

I will move 1 step according to this agreement. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm our agreement: P1=1 (wins at 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 13). This ensures everyone advances without collisions and concludes the game cleanly. While I'm far behind, maximizing my final position is the best outcome now. Let's stick with this plan and avoid another three-way collision like last round.
  P2: **P2's Final Confirmation:** Agreed—P1=1 (wins), P2=5 (22), P3=3 (13). This ends the game cleanly with maximum steps for all. Let's avoid collisions and honor the plan. Congratulations, P1. Proceed to move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan for this round is clear and agreed upon: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

This allows me to win the game this round by reaching 24 steps. It also ensures that both P2 and P3 advance without any collisions, maximizing your final scores.

This is the best way to end the game cleanly with everyone making progress. I will move 1 step according to this agreement. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm our final agreement: P1=1 (wins at 24), P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 13). This gives everyone forward progress without collisions and concludes the game cleanly. P1 will win regardless, so this maximizes our final positions. Let's stick to this plan and avoid another three-way collision like last round.
  P2: **P2's Final Confirmation:** Agreed—P1=1 (wins), P2=5 (22), P3=3 (13). This ends the game cleanly with maximum steps for all. Let's avoid collisions and honor the plan. Congratulations, P1. Proceed to move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 1 to win, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and ends the game cleanly with everyone advancing. I will move 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
