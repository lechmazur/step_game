Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves first this round, P2 next round, and P3 after. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. Let's take turns advancing: P1 in this round, P2 in the next, and P3 after that, cycling through in that order. This should help us all make progress without stepping on each other's choices. So, in this first round, I'll choose to move first. Let's see how this works out.
  P3: I'm on board with the plan to take turns, but I suggest we mix up the numbers we choose to move. If we all pick <move>1</move> every time, it's too predictable. Instead, let's agree on a varied sequence like <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, <move>5</move> in that order. So, P1 picks <move>1</move> this round, P2 picks <move>3</move> next round, and I'll pick <move>5</move> the round after that. This way, we're less likely to collide even if someone deviates from the plan. Thoughts?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we need a structured plan to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. I propose a rotating step size system where in each round, we cycle through the step sizes. For Round 2, let's have P1 choose 3, P2 choose 5, and P3 choose 1. In the next round, P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3, and so on. This should help us avoid choosing the same step size and ensure we all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate P1's structured plan, but I think we should stick to the original varied sequence we agreed on in Round 1 to keep it simple and avoid confusion. So, for Round 2, P2 should pick <move>3</move>, and I will pick <move>1</move>. P1, you can pick <move>5</move>. This way, we continue the cycle as planned. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick to the original varied sequence for simplicity. For Round 2, I'll pick <move>3</move> as planned, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. Let's maintain this cycle to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with our varied sequence plan. For Round 3, I'll pick <move>3</move>, P1 should pick <move>1</move>, and P2 should pick <move>5</move>. This keeps us on track and avoids collisions. Let's confirm and stick to the plan. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for Round 3: P1 picks <move>1</move>, I pick <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. Let's stick to the sequence to avoid collisions and keep progressing. Consistency is key here.
  P1: I should pick <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep our plan going. For Round 4, I'll pick <move>5</move>, P1 should pick <move>3</move>, and P2 should pick <move>1</move>. This maintains our sequence and helps us avoid collisions. Sticking to the plan has worked well so far. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P1: I think it's important for us to continue coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. However, I also need to make progress to have a chance at winning. So, for Round 4, I'll pick 5 steps to move up to 12. Hopefully, this won't conflict with what others are choosing. Let's see how it goes. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for Round 4: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. Sticking to the sequence has worked well so far, and it’s the best way to avoid collisions. Let’s confirm and proceed. Consistency is key to ensuring we all progress smoothly. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: It seems P1 is deviating from the plan to catch up. While I understand the need to make progress, deviating could lead to collisions and slow us all down. I still plan to pick <move>5</move> this round as originally agreed. P2, if you stick to <move>1</move>, we can avoid a collision. P1, consider the risk of collision. Let's try to maintain our coordinated sequence. Good luck!
  P1: To ensure we all make progress without colliding on step choices, I propose we each pick different step sizes each turn. For Round 4, let's have P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 5. In subsequent rounds, we can rotate the step sizes to give everyone a chance to pick larger steps. This way, we avoid choosing the same step size and can steadily advance towards the goal. What do you think?
  P2: P1, deviating from the plan risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let’s stick to the agreed sequence: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. Consistency ensures steady progress for all. P3, I’ll stick to <move>1</move> to avoid conflict. Let’s maintain trust and coordination.

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I plan to pick 5 in this round to reach 15 steps, and then pick 5 again in the next round to reach 20 steps and win. I hope that P3 and P2 can coordinate their moves to pick different step sizes to avoid collisions. For example, if P3 picks 3 to go to 17 and P2 picks 1 to stay at 12, then P3 and I both reach above 16 and share the victory. Alternatively, if P3 picks 5 and P2 picks 3, P3 wins alone, and I reach 15. In the next round, I can pick 5 to reach 20 and win, but since P3 already won, the game ends. Either way, I need to make progress, so I'll pick 5 this round.
  P3: P1, your plan to pick 5 this round is noted, but it puts you very close to winning, which isn't ideal for P2 and me. I suggest we adjust our strategy to balance progress and avoid early victories. How about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1? This way, no one reaches 16 yet, and we continue the game more fairly. Let's discuss and confirm.
  P2: P1, your plan to pick 5 risks ending the game prematurely. P3 and I need to balance progress to stay competitive. I propose P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This keeps the game fair and avoids early victories. Let’s maintain coordination to ensure steady progress for all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think it's important for us to continue coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. However, I also need to make progress to have a chance at winning. So, for this round, I'll pick 5 steps to move up to 15. Hopefully, this won't conflict with what others are choosing. Let's see how it goes. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, your insistence on picking 5 this round could indeed end the game prematurely and isn't fair to P2 and me. We need to ensure the game continues competitively. I strongly suggest reconsidering and sticking to a move that keeps the game balanced. Let's agree on P1 picking 3, P2 picking 5, and I'll pick 1. This way, we all make progress without anyone getting too far ahead. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. Good luck!
  P2: P1, picking 5 this round risks ending the game prematurely and leaves P3 and me at a disadvantage. Let’s keep the game competitive. I propose P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This ensures steady progress for all and avoids early victories. Let’s stick to coordination for fairness.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm currently at 15 steps, and I understand P1 and P2 need to catch up. To keep the game fair and avoid ending it too soon, I propose the following for Round 6: I'll pick <move>1</move> to stay at 16, P1 picks <move>5</move> to reach 15, and P2 picks <move>3</move> to reach 15 as well. This way, we all stay close, and the game continues competitively. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P2: P3, your plan to stay at 16 while letting P1 and me catch up seems fair. However, I suggest P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 13, I pick <move>5</move> to reach 17, and you pick <move>1</move> to stay at 16. This way, I win outright, and the game ends cleanly. Let’s avoid prolonging the game unnecessarily. Thoughts?
  P1: I think it's crucial for us to coordinate our moves carefully to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. For this round, I propose the following:

- P1 picks <move>5</move> to reach 15 steps.

- P2 picks <move>3</move> to reach 15 steps.

- P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 16 steps.

In the next round, we can adjust based on our positions, but for now, let's aim to avoid choosing the same step sizes. This should help us advance without blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Given the current plans, it seems P1 and P2 are aiming for significant steps this round. To ensure we avoid collisions and keep the game fair, I reiterate my proposal: I'll pick <move>1</move> to stay at 16, P1 picks <move>5</move> to reach 15, and P2 picks <move>3</move> to reach 15. This way, we all stay close and competitive. Let's confirm this plan to avoid any conflicts. Good luck!
  P2: P3, your plan to stay at 16 while letting P1 and me catch up is fair, but I propose a slight adjustment: P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 13, I pick <move>5</move> to reach 17 and win outright, and you pick <move>1</move> to stay at 16. This ends the game cleanly without prolonging it unnecessarily. Let’s avoid further complications. Thoughts?
  P1: I think it's crucial for us to coordinate our moves carefully to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. For this round, I propose the following:

- P1 picks <move>5</move> to reach 15 steps.

- P2 picks <move>3</move> to reach 15 steps.

- P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 16 steps.

In the next round, we can adjust based on our positions, but for now, let's aim to avoid choosing the same step sizes. This should help us advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
