Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate so we all advance without collisions. I propose: I’ll choose 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Does that work?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s avoid collisions and all advance.
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this and advance together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. This round, I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. Let's stick to the rotation to avoid collisions and keep advancing fairly.
  P1: I’ve just realized we’re all tied at 6 right now, and if we strictly follow the current rotation, P2 will wind up hitting 16+ first and winning outright. Let’s revise the plan to keep things balanced so no single person gets a guaranteed win. How about I take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, then we rotate from there? Let’s make sure we don’t hand anyone an easy solo victory.
  P2: P1, I agree with your revised plan to keep things balanced. I'll take 1 this round, you take 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's rotate from there to ensure a fair game.

Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s finalize this round: I’ll choose 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Then we’ll all be at 12. Next round, I suggest P3 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I’ll take 1 to keep things balanced. Let’s do it.

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re all tied at 12. Let’s lock in a simple three‐round rotation so we end up tied without collisions: each round, exactly one of us picks 3 and the other two pick 1, so over three turns each person does “3” once and “1” twice, adding 5 steps each total. This round, I’ll be the one to pick 3, and P2/P3 pick 1. Next round, we rotate who picks 3. Fair and collision‐free—what do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for a three-round rotation. This round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair.
  P2: I agree with the three-round rotation plan. This round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's keep it fair and collision-free.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, I’m fully on board with this three‐round rotation plan. I’ll take 3 now, and you two take 1. Next round, we rotate who picks 3 again so each of us gains 5 steps total and we all finish together. Let’s finalize that.
  P3: I agree with the three-round rotation plan. This round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair.

Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, let’s finalize our three-round rotation plan. I’ll pick 3 now, and you two pick 1. Then we rotate next round so each of us adds up the same total without collisions.
  P3: I agree with the three-round rotation plan. This round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair.

Round 5, Conversation subround 4:

  P3: I agree with the three-round rotation plan. This round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair.
  P2: I agree with the three-round rotation plan. This round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's keep it fair and collision-free.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
