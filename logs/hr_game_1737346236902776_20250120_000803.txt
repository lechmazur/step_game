Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies for this round. Since we're all starting at 0 steps, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid colliding. If we can agree on different moves, we can all advance. What do you think? Should we try to pick different numbers to maximize our progress?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the idea of coordinating our moves. To avoid collisions, I suggest we each pick a different move. For example, I could take 1 step, P1 could take 3, and P3 could take 5. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. What do you both think? If we can agree on this, we can all advance effectively.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we should stick to our plan of choosing different moves. If I take 1 step, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, we can all advance without blocking each other. This strategy is crucial to get ahead early in the game. Let’s confirm our choices so we can maximize our progress! What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the idea of coordinating our moves, but I want to emphasize the importance of flexibility. If we all agree on different moves, we need to be prepared for any last-minute changes. I suggest we stick to our initial plan, but I’m open to hearing any alternative strategies you might have. Let’s make sure we’re all on the same page for this round! What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I appreciate the discussion we've had, but I want to remind everyone that this is a competitive game. While coordination is important, I believe we should also consider the possibility of taking a risk. If I choose 1 step and you both stick to our agreed plan, I could potentially gain an advantage by changing my move. Let's stay flexible, and be prepared for any surprises. What do you think?

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P1 has already advanced with 1 step, I suggest we reassess our strategies for this round. P3 and I both picked 5 last round, which led to a collision. To avoid that again, I propose that I take 1 step this time, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let's confirm our choices to maximize our advancement. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your input, but I want to emphasize that while coordination is helpful, we should also consider the competitive aspect of the game. If we stick to the same moves, we risk colliding again. I suggest we each take a different number again but perhaps adjust our previous plan. I could take 3 steps this time, P1 could take 1, and P3 could take 5. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and all make progress. What do you think?

  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of coordination, but I want to suggest that we also consider the possibility of making bold moves.

How about I take 3 steps this time, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can still progress while keeping our options open. Let's discuss!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we need to be cautious about our moves this round. While I proposed taking 3 steps, I realize that we might still collide if we don't adjust our strategy.
