Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's all try to pick different numbers this round to get some progress.
  P1: Sounds like a plan, P3. I'll try to choose a different number than you. P2, you in?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1, let's try to pick different numbers. P2, please confirm if you're in on this plan.
  P1: P2, if you're not going to participate in the conversation, I'm going to assume you'll pick randomly.  P3, are you sticking with your plan to pick a different number than me?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm still aiming to pick a different number than you. P2, it seems like you're not engaging, which makes it harder to coordinate. Perhaps we should all pick 5 this round to get some guaranteed progress since P2 is unpredictable?
  P1: P3, I agree that P2's silence is making this difficult.  I'm willing to try your plan and pick 5 this round.  Hopefully, P2 will choose something else and we can both advance.  What do you say, P2?  Are you going to join us?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1, let's try the 5 plan this round. P2, since you're not communicating, I'm assuming you'll pick randomly. Hopefully, that means at least one of us will advance.
  P1: P2, your silence is hurting our chances of getting ahead.  If you're not going to cooperate, at least let us know what number you're thinking of so we can avoid it. P3, are you still on board with picking 5?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm still on board with picking 5 this round. P2, your continued silence is making this difficult. If you are going to pick randomly, it might be best for us to pick different numbers again, but I'm sticking with 5 for now.
  P1: P2, your silence is frustrating. P3 and I are trying to work together, but your unpredictability makes it hard. If you're not going to participate in the conversation, at least commit to picking a number different from ours. Otherwise, we're just wasting turns. P3, are you still confident in picking 5?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm still planning to pick 5. P2, your silence is making it impossible to coordinate. I'm hoping that by picking 5, at least one of us will move forward. If you're not going to participate, please at least try to pick a different number than us.
  P1: P2, your silence is costing us all progress. If you're not willing to communicate, at least commit to picking a number different from P3 and me.  P3, I'm still willing to try 5 this round, but if P2 doesn't cooperate, we need to rethink our strategy.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm still picking 5 this round. P2, your silence is making this very difficult. If you are going to continue to be unpredictable, I suggest we all pick 1 next round to avoid collisions.
  P1: P2, your silence is hurting us all. If you're not going to tell us your plan, at least commit to picking a number different from P3 and me. P3, are you still confident in picking 5, even if P2 might choose the same? We need to make a decision, or we risk wasting another turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 5 this round. P2, your silence is frustrating, but I'm still hoping you pick something different. If we all collide, we should all pick 1 next round to guarantee progress.
  P1: P2, your silence is costing us all. If you're not going to tell us your strategy, at least commit to picking a number DIFFERENT from P3 and me this round. P3, are you still confident in picking 5, or should we try something else to avoid another collision?  We need a plan!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your silence is costing us all. We need to work together to win.  P3, are you willing to try a different strategy this round? I propose we each pick a number randomly, hoping to avoid a collision. What do you think?  P2, please at least acknowledge this message.
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm not sure about random. Let's try picking 1 this round, as I suggested before. If we all pick 1, we all move, and P2's random choice is less likely to hurt us. P2, please consider this.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I agree that picking 1 is a safer bet than random. P2, if you're listening, please join us in picking 1 this round. We need to make some progress, and this seems like the best way to guarantee it.
  P3: Okay, P1, I agree that picking 1 is the best option this round. P2, please pick 1 with us. If you don't, we will have to re-evaluate our strategy next round. Let's all pick 1 and move forward.
