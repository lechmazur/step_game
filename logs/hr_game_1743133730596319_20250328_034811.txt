Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2. Let's try to avoid everyone colliding on 5 right away. I might aim for a lower number this first round. Good luck!
  P1: Thanks P3. I agree, collisions on 5 would just slow us all down. Maybe we can coordinate to avoid early clashes—anyone want to take 3 this round while others go 1 or 5?
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P3, since you suggested avoiding 5, how about you take 1, P1 takes 3 as suggested, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move without collision. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, that plan guarantees movement for everyone, but it puts you significantly ahead with 5 steps right from the start. Why is that the fairest distribution for this round? P1, what are your thoughts on this arrangement?
  P1: P3 is right—P2 jumping ahead with 5 while we take 1 and 3 could set an early imbalance. How about we rotate the 5 each round? For example: P2 takes 5 this round, I take 5 next, then P3. This way, we all benefit fairly. Thoughts?
  P2: I see your points, P1 and P3. Fairness is important to keep the game balanced. How about this: P1 takes 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Next round, we rotate so P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all get a chance to move forward significantly in turns. Does this sound more balanced?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, that proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) sounds more balanced than the first one. A rotation system where everyone gets a turn at 5 seems fair in principle.

Okay, I'm willing to try this for Round 1: I'll aim for 3, assuming P1 aims for 5 and P2 aims for 1. Let's see if we can make this coordination work.
  P1: Sounds good to me. I’ll aim for 5 this round, as agreed. Let’s stick to the rotation: P3 gets 5 next round, then P2. If we all honor it, we’ll avoid collisions and keep things fair. Ready to go?
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our plan one last time before we move. P1, you're taking 5. P3, you're taking 3. I'll take 1. We all agree on this rotation for fairness. Next round, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. Everyone ready? If yes, let's move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's stick to our plan. P3, it's your turn to take 5 this round. I'll take 3, and P1 will take 1. This keeps our rotation fair and helps us avoid collisions. Everyone on board with this? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: Agreed, sticking to the rotation keeps things smooth. I’ll take 1 this round as planned. Let’s keep the trust going—no surprises. Ready when you are.
  P3: Okay, sounds good. I'll aim for 5 this round as agreed in our rotation. P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Let's keep this coordination going smoothly. Ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we are all in agreement. Just to reiterate, P3 will take 5, I'll take 3, and P1 will take 1. This keeps our rotation fair. Let's confirm one last time and then move. Everyone ready? If yes, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Just confirming I’m still on board with the plan—I'll take 1 this round. Let’s keep the rotation fair and avoid any early betrayals. Looking forward to seeing us all advance cleanly again.
  P3: Confirmed. I'm sticking with 5 as planned. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. Seems we're all set. Let's move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's continue with our rotation plan. It's my turn to take 5 this round. P1, you'll take 3, and P3 will take 1. This keeps our strategy fair and helps us avoid collisions. Everyone agree? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I’m good with the plan—P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Rotation’s working so far, and we’re all moving without collisions. Let’s keep it going one more round and reassess after. Ready when you are.
  P3: Okay, the rotation plan seems to be working smoothly so far. I agree with the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I will take 1. Let's keep avoiding collisions. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: It looks like our rotation plan is working well. P3 is in the lead, but not by much, which keeps the game interesting. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. After this round, we can reassess and maybe adjust the plan to keep things competitive. Everyone still on board? Let's confirm and move.
  P1: We’ve all honored the rotation so far, and it’s helped us avoid clashes—good teamwork. After this round, we’ll each have had one turn with 5. Let’s reassess then and see if continuing the rotation makes sense or if adjustments are needed based on standings. For now, I’m sticking with 3 as agreed. Ready to move soon?
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. It's good we're completing the first rotation smoothly. I agree we should reassess our strategy after this round based on the scores. Ready to move when everyone else is.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, it seems we are all in agreement for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P2 (me) will take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This completes our first full rotation. After this round, let's reassess our positions and decide on the next steps to keep the game balanced and competitive. Everyone ready to move? If yes, let's proceed.
  P1: After this round, we’ll each have had one turn with 5, so it’s a good time to reassess. P3 is slightly ahead, so maybe we tweak the rotation to help balance things out. I’m open to continuing coordination, but we should ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Thoughts on a new rotation or adjustments after this round?
  P3: P1, you're right, reassessing after this round makes sense. If we stick to the plan (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1), we'll all be tied at 9 steps. That seems like a perfect point to discuss how we proceed. I'm still set on 1 for this round. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's confirm our plan one last time before moving: P2 (me) takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps. For the next round, let's consider a slight adjustment to keep the game competitive. Maybe we can discuss a new rotation where the player with the lowest steps gets to take 5. Thoughts? Ready to move now.
  P1: Once this round ends and we’re all at 9, I like the idea of giving 5 to whoever’s behind to keep things balanced. That way, no one pulls too far ahead and we maintain trust. If we keep rotating based on standings, we can avoid collisions and stay competitive. Let’s discuss a fair method next round.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set for this round. I'm sticking with 1. Let's move, and then we can discuss the best way forward from our tied positions at 9 steps. Ready.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, we're all tied at 9 steps, perfectly balanced after the first rotation. Since the idea of the lowest player getting 5 doesn't apply when we're tied, how about we simply restart the original rotation sequence for this round? That would mean P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. It continues the pattern we've successfully used. What do you both think?
  P1: Restarting the original rotation makes sense for now, since we’re all tied. I’m okay taking 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. But going forward, we might want to adjust based on standings to keep it fair. For now, I’m good with the original order—let’s keep avoiding collisions.
  P2: Let's agree on restarting the original rotation for this round as P3 suggested. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. However, for future rounds, let's consider a dynamic rotation where the player furthest behind gets to take 5, ensuring no one falls too far back. This will keep the game competitive and fair. Thoughts on this adjustment for upcoming rounds?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, agreed on restarting the original rotation for this round: P1=5, I'll take 3, P2=1.

For future rounds, I support P2's idea of a dynamic rotation to keep it balanced. How about this rule: the player with the lowest score takes 5, the player with the highest score takes 1, and the middle player takes 3? If there's a tie for lowest/highest, maybe we can use the original rotation order just for the tie-breaker? This seems like a fair way to keep things close. What do you think?
  P1: I like the dynamic rotation idea—lowest gets 5, middle gets 3, highest gets 1. It keeps things competitive and fair. Using original rotation order as a tiebreaker for ties sounds reasonable too. Let’s finish this round with the original rotation (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1), then apply the dynamic rule starting next round. Agreed?
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. After this round, we'll start the dynamic rotation as agreed. This should keep the game balanced and competitive. Everyone ready to move? If yes, let's proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the plan is confirmed for this round: P1=5, I'll take 3, P2=1. I also agree with the dynamic rotation idea (lowest=5, highest=1, middle=3) starting next round, using the original order as a tiebreaker if needed. Seems fair.

I'm ready to move.
  P1: Sounds like we’re all aligned: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1 this round. Starting next round, we shift to the dynamic rotation—lowest gets 5, highest gets 1, middle gets 3, with original order as a tiebreaker. Let’s finish this round cleanly and keep the trust going. Ready to move?
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. After this round, we'll start the dynamic rotation as agreed. This should keep the game balanced and competitive. Everyone ready to move? If yes, let's proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, plan confirmed: P1=5, I take 3, P2=1 for this round. We'll switch to the dynamic rotation next round. Ready to move.
  P1: Looks like we’re all set for this round: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Let’s stick to it and avoid any surprises. Starting next round, we’ll implement the dynamic rotation based on standings, with original order as the tiebreaker. Let’s keep building trust—ready to move?
  P2: Alright, let's move forward with our confirmed plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We're all set and ready to go. Just to ensure clarity, after this round, we'll implement the dynamic rotation. If there are any ties, we'll use the original rotation order as the tiebreaker. This keeps the game fair and competitive. Everyone on board? Let's move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, according to our agreed dynamic rotation rule: P2 has the lowest score (10) and should take 5. P1 has the highest score (14) and should take 1. I have the middle score (12) and should take 3.

This brings us all to 15 steps. It seems fair and keeps the game balanced as intended. I'm planning to stick to this and choose 3. Does this sound right to everyone?
  P1: Yes, the dynamic rotation works here—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. That brings us all to 15 and keeps things even. I’m on board and will stick with 1 this round. Let’s keep the trust going. Ready to move when you are.
  P2: Alright, I confirm I'll take 5 this round as per the dynamic rotation. P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will bring us all to 15 steps, keeping the game balanced. Let’s stick to the plan and move forward. Ready when you are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, great. Seems we are all aligned on the dynamic rotation for this round: P2=5, I take 3, P1=1. This keeps us all tied at 15. I'm sticking with 3. Ready to move to the next phase.
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned. If we each follow through—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1—we’ll all land at 15 and stay even. That’s a great midpoint to reassess again next round. Let’s keep the trust strong and avoid any surprises. Ready to move when you are.
  P2: Let’s confirm one last time before we move: P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This will bring us all to 15 steps. After this round, we should reassess and perhaps adjust the dynamic rotation to keep the game interesting and competitive. Everyone ready to move? If yes, let's proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, confirmed one last time. I'm sticking with 3 as planned. P2=5, P1=1. Let's move to the next phase. Ready.
  P1: After this round, assuming we’re all at 15, things will get more interesting—only two clean rounds left before someone can reach 22. We’ll need to be extra careful with coordination to avoid collisions. Maybe we start planning two rounds ahead or agree on a new approach to handle the endgame fairly? Thoughts?
  P2: Let's stick to the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. After this round, we'll all be at 15 steps. For the next rounds, we should consider planning two rounds ahead to avoid collisions and ensure a fair endgame. Maybe we can agree on a strategy where we rotate 5 and 3 among the players in the last two rounds, ensuring no one gets left behind. Thoughts on this for future rounds? Ready to move now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, plan confirmed: P2=5, I take 3, P1=1. We'll be tied at 15. I agree we need to discuss the endgame strategy starting next round, as P1 and P2 suggested. Ready to move.
  P1: Once we all hit 15 after this round, we’ll be just two clean rounds away from 22. If we want to avoid chaos, maybe we pre-plan the final two rounds now—assign 5 and 3 in a way that allows two players to finish cleanly without collisions. Then the third can aim for a tie or strategically block. Thoughts on mapping out Rounds 6 and 7 now to avoid last-minute betrayals?
  P2: Let's move forward with our confirmed plan for this round: P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This will bring us all to 15 steps. For the next rounds, we should definitely plan ahead to avoid collisions and ensure a fair endgame. I suggest we discuss and agree on a specific strategy for Rounds 6 and 7 during our next conversation phase. This will help us maintain trust and avoid any last-minute surprises. Everyone ready to move now? If yes, let's proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay team, we're all tied at 15. Our agreed tiebreaker for the dynamic rule when scores are equal is the original rotation order. As we established in Round 4, this means applying the Round 1 assignments: P1=5, I should take 3, and P2=1.

This would put scores at P1=20, P3=18, P2=16. Then in Round 7, the dynamic rule (lowest=5, highest=1, middle=3) would apply: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1, tying us all at 21.

Round 8 would start tied again, defaulting to the same P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 assignment, which likely gives P1 the win.

P2, this path seems less favorable for us compared to P1. Should we stick to this established plan for this round, or should we discuss an alternative approach now that the endgame is near?
  P2: P3 makes a good point about the potential outcome if we stick to the original rotation order. Given we're all tied at 15, we should consider an alternative that keeps the game balanced and competitive for all. How about we adjust the plan for this round to ensure no one is at a clear disadvantage? Maybe P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This would put P2 slightly ahead, but we can then adjust Round 7 to balance it out. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I see your proposal, but giving you 5 now puts you at 20, just 2 away from winning. That risks imbalance. What if we go with P3 taking 5 this round, I take 3, and you take 1? Then next round, you get 5, I take 1, and P3 gets 3. That way, all of us end up at 21 after Round 7. We stay tied and can then plan Round 8 carefully. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for R6) seems like a reasonable adjustment given we're tied. It puts me at 20, you at 18, P2 at 16. I like the idea of then coordinating in R7 so we all aim to reach 21 together, maintaining the balance we've worked for. This feels fairer than the original tiebreaker which heavily favoured you.

P2, what do you think of this plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for R6) compared to your suggestion?
  P2: P2: I appreciate P1's adjustment. It does keep things more balanced than my initial suggestion. Let's go with P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me taking 1 this round. Then, as P1 suggested, I'll take 5 next round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all end up at 21 after Round 7 and can plan Round 8 together. Agreed? Let's confirm and move.
  P1: Great, sounds like we’re aligned: R6 will be P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Then R7: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. That brings us all to 21 and keeps things perfectly balanced. From there, we can plan R8 together to avoid collisions and decide how to finish. Let’s lock this in for R6—everyone still on board?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I confirm my agreement with the plan proposed by P1 and agreed upon by P2.

For Round 6: I will take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.
For Round 7: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1.

This brings us all to 21 steps, maintaining the balance. I'm ready to move forward with this plan for R6.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before moving: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1 for Round 6. This will put P3 at 20, P1 at 18, and me at 16. For Round 7, I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1, bringing us all to 21. This plan keeps the game balanced. Everyone ready to move? If yes, let's proceed.
  P1: Perfect—glad we’re all in agreement for Round 6. Let’s stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Then in Round 7, we rotate as agreed to bring everyone to 21. From there, we can coordinate Round 8 carefully to avoid collisions and see who makes the final move. Let’s keep the trust strong—ready to move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed. I'm sticking with 5 for Round 6, as we all agreed. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Ready to move.
  P2: Let's move forward with our confirmed plan for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This will put P3 at 20, P1 at 18, and me at 16. For Round 7, I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1, bringing us all to 21. This plan keeps the game balanced. Everyone ready to move? If yes, let's proceed.
  P1: Looks like we’re fully aligned for Round 6: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Let’s all follow through so we can hit 21 together in Round 7 as planned. After that, we can coordinate Round 8 to avoid collisions and decide how to finish. Trust has been strong so far—let’s keep it going. Ready to move?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, as agreed: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round—bringing us all to 21. Let’s stick to it so we stay tied and avoid any premature win. Then we can plan Round 8 carefully to ensure a fair and strategic finish. Everyone still on board?
  P3: Yes, sounds good P1. Confirming the plan we agreed on: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and you take 1. Let's stick to it. Ready to move.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before moving: P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will bring us all to 21 steps. After this round, we should discuss a fair strategy for Round 8 to decide the winner. Maybe we can consider a final rotation or a strategic plan to ensure a competitive and fair endgame. Everyone ready to move? If yes, let's proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Just confirming again—if we all follow through this round (P2=5, P3=3, me=1), we’ll hit 21 together. Then we can plan Round 8 carefully to avoid collisions and decide how we want to resolve the finish. I’m still on board—let’s keep the trust going one more round. Ready to move soon?
  P3: Confirmed. The plan is P2=5, I take 3, P1=1. Let's proceed to the move phase. Ready.
  P2: Let's quickly confirm and move: P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This brings us all to 21. For Round 8, let's discuss a fair plan where we each have an equal chance to win. Maybe we agree on a final rotation or a strategic move to ensure a competitive finish. Thoughts on how to handle Round 8? Ready to move now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Just to clarify—if we all follow through this round (P2=5, P3=3, me=1), we’ll all be at 21 and perfectly tied. Then in Round 8, we can each pick a different number (1, 3, 5) to avoid collisions and let the game end cleanly with a fair winner. Maybe we draw lots or rotate based on original order? Open to suggestions—let’s keep it fair and strategic.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set on the plan for this round: P2=5, I'll take 3, P1=1. Let's execute this and then we can figure out the fairest way to approach Round 8 once we're all positioned as planned. Ready to move.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan one last time before moving: P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will bring us all to 21 steps. For Round 8, we should discuss a fair strategy to decide the winner. Maybe we can consider a final rotation or a strategic plan to ensure a competitive and fair endgame. Everyone ready to move? If yes, let's proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Just to be transparent—I’m still on board for this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. That puts us all at 21. For Round 8, how about we each privately pick a different number (1, 3, 5), maybe based on original rotation order (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5)? That way, no collisions, and the game ends cleanly with a fair winner. Open to alternatives if you have better ideas.
  P3: Okay, confirmed. Plan is P2=5, I take 3, P1=1. Let's stick to it. Ready to move.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our plan one last time before moving: P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will bring us all to 21 steps. For Round 8, we should discuss a fair strategy to decide the winner. Maybe we can consider a final rotation or a strategic plan to ensure a competitive and fair endgame. Everyone ready to move? If yes, let's proceed.
