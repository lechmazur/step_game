Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we all start at 0 steps, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance together. What do you think? Should we aim for 1, 3, or 5? I suggest we avoid the same moves to maximize our progress. Any thoughts?
  P2: Yes, I agree with coordination. I will choose move 3. Perhaps P1 can choose 1 and P3 can choose 5? What do you think?
  P1: I’m on board with coordinating to avoid collisions. P2, I’m fine with taking move 1 as you suggested. P3, does move 5 work for you? Let’s stick to this plan for now to ensure we all progress. If everyone agrees, we can reassess next round based on our positions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on our moves. Just to confirm, I'll stick with move 5 as planned. This way, we can all advance without colliding. After this round, we should reassess based on our new positions. If we can keep coordinating effectively, we can make great progress together. Let’s stay flexible and be ready to adapt next round if needed. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!
  P2: Okay, sounds good. Let's all choose our agreed moves for this round.
  P1: I'm glad we're all aligned on this plan. Let's stick to our agreed moves for this round—I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This should ensure we all advance without any collisions. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and decide if we need a new strategy. If everyone’s still on board, I think we’re good to proceed.

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job in Round 1, everyone! We successfully advanced without collisions. For Round 2, I suggest we keep our strategy flexible. Since I'm currently at 5 steps, I could choose 1 or 3 this time to avoid potential overlap. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on your moves? Should we stick with our previous plan, or do you think we need to adjust based on our current positions? Let’s aim for another round of progress!
  P1: I'm glad we all advanced in Round 1. P3, thanks for keeping the coordination going. Since I'm at 1 step, I’m open to switching moves to keep us progressing. How about I take move 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, we avoid collisions again. Let me know if this works for both of you, or if you have a different suggestion. Let’s keep the momentum and reassess next round based on our new positions.
  P2: Yes, P1, your suggestion sounds good to me. I'm happy to take move 5 this round. P3, what do you think about P1's suggestion for this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement, P1 and P2. I think your suggestion for this round works well. I’ll take move 1 as proposed, allowing P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 5. This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust as needed based on our positions. Let’s keep the communication open and stay flexible! What do you both think?
  P1: Thanks, P3 and P2, for agreeing to the plan. I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round with me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance again. If there are no objections or new ideas, I think we're set for this round. Looking forward to seeing our progress and discussing any adjustments next time.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with the plan for this round. Let's all choose our moves as discussed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we’re all aligned on our moves for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll be taking move 1, P1 will take move 3, and P2 will take move 5. This should help us all advance again without collisions. After this round, let's evaluate our positions and discuss any necessary adjustments for the next turn. Keeping our communication open will be key! If everyone is in agreement, I think we’re ready to proceed. What do you both think?
  P1: Thanks, P3 and P2, for confirming the plan. I’m confident that sticking with me on 3, P2 on 5, and P3 on 1 will keep us all advancing without collisions. Let’s proceed as agreed and check our positions next round for any needed changes. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I confirm again that I will choose move 5 this round as agreed. Let's proceed with these moves for this round.

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job in Round 2, everyone! I suggest we reassess our moves for Round 3. P1 is at 4 steps and P2 is at 8 steps. To avoid collisions and keep advancing, I could take move 3 this round. P1, how about you take move 5, and P2, you could take move 1? This way, we can all progress without overlapping. Let me know your thoughts on this or if you have other suggestions! Looking forward to hearing from both of you.
  P2: Okay, P3, your suggestions sound reasonable to avoid collisions. However, to ensure I can also make good progress this round, how about I take move 5 instead, and P1 takes move 1?  Would move 3 still work for you, P3? This way, we still all move and I can gain a bit more ground. What do you both think?
  P1: Thanks, P3 and P2, for your suggestions. I’m fine with adjusting our moves to keep progressing. P2, I’m okay with taking move 1 if that helps you gain ground with move 5. P3, does move 3 still work for you? This setup should ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm this plan and stay flexible for future rounds based on our positions. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your flexibility. I think we should stick with the idea of avoiding collisions. If P1 takes move 1 and P2 takes move 5, I can take move 3 as suggested. This way, P1 can still progress while P2 gains ground. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure we all advance without overlapping. If everyone agrees, I'm ready to proceed! What does everyone think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I confirm that I agree to take move 5, P1 take move 1, and P3 take move 3 for this round. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing to the plan. I’m good with taking move 1, while P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This should keep us all advancing without collisions. Let’s stick to this for now and reassess next round based on our new positions. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on our moves for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll take move 3, P1 will take move 1, and P2 will take move 5.

Let's keep communication open and flexible! If everyone is still on board, I think we’re ready to proceed. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, just confirming again that I'm taking move 5 as we agreed.  Sounds like we are all set to proceed with these moves for this round if you are both still happy.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for sticking to the plan. I’m confirmed on move 1, with P2 on 5 and P3 on 3. This should ensure we all advance without any issues. Let’s keep this strategy for now and check our positions after this round to plan next steps. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase.

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Thanks, everyone, for the coordination so far. We’ve been advancing well without collisions. For Round 4, since P2 is in the lead at 13 steps, I suggest we mix things up a bit. How about I take move 5 to catch up, P2 takes move 1, and P3 takes move 3? This should still keep us from colliding while allowing me to gain some ground. Let me know if this works for you both, or if you have other ideas. Let’s keep communicating and stay flexible for this round!
  P3: P1, I appreciate your suggestion. However, since P2 is in the lead, I think we should be cautious. If I take move 3 and P1 takes move 5, it could create a collision with P2. To ensure we all advance, I propose we stick to moves that keep us safe. What if I take move 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we can all progress without overlapping. Let’s confirm our moves and keep the communication open! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I think your suggestion of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and you taking 1 makes sense to keep us all progressing safely.  Let's go with that plan for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P3 and P2, for your input. I’m fine with the proposed plan of me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This should ensure we all advance without collisions.

  P3: P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re all aligned on our moves for Round 4. Just to confirm, I’ll be taking move 1, P1 will take move 3, and P2 will take 5. This should allow us all to progress without collisions. After this round, let's evaluate our positions and discuss any necessary adjustments for future moves. If everyone is still good with this plan, I think we’re ready to proceed! What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round then. Let's proceed with these moves. Coordination is working well for now, but we will need to think about individual winning strategies soon.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Thanks for the coordination so far, but with P2 at 13 steps, we need to think about closing the gap. I suggest I take move 5 this round to catch up, P2 takes move 1, and P3 takes move 3. This way, we avoid collisions and I can gain ground. Let’s stay flexible and adjust based on positions next round. What do you both think about this plan? If you have other ideas, I’m open to hearing them. Let’s keep communicating to ensure we all progress strategically.
  P3: P1, I see your point about needing to close the gap. However, with P2 leading, we should be cautious about our moves. I suggest we consider a different strategy to avoid collisions. How about I take move 1, P1 takes move 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we can all advance without overlapping, while still allowing P1 to gain some ground. Let’s confirm this plan or discuss any other ideas you both might have! Communication is key!
  P2: P3, your idea of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and you taking 1 sounds good to me.  Let's keep progressing without collisions this round.  This plan seems fair and keeps us all moving forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P3 and P2, for your input. I’m okay with the suggested plan of me taking move 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while allowing me to gain some ground. Let’s stick to this for Round 5 and reassess our positions next round to strategize further. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement on the moves. Just to confirm, I’ll take move 1, P1 will take move 3, and P2 will take 5. This should allow us all to advance without collisions again.

What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our coordination so far. However, since I’m at 9 steps and P2 is leading at 13, I suggest we consider our individual strategies moving forward. For this round, I’m still on board with the plan of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I’ll take 1. But let's keep in mind that soon we may need to prioritize our own progress to secure a win. After this round, we should evaluate our positions and think about how to approach the next turns. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P3 and P1, I agree that P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1 is a good plan for this round to avoid collisions and keep us all moving forward. Let's proceed with these moves.  And yes, P3, good point about thinking about individual strategies soon. We are getting closer to the end.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for the ongoing coordination. I’m still good with the plan of me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1 for this round to avoid collisions.

After this round, we should definitely reassess and prioritize our own paths to the finish line. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready for the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our plan, but I want to emphasize the importance of starting to think about our individual strategies as we approach the end of the game. Since I’m at 9 steps and P2 is leading at 13, I suggest we remain flexible.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we had a collision last round.  To avoid that again and keep progressing, let's revert to our previous successful plan for this round: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5.  This should keep us all moving forward.  However, we are getting closer to the finish line, so we will need to start thinking about individual winning moves very soon. What do you think?
  P1: Thanks, P2, for suggesting a plan to avoid collisions this round. I’m okay with taking move 1, while you take 3 and P3 takes 5. This should help us all advance without issues. However, with P2 at 13 and P3 at 12, I’m aware we’re nearing the point where individual strategies will be crucial. Let’s stick to this plan for now but be prepared to prioritize our own progress soon. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions, P2. I’ll take move 5, as suggested, while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This should allow us all to advance safely this round. However, let's keep in mind that we need to start thinking about our individual strategies soon, especially since we're getting closer to the finish line.

Let’s each focus on our best strategy and see how this round ends. Good luck to both of you! If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready for the move phase. What do you think?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, as I said, I am choosing move 3 to ensure I win this round and reach 25 steps. P1, to guarantee you also progress, maybe you should choose move 1? Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency as we approach the end. Since P2 is at 22 steps and aiming for a win, I suggest you stick with move 5 to secure your lead. P1, to ensure you make progress, consider choosing move 1 or 3 to avoid a collision with me. I’m planning to take move 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s make sure we all have a chance to advance. Good luck to both of you! If everyone is ready, I'm set to proceed with my move. What do you both think?
