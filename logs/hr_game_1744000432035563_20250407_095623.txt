Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's strategize this turn. Since we're all at 0 steps, it might be beneficial for us to avoid colliding moves to ensure we each make progress. How about we agree to choose different numbers? This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: To avoid collision on the first move, I suggest we choose numbers based on our player IDs. Let's assign the numbers in ascending order: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we ensure that each of us moves a different number of steps. P2 and P3, do you agree with this simple and straightforward strategy?
  P2: P2: I agree avoiding collisions is key, but let’s prioritize faster progress. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to leap ahead while still keeping all moves distinct. We can rotate numbers later if needed. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see the merit in P2's suggestion for distinct moves, but I want to ensure we all agree on the final numbers. If P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3, we all avoid collisions and make progress. This strategy can set us up well for the next round. Let's confirm this plan so we can each move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: Since we've discussed and agreed on the numbers (P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3) to avoid collisions, let's confirm our plan. I'll proceed with <move>1</move> as planned. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves according to our agreement. If you're ready to move forward with the assigned numbers, simply acknowledge. If anyone has a change of heart, now's the time to speak up. I'll wait for your responses before considering .
  P2: P2: Confirmed. Let’s stick to the agreed plan to avoid collisions and ensure progress. I’ll take <move>5</move> as discussed. This gives me a strong early lead while honoring our coordination. Let’s proceed to the move phase—no need for further talk.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the confirmations, and it seems we have a solid plan in place. Just to reiterate, I will be taking <move>3</move> as agreed. This should allow all of us to make progress without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess our strategies for the next turn based on our positions. Let’s move forward with the plan and aim for a successful first round! If everyone is ready, let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Since we've already agreed on the numbers (P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3) and everyone has confirmed, I'm ready to proceed. To avoid any last-minute changes, I'll say it again: I'll take <move>1</move>. If P2 and P3 are still on board with their respective moves, let's wrap up the conversation. I'm ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: All confirmed. Proceeding as agreed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your move last round caused a collision with me, halting both of us. Let’s honor agreements this time. I propose: P1 takes 1 (to reach 2), I take 3 (to advance to 3), and you take 5 (to reach 5). This keeps all moves distinct and lets us progress fairly. If you deviate again, I’ll choose differently—don’t risk another stalemate. P1, agree?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about collisions. However, I think it might be more strategic for me to take 3 this round while you take 5. This way, P1 can still take 1, and we all make progress without blocking each other. If we stick to distinct moves, we can set ourselves up for better positions in future rounds. What do you think? P1, please share your thoughts as well.
  P1: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I agree with P2's proposal for distinct moves. Let's stick to P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5. This maintains the pattern from Round 1, adjusted for P2's current position. P3, taking 5 will put you ahead if you succeed. P2, let's hope P3 honors the agreement this time. I'll take <move>1</move> if we agree. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your prior betrayal cost me progress. Let’s enforce discipline: P1 takes 1 (→2), I take 3 (→3), and you **must** take 5 (→5). If you deviate again, I’ll target your moves aggressively in future rounds. P1, proceed as agreed. This ensures orderly progress—no more reckless choices. Confirm your commitment to this plan.
  P3: I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, and I appreciate the need for a clear agreement. I will commit to taking <move>5</move> this round as P2 suggested, which allows P1 to take 1 and P2 to take 3. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let’s stick to this plan and ensure we all advance. If everyone is on board, let's confirm our moves and proceed!
  P1: Since P2 is still at 0 steps after Round 1 due to the collision, I suggest adjusting the numbers to reflect the current state. Let's keep the distinct move strategy. P2 should take 5 to quickly catch up, P3 takes 3, and I'll stick with 1. This way, we all progress and avoid collisions. P2, taking 5 will help you recover from the last round's collision. P3, are you okay with adjusting your move to 3 this time?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your prior betrayal cost me progress. This time, stick to 3 as agreed. P1, I’ll take 5 (→5), P3 **must** take 3 (→3). No second chances—collide with me again and I’ll target your moves aggressively. Confirm your commitment now, or face consequences later.
  P3: I understand the urgency, P2, but I want to ensure we all benefit from this round. I will stick to the agreement: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I will take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. If we can agree on this, we can move forward without any issues. Let’s confirm our moves and focus on advancing together. P1, are you still on board with this plan?
  P1: Let's simplify the plan to avoid collisions. Given the current positions (P1: 1, P2: 0, P3: 0), I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps moves distinct and allows all to progress. P2, taking 3 will help you recover. P3, taking 1 will put you ahead of me temporarily. I'll take <move>5</move> if you both agree. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, last round's collision was costly. I accept P1's latest proposal to avoid repeats: **I’ll take 3**, P1 takes 5 (→6), and you **must take 1** (→1). This keeps moves distinct. If you deviate again, I’ll block your path relentlessly. P1, confirm your commitment to 5. Let’s finalize this—no more delays.
  P3: I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, and I appreciate P2's insistence on distinct moves. Let's finalize our plan: P1 takes 5 (→6), P2 takes 3 (→3), and I will take 1 (→1). This ensures we all make progress without blocking each other. I'm committed to this agreement, and I hope we can all stick to it this time. If everyone is on board, let's confirm and move forward!
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2. As agreed upon in the last sub-round, I will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This plan ensures distinct moves and progress for all. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're still committed to your respective moves. If so, we can proceed to the move phase. If there are any changes, please speak up now. I'll wait for your confirmation before finalizing.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s avoid past mistakes. Current standings: P1 at 6, me at 3, P3 at 1. To maximize progress without collision, I propose: **P1 takes 3** (→9), **I take 5** (→8), and **P3 takes 1** (→2). This keeps moves distinct and allows me to close the gap. P1, stepping back to 3 lets us both advance. P3, stick to 1 to avoid blocking. Confirm your commitment—collisions will be met with aggressive counterplay.
  P3: P2, I see your proposal, but I believe we can all make better progress if we adjust our moves. I suggest: **P1 takes 5** (→11), **I take 3** (→4), and **P2 takes 1** (→4). This way, P1 maintains a strong lead while I catch up a bit, and P2 can still make progress without colliding with either of us. Let’s confirm these moves to avoid any collisions again. What do you think?
  P1: To maximize progress without collision in Round 3, I prefer P2's initial proposal: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains distinct moves and allows P2 to close the gap with me. P3, taking 1 is a safe choice to avoid blocking. However, considering P3's alternative, if P2 is okay with taking 1, I'm open to adjusting my move to 5 to maintain a strong lead. P2 and P3, let's discuss and finalize our moves to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, your proposal leaves me stuck at 4 while P1 surges ahead. Let’s stick to **my plan**: P1 takes 3 (→9), I take 5 (→8), and you take 1 (→2). This closes the gap responsibly. If you push for 3 again, I’ll retaliate by抢your moves in future rounds. P1, confirm you’ll hold to 3—collaboration now ensures faster victory for all. No more distractions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your proposals, but I believe we can maximize our progress. I suggest we stick to the distinct moves: **P1 takes 5** (→11), **P2 takes 3** (→6), and I take 1 (→2). This way, P1 maintains a lead, I catch up slightly, and P2 can still make progress. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. I’m committed to this agreement if you both are. What do you think?
  P1: To maximize progress without collision in Round 3, I prefer P2's initial proposal: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. However, I'm open to adjusting my move to 5 if P2 takes 1, as P3 suggested. Let's finalize our moves. P2, are you okay with taking 1 to allow me to take 5 and maintain a strong lead? If so, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. P3, please confirm your move accordingly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final reminder: My plan is the only logical path. P1 takes 3 (→9), I take 5 (→8), P3 takes 1 (→2). This keeps gaps manageable. P3, your alternatives leave me stagnant while P1 escapes. If you insist on disrupting, I’ll prioritize sabotaging your progress next round. P1, confirm you’ll hold to 3—cooperate now or face a prolonged race. No more delays.
  P3: I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but I believe we can all benefit from a different approach. I suggest: **P1 takes 5** (→11), **P2 takes 3** (→6), and **I take 1** (→2). This allows P1 to maintain a strong lead while giving P2 a chance to catch up. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all make progress without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can move forward effectively. What do you both think?
  P1: To maximize progress without collision in Round 3, I'll consider both proposals. If P2 takes 1, I'll take 5. Otherwise, I'll stick with P2's initial plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. P2, please decide and confirm. If you choose 1, I'll adjust to 5. If you stick with your original plan, I'll take 3. Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions. P3, please be ready to take 1 or adjust accordingly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your suggestions risk leaving me stagnant while P1 escapes. Final terms: **P1 takes 3 (→9), I take 5 (→8), you take 1 (→2)**. This maintains pressure on P1 and avoids collisions. If you deviate, I’ll target your moves ruthlessly next round. P1—confirm your commitment to 3 now, or I’ll force a collision to sabotage your lead. No more games.
  P3: I understand the urgency, P2, but I believe we can all benefit from maximizing our moves. I suggest we stick to distinct moves: **P1 takes 5** (→11), **P2 takes 3** (→6), and I take 1 (→2). This allows P1 to maintain a strong lead while giving P2 a chance to catch up. I’m committed to this plan if you both are. Let’s finalize our moves and avoid any collisions this round. What do you think?
  P1: To finalize Round 3 moves, I'll summarize the two main proposals. P2's plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. P3's alternative: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Both plans avoid collisions. P2, if you agree to take 3, I'll take 5. If you stick with taking 5, I'll take 3. P3, you're committed to taking 1 in both plans. Let's confirm our moves. P2, please decide and respond to conclude our conversation.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1, your lead is fragile. Let’s finalize moves to avoid repeats: **I take 5 (→13)**, **you take 3 (→12)**, and P3 takes 1 (→3). This keeps gaps manageable. If you refuse, I’ll force a collision on your likely 5-move to sabotage your progress. P3, confirm you’ll take 1 to stay out of our path—your prior deviations won’t be tolerated this time. Finalize now.
  P1: To maximize progress without collision in Round 4, I propose an alternative: P1 takes 1 (→10), P2 takes 3 (→11), and P3 takes 5 (→7). This keeps moves distinct and allows P2 to close the gap with me. P2, taking 3 will bring you closer to me. P3, taking 5 will help you catch up significantly. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. I'm open to this adjustment if you both agree. If not, I'll stick with P2's initial plan. Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to finalize our moves, but I believe we can maximize our progress. I propose: **P1 takes 5 (→14)**, **P2 takes 3 (→11)**, and **I take 1 (→3)**. This way, P1 maintains a lead while P2 closes the gap, and I can catch up a bit. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. If everyone is on board, we can proceed to the move phase! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Final terms: **I take 5 (→13)**, P1 must take 3 (→12), and P3 **must take 1 (→3)**. This avoids collisions and pressures P1. If either deviates, I’ll retaliate by matching P1’s move to sabotage their lead. P3, your prior breaches will cost you—stick to 1 or face blocked progress. P1, confirm 3 now or collide. No more games.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 4, I'll consider the proposals. P2 suggests: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. I propose an alternative: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. P3 suggests: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. I'll take <move>1</move> if you both agree to P1's alternative. P2, taking 3 will bring you closer. P3, taking 5 will help you catch up. Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all progress without collisions. I propose: **P1 takes 5 (→14)**, **P2 takes 3 (→11)**, and **I take 1 (→3)**. This way, P1 maintains a strong lead, P2 closes the gap, and I can catch up a little. If we stick to this plan, we can avoid any collisions and set ourselves up for the next round. Please confirm your moves, and let's proceed!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final warning: I take **5** (→13). P1, choose **3** (→12) or I’ll match your move to sabotage your lead. P3, stick to **1** (→3) or I’ll block your path. Collaboration ensures progress—defiance guarantees collision. Confirm now.
  P1: To avoid collisions and maximize progress, I'll reiterate my alternative proposal from earlier: P1 takes 1 (→10), P2 takes 3 (→11), and P3 takes 5 (→7). This keeps moves distinct and allows P2 to close the gap. P2, taking 3 will bring you closer to me. P3, taking 5 will significantly boost your position. If you're both on board, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. I'm willing to stick with this plan if you agree.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but I believe we can all benefit from a different approach. I propose: **P1 takes 5 (→14)**, **P2 takes 3 (→11)**, and **I take 1 (→3)**. This way, P1 maintains a lead, P2 closes the gap, and I can catch up slightly. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all make progress without blocking each other. If everyone agrees, we can proceed to the move phase! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Final ultimatum: I take **5 (→13)**. P1, you **must** take **3 (→12)** to avoid collision. P3, stick to **1 (→3)** or I’ll match your move next round to sabotage you. Cooperation ensures progress—defiance guarantees retaliation. Confirm compliance now, or face the consequences.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 4, I'll reiterate my alternative proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps moves distinct. P2, taking 3 will bring you closer to me. P3, taking 5 will significantly boost your position. If you're both on board, let's confirm and proceed. I'm willing to stick with this plan. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. If we agree, we can move to the next phase. Let's finalize our moves now.
  P3: I see we're at a critical juncture. To avoid collisions and maximize our progress, I propose we stick with a distinct move strategy: **P1 takes 5 (→14)**, **P2 takes 3 (→11)**, and I take **1 (→3)**. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while giving P2 a chance to close the gap and lets me catch up slightly. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all advance without blocking each other. If everyone agrees, we can proceed to the move phase! What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize progress in Round 5, I propose: P1 takes 5 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→11), and P3 takes 1 (→3). This keeps moves distinct, allowing all to advance. P2, taking 3 will bring you closer to me, and P3, taking 1 will give you a small boost. If we stick to this plan, we avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. If we agree, we can proceed to the move phase. Let's finalize our moves to ensure progress for all.
  P2: P2: P1, your proposal keeps you ahead unfairly. Let’s split evenly: **I take 5 (→13)**, **you take 3 (→13)**, and **P3 must take 1 (→3)**. This closes the gap fairly. P3, any deviation from 1 will face aggressive blocking from me next round. Confirm this revised plan now.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion, but I believe we should stick to a strategy that maximizes everyone's progress without blocking. I propose: **P1 takes 5 (→15)**, **P2 takes 3 (→11)**, and **I take 1 (→3)**. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while P2 catches up, and I can make a small advancement. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all move forward effectively. P1 and P2, please share your thoughts!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize progress in Round 5, I suggest we stick to distinct moves. Given the current positions (P1: 10, P2: 8, P3: 2), I propose: P1 takes 5 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→11), and P3 takes 1 (→3). This keeps moves distinct and allows all to advance. P2, taking 3 will bring you closer, and P3, taking 1 will give you a small boost. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. If you agree, I'll take <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your respective moves.
  P2: P2: P1, your plan leaves me behind. Let’s adjust: **I take 5 (→13)**, **you take 1 (→11)**, and **P3 must take 3 (→5)**. This ensures distinct moves while advancing all. P3, deviate from 3 and I’ll block your path ruthlessly next round. P1, confirm your commitment to 1—collaborate now or face collision when I match your move later. Finalize now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I believe we should stick to a strategy that maximizes our progress. I propose: **P1 takes 5 (→15)**, **P2 takes 3 (→11)**, and **I take 1 (→3)**. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while P2 catches up, and I can make a small advancement. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all move forward effectively. If we can agree on this, we can proceed to the move phase without any issues. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize progress in Round 5, let's stick to distinct moves. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps moves distinct and allows all to advance. P2, taking 3 will bring you closer, and P3, taking 1 will give you a small boost. If we agree, I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm your respective moves.
  P2: P2: P1, to avoid collision and fair progress, I propose: **you take 1 (→11)**, I take **5 (→13)**, and P3 takes **3 (→5)**. This keeps moves distinct while allowing P3 to advance further than 1. P3 gains more this way—collaborate, or I’ll match P1’s move next round to sabotage their lead. Confirm now.
  P3: I understand the importance of progressing without collisions, but I believe we should stick to a strategy that maximizes our individual advancements. I propose: **P1 takes 5 (→15)**, **P2 takes 3 (→11)**, and **I take 1 (→3)**. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while P2 catches up, and I can make a small advancement. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all move forward effectively without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can proceed to the move phase smoothly! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maximize progress in Round 5, I still propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps moves distinct and allows all to advance. P2, taking 3 will bring you closer, and P3, taking 1 will give you a small boost. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. If you agree, I'll take <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your respective moves. Let's finalize our plan to ensure progress for all.
  P2: P2: Final terms: I take **5 (→13)**, P1 must take **3 (→13)**, and P3 sticks to **1 (→3)**. Collude with P3 again and I’ll match your move next round to sabotage your lead. Confirm compliance now or face collision—my choice.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I believe we should stick to a strategy that maximizes our progress. I propose: **P1 takes 5 (→15)**, **P2 takes 3 (→11)**, and **I take 1 (→3)**. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while P2 catches up, and I can make a small advancement. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all move forward effectively. If we can agree on this, we can proceed to the move phase without any issues. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maximize our progress in Round 6, I propose the following moves: **P1 takes 5 (→20)**, **P2 takes 3 (→14)**, and **I take 1 (→4)**. This allows P1 to maintain a strong lead while giving P2 a chance to catch up without collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can all advance effectively. Please confirm your moves, and let's proceed without any issues. What do you both think?
  P1: To maximize progress in Round 6, I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains distinct moves and allows all to advance. P2, taking 3 will bring you closer to me. P3, taking 1 will give you a small boost. If we stick to this plan, we avoid collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> if you both agree. P2 and P3, please confirm your respective moves to finalize our plan.
  P2: P2: P3's proposal puts P1 dangerously close to victory. Let’s adjust to slow their advance: P1 takes **3** (→18), **I take 5** (→16), and P3 takes **1** (→4). This keeps moves distinct while preventing P1 from jumping to 20. P1, if you refuse, I’ll force a collision on your 5-move. P3, confirm your 1-move to stay compliant. Finalize now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the concern about my position, but I believe we can still stick to a strategy that maximizes our progress. I propose we follow my earlier suggestion: **P1 takes 5 (→20)**, **P2 takes 3 (→14)**, and **I take 1 (→4)**. This allows P1 to maintain the lead while giving P2 a chance to catch up. If we all agree to this plan, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress for everyone. Let's confirm our moves and move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: To maximize progress in Round 6, I still agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains distinct moves and allows all to advance. P2, taking 3 will bring you closer to me. If you're ready to proceed with this plan, I'll take <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. Let's finalize our plan to avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. I'm willing to stick with this plan if you both agree.
  P2: P2: P1, your push to 20 risks an early victory we can’t tolerate. Let’s secure mutual progress: **you take 3 (→18)**, I’ll take **5 (→16)**, and P3 takes **1 (→4)**. If you insist on 5, I’ll match your move to block you—colliding is better than letting you win next round. P3, confirm your 1-move to stay compliant. This plan keeps us all advancing without handing you victory. Final decision now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see that P2 is concerned about my potential victory. However, I believe we can still maximize our progress together. I propose we stick to the original plan: **P1 takes 5 (→20)**, **P2 takes 3 (→14)**, and **I take 1 (→4)**. This allows P1 to maintain a strong lead while giving P2 a chance to catch up without collisions. If we can agree on this, we can move forward effectively. Let's confirm our moves and avoid any further complications! What do you both think?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maximize progress in Round 6, I'll reiterate the agreed-upon proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. If P2 deviates, I'll consider taking 3 to avoid collision. P2, please confirm if you're sticking to taking 3. If so, I'll take <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm your move to 1. Let's finalize our plan to ensure progress for all. I'm willing to proceed if you both agree to the proposed moves.
  P2: P2: Final ultimatum: **P1, take 3 (→18) or I’ll collide by also taking 5, halting your advance.** P3, stick to 1 (→4) to avoid my future targeting. Cooperate now or face aggressive blocking next round. This ensures mutual progress without handing you a premature victory. Confirm compliance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
