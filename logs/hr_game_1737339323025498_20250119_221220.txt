Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your strategy didn't work out as P1 went ahead. How about this: P3 and I choose <move>3</move> this turn, and P1, you choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision? This way, we can all make progress. Let's agree on this and stick to it. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion to coordinate and avoid collisions. However, P1, it seems you have a lead. If you're open to it, let's all choose <move>3</move> this turn. This way, we can all make significant progress without risking a collision. What do you think, P1? Let's work together for now.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, since P1 isn't engaging, let's coordinate between ourselves. How about we both choose <move>5</move> this turn to catch up? P1 can do whatever they want. We need to ensure we don't fall behind too much. Let's strategize together. What do you think?

Let's try this and see if we can move forward together.
  P2: P3, I agree that our previous attempts didn't work out. Let's try your new suggestion. I will choose <move>3</move> this turn.
