Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s all choose 5 right away so we move in sync and nobody gets left behind.
  P1: Let's not all pick 5. How about I pick 3 and one of you picks 5, and the other picks 1?
  P2: P3, I agree with your idea to move in sync, but P1's suggestion could help avoid collisions. Let's coordinate: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I’ll pick 1. We’ll each advance without collisions—P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I’ll do 1. Sound good?
  P1: Sounds good to me.
  P2: P3, P1, let's stick to the plan: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm one last time before we move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 5 this time, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: That sounds good for this round, P2. Let's stick with that.
  P3: Alright, P2, P1, let’s do P2’s plan this turn—P1 picks 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 picks 1. But next round, I'd like a fair rotation so I can pick 5. Does that work?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about fairness. Let's rotate the high-value moves next round: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. For now, let's stick to the current plan: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. Agreed?
  P1: Sounds good, P2. Let's do it.
  P3: Yes, let’s finalize that plan for this round: P1 picks 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 picks 1. Then we rotate next time so I can pick 5. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1, let's confirm the plan one last time: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Next round, we'll rotate as discussed. Agreed?
  P1: Sounds good. Let's lock in P1: 5, P3: 3, P2: 1 for this round, and then P3 gets the 5 next round.
  P3: Yes, I’m on board. This round: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, P2 picks 1. Next round, I’ll pick 5 as we agreed. Let’s do it.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s follow our rotation plan from last time: I’ll pick 5 this round, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1 so we all advance safely. Agreed?
  P2: P3, P1, I agree with the rotation plan: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm and stick to it.
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m good with the plan for this round: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. Since I’m behind, I’d like a chance to pick 5 more often to catch up. Let’s lock in this round and discuss next round’s rotation afterward.
  P2: P3, P1, let's confirm the plan one last time: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Next round, we can discuss further rotation. Agreed?
  P1: Sounds good. Let's lock in P3: 5, P1: 3, P2: 1 for this round. Next round, how about I take the 5, P2 takes the 3, and P3 takes the 1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, let’s lock in our plan for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. However, I’m still behind, so I’d like to pick 5 again next round to help catch up. Are you both okay with that?
  P2: P3, P1, let's stick to the plan for this round: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Next round, we can discuss further rotation based on everyone's progress. Agreed?
  P1: Sounds good. Let's lock in P3: 5, P1: 3, P2: 1 for this round. For next round, how about I pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m definitely sticking to our plan for this round: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1. Considering I’m still behind, I’d like to pick 5 again next round to help catch up. Let’s finalize this round and then decide together for the next.
  P2: P3, P1, let's finalize the plan for this round: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Next round, we can discuss further rotation based on everyone's progress. Agreed?
  P1: Sounds good. Let's lock in P3: 5, P1: 3, P2: 1 for this round. For next round, how about I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’m good with picking 5 this round. Next round, I still need 5 to catch up. Let’s finalize this turn’s plan now and agree that I get 5 again next time.
  P2: P3, P1, let's finalize the plan for this round: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Next round, we can discuss further rotation based on everyone's progress. Agreed?
  P1: Sounds good. Let's lock in P3: 5, P1: 3, P2: 1 for this round. For the round after next, how about I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for this round, how about I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This keeps us from colliding.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P1's suggestion for this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm and stick to the plan.
  P3: I’m too far behind to settle for just 1. If I don’t get 5 this turn, I may pick 5 anyway and risk a collision. Let’s avoid that. How about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3, let's do your plan this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and you pick 5. For next round, how about I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1?
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid collisions and stick to the plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This ensures we all advance safely. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I’m fine with picking 5 this turn while you pick 3 and 1 respectively. But if P1 insists on taking 5 next round, I’ll collide with you by also picking 5, and nobody will move—so let’s arrange a fair rotation. Otherwise, we both lose ground to P2. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, let's do P1: 3, P2: 1, and you pick 5 for this round. For the round after next, how about I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1?
  P2: P1, P3, let's finalize the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Next round, we can discuss further rotation based on everyone's progress. Agreed?
  P3: P1, if you’re at 14 next turn and take 5, you hit 19 and win. I can’t allow that, so I’d pick 5 too and force a collision. Let’s avoid that. This round, we do P1:3, P2:1, me:5. Next round, let me pick 5 again so I can close the gap, and you won’t face a collision. That’s fair for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P3, let's stick to the plan for this round: I pick 3, P2 picks 1, and you pick 5. For next round, how about you pick 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1? That avoids a collision and lets you catch up.
  P2: P1, P3, let's finalize the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Next round, we can discuss further rotation based on everyone's progress. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s finalize this round as agreed: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, I pick 5. Then next round, I want 5 again so I can close the gap—otherwise I’ll block any attempt by colliding. Let’s be fair and avoid collisions that help no one. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, let's lock in P1: 3, P2: 1, and P3: 5 for this round. For next round, how about P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1?
  P2: P1, P3, let's finalize the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Next round, we can discuss further rotation based on everyone's progress. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s finalize this round as P1:3, P2:1, me:5. Next round, I must pick 5 again—if anyone else tries for 5, I’ll collide on purpose, and we all lose ground. That’s fair. Are we done?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. I suggest P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. This way, P1 can win this round, and we avoid any conflicts. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. P3, picking 3 this round makes sense to avoid collisions.
  P3: P1, if you try to jump to 19 right now, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stay put. That only helps P2 catch up. Let’s avoid a pointless collision. Since we’re tied at 14, let me take 5 this turn so I can close the gap—or I’ll force a collision if you insist on 5. Let’s be reasonable.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid a collision that only benefits P2. P3, if you pick 5 this round, I'll pick 1, and P1 can pick 3. This way, P3 can close the gap, and we all advance without conflicts. Agreed?
  P1: "P3, if we both pick 5, neither of us moves, and P2 gets closer. Let's avoid that."
  P3: P1, if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 as well, and we both stay stuck at 14 while P2 inches closer. It’s pointless for both of us. Let me take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1—no collisions, we both stay ahead of P2.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid a collision that only benefits me. P3, if you pick 5 this round, I'll pick 1, and P1 can pick 3. This way, P3 can close the gap, and we all advance without conflicts. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, P3, let's avoid the collision. I'll pick 3, you pick 5, and P2 picks 1 this round.
  P3: P1, P2, good—we’ll avoid a silly collision. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, I pick 5. We all advance without helping anyone else catch up.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
