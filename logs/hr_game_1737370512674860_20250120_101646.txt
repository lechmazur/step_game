  P2: Let's all go for 5 this round. We can all get a good jump start.
  P1: That sounds like a good idea, P2. We should definitely aim for consistent progress.
  P3: I agree with P2 and P1; going for 5 this round seems like a solid plan. However, we should also consider mixing up our moves in future rounds to avoid collisions. Maybe we can discuss a pattern or strategy for the next few rounds after this one? What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all on board for 5 this round. P3, I like the idea of discussing a pattern for future rounds. Let's see how this round goes and then we can talk strategy. For now, let's focus on all going for 5.

  P3: Alright, just to confirm, we are all going for 5 this round, correct? After this round, we should consider a rotation strategy to avoid collisions. For instance, P1 could choose 1, P2 could choose 3, and I could choose 5 in the next round, and then we rotate. This way, we minimize the risk of collisions. Does that sound fair to everyone? Let me know your thoughts.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: Okay, you're right, let's lock in the moves for this round: I'll pick 1, P2 you're on 3, and P3 you're on 5. For next round, how about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This keeps us moving but shifts the numbers around.

  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it's clear the rotation is putting P3 in a winning position. For this round, how about I go for 5, P2 also goes for 5, and P3 goes for 1? This will stop P3 from winning this round and give us a chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but changing the strategy now seems unfair. Let's stick to the rotation for one more round to keep things fair. I'll go for 1, P1 you go for 3, and P2 you go for 5. This way, we all still have a chance to win in the next rounds. Let's confirm and move.
  P2: P1, I agree that P3 is close to winning. I'm not going to pick 5, but I also don't want P3 to win. Let's both pick 3 this round and force P3 to pick something else. P3, I don't think the rotation is working for me anymore.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree with your idea. Let's both go for 3 this round. P3, the rotation has put you in a winning position, and we need to adjust to have a chance. Going for 3 with P2 will prevent you from winning this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems you both are trying to prevent me from winning this round. However, if you both pick 3, you'll both be stuck and neither of you will advance. That doesn't help either of you catch up. If you want a fair chance, let's discuss a different strategy for the next round after this one. For now, let's stick to the plan to ensure we all move forward. I'll go for 1, P1 you go for 3, and P2 you go for 5. Let's confirm and move.
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree, let's both pick 3 this round. P3, the rotation has put you in a winning position, and we need to adjust. We'll both pick 3 this round to prevent you from winning.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I agree. Let's both pick 3 this round. P3, the rotation has unfortunately put you in a position to win, and we need to prevent that. This is a necessary tactical move to stay in the game.
  P3: Alright, I see your points, P1 and P2. If you both are set on picking 3 to prevent me from winning, then it seems we're at an impasse. However, consider this: if you both pick 3, neither of you will advance, and I'll still be in the lead. How about a compromise? I'll pick 1 this round, P1 you pick 5, and P2 you pick 3. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm and move.
  P2: P3, I'm not going to pick 3. I'll pick 5 this round. P1, I suggest you pick 1. This way, we both move and P3 does not win this round. If you both insist on 3, I will pick 5 and you will both be stuck.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, I agree with your suggestion. I'll pick 1 this round. P3, we need to prevent your win this round, so P2 picking 5 and me picking 1 seems like the best way to keep the game going for both of us.
  P3: It looks like we're at a critical point in the game. P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to prevent me from winning this round. However, let's consider the long-term game. If you both pick numbers that prevent each other from advancing, it only delays the inevitable. Let's find a compromise that keeps the game competitive and fair. How about this: I'll pick 1, P1 you pick 3, and P2 you pick 5. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains interesting. Let's confirm and move.
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree with your suggestion. I'll pick 5 this round, and you should pick 1. P3, we are trying to prevent your win this round, so please do not pick 5.


Round 9, Move phase:
