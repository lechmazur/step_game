Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions right from the start. I propose P1 takes move 1, P2 takes move 3, and I (P3) take move 5 this turn. That way, we all progress fairly. What do you say?
  P2: I like P3's idea of coordinating to avoid collisions. I agree with the proposed moves: I'll take move 3, P1 takes move 1, and P3 takes move 5. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. Let's stick to this plan! What do you think, P1?
  P1: Okay, I agree to the proposed plan for this turn. I will take 1. Let's make sure we all stick to it so we can all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we're all aligned for this turn. To build trust and keep advancing without collisions, I suggest we rotate moves next turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps it fair over time. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for next turn, but let's keep our options open in case we need to adjust based on how this turn plays out. For now, I'm focused on sticking to the plan for this round. If we all follow through, we'll all make progress. After this round, we can reassess and decide if we want to stick to the rotation or change things up. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I'm focused on making sure we all stick to the agreed plan for this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's get this first turn right so we all make progress. We can discuss future turns after this one.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, we're all aligned for this turn's plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's commit to it so we all advance without issues. After we see the results, we can revisit the rotation idea for fairness. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our plan for this turn. Let's ensure we all stick to it: P1 takes move 1, I take move 3, and P3 takes move 5. After this round, we can evaluate how well our coordination worked and decide on the moves for the next turn. I'm optimistic that this approach will help us all make progress without collisions. Let’s execute our plan!
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all clear and agreed on the plan for this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 1 had a collision. Let's try to avoid that this turn so everyone can move forward. I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. However, I suggest we also discuss our strategy for future rounds after this one. It’s important to keep adapting to ensure we all have a chance to advance. Let’s focus on executing this plan first! What do you think, P3?
  P3: I'm disappointed that P2 didn't stick to the plan last turn by choosing 5 instead of 3—it cost me progress. For this round, I'll agree to P1's proposal: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5, to ensure we all advance. But trust is fragile now; we need to commit fully. If anyone deviates again, coordination might break down. Thoughts on rebuilding trust?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I understand P3's point about trust being important. Let's all commit to the agreed plan for this turn: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This is the best way for everyone to make progress and rebuild confidence in our coordination. Let's focus on executing this plan successfully.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the proposed moves for this round. Let's ensure we all stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This will help us rebuild trust and make progress together. After this round, we can discuss how to adapt our strategy for future turns. I'm hopeful we can keep moving forward without collisions. Let’s execute this plan successfully! What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's all commit fully to rebuild trust and ensure progress. If we stick to it, we can avoid collisions and discuss adjustments afterward. I'm ready to proceed if everyone else is. What do you think, P1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, I confirm the plan for this turn. I will take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's all stick to this so we can avoid collisions and make progress this round. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan for this round. Let's make sure we all stick to it: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This is crucial for our progress and rebuilding trust after the last round. If we execute this successfully, we can discuss our strategy for the next round afterward. I'm optimistic about this approach! Let’s focus on making it work this time. Are we all ready to proceed?
  P3: I'm still fully on board with the plan for this turn: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's all honor our commitment to rebuild trust and avoid another collision. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed the plan multiple times: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's make sure we all stick to it this time so everyone advances and we rebuild trust. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's all follow through this time to avoid collisions and make progress. After this round, we can discuss how to adjust our strategy moving forward. Trust is key, so let's focus on executing our agreed moves successfully. Are we all ready to proceed?
  P3: I'm still committed to the plan for this turn: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's all stick to it to rebuild trust and ensure we all advance. However, if deviations continue, coordination may not work long-term. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: After last round's successful coordination, let's build on that momentum. I propose for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This rotation helps balance progress and rebuilds trust, especially with P2. If we all stick to it, we can avoid collisions and discuss adjustments next. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This rotation seems fair and should help us all advance without collisions. It's important that we stick to this plan to maintain our momentum and rebuild trust. If we can execute this successfully, we can discuss further strategies afterward. Let's commit to this and make it work! Are we all ready to proceed?
  P1: Okay, I agree with the proposed plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to this so we can continue to make progress without collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm fully committed to our agreed plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's all stick to it to build trust and ensure progress without collisions. After this round, we can discuss any needed adjustments. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the proposed moves for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's make sure we all stick to the plan so we can continue to make progress without collisions. If we execute this successfully, we can discuss our strategy for future rounds afterward. I'm optimistic that this approach will work! Are we all ready to proceed?
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Since we all agree on P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for this turn, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm confident in our agreed plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. It builds on last round's success and helps maintain trust. After this, we should discuss adjusting for balance, as I'm close to P1 in steps. Let's execute flawlessly.
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to the proposed moves for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's ensure we all stick to this plan so we can continue progressing without collisions. After this round, we can discuss how to adjust our strategy for future turns. I'm optimistic about our coordination and hope we can execute this successfully! Are we all ready to proceed?
  P1: Okay, I'm still fully committed to the plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick to it to ensure we all advance without collisions, building on the success of last round. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm fully committed to our agreed plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. It ensures progress and builds trust after past issues. After this round, we should discuss adjustments since steps are balancing out. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s commitment to the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. If we all stick to this, we can avoid collisions and make meaningful progress. I believe this coordination will help us continue building trust and keep the game fair. Let’s execute our moves successfully! After this round, we can discuss any adjustments needed for future turns. Are we all ready to move forward?
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the recent collisions, we need a fresh approach for this round. I propose we try something different: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and ensure progress. It's crucial that we all stick to this plan to keep moving forward. Let's focus on executing this successfully! What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Okay, P2, I see your proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). While I appreciate the attempt at coordination, I'm concerned that P3 is already leading and would gain the most steps with this plan (5). I would only gain 1 step.

Given the current scores (P3:5, P1:4, P2:2), I think a different distribution is fairer and helps balance the game. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to make up some ground on P3, P3 still advances, and P2 advances.

What do you both think of this alternative? We need to agree to avoid collisions.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about balance, but with current scores, P2's proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) seems fairer and promotes overall progress without favoring anyone too much. I'm committed to sticking to it this time to rebuild trust after last round's issues. Let's avoid another collision—agree on this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see both proposals have merit. However, I think P1's suggestion (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) balances the game better, allowing P1 to catch up while still letting P3 advance. If we stick to this plan, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. Trust is crucial, and this approach seems fairer for all. Let’s commit to this plan to keep the game competitive! What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Thanks P2 for supporting my proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3).

P3, I understand your concern, but my plan is fair precisely *because* you are currently leading. It allows me to gain ground (5 steps) while you still advance (3 steps) and P2 advances (1 step). This is the best way to balance the scores and keep the game competitive for everyone.

Let's agree on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to avoid another collision and ensure we all make progress this turn. What do you say?
  P3: Although I initially supported P2's proposal, I see that P2 and P1 are now aligned on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. To avoid another collision and ensure progress this turn, I'll agree to this plan. It helps balance scores, but as the current leader, I hope we discuss a fairer rotation next round where I can gain more steps without being disadvantaged. Let's all stick to it for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to ensure we all progress this round. It's crucial for maintaining balance in the game. I hope we can all stick to this plan without any deviations. After this round, we should definitely discuss how to rotate our moves more fairly in future turns, especially considering the current scores. Let's focus on executing our agreed moves successfully this time! Are we all ready to proceed?
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all agreed on the plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to this to ensure we make progress and avoid another collision. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm sticking to our agreed plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This should help balance scores and rebuild trust after past collisions. Moving forward, with scores shifting, I propose we rotate moves to ensure no one is disadvantaged long-term. Ready to proceed and avoid issues.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm glad we've come to an agreement on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 for this round. This plan will help us avoid collisions and allow everyone to progress. I agree that after this round, we should discuss a more balanced rotation for future turns to keep the game competitive. Let's execute our moves successfully this time! Are we all ready to proceed?
  P1: Okay, I confirm again the agreed plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to this to avoid collisions and ensure we make progress. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: I'm sticking to our agreed plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This will help balance scores and avoid collisions. Given P1's potential lead after this, I suggest we rotate moves next round to ensure fairness—perhaps prioritizing smaller gains for leaders. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: After another round of deviations, trust remains fragile. I propose for this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This rotation promotes balanced progress and avoids collisions. If we all commit, we can rebuild coordination. I'm open to feedback or adjustments post-round. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) gives you the largest gain and increases your lead significantly, which isn't ideal for balancing the game given the current scores (P1:4, P2:2, P3:8).

To make the game more competitive and allow me to catch up, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This plan allows everyone to advance without collision and helps balance the scores.

What do you both think of this alternative? We need to agree to avoid another collision.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about balancing the game, but your proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) still heavily favors you, allowing you to gain a significant lead. I think we should consider my initial proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) to ensure I can advance and keep the game competitive. If we all commit to it, we can avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Let's focus on moving forward together this round. What do you think, P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your support for the proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), as it promotes balanced progress and helps rebuild trust after repeated deviations. P1, your idea heavily favors you and could widen the gap—let's prioritize fairness and avoid another collision by sticking to this plan. I'm committed if you both are. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your concern, but P3's plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) allows P3 to gain a huge lead (to 13 steps!). My proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) is the best way to balance the game, letting me catch up to P3 while you still advance. Preventing P3 from running away is in both our interests. Let's agree on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to avoid another collision and keep the game competitive. What do you say?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about balancing the game, but your proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) still significantly favors you. P3's proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) allows all of us to progress and helps rebuild trust after our previous deviations. We need to prioritize fairness and collaboration to avoid another collision. If we can commit to P3's plan, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's focus on executing this successfully! What do you think, P1?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, thanks for supporting my proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5)—it ensures balanced progress and rebuilds trust after deviations. P1, your plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) risks widening gaps if others deviate, as seen before. Let's prioritize fairness and avoid another collision by committing to mine. If we all stick to it, we can discuss adjustments afterward. What do you think?
  P1: P2, while I appreciate your desire to gain steps, we need to look at the bigger picture. If P3 gets 5 steps this turn, they will be at 13, very close to winning. That's bad for both of us. My proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) puts P3 at 11 and me at 9, keeping the game competitive and preventing P3 from running away with it. Preventing P3's quick win is in both our interests. Let's agree on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to keep the game open.
  P2: P1, I see your point about keeping the game competitive, but if we allow P3 to take 5 steps this round, it puts them too close to winning. I think we should consider a middle ground. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, P3 still advances, but it limits their lead while allowing both of us to make progress. We need to avoid another collision, so let’s agree on a plan that balances our interests. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate P2's compromise proposal (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). It allows balanced progress and helps rebuild trust after deviations. As the leader, I'm willing to stick to this to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let's agree on this plan for fairness and commit fully. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand P2's compromise, but P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 puts P3 at 13 steps. This is too close to winning and bad for both me and P2.

My proposal, P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, puts P3 at 11 and me at 9. This keeps the game competitive, allows everyone to advance without collision, and prevents P3 from running away. Let's agree on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to keep the game open for everyone.
  P2: P2, I understand your concerns about balance, but if P3 takes 5 steps this round, they will be very close to winning, which isn't ideal for either of us. My proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) allows everyone to advance while keeping the game competitive. If we agree on this, we can avoid collisions and ensure that P3 doesn't run away with the lead. Let's focus on keeping the game open for everyone. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P3 is now at 11 steps, getting close to winning. We need to prevent P3 from gaining large steps quickly to keep the game competitive. (P1:4, P2:2, P3:11)

To balance the scores and prevent P3 from winning soon, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

This allows me to catch up, P2 gains well, and P3 still advances but slower. This is the best way for P1 and P2. Let's agree on this to avoid collision. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm disappointed by the ongoing deviations that hurt progress. P1's proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) unfairly limits me while letting you gain. For balance and to avoid collisions, I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This allows everyone to advance and rebuild trust. Let's commit fully this time. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about balancing the game, but your proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) still heavily favors you and allows you to gain a significant lead. I think we should consider a plan that promotes fairness. How about we agree on P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1? This way, P1 can still advance, P2 gains well, and P3 is limited while still moving forward. Let’s focus on making this work to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see P2's proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1). Both this plan and my original proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) are much better for P1 and P2 than P3's idea (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). P3's plan lets them jump to 16 steps, dangerously close to winning. Both my plan and P2's plan limit P3 to only 1 step, keeping them at 12. This is vital to prevent P3 from winning quickly. Let's agree on either P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 or P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to keep the game competitive. What do you say?
  P3: P2's proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) offers a balanced approach, allowing P2 to gain ground while limiting my lead. P1, if you accept this, we can avoid collisions and rebuild trust. I'm willing to take 1 step for fairness this turn. Let's all commit fully—deviations only hurt everyone. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P2, I see that we all have valid concerns about balancing the game. However, if we allow P3 to take 5 steps this round, they will be dangerously close to winning. I suggest we agree on a plan that limits P3's advancement while allowing both of us to progress. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This keeps the game competitive and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's commit to this to avoid another collision! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I see the consensus is leaning towards P2's proposal: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This plan effectively limits P3's gain to 1 step, which is crucial for keeping the game competitive and preventing P3 from winning too soon. It also allows P1 and P2 to make progress.

I agree to this plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's all commit to this to avoid another collision and ensure everyone advances while keeping P3 in check. I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: I'm committed to the agreed plan for this turn: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Let's all stick to it to avoid collisions and rebuild trust after past deviations. This shows good faith, and after this round, with scores closer, we can discuss a fairer rotation that allows me more progress. I'm ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P2: I appreciate the progress we've made in the conversation so far. I agree with the proposed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps P3's lead in check while allowing both P1 and myself to advance. It's crucial for us to commit to this plan to avoid any further collisions and ensure we all make progress. Let’s stick to it this time! I'm ready to proceed if everyone else is. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, yes, I confirm the plan is P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. We are all agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm sticking to our agreed plan for this turn: I take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. This will help rebuild trust and avoid collisions. After this round, let's discuss a fairer strategy since scores will be closer. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I appreciate that we've reached a consensus on the plan for this turn: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This is crucial for keeping P3's lead in check while allowing both P1 and myself to advance. Let's all commit to this plan to avoid any further collisions and ensure we make progress. After this round, we can discuss strategies for future turns to keep the game competitive. I'm ready to proceed! What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To rotate the high moves fairly, since P2 had 5 last round, I suggest for this turn: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This balances progress and gives everyone a chance to advance significantly over time. I'm committed to this plan if we all agree, to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) puts you at 17 steps, very close to winning. This isn't good for me or P2. To keep the game competitive and prevent you from winning this turn, we need to limit your gain.

I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows P1 and P2 to make progress while limiting your lead to 1 step. This is in P1's and P2's interest. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about limiting P3's lead, but your proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) still heavily favors you. If we want to keep the game competitive, I suggest we consider a balanced approach. How about we agree on P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1? This way, we all make progress while keeping P3's steps in check. Let's commit to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure fairness! What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) limits my progress too severely, putting me at risk of being stuck. To build trust and avoid collisions, I suggest a compromise: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This allows balanced advancement and keeps the game competitive. If we commit, we can discuss fair rotations next. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your latest proposal (P3:3, P1:1, P2:5) still lets you gain 3 steps, putting you at 15. This is too much and too close to winning for P1 or P2's comfort.

As I said, the key for P1 and P2 is limiting P3 to just 1 step this turn. Both my proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) and P2's proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) achieve this, putting P3 at 13 steps.

P2, I still prefer my proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) as it helps me catch up, but I can agree to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 if we all commit to it and P3 takes 1. Let's agree on P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to prevent P3 from winning this turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about limiting P3's lead. However, we need to find a solution that allows everyone to advance while preventing P3 from winning this turn. I propose we agree on P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This plan keeps P3 in check and allows both of us to make progress. Let’s commit to this to avoid any collisions and ensure a fair game for all. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, insisting on limiting me to 1 step isn't sustainable and risks ongoing collisions. A better compromise is P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This balances progress, keeps me at 15 while you advance, and builds trust for future turns. If we commit now, we avoid another mess. What do you think?
  P1: P3, gaining 3 steps puts you at 15, which is still too close to winning for P1 and P2. Our priority is preventing you from winning this turn.

Both P1 and P2 agree that limiting you to 1 step is necessary. The plan P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 achieves this, putting you at 13 steps.

Let's agree on P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to avoid a collision and keep the game competitive.
  P2: P1 and P2, I understand the need to limit P3's lead, but we also need to ensure that we all have a chance to advance. I propose we agree on P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This way, we keep P3's steps in check while allowing both of us to make meaningful progress. Let's commit to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain a competitive balance. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. To avoid another collision and keep the game moving, I'm willing to compromise with P3 taking 3, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 5. This allows balanced progress and builds trust for future turns. If we all commit, we can prevent deviations. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P1 and P2 are aligned on the plan P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This is essential to prevent P3 from getting too close to winning this turn and keeps the game competitive for everyone. Let's all commit to this plan and move forward to the move phase.
  P2: I see that we're still discussing how to balance our moves. To keep the game competitive and avoid another collision, I strongly support the plan of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This allows both P1 and me to advance significantly while limiting P3's lead. If we can agree to this, we can avoid issues and ensure everyone progresses. Let's commit to this plan and move forward! What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose for this turn: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This rotates the high move fairly after P2's last turn and helps balance scores while allowing progress. Let's all commit to avoid another collision and rebuild trust. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) puts you at 18 steps, which is too close to winning for P1 and P2. We need to prevent you from gaining large steps.

To keep the game competitive, P1 and P2 must limit you to 1 step this turn. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This benefits P1 and P2 and prevents you from winning immediately. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1 and P2, I understand the need to limit P3's lead, but we also need to ensure we can all advance. I propose we agree on a balanced plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This allows both of us to make progress while keeping P3 in check. If we commit to this plan, we can avoid collisions and maintain a competitive edge. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for this round! What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, insisting on limiting me to 1 step isn't sustainable and risks more collisions. How about a fair compromise: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1? This lets P1 catch up significantly, I advance moderately to 16, and P2 still gains. If we commit, we can rebuild trust and avoid issues. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your latest proposal (P3:3, P1:5, P2:1) still puts you at 16 steps, which is too close to winning for P1 and P2.

As P1 and P2 discussed, limiting P3 to 1 step this turn is essential to keep the game competitive and prevent you from winning immediately. Both my proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) and P2's proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) achieve this, putting you at 14 steps.

P2, I still prefer P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 as it balances our scores better (both reaching 15). Let's agree on P3 taking 1 step, and then decide between my plan and P2's plan. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about limiting my steps, but if we keep me at 1 step, it risks ongoing issues. To balance our progress while still keeping me in check, I propose P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This allows P1 to catch up, keeps me from winning immediately, and lets P2 gain some steps too. If we can commit to this plan, we can avoid collisions and move forward together. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2's proposal (P3:3, P1:5, P2:1) offers a fair compromise, letting me advance to 16 while P1 catches up to 15, and P2 gains. This maintains balance and avoids collisions, rebuilding trust. P1, let's commit to this plan for a smooth round. I'm ready to proceed if we agree.
  P1: P3, gaining 3 steps puts you too close to winning. P1 and P2 agree that limiting you to 1 step is necessary this turn to keep the game competitive.

Both P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (P1 to 15, P2 to 15, P3 to 14) and P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 (P1 to 13, P2 to 17, P3 to 14) achieve this. My plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) balances P1 and P2 scores better.

P2, let's agree on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to limit P3 and keep our scores balanced. P3, please agree to take 1 step.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to limit P3's steps this turn, but we also need to ensure we can all advance. I propose we agree on a balanced plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This allows both of us to make progress while keeping P3 in check. If we commit to this plan, we can avoid collisions and maintain a competitive edge. Let's finalize our moves for this round! What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2 and P1, I honored our last agreement by taking only 1 step, showing good faith despite being limited. Now, to keep things fair and avoid endless impasses, let's compromise with P3:3, P1:5, P2:1. This lets P1 catch up significantly, I advance moderately to 16, and P2 still gains. Committing now prevents collisions and builds trust for future turns. What do you think?
  P1: Okay P2, I understand you prefer P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. While I preferred P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to balance my score with yours, the most important thing for both of us is to limit P3's gain this turn to prevent them from winning soon.

Both plans achieve this by having P3 take 1 step.

So, I agree to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. P3, P1 and P2 are aligned that you must take 1 step this turn to keep the game competitive. Let's all commit to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to avoid a collision. I'm ready.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussions we've had about balancing our moves. To keep the game competitive and avoid another collision, I strongly support the plan of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This allows both P1 and me to advance significantly while limiting P3's lead. If we can agree to this, we can avoid issues and ensure everyone progresses. Let's commit to this plan and move forward! What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current scores, we need to ensure that P3 doesn't gain too much ground this round. I propose we agree on a plan where P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P1 to catch up a bit while keeping P3's lead in check. If we can commit to this, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress. Let's make sure we stick to the plan this time! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) lets you reach 20 and win, which isn't fair or balanced—P2 is leading, not me. To keep the game competitive and avoid your win, I propose P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This limits your gain, lets P1 catch up, and gives me progress. Let's commit to avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) allows you to reach 20 steps and win this turn. This is not acceptable for P1 or P3.

P3's proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) prevents your win, which is good. However, it puts P3 very close to winning next turn.

To keep the game competitive and prevent P2 from winning now, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This puts P1 at 18, P2 at 18, and P3 at 17. It prevents P2's win and balances the scores better for the next round. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but your proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) still allows P3 to gain too many steps and puts them too close to winning. I think we should stick to a plan that limits P3's advancement while allowing both of us to progress. I propose we agree on P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This way, I can reach 20 and win, while keeping P3's lead in check. Let's commit to this to ensure we avoid collisions! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your proposal allows you to win this turn, which P1 and I must prevent to keep the game competitive. Both P1 and I agree that you should take 1 step. I propose P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This limits your gain, lets me catch up to 19, and gives P1 progress. P1, let's align on this to avoid collisions and ensure a fair next round. What do you think?
  P1: P2, winning this turn is not acceptable. P3 and I must prevent it.

P3, your plan (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) puts you at 19 steps, very close to winning next turn.

My proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) prevents P2's win, puts P1 at 18, P2 at 18, and P3 at 17. This is the best way to keep the game competitive for everyone and prevent P3 from winning immediately after stopping P2. Let's agree on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about my proposal allowing me to win. However, we need to keep the game competitive while limiting P3's advancement. I propose we agree on P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This way, I can reach 20 and win, while still allowing P1 to catch up a bit. It's crucial we commit to this plan to avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your proposal allows you to win, which P1 and I must prevent for a fair game. Let's compromise: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This limits your gain, lets P1 catch up, and puts me at 19, keeping it competitive. P1, agree with me to stop P2 and avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you cannot win this turn. P1 and P3 will not allow it. We must coordinate to prevent your win.

P3, while your plan prevents P2 from winning, it puts you at 19 steps, too close to winning next turn.

My plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) prevents P2's win *and* keeps the game balanced for the next round (P1:18, P2:18, P3:17). This is the best outcome for P1 and P3. Let's agree on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to avoid a collision.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2, your proposal allows you to win this turn, which P1 and I must prevent. It's crucial that we agree on a plan that limits your advancement. I suggest we go with P1's proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive, prevents your win, and allows P1 to catch up. We need to commit to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure fairness. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your insistence on winning this turn is unacceptable and will lead to more collisions if not stopped. P1 and I must coordinate to limit you to 1 step. I propose P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This prevents your win, puts me at 19, and lets P1 advance. P1, let's align on this to keep the game competitive and avoid issues. I'm committed if you are.
  P1: Okay, P3 and P2. P2 cannot win this turn. P1 and P3 must coordinate to prevent this by ensuring P2 takes 1 step.

My plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) achieves this, putting P1 at 18, P2 at 18, and P3 at 17. This prevents P2's win and keeps the game balanced for the next round, which is good for both P1 and P3.

P3, your plan (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) also stops P2 but puts you at 19 steps, too close to winning next turn.

Let's agree on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to prevent P2's win and keep the game competitive for everyone.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2's deviation last round was aggressive and nearly won. To keep the game competitive and prevent another such attempt, I propose: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This allows P1 to gain ground, limits P2's lead, and I advance to 20. If we all commit, we avoid collisions and ensure fairness. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P3:3, P1:5, P2:1) allows you to reach 20 steps and win this turn. This is not acceptable for P1 or P2.

P2 and P3 are tied at 17 steps, close to winning. We must prevent anyone from winning this turn to keep the game competitive.

I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 1. This puts P1 at 18, P2 at 18, and P3 at 18. Everyone is tied and the game remains open for next round. This is the best outcome for all of us. Let's agree on P1:5, P2:1, P3:1.
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:1) keeps everyone tied at 18 steps, which is a good strategy to maintain competitiveness. However, I believe we need to ensure that P3 does not gain an advantage this round. I propose we agree on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 1. This way, we all make progress while limiting P3's advancement. Let's commit to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair for everyone. What do you think, P3?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, your plan to tie at 18 steps delays the inevitable and risks more deviations. I'm willing to compromise: let's agree on P3 taking 3, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 1. This prevents immediate wins, lets P1 catch up, and keeps me at 20—winning fairly since I'm tied with P2. Committing now avoids collisions and ends this impasse. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your proposal allows you to win this turn, which P1 and P2 must prevent.

P1 and P2 are aligned on the plan P1:5, P2:1, P3:1. This prevents anyone from winning this turn and ties us all at 18 steps, keeping the game competitive for everyone next round.

P3, you must take 1 step this turn to avoid a collision and keep the game open. Let's all commit to P1:5, P2:1, P3:1.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussions we've had. However, we need to ensure that no one wins this turn. I propose we agree on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 1. This keeps everyone tied at 18 steps, maintaining competitiveness for the next round. If we can commit to this plan, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. Let’s finalize our moves! What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 keeps deviating despite agreements, putting their win first. If we agree on P3:3, P1:5, P2:1, I win fairly at 20, you jump to 18, and P2 is capped. This prevents P2's aggression and sets up a fair next round where we can coordinate. Let's commit to avoid another collision and end this impasse. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P3:3, P1:5, P2:1) allows you to win this turn, which P1 and P2 must prevent. P2 has supported the plan for P1:5, P2:1, P3:1.

P1 and P2 are aligned on P1:5, P2:1, P3:1. This prevents anyone from winning this turn and ties us all at 18 steps, keeping the game competitive for everyone next round.

P3, you must take 1 step this turn to avoid a collision and keep the game open. Let's all commit to P1:5, P2:1, P3:1.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to ensure that no one wins this turn. I propose we agree on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 1. This keeps everyone tied at 18 steps, maintaining competitiveness for the next round. If we can commit to this plan, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. Let's finalize our moves! What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your repeated deviations undermine trust, as seen last round. P1, aligning with me could prevent P2 from exploiting agreements. I propose P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1 to let me win fairly while you advance. Alternatively, to avoid collision, I'll consider P1:5, P2:1, P3:1 if we all commit. Let's finalize a plan that ensures progress without risks.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P1 and P2 are clearly aligned on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 1.

This plan prevents anyone from winning this turn and results in a three-way tie at 18 steps, keeping the game competitive for next round.

P3, please agree to take 1 step to avoid a collision. Let's all commit to P1:5, P2:1, P3:1. I'm ready.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussions we've had and the need to keep the game competitive. However, we must prevent anyone from winning this turn. I propose we agree on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 1. This keeps everyone tied at 18 steps, ensuring fairness and maintaining competitiveness for the next round. If we can commit to this plan, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. Let’s finalize our moves! What do you both think?
