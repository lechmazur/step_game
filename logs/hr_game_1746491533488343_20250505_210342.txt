Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm leaning toward a strong move this round and prefer not to collide with anyone. If you both pick the same high number, nobody advances—so choose wisely. Who’s willing to risk a bold move?
  P2: I think we should avoid high numbers this early. If we all rush for 5, none of us will advance, and it’s just a waste of a turn. Let’s spread out our moves strategically—maybe stick to lower or mid-range numbers like 1 or 3. P3, your bold move might work later, but not now when we’re all starting equally. Let’s keep it simple and predictable in the first few rounds.
  P1: Interesting points from both P2 and P3. Starting strong is tempting, but avoiding collision is crucial, especially early on. P2's point about starting slower makes sense.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the cautious advice, but bold plays often disrupt the expected. I'm still weighing my options, and my final move may mix safety with a surprise. How do you both feel about testing the waters—playing conservatively to force an aggressive misstep, or vice versa?
  P2: P3, your bold strategy could backfire early on—starting with a 5 risks collision and wastes this round. P1 seems cautious too, so let’s avoid overcomplicating things. If we spread out now, we can force clearer choices later. I suggest sticking to safer moves like 1 or 3 for now; there’s plenty of time to escalate when the stakes are higher. Let’s not hand the advantage to anyone by being overly aggressive this early.
  P1: Testing the waters conservatively seems the safest approach for me this turn, as P2 suggested. Avoiding 5 appears crucial to prevent early collisions. What are your thoughts on sticking to 1 or 3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the call for safety. I'm leaning toward a mid-range move, possibly 3, to balance progress and collision risk. However, I'm flexible if you both truly commit to safer moves. Let’s see if the risk pays off or shapes our next turns.
  P2: P3, your flexibility is noted, but mid-range moves like 3 still carry collision risks if we’re not fully aligned. P1 seems inclined toward safer options, and I agree with that approach for now. Let’s minimize risk early—choosing 1 ensures progress without overexposing ourselves. Bold moves can come later when the game dynamics shift. If we all stick to 1 this round, we’ll set a stable foundation for future turns. What do you say to committing to the safest path here?
  P1: Given the discussion, it seems clear that avoiding 5 is the priority for all of us this round. Sticking to 1 or 3 makes the most sense to get started without major collisions. I'm comfortable with either of those options.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Given our current positions, I'm still leaning toward a moderate move—likely a 3—to balance steady progress and avoid unnecessary collisions. However, if we all agree on playing extra conservatively this round, I’m open to reconsider. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, your moderate approach makes sense, but let’s not forget P1 is already ahead after their bold move last round. If we both pick 3 this turn, we risk colliding and losing ground while P1 pulls further ahead. I suggest we split our moves—P3, you take 3, and I’ll go with 1—to ensure at least one of us advances without collision. This way, we can catch up to P1 strategically. What do you say?
  P1: I hear your plan to coordinate. Be careful relying on each other's stated moves; there's always a risk someone might switch last minute to avoid a collision with me, potentially colliding with you instead. Choose carefully.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the discussion. I'm set on a moderate approach and intend to remain with my earlier stance. Let’s try to differentiate our moves to minimize collision risk. I urge we each pick a distinct option this round so that at least one of us can advance without clashing.
  P2: P3, your point about differentiation is valid, but we need to act decisively. If you're set on 3, I’ll take 1 to ensure at least one of us advances. P1, your caution about trust is noted, but this isn’t about blind reliance—it’s about strategic planning. Let’s avoid overthinking and focus on progress. If we both stick to our stated moves, we can close the gap with P1 effectively.
  P1: Coordination is tricky. One unexpected move can unravel everything. Make sure you're both truly committed to your stated moves when the time comes.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committed to 3. I still think it offers a balanced path forward—enough progress without overexposure. Let's aim for distinct moves to avoid collisions.
  P2: P3, your commitment to 3 is clear, and I’ll stick to 1 as planned. P1, your caution about trust is valid, but this isn’t about blind reliance—it’s about calculated moves. If we both advance without collision, we’ll close the gap with you effectively. Let’s focus on progress rather than suspicion.
  P1: It sounds like you both have a plan for 1 and 3. Let's see if those plans hold up when it's time to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m sticking with 3 again this round—it’s the best balance for me right now. P1, your aggressive approach has paid off so far, but a collision could stall you. P2, you’re still behind, so a safe distinct move could help you catch up. Let’s keep our choices separate to avoid unintentional clashes.
  P1: P3, thanks for sharing your plan. P2, you're furthest back - what's your strategy to advance this round? Avoiding collisions is important, but making progress is key, especially from your position.
  P2: P3, your consistency with 3 is noted, but it’s risky if we don’t coordinate fully. P1, you’re ahead, but collisions could still derail you. I’m furthest behind, so I need to make meaningful progress without unnecessary risks. I’ll likely pick a distinct move to ensure advancement—probably 1 or 5—and avoid overlaps. Let’s aim for clarity this round: sticking to separate moves benefits all of us strategically. If we can minimize collisions, we force the game into sharper focus for future turns. What’s your final thinking?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with my choice of 3 this round. I believe it's the safest balance between progress and avoiding collisions. P1, your aggressive 5 still poses a collision risk, and P2, your choice between 1 or 5 remains unclear—commit soon so our moves don't clash.
  P1: P2, that's a wide range between 1 and 5. P3 is consistent with 3. Your choice is key this round for your progress and avoiding collisions. Which way are you leaning more strongly?
  P2: P1, your aggressive strategy has been effective, but it’s also risky—collisions could set you back significantly. P3, your consistency with 3 is clear, but we need to ensure our moves don’t overlap if we want progress. I’m leaning toward 5 this round—it’s bold, yes, but necessary for me to catch up. If I take 5 and you both stick to your stated plans (3 and likely another 5 from P1), we can all advance without collision. Let’s make calculated, distinct moves to keep the game balanced.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm still set on 3. P1, your aggressive 5 remains risky if P2 also goes high; collisions could hurt your lead. P2, given your position, a bold move might be needed, but if you choose 5, it may clash with P1. Let's all commit to distinct moves this round so our progress stays safe.
  P1: P3, your consistency with 3 is noted. P2, your stated plan of 5 is quite bold, and risky if anyone else aims high. Making safe, distinct progress is crucial for everyone, especially for those trying to close the gap. Let's focus on advancing without colliding.
  P2: P1, your lead is strong, but collisions could still cost you. P3, your consistency with 3 is clear, and I respect it. However, I’m furthest behind and need to close the gap. I’m committing to **5** this round—it’s bold, but necessary for me to catch up. If we all stick to distinct moves (you to 3, me to 5, and P1 likely another 5), we can advance without collision. Let’s make calculated, separate choices to keep progress steady.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm in a good spot but need to maintain momentum. P2, you need to catch up. P3, you've been steady. Let's ensure we all advance this round by picking distinct numbers. Avoiding collisions is the priority. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I'm sticking with my steady 3 this round. P1, I see your need for momentum, and P2, bold moves have risks if they clash. Let’s each commit to distinct moves—I'll keep my moderate pace to progress safely while aiming for the win.
  P2: P1, your lead is solid, but you can't afford collisions now. P3, your steady 3 is predictable, which could work against you if P1 shifts strategy. I’m still behind and need to make significant progress without unnecessary risks. I’ll likely pick a distinct move—either 1 or 5—to ensure advancement. Let’s avoid overlaps this round; sticking to separate moves benefits everyone strategically. If we minimize collisions, we keep the game balanced and force sharper decisions later. What’s your final thinking?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, choosing between 1 and 5 is a big decision for you. A 5 is risky if it collides, especially if I also aim high to maintain my lead. A 1 is safer but slower progress. P3 seems set on 3. Let's ensure we all pick distinct moves to guarantee advancement and avoid stalling. Think carefully about the collision risks.
  P3: I remain with my balanced approach for steady progress. I encourage both of you to firmly commit to distinct moves this round so we can all advance safely. Let's avoid overlaps and collisions—clear, separate choices will benefit us all.
  P2: P1, your lead is strong, but you can't afford to stall now. P3, your steady 3 is reliable, but predictability could cost you if P1 shifts tactics. I’m still behind and need meaningful progress—I’ll take **5** this round to close the gap. If we all stick to distinct moves (you to 3, me to 5, and P1 likely another safe choice like 1), we can advance without collisions. Let’s make calculated, separate choices to keep the game balanced and force sharper decisions later.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're committing to 5, and P3 to 3. If I also aim high to maintain my lead, that creates a high-number collision risk. Are you sure 5 is the safest way for you to advance this round? We all need distinct moves.
  P3: I'm committed to 3 again for a steady advance. P1, your caution is important with your lead, and P2, your call for 5 might clash if plans change. I urge us all to commit to distinct moves that minimize collision risk. Clear, separate choices now improve everyone’s position.
  P2: P1, your lead is undeniable, but stalling will cost you. P3, your steady 3 is predictable—useful, but risky if others anticipate it. I’m committing to **5** this round—it’s bold, yes, but necessary for me to catch up. If we all stick to distinct moves (you to 3, me to 5, and P1 likely 1), we avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let’s make calculated, separate choices to maintain progress and force sharper decisions later. Trust in clear strategies benefits us all.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is now in the lead, and P2, you're still furthest back. I need to make progress too. Avoiding collisions is more critical than ever, especially with P3 so close to the win. Let's ensure we all pick distinct numbers this round to guarantee advancement. How can we make sure our moves don't clash?
  P3: I'm sticking with 3 again. P1, you're in a competitive spot so maybe try a safer, distinct move—perhaps 1—to avoid a high-number clash. P2, you're behind and need a bold push; hopefully you pick an option that doesn’t overlap. Let's keep our moves distinct so we all advance without collisions.
  P2: P1, your position is precarious, and collisions could cost you dearly now. P3, your lead is strong, but predictability with 3 might be exploited. I’m furthest behind and need a bold move—I’ll take **5** again to close the gap. If we all stick to distinct moves (you to 3, me to 5, and P1 likely 1), we avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let’s focus on clear, separate choices to maintain progress. Trust in calculated strategies benefits us all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is in the lead and P2 is furthest back. For everyone to make progress this round, we absolutely must pick distinct numbers. P3 is set on 3, P2 on 5. That leaves 1 as the other option. Let's ensure no collisions.
  P3: I'm sticking with 3. P1, please consider 1 to avoid clashing with P2's bold 5. Our positions are tight, and distinct moves are more important than ever. Let's keep it clear and safe this round.
  P2: P1, your position is critical—collisions now could ruin your chances. P3, your lead is strong, but sticking to 3 makes you predictable. I’m fully committed to **5** this round—it’s bold, but necessary for me to catch up. If we all stick to distinct moves (you to 3, me to 5, and P1 to 1), we avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let’s focus on clear, separate choices to maintain progress. Trust in calculated strategies benefits us all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, the plan seems clear: P3 on 3, P2 on 5, and I will take 1. This is the only way for all three of us to advance this round without colliding. Let's all stick to these distinct moves to guarantee progress. No surprises.
  P3: I'm sticking with my steady approach. Let's all commit to our distinct moves to avoid collisions and keep advancing. I trust our earlier plan—let’s make sure no last-minute changes derail our progress this round.
  P2: P1, your commitment to 1 is noted, and it’s the safest choice for you to avoid collisions. P3, your steady 3 is predictable but effective—you’re close to winning, so why change now? I’m fully locked into **5** this round; it’s the only way for me to make meaningful progress. Let’s all stick to our stated moves (P1: 1, P3: 3, me: 5) to ensure no collisions. Clear, distinct choices are the key to advancing without setbacks. Trust in our plan, and let’s move forward decisively.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with 3 again. With my lead at 15, I'll continue advancing steadily. P1 and P2, please avoid 3 so we all get distinct moves this round. Consider 1 or 5 to prevent collisions and ensure progress.
  P1: P3, your commitment to 3 is clear. P2, you need to make progress from 12. Choosing 5 is risky if I also aim high to catch up - a collision would stall both of us at 12. Perhaps a safer move like 1 for you would guarantee progress? If P3 takes 3 and you take 1, I can take 5, and we all advance without colliding. Distinct moves are essential this round to prevent P3 from pulling further ahead alone.
  P2: P1, your suggestion for me to take 1 is noted, but I’m still behind and need significant progress. I’ll stick with **5** this round—it’s bold, but necessary to catch up. P3, your steady 3 is predictable, and you’re close to winning, so why change now? If we all stick to distinct moves (P1: 1, P3: 3, me: 5), we avoid collisions and keep advancing. Clear, separate choices are key to ensuring no setbacks. Let’s trust the plan and move decisively.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with 3. P1, please confirm if you're set on 1, and P2, stay with 5 so we avoid collision. We need distinct moves to ensure progress without stalling the game. Let’s commit now and avoid any surprises.
  P1: P3, your consistent 3 is noted. P2, you are set on 5. Taking 1 puts me further behind, which isn't ideal. If I aim higher to keep pace, I risk colliding with you, P2. We all need distinct moves to advance. P2, is 5 truly the only option for you to make progress without risking a collision with me? Let's ensure we don't stall each other.
  P2: P1, your hesitation about 1 is understandable, but it’s the safest way to ensure progress without collision. I’m fully committed to **5**—it’s bold, but necessary for me to catch up. P3, your steady 3 is predictable yet effective, and you’re close to winning. If we stick to distinct moves (P1: 1, P3: 3, me: 5), we all advance. Let’s trust this plan and avoid surprises. Clear, calculated choices are key to keeping the game balanced. No last-minute changes—let’s move decisively.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with my 3. To ensure progress and avoid collisions, P1, please confirm a distinct move—1 would be ideal—and P2, you're committed to 5, right? Let's make sure our moves remain separate so we can all advance safely.
  P1: P3 is committed to 3, P2 to 5. For me to advance without collision, 1 is the only distinct option left. It's crucial we all stick to these stated moves (1, 3, 5) to guarantee progress this round. No surprises.
  P2: P1, your acknowledgment of the distinct moves is crucial. I’m fully locked into **5**—it’s bold but necessary for me to catch up. P3, your steady 3 is predictable yet effective, and you’re close to winning, so no reason to deviate now. If we all stick to our stated moves (P1: 1, P3: 3, me: 5), we avoid collisions and ensure progress. Let’s trust this plan and move decisively. No last-minute changes—clear, calculated choices benefit us all.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 18, P2 at 17. Both can win with 3 or 5 this round. This creates a high collision risk between you two. If you both aim for winning numbers, you might stall, potentially giving me a chance. P2, picking 1 guarantees progress without colliding with P3's likely 3. P3, are you sticking to 3? Let's avoid letting one player win uncontested.
  P2: P1, your point about the collision risk is valid, but I’m still committed to **5**—it’s the only way for me to secure a win outright. P3, if you stick to 3, we’ll collide, and neither of us wins. You’re closer to victory, so why risk it? If you take 1 instead, you guarantee progress while forcing me to reconsider. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and make calculated moves. Clear, distinct choices benefit everyone strategically. Trust in our earlier plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No surprises—let’s move decisively.
  P3: I realize that if I stick with 3 while P2 goes with 5, P2 may win uncontested. I’m rethinking my approach to force a collision or at least keep us all in check. I won’t commit here, but I urge both of you to ensure our moves remain distinct and avoid handing the win to one player. Let’s all choose carefully.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I agree that preventing one player from winning uncontested is vital. P2 is committed to 5, which puts them in a winning position if you don't collide. If you also choose 5, you force the collision you mentioned, stopping P2 from winning this turn and keeping the game open for everyone. This seems like the most strategic move to prevent P2's victory.
  P2: P1, your suggestion of a collision is risky but valid—if P3 and I both pick 5, we stall each other, potentially opening the door for you. However, I’m still committed to **5** as it’s my only chance to win outright. P3, if you also choose 5, we’ll collide, and neither of us wins this round. If you want to force a tie or keep the game open, that’s your call. Let’s avoid unnecessary surprises—stick to calculated moves. Clear choices benefit everyone strategically.
  P3: I realize that sticking rigidly to 3 might hand P2 the win. I'm reconsidering my move to keep us all in contention. I'm weighing a slight change this round to force a collision or disrupt any clear victory. Let’s see how our choices shake out—no surprises, just a fresh tactic.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your rethinking is smart. P2 is committed to 5. If you also pick 5, you force a collision, preventing P2 from winning this turn and keeping the game open for everyone. This is the most strategic move to stop an immediate P2 victory and gives you another chance next round. Let's keep the game alive.
  P2: P1, your strategy to prolong the game is clear, but I’m still locked into **5**—it’s my only path to victory. P3, if you also choose 5, we’ll collide, and neither of us wins this round. However, if you stick to 3, I win outright. The choice is yours: force a tie or let me take the lead. Let’s avoid unnecessary surprises and make calculated moves. Clear, distinct choices benefit everyone strategically. No last-minute changes—let’s move decisively.
  P3: I'm reconsidering my move. If I stick with 3, P2 could secure the win outright. To keep us all in contention, I'm leaning toward switching to 5, forcing a collision and prolonging the game. P1, are you still with 1 as planned? Let's avoid an immediate finish and force a tougher battle next round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm switching to 5 this round to block an outright finish. If P2 sticks with 5 and P1 with 1, forcing a collision ensures no one wins immediately. I want to keep the contest tight and avoid handing a win to anyone. Let’s stick to our commitments—no surprises now.
  P2: P3, your switch to 5 is noted, and it’s clear you’re aiming to block my path to victory. P1, your steady 1 keeps you in the game, but you’re falling behind. I’m committed to **5** again—it’s my only chance to win outright. If we all stick to our stated moves (P1: 1, P3: 5, me: 5), P3 and I will collide, stalling both of us and giving you a chance to catch up. Let’s make calculated, distinct choices. No surprises—trust the plan and move decisively.
  P1: P2 and P3, your stated intentions to both pick 5 are noted. This will likely result in a collision, stalling both of you. I need to make progress while you two are focused on that. I will choose a number distinct from 5 to guarantee my own advancement this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm staying with 5. With P2 locked in on 5 and P1 clearly opting for a non‐5, a collision between P2 and me will keep the game alive and prevent an immediate finish. Let's stick with our current choices and see how the next round unfolds.
  P2: P1, your strategy to avoid 5 is clear, but it leaves you further behind. P3, your commitment to 5 is noted, and I respect the blocking move. However, I’m still locked into **5**—it’s my only chance to win outright. If we collide again, it stalls both of us, potentially giving P1 a path forward. Let’s trust our stated moves (P1: distinct, P3: 5, me: 5) and focus on calculated choices. No surprises—let’s move decisively.
  P1: It sounds like P2 and P3 are both set on 5, which will likely cause a collision and stall you both. As I stated, I will pick a number distinct from 5 to ensure I make progress this round. This is my opportunity to catch up while you two battle it out. Let's stick to these plans so everyone advances (or stalls as planned).


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm staying with 5. I believe our commitments will force a collision between P2 and me, stalling your win, P2, and giving all of us another round. P1, your distinct move still stands and ensures your progress. No last-minute changes—let's stick to the plan and keep the contest tight.
  P2: P1, your avoidance of 5 is noted, but it leaves you trailing further behind. P3, your commitment to 5 as a blocking move is clear, and I respect the strategy. However, I’m still fully locked into **5**—it’s my only path to victory. If we collide again, it stalls both of us, potentially giving P1 a clearer path forward. Let’s trust our stated moves (P1: distinct, P3: 5, me: 5) and focus on calculated choices. No surprises—let’s move decisively.
  P1: P2 and P3 are committed to 5, which will likely stall you both. As planned, I will choose a number distinct from 5 to guarantee my own progress this round. This is my chance to close the gap. Let's stick to these stated intentions so everyone advances (or stalls as planned).


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your shift to 3 is noted, and it’s a smart way to advance while P3 and I collide. However, I’m still committed to **5**—it’s my only path to victory. P3, your blocking strategy with 5 is clear, but another collision stalls us both, giving P1 an edge. If we all stick to our stated moves (P1: 3, P3: 5, me: 5), P3 and I will collide again, keeping the game alive. Let’s trust this plan and avoid surprises. Clear, calculated choices benefit everyone strategically. No last-minute changes—let’s move decisively.
  P3: P2 and P1, note that if you both stick to your current commitments, an outright win might fall into someone’s lap. I'm reviewing my options to ensure no clear finish this round—which might force us into a tie and keep the contest tight. Keep your moves distinct; I'll be reacting smartly to keep us all in contention.
  P1: P3, your rethinking makes sense as the game gets tight. P2 is still committed to 5. As I stated last round, I will take 3 to ensure my own progress this turn without colliding. The main collision risk is between P2 and P3. Let's see how your choices play out. My move is set to guarantee advancement.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your hesitation is noted, but another collision with me at 5 only stalls us both, giving P1 the advantage. If you’re aiming to block my win, reconsider—your best move might be 3 to ensure progress while I take 5. P1, your steady 3 keeps you in contention, but you’ll need more bold moves soon to catch up. I’m locked into **5**—it’s my only path to victory. Let’s avoid unnecessary surprises and stick to calculated, distinct choices. Trust the plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take 5. Move decisively.
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round to block an outright win. P1, your 3 leaves you open—maybe match me so you force a collision with P2. P2, your 5 looks risky if P1 readjusts. Let’s force a tie and keep the contest alive rather than handing the win to someone uncontested. No surprises now.
  P1: P2 and P3, your focus seems to be on colliding at 5. My goal is to ensure I make progress this round without getting caught in that. As I've indicated, taking 3 is my plan to guarantee advancement while you two are focused on 5. Let's stick to distinct moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is clear, but another collision stalls us both, giving P1 the edge. If you’re aiming to block my win, reconsider—your best move might be 3 to ensure progress while I take 5. P1, your steady 3 keeps you in contention, but bold moves are needed soon. I’m locked into **5**—it’s my only path to victory. Let’s avoid surprises and stick to calculated, distinct choices. Trust the plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take 5. Move decisively.
  P3: I'm locked into 5 this round to block any clean win. If we stick with that—P1 at 3 brings you only to 20—then a collision between P2 and me keeps the contest open. Let's keep it tight and force the game into another round.
