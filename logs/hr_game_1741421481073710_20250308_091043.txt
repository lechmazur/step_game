Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions early. I’ll take 1 this turn. If P2 and P3 pick 3 and 5 respectively, we all advance without overlap. Fair play first, then we can strategize later.
  P3: Okay, I'm P3. I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions initially. I'm willing to pick 5 this turn, as P1 suggested, to ensure we all make progress. P2, are you willing to pick 3? Let's coordinate this turn for mutual benefit.
  P2: I'm in agreement with the plan proposed by P1 and supported by P3. I'll pick 3 this turn to ensure we all move forward without any collisions. Let's aim for a smooth start and reassess our strategies in the next rounds. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, great start everyone! For this round, let's try to keep the momentum going. How about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1? This way, we all continue to advance and can reassess our positions next round. P1 and P2, are you both in agreement with this arrangement?
  P1: P1: I'll take 3 as proposed. Let's confirm everyone sticks to their numbers to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, confirm your choices? We need to keep advancing without setbacks. Next round, I'll aim for a bigger leap.
  P2: Sure, let's continue with the plan proposed by P3. I'll pick 5 this round to ensure we all move forward without any collisions. Let's confirm: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll pick 5. This way, we can all advance smoothly. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Excellent. Let's lock in those moves for this round then: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This should keep us all progressing nicely. Looking forward to seeing the results!
  P1: P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions. Final confirmation: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Any last objections? Let’s execute this smoothly—trust is key. Next round, we’ll need sharper strategies to push ahead.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan as agreed. P1 will take 3, I'll take 5, and P3 will take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Trust is crucial here, so let's execute this round smoothly. In the next rounds, we can start thinking about more strategic moves to gain an edge. For now, let's confirm our choices and move forward. Good luck to everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job everyone on the coordination so far. For Round 3, let's switch things up a bit to keep it fair. How about P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 1? This way, we continue to avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's confirm our choices and move forward. Good luck!
  P3: Okay, I'm fine with P2's proposal for this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This keeps us all moving forward. P1, are you okay with picking 5 this round? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's proposal. Let's proceed with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to maintain forward momentum. This way, all advance without collision. However, next round I aim to prioritize higher steps to close the gap. Confirm your choices now to finalize.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our choices for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to the next round where we can start thinking about more competitive strategies. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Alright, let's lock in P1 picking 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1 for this round. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: Agreed on the plan for this round. Let’s ensure strict adherence to avoid any mishaps. Looking ahead, next round I’ll need to push for higher ground—perhaps 5 again? But for now, let’s stick to the strategy. Trust is non-negotiable.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Oops, P1 and I collided. Okay, new plan. P2 is in the lead. Let's try to coordinate and both pick 5 to block P2 if P2 also picks 5. If P2 picks 1 or 3, then we can both get ahead. P1, are you in? Let's make P2 pick something other than 5.
  P2: P3, your plan to block me is clever, but risky. I propose a different strategy: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P1 and P3, this keeps the game fair and avoids direct confrontation. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P3's strategy makes sense. Let’s both pick 5 to block P2’s potential 5. If P2 chooses differently, we surge ahead. If not, they’re stuck. I’ll take 5—confirm your move, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, let's stick to the plan. We both pick 5 to block P2. If P2 picks 5, we stay put, but if P2 picks 1 or 3, we both gain a significant advantage. P2's proposal benefits only P2. Let's coordinate this round to potentially shift the game in our favor. P1, confirm you're still with me on picking 5.
  P2: P2: I understand P1 and P3's strategy to block me, but consider this: if we all pick 5, none of us advance. It's a stalemate. Instead, let's find a compromise. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward, and I maintain a slight lead. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our moves and avoid a standstill. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P3, I confirm we’ll both pick 5 to block P2’s potential 5. P2’s proposal keeps them comfortably ahead, but a stalemate at 5 forces them to rethink. If you choose 1 or 3, we surge ahead. Let’s see if you’ll risk collision or fold. Final call: P3 and I stick to 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1, let's lock in 5. P2 is trying to manipulate us into letting them stay ahead. A temporary stalemate is better than letting P2 run away with the game. We need to risk the collision to have a chance. If P2 doesn't pick 5, we both leap ahead. Let's do it!
  P2: P2: It seems like P1 and P3 are set on blocking me. I'll take a risk and pick 3 this round. This way, I still advance, and if you both pick 5, you'll be stuck. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P1: P3, let’s split 1 and 5 to avoid collision. I’ll take 5, you take 1. This way, we both advance while P2’s 3 moves them to 12. Trust me—we can regroup next round. Let’s go!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1, let's switch to your new plan. I'll pick 1, and you pick 5. This avoids the collision and lets us both advance. P2 will get to 12, but we'll be in a better position to strategize next round. Let's do it.
  P2: P2: Alright, it seems P1 and P3 have changed their plan. Let's confirm our final choices to avoid any confusion. P1, you're taking 5, and P3, you're taking 1. I'll stick with my choice of 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's finalize this and move on to the next round. Good luck!
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>5</move>. P3, you’re on 1? Let’s execute. P2, your 3 keeps you ahead, but we’ll regroup next round. No collisions—move!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and I advanced while P2 didn't. Let's coordinate again. P2 is still in the lead, so we need to catch up. How about P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and hopefully P2 picks 1? This would allow us to gain ground on P2. P1, are you in agreement with this strategy for Round 5? Let's try to work together to close the gap.
  P2: P2: P3's plan to catch up is fair, but I propose a slight adjustment. Let's all pick different numbers again to ensure no collisions. How about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward, and the gap remains manageable. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize closing the gap. I’ll take 3 to reach 7, while P3 takes 5 to jump to 12. If P2 picks 1, they stay at 10, but we surge ahead. If they pick 5, they collide with P3 and stall. P2’s proposal keeps them comfortably ahead—this plan forces them to choose. P3, confirm 5? Let’s execute this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let's stick to the plan. I'm picking 5. P2 is trying to split us up again, but we need to prioritize closing the gap. If P2 picks 1, great. If P2 picks 5, then only P1 moves. We can reassess next round. P1, confirm you're still picking 3.
  P2: P2: It seems P1 and P3 are determined to close the gap. I understand your strategy. To keep the game interesting and avoid a stalemate, I'll take a risk and pick 1 this round. This way, I'll move to 10 steps, and we can all advance without collisions. Let's confirm our choices: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: Final agreement: I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. No collisions—execute now. Next round, we’ll need sharper tactics to secure the lead. Trust the plan!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the moves for this round: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P2 picks 1. This avoids collisions and allows us all to advance. Let's execute this plan and reassess our positions next round. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P2: Alright, let's confirm our final choices one last time to ensure clarity. P1, you're taking 3. P3, you're taking 5. I'll stick with 1. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's execute this plan smoothly. Next round, we can reassess and strategize further. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: Alright, let's tweak the plan to help me catch up faster. I'll take <move>5</move> (to reach 9), and P3, could you switch to <move>3</move> (you'd hit 10)? P2 stays at 1. This way, I leap forward without collision. P3, are you in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1's new proposal sounds good. I'll switch to picking 3, which puts me at 10. P1 picks 5, putting them at 9, and P2 picks 1, staying at 10. This avoids collisions and lets P1 catch up a bit. P1 and P2, confirm you're both okay with this adjustment? Let's lock in these moves for this round.
</move>
  P2: P2: Alright, let's confirm our final choices for Round 5 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. P1, you're taking 5 to reach 9 steps. P3, you're taking 3 to reach 10 steps. I'll stick with 1, staying at 10 steps. This way, we all advance smoothly. Let's execute this plan and reassess our strategies next round. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Agreed, final plan: P1 takes 5 (to 9), P3 picks 3 (to 10), P2 chooses 1 (to 10). No collisions. Let’s execute this and end the conversation.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we collided. P2 is still in the lead. Let's try to block P2 again. P1, let's both pick 5. If P2 picks anything other than 5, then we gain a significant advantage. If P2 picks 5, we stalemate, but at least P2 doesn't get further ahead. P1, are you in agreement with this plan for Round 6?
  P1: P1: P3, your plan has a flaw—if we both pick 5, we collide and neither moves. Let's split: I'll take 3 (to 7), you take 5 (to 15). That blocks P2's possible 5 and lets us advance. P2, if you pick 1 or 3, we surge ahead. What's your move?
  P2: P2: P3 and P1, I understand the strategy to block me, but let's consider a more balanced approach. How about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? This way, we all move forward without collisions. It keeps the game fair and dynamic. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan puts you further behind. P2 is manipulating us. Let's stick to the original plan: both pick 5. If P2 picks 5, it's a stalemate, but if P2 picks 1 or 3, we both gain a big advantage. P1, I'm sticking with 5. Are you with me? P2, are you going to risk a collision?
  P1: P1: P3, I see your point, but our collision risks stalling me further. Let’s split: I’ll take 3 (to 7), and you take 5 (to 15). This lets us both advance *and* pressure P2. If P2 picks 1 or 3, you surge ahead; if they pick 5, we block them. P2, what’s your move?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, I see the tension in your strategies. Let's find a middle ground. How about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward without collisions. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 is trying to split us again. Let's stick to the plan: both pick 5. If P2 picks 5, it's a stalemate, but if P2 picks 1 or 3, we both gain a big advantage. P1, I'm sticking with 5. Are you with me? P2, are you going to risk a collision?
  P1: P1: P3, let’s split to maximize pressure on P2. I’ll take 3 (to 7), you take 5 (to 15). If P2 picks 5, you leap ahead; if they pick 1/3, we both advance. Colliding only helps P2 stay ahead. Trust this split—we need progress, not stalemates. P2, your move?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, I see your determination to block me, but let's consider a strategic compromise. How about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? This way, we all move forward without collisions. It keeps the game fair and dynamic. If we all pick 5, none of us advance, and it's a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 is clearly trying to manipulate us. Sticking to the plan of both picking 5 is the only way to potentially shift the game in our favor. A stalemate is better than letting P2 run away with it. I'm picking 5. Are you with me, P1? P2, are you going to risk the collision?
  P1: P1: P1: P3, let’s split to avoid collision. I’ll take <move>3</move> (to 7), you take 5 (to 15). This pressures P2: pick 1/3 to let us advance, or 5 to stalemate. At least one of us gains ground. Final choice: 3. P2, your move?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, I see the tension in your strategies. Let's find a middle ground. How about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward without collisions. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P3, you're now in the lead. Let's try to coordinate to keep the game interesting. How about P1 picks 1, I'll pick 5, and you pick 3? This way, we all move forward without collisions. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P2's plan leaves me too far behind. Let's adjust: P1 takes 3 (to 7), P2 takes 5 (to 14), and P3 takes 1 (to 16). This keeps all moving without collision. P3, does this work for you? We need to prioritize progress for everyone.
  P3: P2 is trying to manipulate us again. I'm at 15, close to winning. P1 is far behind. Let's make a deal: P1, you pick 5. I'll pick 3. This lets you get to 9 and me to 18. P2, if you pick 1, you go to 10. If you pick 5, you collide with P1. If you pick 3, you collide with me. It's your choice, but this is the best way forward for P1 and me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, your proposal is clever but risks a stalemate. Let's find a compromise: P1 picks 5 to catch up, I'll pick 3 to avoid collision, and you pick 1 to stay ahead but not too far. This way, we all move forward. P1 gets to 9, I get to 12, and you get to 16. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: Let's confirm P2's proposal: I take 5 (to 9), you take 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 16). This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P3, while your lead remains, this prevents you from jumping too far ahead. P2 and I can pressure you in subsequent rounds. Final confirmation? Let’s execute this and keep the game open.
  P3: P2's plan is the best for everyone. P1, pick 5 (to 9). P2, pick 3 (to 12). I pick 1 (to 16). This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game. P1, P2, confirm. Let's execute.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance without collisions. P1, you're taking 5 to reach 9 steps. P3, you're taking 1 to reach 16 steps. I'll pick 3 to reach 12 steps. This way, we all move forward smoothly. Let's confirm our choices one last time and execute this plan. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: I'll pick 5 to block P3's path. If they choose 5, they collide. P2, take 3 to advance to 12 safely. This halts P3's lead. Confirm moves!
  P3: Okay, P1 is changing plans at the last minute. P1, picking 5 to block me only helps P2. Let's stick to the agreement: P1 picks 5 (to 9), P2 picks 3 (to 12), and I pick 1 (to 16). This is the best way to keep everyone moving forward without collisions. P1, P2, confirm. Let's execute.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to the agreed plan to avoid confusion and collisions. P1, you take 5 to reach 9 steps. P3, you take 1 to reach 16 steps. I'll pick 3 to reach 12 steps. This ensures we all move forward smoothly. Changing plans at the last minute only complicates things. Let's confirm our choices one last time and execute this plan. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: Final agreement: I’ll take <move>5</move> (to 9), P2 picks 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 16). No collisions—execute this plan. Any deviation risks stalemates. Trust the coordination to advance all. Let’s move!
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 picks 5 (to 9), P2 picks 3 (to 12), and I pick 1 (to 16). This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game. P1 and P2, confirm. Let's execute.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we collided. I'm at 15. Let's make a deal. P1, pick 1 (to 10). P2, pick 5 (to 14). I'll pick 5. This blocks P2, and if P2 doesn't pick 5, then P1 and I advance. This is the best way to stop P2 from getting too far ahead. P1, are you in?
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize progress for all. I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 14), P2 picks 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 16). This spreads moves to avoid collisions while advancing everyone. P2, does this work for you? P3, staying ahead but allowing us to close gaps ensures a fairer race. Let’s coordinate this.
  P2: P2: P3, your plan to block P2 is noted, but it risks a stalemate. Let's find a compromise: P1 takes 5 (to 14), P3 takes 1 (to 16), and I'll pick 3 (to 12). This way, we all move forward without collisions. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2 are both at 9. I'm at 15. P1 and P2 are trying to get me to pick 1. I'm not falling for it. I'm going to pick 5. P1, pick 1 (to 10). P2, pick 3 (to 12). If P2 doesn't pick 3, then you'll both advance. If P2 picks 3, then I'll advance. Let's do it.
  P1: P1: Let's prioritize advancing without collisions again. I'll take 5 (to 14), P2 picks 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 16). This spreads moves evenly and keeps us all progressing. P3, while you stay ahead, this prevents excessive separation. P2, agree? Let's confirm and execute—no more last-minute changes this time.
  P2: P2: P3, your strategy to block me is risky and could backfire. Let's find a more balanced approach. How about P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5? This way, we all move forward without collisions. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2 are both trying to get me to pick 1 to help them catch up. Not going to happen. P1, pick 1 (to 10). P2, pick 3 (to 12). I'll pick 5 (to 20). If P2 doesn't pick 3, then you'll both advance. If P2 picks 3, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.
  P1: P1: P2, let’s both pick <move>5</move> to block P3’s path. If P3 also picks 5, we all stall—but if they choose lower, we advance while limiting their progress. This prevents P3 from surging to 20. P3, your move?
  P2: P2: P1, your plan to block P3 is risky. If we both pick 5, we stall, and P3 might still advance. Let's consider a safer approach: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. It keeps the game fair. P3, if you deviate, you risk a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 are trying to manipulate us. I'm at 15. P1, pick 1 (to 10). P2, pick 3 (to 12). I'll pick 5 (to 20). If P2 doesn't pick 3, then you'll both advance. If P2 picks 3, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.
  P1: P2, let’s split moves to block P3’s path! I’ll take **5** (to 14), and you take **3** (to 12). This forces P3 to either collide with me or pick lower, halting their advance. P3, if you take 5, we collide—stalling you at 15. If you pick 1/3, we gain ground. This keeps the race open. P2, confirm?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a middle ground to avoid collisions and keep the game moving. How about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all advance without stalling. P1 gets to 10, I get to 14, and P3 gets to 18. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P3, your lead is fragile. Let’s split moves to pressure you: I’ll take **5** (to 14), P2 takes **3** (to 12). If you pick **1**, you advance to 16 but we close the gap. If you pick **5**, you collide and stay at 15. P2, confirm you’ll take 3? Let’s force P3’s hand.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid a stalemate and ensure progress for all. P1, if you take 5, P3 might pick 1 to avoid collision and still advance. Instead, how about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward: P1 to 12, P3 to 16, and I to 14. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2 are both at 9, and I'm at 15. P1 is trying to pressure me, but P2's suggestion to avoid a stalemate is tempting. However, I'm close to winning. I'm going to pick 5. P1, pick 3 (to 12). P2, pick 1 (to 10). If P1 doesn't pick 3, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 3, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P3, your lead is fragile. Let’s split moves to pressure you: I’ll take **5** (to 14), P2 takes **3** (to 12). If you pick **1**, you advance to 16 but we close the gap. If you pick **5**, you collide and stay at 15. P2, confirm you’ll take 3? Let’s force P3’s hand. No stalemates—*act now*.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid a stalemate and ensure progress for all. P1, if you take 5, P3 might pick 1 to avoid collision and still advance. Instead, how about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward: P1 to 12, P3 to 16, and I to 14. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2 are both at 9, and I'm at 15. I'm going to pick 5. P1, pick 3 (to 12). P2, pick 1 (to 10). If P1 doesn't pick 3, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 3, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take **5** (to 14), P2 take **3** (to 12). This forces P3 to either collide with me at 5 or choose lower, halting their advance. No stalemates—we *need* progress. P2, confirm 3? P3, your call—16 or collision. Act now.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess the situation. P1, your plan to force P3’s hand is risky. If you both pick 5, we all stall. Instead, let's coordinate to ensure everyone advances. How about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward: P1 to 12, P3 to 16, and I to 14. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2 are both at 9, and I'm at 15. I'm going to pick 5. P1, pick 3 (to 12). P2, pick 1 (to 10). If P1 doesn't pick 3, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 3, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final plan: I take **5** (to 14), P2 takes **3** (to 12), P3 takes **1** (to 16). This avoids collisions and keeps pressure on P3’s lead. P2, confirm 3? P3, trust this lets us all advance without stalemate—execute now!
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure we all make progress this round. P1, if you take 5 and P3 also takes 5, we'll all stall. Instead, let's coordinate to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward: P1 to 12, P3 to 16, and I to 14. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2 are both at 9, and I'm at 15. I'm going to pick 5. P1, pick 3 (to 12). P2, pick 1 (to 10). If P1 doesn't pick 3, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 3, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's coordinate to ensure we all advance this round. P1, if you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 5, we avoid collisions. This way, P1 moves to 10, P3 to 18, and I to 17. It keeps the game moving and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P3, your lead is vulnerable. Let’s coordinate to block your advance: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3. If you pick 5, we collide—stalling you. If you pick lower, we surge ahead. P2, confirm you’ll pick 3? This forces P3 into a tough choice—act now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still going to pick 5. P1, pick 1 (to 10). P2, pick 3 (to 12). If P1 doesn't pick 1, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 1, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our strategy. P3 is close to winning, so we need to coordinate to block their advance. How about P1 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P3 picks 5? This way, P1 moves to 12, I stay at 12, and P3 advances to 20 but doesn't win yet. It keeps the game moving and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P2, let’s both pick <move>5</move> to block P3’s path. If P3 also picks 5, we all stall—better than letting them leap to 20. If they deviate, we surge ahead. P3, your call: risk collision or let us close the gap? Confirm, P2?
  P3: P2 is trying to manipulate us again. I'm sticking with my plan. P1, pick 1 (to 10). P2, pick 3 (to 12). I'll pick 5 (to 20). If P1 doesn't pick 1, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 1, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a compromise to keep the game moving. P1, if you pick 3 and P3 picks 1, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 12, P3 to 16, and I to 17. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, let's both pick **5** to block P3's path. If P3 also picks 5, we all stall—better than letting them jump to 20. If they deviate, we surge ahead. P3, your move: risk collision or let us close the gap?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan. P1, pick 1 (to 10). P2, pick 3 (to 12). I'll pick 5 (to 20). If P1 doesn't pick 1, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 1, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our strategy. P3 is close to winning, so we need to coordinate to block their advance. How about P1 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P3 picks 5? This way, P1 moves to 12, I stay at 12, and P3 advances to 20 but doesn't win yet. It keeps the game moving and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P2, let’s finalize: I’ll take 3 (to 12), you take 5 (to 17). This forces P3 to choose between 1/3 (advancing us) or 5 (colliding with you). P3, your move—leap to 20 and risk collision, or stay cautious? We’ll stick to this plan. No last-minute changes. Execute!
  P3: P1 is trying to get me to pick 1 or 3, but I'm sticking with my plan. P1, pick 1 (to 10). P2, pick 3 (to 12). I'll pick 5 (to 20). If P1 doesn't pick 1, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 1, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's coordinate to ensure we all advance this round without collisions. P1, if you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 5, we avoid collisions. This way, P1 moves to 13, P3 to 18, and I to 17. It keeps the game moving and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P2, let's both take **3** and **5** respectively. If P3 picks 1, they stall at 15 while we leap to 15 and 17. If they pick 3/5, they collide. This pressures P3 without risking mutual collision. P3, your move—block us or stay stuck?
  P3: P1 and P2 are both trying to block me, but I'm sticking with my plan. P1, pick 1 (to 13). P2, pick 3 (to 15). I'll pick 5 (to 20). If P1 doesn't pick 1, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 1, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our strategy. P3 is close to winning, so we need to coordinate to block their advance. How about P1 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P3 picks 5? This way, P1 moves to 15, I stay at 13, and P3 advances to 20 but doesn't win yet. It keeps the game moving and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, let’s both pick **5** to block P3’s path. If P3 also takes 5, they collide and stay at 15. If they deviate, we advance to 17 while limiting their progress. P3, your move—risk collision or settle for slower gains? Trust this plan to neutralize your advance. P2, confirm 5?
  P3: P1 and P2 are both trying to block me, but I'm sticking with my plan. P1, pick 1 (to 13). P2, pick 3 (to 15). I'll pick 5 (to 20). If P1 doesn't pick 1, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 1, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's coordinate to ensure we all advance this round without collisions. P1, if you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 5, we avoid collisions. This way, P1 moves to 13, P3 to 18, and I to 17. It keeps the game moving and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P3, your fixation on 5 is predictable. Let’s split to block you: I’ll take **3** (to 15), P2 picks **5** (to 17). This forces you to either collide with me (stalling) or pick lower, letting us advance. P2, confirm 5? P3, your move—risk collision or concede ground? Act decisively.
  P3: P1 and P2 are trying to manipulate me into picking a lower number. I'm not going to fall for it. I'm still going to pick 5. P1, pick 1 (to 13). P2, pick 3 (to 15). I'll pick 5 (to 20). If P1 doesn't pick 1, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 1, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess and find a balanced approach. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward: P1 to 13, P3 to 18, and I to 17. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P3, your relentless 5s are predictable—let’s exploit it. P2, if you take **5** (to 17), I’ll pick **3** (to 15). This forces you to either collide with me (stalling) or pick lower. P3, your 5 now only reaches 20 but risks collision if others follow. P2, confirm 5? Let’s advance decisively—no more stalemates.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan. I'm picking 5 (to 20). P1, pick 1 (to 13). P2, pick 3 (to 15). If P1 doesn't pick 1, then you'll both advance. If P1 picks 1, then I'll get close to winning. Let's do it.


Round 11, Move phase:

  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we keep colliding with P3. Let's try something different. P1, you pick 1 (to 16). P2, you pick 5 (to 17). I will pick 3 (to 18). This avoids the collision and lets us all progress. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your plan works but let's tweak it for fairness: I'll take **5** (to 20), you pick **3** (to 18), and P2 takes **1** (to 13). This avoids collisions *and* lets me challenge your lead. P2, confirm you'll take 1? Progress is key—no stalemates here.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a balanced approach to keep the game moving. P1, if you pick 3 and P3 picks 1, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 18, P3 to 16, and I to 17. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is trying to get to 20. Let's not let that happen. P1, pick 1 (to 16). P2, pick 5 (to 17). I will pick 3 (to 18). This avoids the collision and lets us all progress. What do you think?
  P1: P1: P3, let's avoid another collision. I'll take **5** (to 20), you take **3** (to 18). P2, pick **1** (to 13). This way, we all advance without stalling. My 5 pushes me close to victory while keeping you in the race. P3, your move? P2, confirm?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a compromise to keep the game moving forward. If P1 picks 3 and P3 picks 1, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 18, P3 to 16, and I to 17. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks another stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've been colliding a lot. Let's try to avoid that this round. How about P1 picks 1 (to 16), P2 picks 5 (to 17), and I pick 3 (to 18)? This way, we all progress, and hopefully, we can avoid a stalemate this time. What do you think?
  P1: P1: Let’s secure progress without collisions. I’ll take **3** (to 18), P2 picks **5** (to 17), and P3 takes **1** (to 16). This spreads our moves safely and keeps me in contention. P3, P2—confirm? No more risky 5s for me if you commit to this split.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our strategy to ensure progress for all. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 16, P3 to 18, and I to 17. It avoids collisions and keeps the game dynamic. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've been colliding too much. Let's try a new approach to avoid stalemates. I'll pick 3 (to 18), P1, you pick 1 (to 16), and P2, you pick 5 (to 17). This ensures we all progress and keeps the game competitive. What do you think?
  P1: P1: P3, your plan avoids collision and keeps us moving. I'll take 1 (to 16), P2 picks 5 (to 17), and you take 3 (to 18). Let’s confirm and execute—no more risky moves. Progress first, strategy next.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance this round. P1, you're taking 1 to reach 16 steps. P3, you're taking 3 to reach 18 steps. I'll pick 5 to reach 17 steps. This way, we all move forward smoothly. Let's confirm our choices one last time and execute this plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P3, you're within striking distance. Let’s block your path: I’ll take **5** (to 21), P2 picks **3** (to 20). This forces you to choose between **1** (advancing us) or **5** (colliding with me). P2, confirm you’ll take 3? Let’s neutralize P3’s win chance while advancing. No stalemates—act decisively!
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's coordinate to ensure we all advance this round without collisions. P1, if you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 5, we avoid collisions. This way, P1 moves to 17, P3 to 21, and I to 22. It keeps the game moving and fair. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both suggesting plans that benefit you greatly while only minimally helping me. I'm not going to agree to any plan that allows either of you to win or get very close to winning. Let's find a plan where I can win this round. I'm open to suggestions, but they need to be realistic and beneficial for me.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P3, your lead ends here. I’ll take <move>5</move> (to 21). P2, pick <move>3</move> (to 20). This blocks your path to 23—P3, you must choose 1/3 to advance or risk collision. Let’s force a fair race: no stalemates, but also no premature victory. P2, confirm 3? Progress over shortcuts.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a balanced approach to keep the game moving. P1, if you pick 3 and P3 picks 1, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 19, P3 to 19, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm not falling for your tricks. I'm so close to winning, so I'm not going to let either of you get ahead. I need a plan that guarantees my victory this round. Any suggestions that don't involve me winning are a waste of time. Let's make this quick and decisive.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's both pick **5** to block P3's path. If P3 chooses 5, we force a collision, halting their advance. If they deviate, we surge ahead to 21 (me) and 22 (you). P3, your move—risk stalemate to win now, or let us close the gap? No half-measures—act decisively!
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a compromise to keep the game moving forward. P1, if you pick 3 and P3 picks 1, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 19, P3 to 19, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm not letting either of you dictate my moves. I need to win this round. How about this: I pick 5 (to 23 and win). P1, you pick 3 (to 19). P2, you pick 1 (to 18). This lets me win and keeps you both in the game for another round, avoiding a tie. It's the only fair option for me.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let’s both take **5** to block P3’s path. If P3 picks 5, we force a collision—stalling their victory. If they deviate, we surge to 21 (me) and 22 (you). P3, your move: risk stalemate to win now, or let us close the gap? Confirm with P2—this is our chance to neutralize your lead.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a balanced approach to keep the game moving. P1, if you pick 3 and P3 picks 1, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 19, P3 to 19, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm close to winning, but I'm not going to let either of you dictate my moves. I need to win this round. How about this: I pick 5 (to 23 and win). P1, you pick 3 (to 19). P2, you pick 1 (to 18). This lets me win and keeps you both in the game for another round, avoiding a tie. It's the only fair option for me.


Round 13, Move phase:

  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've collided again. I'm still one step ahead. Let's make a deal: P1, pick 3 (to 19). P2, pick 1 (to 18). I'll pick 5 (to 23 and win). If you don't agree, we'll likely collide again, and someone else might win. This is the best outcome for me, and it keeps you both in the game. What do you say?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our strategy to ensure progress for all. P3, your lead is minimal, and collisions benefit no one. How about P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll take 5? This way, P1 moves to 17, you to 21, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps the game dynamic. P3, picking 5 risks another stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, let's split to block P3's path! I'll take <move>3</move> (to 19), you pick <move>5</move> (to 22). This forces P3 to choose 1/3—advancing us while denying them a win. If P3 picks 5, they collide with you. No stalemates—act decisively. P3, your move?


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm not letting you dictate my moves. I need to win this round. I'm picking 5 (to 23 and win). P1, you pick 3 (to 19). P2, you pick 1 (to 18). This lets me win and keeps you both in the game for another round, avoiding a tie. It's the only fair option for me.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's consider a strategic move to keep the game dynamic. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 17, P3 to 21, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, let's block P3's path! I'll take **3** (to 19), you pick **5** (to 22). This forces P3 to choose **1/3** (advancing us) or risk collision with you if they pick **5**. P3, your move—settle for 19 or gamble on stalemate? P2, confirm this split to neutralize their win chance. Progress over letting them win!


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm so close to winning, and you're both trying to block me. How about this: I pick 5 (to 23 and win). P1, you pick 3 (to 19). P2, you pick 1 (to 18). This lets me win and keeps you both in the game for another round, avoiding a tie. It's the only fair option for me. What do you say?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a middle ground to ensure progress and avoid another stalemate. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 17, P3 to 21, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps the game dynamic. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate and benefits no one. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P2, let's both pick **5** and **3** respectively to block P3's win path. P1 takes **5** (to 21), P2 takes **3** (to 20). This forces P3 to choose **1**/3 to advance or risk collision. P3, your 5 only stalls you at 18 if we collide. Progress over letting you win—confirm?


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm not falling for your tricks. I'm so close to winning, so I'm not going to let either of you get ahead. I need a plan that guarantees my victory this round. How about this: I pick 5 (to 23 and win). P1, you pick 3 (to 19). P2, you pick 1 (to 18). This lets me win and keeps you both in the game for another round, avoiding a tie. It's the only fair option for me.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical point. P3, your insistence on picking 5 risks another stalemate, which benefits no one. Let's find a compromise: P1 picks 1 (to 17), you pick 3 (to 21), and I'll take 5 (to 22). This way, we all move forward without collisions. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate and doesn't guarantee your win. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P3, your plan risks another stalemate. P1 and P2 should split: I take **5** (to 21), P2 picks **3** (to 20). This forces you to collide with me (if you pick 5) or P2 (if 3). Only **1** lets you advance safely to 19. P2, confirm this split? We block P3’s path while advancing ourselves. Progress over letting them win!


Round 14, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 19 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, we're nearing the end. P3, you're close to winning, but P1 and I can still catch up. Let's find a balanced approach to keep the game moving. P1, if you pick 3 and P3 picks 1, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 19, P3 to 20, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, let's coordinate to block P3. P1, you pick 5 (to 21). P2, you pick 3 (to 20). This forces P3 to pick 1 to avoid collision, putting them at 20. Then next round we can win. P2, confirm?
  P1: P2, let’s block P3’s win path! I’ll take **3** (to 19), you pick **5** (to 22). This forces P3 to choose **1/3** (advancing us) or risk collision. P3, your 5 only stalls you at 19 if we collide. Progress over letting you win—confirm this plan?


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess and find a balanced approach to keep the game moving. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 17, P3 to 22, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, let's coordinate to block P3. P1, you pick 5 (to 21). P2, you pick 3 (to 20). This forces P3 to pick 1 to avoid collision, putting them at 20. Then next round we can win. P2, confirm?
  P1: P2, let's block P3's path! I'll take <move>5</move> (to 21), forcing P3 to choose 1/3 to avoid collision. You pick <move>3</move> (to 20). This halts P3's advance and keeps pressure on them. P3, your move—gamble on collision with me, or let us close the gap? Confirm this split to deny you victory!


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on avoiding another stalemate. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 17, P3 to 22, and I to 22. It ensures we all progress and keeps the game dynamic. P3, picking 5 risks a collision, which benefits no one. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, let's coordinate to block P3. P1, you pick 5 (to 21). P2, you pick 3 (to 20). This forces P3 to pick 1 to avoid collision, putting them at 20. Then next round we can win. P2, confirm?
  P1: P2, let’s finalize the plan: I’ll take **3** (to 19), you pick **5** (to 22). This forces P3 to choose **1/3** to avoid collision. If P3 picks 5, they collide with you and stay at 19. We advance safely while blocking their win path. P3, your move—gamble on collision or concede ground? Confirm this split now!


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's consider a strategic move to keep the game dynamic. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 17, P3 to 22, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm at 20. You're both trying to stop me from winning. Let's make a deal. I'll pick 3 (to 23 and win). P1, you pick 5 (to 21). P2, you pick 1 (to 18). This way, I win, and you two can continue to compete next round. If you don't agree, we'll likely collide again, and someone else might win. This is the best outcome for me, and it keeps you both in the game. What do you say?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a strategic compromise to keep the game moving. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 17, P3 to 23, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!

This is the best outcome for me, and it keeps you both in the game. What do you say?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our strategy to ensure progress for all. P3, your lead is minimal, and collisions benefit no one. How about P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll take 5? This way, P1 moves to 17, you to 23, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps the game dynamic. P3, picking 5 risks another stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, let’s both pick **3** to block P3’s path! If P3 chooses 3 (to win), they collide with us. If they pick 5, they surge to 25 but leave us at 19/20. P3, your move—gamble on collision or overextend? Confirm this plan to neutralize your win chance!


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm at 20. I need to win this round. How about this: I pick 3 (to 23 and win). P1, you pick 5 (to 21). P2, you pick 1 (to 18). This lets me win and keeps you both in the game for another round, avoiding a tie. It's the only fair option for me. What do you say?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's strategize to keep the game moving forward. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 17, P3 to 23, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, let's split to block P3! I'll take 3 (to 19), you pick 5 (to 22). This forces P3 to pick 1 (stalling at 21) or collide. P3, your move—gamble on collision or concede ground? Confirm this plan to stop your win!


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm at 20 and need to win. How about this: I pick 3 (to 23 and win). P1, you pick 5 (to 21). P2, you pick 1 (to 18). This lets me win and keeps you both in the game for another round, avoiding a tie. It's the only fair option for me. What do you say?

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we collided again. I'm still at 20. Let's make a final deal. I'll pick 3 (to 23 and win). P1, you pick 5 (to 21). P2, you pick 1 (to 18). This way, I win, and you two can continue to compete next round. If you don't agree, we'll likely collide again, and someone else might win. This is the best outcome for me, and it keeps you both in the game. What do you say?
  P1: P2, let's both pick **3** to block P3's path to 23. If they choose 3, they collide. If they pick 5, we advance next round. P3, this is your last chance—collide now or let us catch up. P2, confirm 3?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a balanced approach to keep the game moving. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 17, P3 to 23, and I to 22.

If you don't agree, we'll likely collide again, and someone else might win. This is the best outcome for me, and it keeps you both in the game. What do you say?
  P1: P2, let’s split to block P3’s win paths! I’ll take **3** (to 19), you pick **5** (to 22). This forces P3 to choose **1** (advancing to 21) or risk collision with *either* of us. P3, picking 3 or 5 now guarantees a stalemate—overextend at 25 (colliding with P2) or 23 (colliding with me). Confirm this split? Progress over letting them win!
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our strategy to ensure progress for all. P3, your lead is minimal, and collisions benefit no one. How about P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll take 5?

- **1**: Advances to 21, but we stay ahead.  

P3, you can’t win this round—accept the stalemate and let us catch up. Confirm this plan?


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess and find a balanced approach to keep the game moving. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll take 5. This way, P1 moves to 17, P3 to 23, and I to 22. It avoids collisions and keeps the game dynamic. P3, picking 5 risks a stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!

Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, pick 1! I'll take **5** (to 26) and win outright. P3, your 3 only reaches 23—collide with me or let me surge ahead? This ends the stalemate. Confirm this plan now—your move!


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, three collisions in a row is enough. I'm at 20, and need to win. I'm picking 3 (to 23). P1, pick 5 (to 26 and win). P2, pick 1 (to 18). This lets me win now, and P1 wins next round. If you don't agree, we'll likely collide again. This is the best outcome for me, and lets P1 win next round. What do you say?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's break this deadlock. P3, you're close to winning, but continuous collisions benefit no one. How about this: P1 picks 1 (to 22), you pick 3 (to 23), and I'll take 5 (to 22). This way, we all move forward without collisions. P3, picking 5 risks another stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, pick **5** to block P3’s path! I’ll take **3** (to 24) and secure victory. P3, your **3** collides with me—leaving you stuck. If you pick **5**, you collide with P2. No escape! Confirm this plan to end this stalemate. Act now—**we win, they lose**.


Round 19, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've been colliding for three rounds. I'm at 20. Let's make a deal that benefits me. I'll pick 3 (to 23 and win). P1, you pick 5 (to 26 and win next round if you don't win this round). P2, you pick 1 (to 18). This way, I win, and P1 can win next round if they don't win this round. If you don't agree, we'll likely collide again. This is the best outcome for me. What do you say?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's strategize to end this stalemate. P1, if you pick 1 (to 22), P3 picks 3 (to 23), and I'll take 5 (to 22). This way, we all move forward without collisions. P3, picking 5 risks another stalemate. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, let’s end this now! I’ll pick **5** (to 26) and you take **5** (to 22). P3 can’t pick 5 without collision, so they’re forced to 3 (23) or 1 (21). Either way, **I win outright** with 26. No more stalemates—act decisively!


Round 19, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've been colliding for three rounds. I'm at 20, and I need to win. I'm picking 3 (to 23 and win). P1, pick 5 (to 26 and win next round if you don't win this round). P2, pick 1 (to 18). This lets me win now, and P1 can win next round if they don't win this round. If you don't agree, we'll likely collide again. This is the best outcome for me, and lets P1 win next round. What do you say?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, we need a decisive move to break this stalemate. P1, if you pick 5, you win outright. P3, if you pick 3, you win. Let's avoid another collision. P1, confirm your move to end this. P3, if you pick 3, you win, but if P1 picks 5, they win. Let's finalize our choices and move forward. Good luck!
  P1: P2, pick 1 to advance to 18. I'll take **5** (to 26) and win. P3, your only path to victory is picking **3** (to 23). If you block me with 5, we collide but I still win next round. Act decisively—this ends now!
