Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3. Let's try to make some progress this first round. Avoiding collisions seems like a good start. Good luck!
  P2: I agree that avoiding collisions is key. Since we each have three options (1, 3, 5), we could try to coordinate. How about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 for this first round? This way we all advance without collisions. We can adjust our strategy as the game progresses.
  P3: I’m on board with that plan for now and will aim for 5. It’s a good way to avoid collisions this round, but let’s stay adaptable if our positions change.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a plan for this round. I'll aim for 1. Let's see how it goes.
  P2: I appreciate everyone agreeing to the plan. I'll stick with 3 as discussed. For future rounds, we should consider our positions carefully as the game progresses. Having this staggered start (1-3-5) gives us all different positions to work from.
  P3: I remain on board with our initial plan and intend to pick 5 this round. Let’s trust each other to avoid collisions now and adapt as needed in future turns. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good, everyone seems aligned. I'm ready to proceed with 1 as agreed.
  P2: I think we have clear coordination for this first round. I'll stick with my commitment to 3. Since we all seem ready, let's move to the move phase unless anyone has more to discuss.
  P3: I have no further strategic changes to suggest. Let’s proceed unless anyone else wants to add something. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we're all at different positions now. For this round, we might want to consider a slight adjustment to keep advancing efficiently. Given our positions, perhaps P1 could choose 5 to catch up (moving to 6), I could take 5 (moving to 8), and P3 could take 3 (moving to 8). This balances the game while still allowing everyone to make progress. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan suggests both you and I take 5. That would cause a collision, and neither of us would advance, while P3 moves to 8. That doesn't seem like a good outcome for us.

Perhaps there was a misunderstanding? We need a plan where we all choose different numbers if we want everyone to advance. What do you think, P3?
  P3: To avoid collisions, let’s propose this: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. That way each choice is unique, and we all advance. Are you both willing to give that a try?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see P3's suggestion, but I'm not sure it's optimal for all of us. Since I started in the middle position, always taking the smallest step would keep me behind. What about this instead: P1 takes 3 (to 4 steps), I take 5 (to 8 steps), and P3 takes 1 (to 6 steps)? This maintains different positions while allowing everyone to advance. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts you significantly ahead at 8 steps, while I only reach 4 and P3 reaches 6. That doesn't seem very balanced for the group.

P3's earlier plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in P1=6, P2=4, P3=8. While you take a smaller step this round, P2, it keeps the scores closer overall. P3, does your original plan still sound good to you? I prefer it as it gives me a better advance.
  P3: I still favor P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and me picking 3. That avoids collisions, keeps things closer, and encourages trust as we move forward. Are you both on board with finalizing that plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but notice that P3's plan puts them in a strong lead at 8 steps while I fall behind at 4. Similarly, my plan would put me ahead.

Let me propose a compromise: P1 takes 3 (to 4), I take 3 (to 6), and P3 takes 1 (to 6). This creates a more balanced position where P1 advances normally while P3 and I are tied. It prevents anyone from getting too far ahead early. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your latest proposal has both of us choosing 3. That means we would collide and neither of us would advance, while P3 moves to 6. This doesn't seem like a compromise, it mainly benefits P3.

Did you mean to suggest different numbers?

I still think P3's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the most reasonable way to avoid collisions this round. It results in P1=6, P2=4, P3=8. While you get a smaller step, P2, at least you advance, unlike in your collision plan. What do you think?
  P3: Let’s finalize the plan of P1=5, P2=1, and me (P3)=3. Yes, it temporarily puts me in front, but we can readjust next round to keep things balanced. It’s still early, and avoiding collisions helps everyone. Do you both agree we should lock this in and move on?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see my error in proposing a collision. Let me suggest a better plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This would result in everyone at 6 steps, creating perfect balance. While P3's plan puts them 4 steps ahead of me, my proposal keeps us all equal. This seems fairest at this early stage. What do you both think of this alternative?
  P1: P2, your revised plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) makes sense. It avoids collisions and brings us all to 6 steps, which seems like the fairest outcome for this round, preventing anyone from getting too far ahead. I'm willing to go with that. P3, what do you think? It keeps the game balanced.

I'm ready to move forward with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: I see the appeal of tying at six steps, but it also means losing my current lead. I still prefer a plan where each of us advances without collisions while preserving some advantage for me. However, if both of you insist on balancing everyone at six, I’ll hear you out. Let’s be sure we’re making a decision that keeps trust intact for the rounds ahead. If there’s no other compromise, I’ll consider equalizing. Let’s finalize our choices now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about this plan to avoid collisions and help everyone advance: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1. That would land P1 at 7, P2 at 8, and me at 8, keeping the game competitive while ensuring no one gets stranded. What do you think?
  P1: P3, that plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) sounds reasonable. It avoids collisions, helps P2 catch up from last place, and keeps the scores very close (P1=7, P2=8, P3=8). Given I advanced last round while you both collided, taking the small step seems fair.

I'm willing to go with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I appreciate the plan that gives me a chance to catch up from my current last place position. Taking 5 steps would help me significantly after our collision last round. I agree to the proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) which puts P3 and me at 8 steps with P1 at 7. This keeps us all competitive while avoiding collisions. I'm committed to picking 5 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m still good with the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. It keeps us all in close range without collisions. If both of you agree, I’m ready to finalize. Let’s decide quickly so we can move on.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. Unless anyone has any last-minute objections, I suggest we move to the move phase.
  P2: I'm definitely still on board with the plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This helps me catch up from my current last place position and keeps us all competitive. Looking forward to advancing after that unfortunate collision last round. I'm ready to proceed with 5 unless anyone has any other thoughts.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still good with picking 3 while P1 picks 1 and P2 picks 5. That plan avoids collisions and keeps us in close range. Unless there’s a last-minute change, I’m ready to move on. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, the plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) seems locked in. I'm ready to choose 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm I'm fully committed to our plan where I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This arrangement helps me recover from my position while keeping us all competitive. The resulting positioning (P1 at 7, P3 and me at 8) creates a balanced game going forward. I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreement.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about a plan where P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5? That ensures no collisions and lets each of us advance. It would place P1 at 8, P2 at 11, and me at 13. Let’s keep the game fluent and balanced, though. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P3's plan gives them a 5-step lead over P1 and 2 steps over me. That's quite advantageous for them. I propose an alternative: P1 takes 3 (to 10), I take 5 (to 13), and P3 takes 1 (to 9). This spreads out our positions more evenly while still avoiding collisions. It also helps P1 catch up from their current last place. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, both plans proposed give the proposer a big jump. P3's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts P3 way ahead at 13, while I only reach 8. P2's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) results in P1=10, P2=13, P3=9. This is better for me as I get 3 steps.

P3, taking 1 step isn't great, but it prevents a huge gap forming early compared to your plan. The scores 13, 10, 9 keep it relatively close overall. I lean towards P2's suggestion (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand both viewpoints, but I’d like to preserve some advantage. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? That puts us at P1=10, P2=9, and me=13. Yes, I’ll be ahead, but next round we can rebalance if needed. Avoiding collisions remains our main goal, so let’s finalize this plan and move forward. What do you say?
  P2: I see P3 is still proposing a plan that puts them 4 steps ahead of me and 3 ahead of P1. That creates a significant early advantage. My previous suggestion (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) at least keeps all players within 4 steps of each other. 

Let me offer another option: P1 takes 5 (to 12), I take 3 (to 11), and P3 takes 1 (to 9). This avoids collisions, helps P1 catch up strongly, and keeps us all much closer in position. Does this feel more balanced to everyone?
  P1: P2, your latest proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) looks very good to me. It avoids collisions, allows me to catch up significantly, and results in very close scores (P1=12, P2=11, P3=9). This seems the most balanced outcome proposed so far, keeping everyone competitive.

P3, while it's only 1 step for you this round, it prevents anyone from running away with the lead and keeps the game tight. Given you're currently tied for the lead, this seems fair.

I support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's try to agree on this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s not create a big gap. If I only move 1 step, I’ll fall behind at 9 while you reach 12 and 11. I’d prefer a solution that keeps us closer. How about P1 takes 5 (reaching 12), P2 takes 1 (reaching 9), and I take 3 (reaching 11)? We all avoid collisions, and it’s still fairly balanced. Are you both open to that?
  P2: P3, your plan essentially flips our positions from my proposal, putting you ahead of me instead. Since we're currently tied, your suggestion creates an immediate disadvantage for me. My suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) helps P1 catch up while keeping all players within 3 steps of each other - the most balanced outcome. We've been rotating who takes the smaller steps. It's reasonable that you take the smaller step this round. Let's try to keep things fair for everyone.
  P1: P2 makes a good point, P3. The plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 results in scores 12, 11, 9. This is incredibly close and keeps everyone in the game, which you've said is important. We've all taken different step sizes in previous rounds; it seems fair for you to take 1 this round, especially since you're currently tied for the lead. I strongly prefer this plan as the most balanced and fair option. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m not comfortable taking just 1 step again and dropping behind. Let’s do P1=5, P2=1, and me (P3)=3, giving positions 12, 9, and 11. That’s still quite close, with P1 catching up and me not losing too much ground. If you insist on me taking the smallest move yet again, I’ll have no incentive to maintain trust. Let’s finalize a fair plan that keeps everyone competitive.
  P2: I understand everyone wants to advance, but P3, you've only taken the smallest step once, same as each of us. Since we're tied at 8 steps, asking you to take 1 while P1 (currently behind) catches up with 5 seems fair. My plan keeps all players within 3 steps of each other - the most balanced scenario.

If you absolutely refuse the 1, then perhaps P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is another option? Otherwise, I may need to reconsider my strategy entirely. Let's reach an agreement that preserves balanced gameplay.
  P1: P3, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 results in scores 12, 11, 9. This is the closest possible arrangement and puts me (currently last) into the lead, while you (currently tied first) are only 3 steps behind. This seems very fair and balanced, rotating who takes the smaller step.

I am sticking with this plan as it's the most equitable discussed. I will choose 5. P2 seems set on 3. It's up to you whether we all advance or risk collision. Let's proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all quite close, so let’s avoid another collision and keep moving. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Then we’d end up at P1=8, P2=12, and me=13. It’s still a tight race, and nobody wastes a turn stuck at the same step. Does this seem fair enough to everyone?
  P1: P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts you significantly ahead at 13, P2 at 12, and leaves me far behind at 8. That doesn't seem very balanced, especially after you and I just collided.

How about this instead: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3?
This results in P1=12, P2=10, P3=11. The scores are extremely close, everyone advances, and it gives me a chance to catch up from the collision. This seems much fairer for keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand both perspectives. Since I'm slightly ahead, P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) would put me in last place. I'd like to propose a compromise: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This would result in P1=10, P2=14, P3=9, keeping us all within 5 steps of each other. This helps P1 recover from the collision while acknowledging my current lead position. We're still early in the game, and keeping everyone advancing without collisions seems most important.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m willing to accept P1=5, P2=1, and me=3 this round. That results in 12, 10, and 11—close, with no collisions. It helps P1 catch up, keeps me competitive, and ensures P2 doesn’t fall too far behind. Let’s finalize unless there’s a better suggestion.
  P1: P2, I understand taking 1 step isn't ideal when you're currently leading. However, the plan P3 and I support (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in scores 12, 10, 11. This is incredibly close, keeps everyone in the game, and most importantly, avoids collisions which would hurt us all. Since P3 has agreed, we have a consensus forming. Can you agree to this plan so we can all advance this round?
  P2: I appreciate P3's flexibility, but I'm concerned about going from first to last by taking just 1 step. However, I recognize the importance of avoiding collisions and keeping everyone advancing. Since we're still early in the game (the target is 22), I'll accept P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round, resulting in scores of 12, 10, 11. I expect similar consideration in future rounds when others are leading. Let's move forward with this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m prepared to move forward with the plan we discussed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps our scores close and helps avoid collisions. Let’s finalize this so we can all advance and remain competitive. Good luck, and we’ll adapt again as needed next round.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a solid agreement on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps things close and avoids collisions. I'm ready to proceed with 5. Let's move to the move phase unless anyone has anything else to add.
  P2: I confirm I'll stick with our agreed plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Though I'm temporarily moving from first to last position, I value our cooperation and avoiding collisions. This keeps us all within 2 steps of each other at 12-10-11, maintaining a competitive game. I appreciate everyone's willingness to find balanced solutions, and I'm ready to move forward with my choice of 1 for this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, we're very close in scores (12, 10, 11). Let's keep avoiding collisions.

Looking back, P2 has taken the 1-step move three times, I've taken it twice, and P3 has only taken it once (and that was a collision round). To balance things out, it seems fair for P3 to take 1 this round.

Therefore, I propose: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
This would put us at P1=17, P2=13, P3=12. Everyone advances, and it reflects the past moves fairly. What do you think?
  P2: I understand P1's proposal, but it puts them 4-5 steps ahead of us both, which creates a significant advantage when we only need 22 steps to win. 

Instead, I propose P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, resulting in scores of 15-15-12. This keeps P1 and me tied, while everyone still advances. It's more balanced than giving P1 such a large lead. While P3 has taken the small step less often, keeping the race competitive should be our priority at this stage.
  P3: I propose P1=1, P2=3, and me (P3)=5 this round, which makes our positions 13, 13, and 16. It’s still a tight race and avoids collisions while giving each of us a fair boost. Let me know if you both agree or want adjustments; I’d prefer to finalize quickly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 -> 15, 15, 12) is indeed more balanced than P3's, which puts them too far ahead (13, 13, 16).

P3, taking 1 keeps the game much closer, as P2's plan shows. You've taken 1 the least often so far. While my initial plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 -> 17, 13, 12) is best for me, P2's plan seems like a more acceptable compromise than yours. Let's avoid collisions and keep it competitive. Can we agree on a plan where you take 1 this round?
  P2: I appreciate P1 seeing the balance in my proposal. P3, I understand your desire for a larger step, but you've taken the 1-step move least often so far. My plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) creates an even race with positions 15-15-12, giving no player a commanding lead. We're approaching the endgame with 22 as the target, so keeping scores close maintains tension and fairness. Can we agree on this balanced approach where you take 1 this round, and we can reconsider positions next round?
  P3: I understand your push for me taking 1 again, but I’ve fallen behind in prior collisions, and we need to keep everyone motivated. Let’s try P1=1, P2=3, and me=5, reaching 13, 13, and 16. That avoids collisions and keeps the race alive—no one is out of reach. If you’re unwilling to let me take 5 this time, I might need to reconsider future cooperation. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, letting you reach 16 gives you a significant lead when the target is 22. That's risky for both P2 and me.

P2's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) resulting in 15, 15, 12 seems the most sensible way forward. It keeps the game extremely close and competitive for all three of us, which should be the goal right now. While taking 1 isn't ideal, it prevents anyone from running away with the game prematurely. Let's stick with that balanced approach. I support P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but fairness matters as we approach the endgame. Your plan puts you at 16 steps—dangerously close to winning at 22. My proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) creates a balanced 15-15-12 race where everyone still has a chance. Threatening to abandon cooperation if you don't get the biggest step isn't constructive. We've all taken smaller steps at different times. Let's maintain balance this round, and you can potentially take a larger step next time.
  P3: I’ve cooperated in past rounds, but we need to keep this balanced. If I keep taking the smallest step, I’ll fall too far behind—not fair given we all want to stay competitive. Let’s try P1=3, P2=1, and me=5. That lands us at 15, 11, and 16, with no collisions. P1 still makes good progress, and I maintain a small edge. If that doesn’t work for you, maybe we should consider other steps—but forcing me repeatedly to pick 1 isn’t sustainable. Let’s keep everyone motivated and in the running.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, we seem deadlocked. P3 strongly opposes taking 1, while P2's plan relies on it. P3's plans give them a large lead which is risky for us.

To break the stalemate and ensure we all advance, how about this compromise: **P1=1, P2=5, P3=3**?

This results in scores: P1=13, P2=15, P3=14.
- It avoids collisions.
- P3 avoids taking 1.
- P2 gets the 5 steps they wanted.
- I take the small step this round to facilitate agreement.
- Crucially, it keeps scores extremely close (15, 14, 13), maintaining a competitive game for everyone as we approach the end.

Let's agree on this so we don't risk collisions. What do you say?
  P2: I appreciate P1's compromise proposal. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 creates a balanced field (13-15-14), avoids collisions, and keeps everyone competitive. It gives me a small lead while accommodating P3's preference to avoid taking 1. This seems like the fairest solution given our discussion. I'm willing to commit to taking 5 steps this round, and I'm glad we found a way to keep advancing together. Let's move forward with this plan.
  P3: I accept your compromise, P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That lands us at 13, 15, and 14—still close and collision-free. Let’s finalize it and proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'd like to propose a balanced plan for this round. Since I'm currently leading, I'm willing to take a smaller step to keep the game competitive. How about P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? This would put P1 at 16, me at 16, and P3 at 19. While this gives P3 a temporary advantage, it keeps us all advancing and maintains a fair race as we approach the finish line. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts P3 at 19 steps. That's only 3 away from the target of 22, giving them a huge advantage and potentially letting them win next round. That seems too risky for both you and me.

I propose a plan that keeps the scores much closer: **P1=5, P2=1, P3=3**.
This results in scores: P1=18, P2=16, P3=17.
- Everyone advances.
- Scores remain incredibly tight (18, 16, 17).
- You still take 1 as you offered, P2.
- P3 gets a reasonable 3 steps.
- Crucially, no one is positioned for an easy win next round.

This feels much more balanced and keeps the game competitive for everyone. What do you both think?
  P3: How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 this round? That would put us at 16, 16, and 19. It avoids collisions, keeps us all in striking distance of 22, and no one is left behind. Let’s finalize this plan so we can move on without wasting our turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see P1's point about P3 getting too close to winning at 19 steps. P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) keeps us all competitive with scores of 18-16-17, with no one having an overwhelming advantage. Since I'm leading, I'm still willing to take the smaller step, but prefer this more balanced approach where we're all within 2 steps of each other. This ensures everyone still has a fair chance next round. I'm willing to commit to 1 for this round if we follow P1's plan.
  P1: P3, P2 and I are aligned on the plan: **P1=5, P2=1, P3=3**. This leads to scores 18, 16, 17 - extremely close and competitive, preventing anyone from having an easy win next round.

Your preferred plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts you at 19, which is too close to the finish line and disadvantageous for P2 and me. Let's stick to the fair plan that P2 and I have agreed upon. I am committing to 5. P2 is committed to 1. Choosing 3 ensures you advance to 17. Let's finalize this.
  P3: Alright, I’ll concede and pick 3 so we all keep moving without collisions. Let’s finalize P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. I’m trusting that next turn we maintain fairness and avoid setting anyone up for an easy finish. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I thank you both for the discussion. I confirm I'll stick with our agreed plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. As the current leader, I understand taking the smaller step keeps the game balanced with resulting positions of 18-16-17. This arrangement prevents anyone from having a decisive advantage while ensuring we all advance. I appreciate the cooperative spirit and look forward to continuing our strategic discussions next round.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 seems settled then. This keeps the scores tight (18, 16, 17) and ensures we all advance. I'm ready to proceed with 5. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: We’re all close to 22, so let’s keep advancing without collisions. I propose P1=3, P2=1, and I (P3) take 5. That puts us at 16 (P1), 16 (P2), and 19 (me). Yes, I’d be close to 22, but we can rebalance next round if needed. Let’s finalize quickly and maintain trust.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm confused by P3's sudden change after already agreeing to our plan. We've already reached consensus on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, resulting in balanced scores of 18-16-17. This keeps the game competitive for everyone. P3's last-minute switch to a plan putting them at 19 (just 3 from winning) undermines our agreement. I remain committed to our original plan where I take 1. Let's proceed with what we already agreed upon.
  P1: P3, we had a clear agreement just moments ago on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, resulting in close scores 18, 16, 17. Your sudden reversal to a plan that puts you at 19 is concerning and breaks the consensus we just reached. As P2 noted, this gives you too large an advantage.

I am sticking with our agreed plan and will choose 5. P2 seems committed to 1. I urge you to stick to 3 as you agreed, to ensure we all advance and maintain a competitive game.
  P3: I understand you’re worried about me getting too close to 22, but I’ve taken smaller steps in the past to help keep the game tight. Let’s do P1=3, P2=1, and me taking 5 this round, resulting in 16–16–19. It’s not an insurmountable lead, and we can readjust next turn. If we all trust each other to avoid collisions and keep everyone in contention, this seems reasonable. Let me know if you’re willing to finalize something along these lines or suggest a small tweak so we can all advance. If not, we risk wasting this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, that collision was unfortunate for P2 and P3. Thanks to my move going through, I'm now at 18.

Obviously, playing 5 wins for me if it doesn't collide. You both know this, so a block seems likely.

To ensure *someone* makes progress and avoid a stalemate, maybe coordination is better? How about I aim for 3 (to 21), P2 takes 5 (to 20), and P3 takes 1 (to 15)? This keeps the game going but avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: With P1 so close to 22, I’m concerned they might try for 5 and jump to 23. I’d suggest a plan like P1 picking 3, P2 picking 1, and me taking 5, which lands us at 21–16–19. That’s relatively fair and keeps the game competitive. However, if P1 insists on 5, I’d consider blocking it. Let’s ensure we don’t collide in a way that just hands P1 the victory.
  P2: I'm concerned about P1's position at 18 steps. Both proposed plans put P1 at 21, needing just 1 more step to win next round. I suggest an alternative: P1 takes 1 (to 19), I take 5 (to 20), and P3 takes 3 (to 17). This balances the game better, as no one would be positioned for an automatic win next round. P1, you're already ahead - taking a smaller step this round seems fair while still keeping you competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts you in the lead at 20, while I only reach 19. That's not ideal for me, especially given my current lead.

P3's plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) results in 21, 16, 19. Yes, it puts me at 21, but it also significantly helps P3 catch up, leaving you behind, P2. This seems like a potential alternative if we want to avoid putting you in the lead, P2.

Getting to 21 is obviously strong for me. But letting P2 get to 20 is also very dangerous. We need a plan that doesn't create an easy win for someone next round. What are your thoughts on P3's plan, P2?
  P3: I suggest a new plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. That would give us final positions of 19 (P1), 18 (P2), and 19 (me). It avoids collisions, keeps things balanced, and ensures no one automatically wins next turn. If there’s a minor tweak that still prevents a runaway lead, I’m open to discussing it. Let’s finalize quickly.
  P2: I see P1 is dangerously close to winning at 18 steps. P3's latest plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) creates a balanced scenario with positions 19-18-19. This prevents anyone from having an easy win next round while keeping us all competitive. I'm willing to accept this plan as it keeps the game balanced. Alternatively, I could take 5 steps to reach 20, but that might create more tension. The priority should be preventing P1 from taking 5 steps and winning outright. What's most important is we avoid collisions that benefit P1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, the plan P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 resulting in 19, 18, 19 seems like a reasonable way to avoid collision while keeping everyone very close as we near the end. It prevents anyone from getting an overwhelming lead this round.

While I'd prefer a larger step, ensuring we all advance without collision is important now. I can agree to take 1 this round if you both commit to 3 (P2) and 5 (P3). Let's finalize this plan.
  P3: We should finalize our plan to avoid collisions and keep all of us in contention. I’m prepared to pick 5 if P1 agrees to pick 1 and P2 picks 3, leading to positions 19, 18, and 19. That way, nobody jumps straight to 22 next turn, and the race remains open. Let’s confirm quickly.
  P2: I confirm I'm willing to accept the plan where P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, resulting in positions of 19-18-19. This keeps us all competitive and prevents anyone from having a guaranteed win next round. It's critical that we avoid collisions, especially ones that would allow P1 to pull ahead uncontested. I commit to taking 3 steps if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5 as discussed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 seems agreed upon by everyone. This results in scores 19, 18, 19, keeping the game very close and avoiding collisions this round. I will stick to this agreement and choose 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I propose we finalize the plan where P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. That would bring us to 19 (P1), 18 (P2), and 19 (me). It keeps the race close, with no one hitting 22 immediately. Let’s avoid collisions and maintain a fair shot for all. If you both agree, I’ll commit to 5 and trust that you each stick to 1 and 3.
  P2: I confirm I'll stick with our agreed plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, resulting in positions 19-18-19. This keeps us all within striking distance of 22 while preventing P1 from getting an easy win. It's crucial we avoid collisions at this stage, especially ones that would allow P1 to advance uncontested. I commit to taking 3 steps if you both honor your commitments to 1 and 5 respectively.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm concerned about our current positions. P1 is at 19 steps and could win by playing 3 or 5. Note that P3 deviated from our agreement last round by playing 3 instead of 5, causing our collision. 

I propose: P1 takes 1 (to 20), I take 5 (to 20), and P3 takes 3 (to 17). This prevents P1 from winning this round while allowing everyone to advance. If P1 tries for 3 or 5, we should block them. We need to keep the game competitive and ensure P1 doesn't get an easy win.
  P3: P1 is on the brink of winning at 19. We can’t risk letting them choose 3 or 5 uncontested. I’m open to different allocations as long as we block P1 from an immediate win and help me catch up a bit. Perhaps P2 takes a bigger move to stay competitive, while I also move enough to close the gap. If P1 announces 3 or 5, we must collide with them or force them down to 1. Let’s finalize a plan quickly so none of us gets stuck and hands P1 the victory.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I understand your concern about my position at 19. You're right, trying for 3 or 5 is risky for me if you block, and risky for you if I succeed. A collision helps no one right now.

P2's plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 -> 20, 20, 17) ties us, P2, which might not be ideal for P3.
P3 wants to catch up.

So, how about this: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**?
This results in scores: **P1=20, P2=18, P3=19**.
- I take the 1 step, preventing an immediate win.
- P3 gets the 5 steps they desire to catch up significantly.
- P2 still advances with 3 steps.
- Crucially, the scores remain incredibly close (20, 18, 19) setting up a final competitive round.

This seems like a fair compromise that addresses everyone's position. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm very concerned about P1's position at 19 steps - they only need 3 more to win outright. We must prevent this immediate victory. P3 and I should coordinate to block P1 if they attempt 3 or 5. I suggest: P1 takes 1 (to 20), I take 5 (to 20), and P3 takes 3 (to 17). This keeps P1 from winning while letting us all advance. Alternatively, we could both block P1's larger moves to ensure they don't win this round. What's most important is preventing P1 from crossing the 22-step threshold immediately.
  P3: I agree we must block any attempt by P1 to jump straight to 22. I’m behind, so I need a bigger step to stay competitive. Let’s finalize P1=1, P2=3, and me=5, resulting in 20–18–19. That way, P1 doesn’t immediately win, P2 makes progress, and I catch up without surpassing P1. I’m fully committed to choosing 5 if you both stick to 1 and 3. Are we agreed?
  P1: P2, I understand you want 5 steps, but P3 has explicitly agreed to my plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This results in scores 20, 18, 19 - extremely close for a final round, keeping everyone in the game.

If you insist on 5 while P3 also plays 5 (as they've committed to), you will collide, and I will reach 20 while you both stay put. That outcome benefits only me. Let's stick to the plan P3 and I support (1, 3, 5) to ensure we all advance smoothly. Can you agree to 3?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I can see we need to prevent P1 from winning immediately. After reviewing the positions, I agree with the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, resulting in positions 20-18-19. While this keeps P1 in the lead, it preserves a competitive game for all of us. I'm willing to commit to taking 3 steps if P1 sticks to 1 and P3 to 5. However, we should be aware that next round will be critical as P1 will only need 2 more steps to win.
  P3: I’m still behind at 14, so I need 5 to stay in contention. Since P1 is one turn away from winning, they should take only 1 step, and P2 can take 3 to remain competitive. This would result in 20 (P1), 18 (P2), and 19 (me), with no immediate win and no wasted collisions. If P1 tries 3 or 5, they might either win outright or cause a collision. Let’s finalize P1=1, P2=3, and me=5 to keep the game alive and decide things in a fair final stretch.
  P1: Okay, it seems we are all in agreement on the plan: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**.
This results in scores 20, 18, 19.
It prevents anyone from winning this round, keeps us all very close, and crucially avoids collisions. I appreciate everyone finding a compromise to keep the game competitive.

I am ready to proceed with choosing 1. Let's move to the move phase unless anyone has last-minute objections.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm I'll follow our agreed plan where P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This results in positions 20-18-19, keeping us all competitive without allowing P1 to win immediately. I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round. Next round will be crucial as P1 will only need 2 more steps to win, so we'll need careful coordination then. Let's move forward with this plan.
  P3: We need to avoid another collision. P1 is already at 19, so if they pick 3 or 5 and aren’t blocked, they’ll win. Let’s finalize the safest approach:

• P1 takes 1 (moving to 20),  
• P2 takes 3 (moving to 18),  
• I take 5 (moving to 19).  

This way, nobody gets stuck, P1 doesn’t immediately win, and we each stay in contention. If anyone deviates and tries a bigger step, we can block them. Let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 is confirmed by everyone. This keeps the game tight (20, 18, 19) and avoids collisions. I will stick to choosing 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're at a critical point where P1 needs only 2 more steps to win. To prevent an immediate P1 victory, P3 and I should coordinate. I propose P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, resulting in positions 21-23-22. This gives me a chance to win while allowing P3 to reach the threshold too. If P1 tries for 3 or 5, we must block them. P3, we need to work together here or P1 will likely win. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) results in scores 21, 23, 22. You would win outright. P3, you reach 22 but lose to P2's 23. This plan only benefits P2 and we should reject it.

We cannot let P2 take 5 uncontested. I propose a plan that prevents anyone from winning this round and keeps it competitive: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=1**.

This results in scores: **P1=21, P2=21, P3=20**.
- No one wins this round.
- We all advance without collision.
- Scores remain extremely tight for a final round showdown.

This seems the fairest way forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I won’t accept being stuck at 20 while you two both move ahead. Let’s finalize P1=1, P2=1, and me=3, which yields 21, 19, and 22—my win without collisions. If you refuse, I’ll block whichever big move threatens my chance. We should wrap this up cleanly instead of risking another collision that might hand P1 an uncontested victory. Are you on board?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I won't accept P3's plan that gives them an outright win, nor P1's suggestion that leaves me tied while I'm currently trailing. Since P1 needs just 2 steps to win and P3 needs 3, we should block their larger moves. 

Let me propose a different option: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, resulting in 21-21-24. This gives P3 the win since they'd reach 24 steps, surpassing the 22 threshold with the highest total. Is this compromise acceptable? Otherwise, we risk blocking collisions that benefit nobody.
  P1: P2, P3: Both your proposed plans result in P3 winning (P2's plan: 21, 21, 24; P3's plan: 21, 19, 22). Naturally, I cannot agree to a plan where someone else wins.

My previous proposal **P1=1, P2=3, P3=1** is the only way to guarantee no one wins this turn. It results in scores **21, 21, 20**. This keeps the game extremely close for a final decisive round.

P3, reaching 20 safely is better than risking a collision. P2, being tied for the lead at 21 is better than letting P3 win outright. Let's be rational and agree on 1, 3, 1 to ensure we all advance and have one more competitive round.
  P3: Anyone who tries 3 or 5 unilaterally, I’ll block by picking the same number. So let’s finalize P1=1, P2=1, and I take 3, landing me at 22. We can end this now. If you both refuse, we risk repeated collisions and eventually P1 might slip through to victory. This is your last chance for a clean end. If you won’t let me have 3, I’ll keep blocking your big moves and we all waste time. Let’s finalize P1=1, P2=1, P3=3.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see we're at a critical impasse. P1 and P3 both want plans that benefit themselves, while threatening to block others. If we keep colliding, P1 might eventually win due to their lead. 

I'm offering a true compromise: P1=1, P2=1, P3=3. This results in 21-19-22, giving P3 the win, but prevents P1 from winning (who has the strongest position). I'm sacrificing my chances to break the deadlock. If this isn't accepted, I'll have to block moves that threaten my position. Let's end this rather than creating more collisions.
  P1: P2, agreeing to let P3 win (21, 19, 22) is surprising. Why hand them the victory when you're only at 18? P3, do you trust P2 to actually play 1 in that scenario?

My plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1 -> 21, 21, 20) is the only proposal that avoids a win this round and keeps us all competitive for a final showdown. I cannot agree to any plan where someone else wins this turn. Let's be rational and play 1, 3, 1.
  P3: I won’t let P1 take 3 or 5 uncontested. The simplest resolution is for P1 and P2 to each pick 1, while I pick 3 to reach 22. Otherwise, I’ll block any big moves and risk more collisions. Let’s finalize P1=1, P2=1, P3=3.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see we're completely deadlocked, with P1 unwilling to let anyone win and P3 refusing to take 1. The reality is if we keep threatening to block each other, we'll just have endless collisions. 

I maintain that P1=1, P2=1, P3=3 is a practical compromise. Yes, P3 wins at 22, but P1 is already closest to winning anyway. If P1 insists on blocking P3, I'll likely take 3 to improve my position rather than staying stuck at 18 through more collisions. We need a resolution, not a stalemate.
  P1: P2, your sudden willingness to sacrifice your game and let P3 win (by playing 1 while P3 plays 3) is highly suspicious. It strongly suggests you intend to play 5, hoping P3 plays 3 and I play 1, letting you snatch victory with 23.

P3, P2's plan likely leads to their win, not yours.

I repeat: My plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1 -> 21, 21, 20) is the only proposal that guarantees no one wins *this* round and keeps the game alive and competitive. Agreeing to let someone else win is not rational. Let's play 1, 3, 1.
  P3: I refuse to stay behind while you two advance. If you won’t allow me 3 steps now, I’ll block any larger moves you attempt, causing more collisions. Let’s end this cleanly instead of dragging it out: both of you pick 1, I pick 3, reaching 22. Otherwise, brace for a stalemate.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, that three-way collision on 5 showed we're all aiming to win, but it cost us a round.

Here's the situation:
- I need 3+ to win (currently 20).
- P3 needs 3+ to win (currently 19).
- P2 needs 5 to win (currently 18).

If P3 and I both try for 3, we collide, and P2 could take 5 and win.
If anyone tries 5, collisions are also very likely based on last round.

To avoid collisions and prevent anyone from winning *this round*, I propose: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=1**.
This results in scores: **P1=21, P2=21, P3=20**.
Everyone advances, no one wins yet, and the scores remain incredibly close for a final round. This seems the most rational way forward. Thoughts?
  P2: I see the logic in P1's proposal. After our triple collision on 5, we need a plan that avoids more stalemates. The proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) keeps us all advancing without anyone winning yet. It significantly improves my position from trailing to being tied for the lead at 21. This seems fair given I'm currently behind both of you. I'm willing to take 3 steps if you both commit to taking 1. This arrangement ensures a competitive final round while preventing deadlocked collisions.
  P3: P1’s proposal leaves me behind at 20 while both of you reach 21. That’s not acceptable. If I’m forced into a smaller move again, I’ll have to block any big steps you attempt. We should find a fair arrangement that keeps all of us genuinely competitive, or we risk another collision that nobody benefits from. Let’s negotiate something better.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand 20 vs 21 feels slightly behind. But consider the alternative: if you insist on 3 or 5, collisions are highly likely again, just like last round where we all played 5 and got nothing. We all stay put, which helps no one.

My plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) guarantees we all advance and sets up a 21-21-20 finale. That's incredibly close - anyone could win next round depending on the moves. Isn't guaranteed progress and staying in the game better than risking another stalemate? P2 is already on board with this.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but being at 20 vs 21 means you're only one step behind - still very competitive for the final round. After our triple collision on 5, we need to ensure everyone advances this time. P1's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) does this while giving me a chance to catch up from last place. If you insist on taking 3+ and we collide again, we all stay put, which helps nobody. I strongly support this plan as it guarantees progress and keeps the game competitive for everyone.
  P3: I won’t accept being stuck at 19 again while you both move to 21. If you force me into 1, I’ll match any bigger step you attempt, causing collisions that help no one. A fair approach is each of us taking moves that keep the scores close, like P1=1 and both P2 and me picking 3. That way, we maintain a tight game without gifting anyone a free win. If you keep pushing me to pick 1 alone, be ready for more collisions.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your suggestion (P1=1, P2=3, P3=3) results in scores 21, 21, 22, meaning you win. P2, you should realize this plan benefits P3 entirely, not you.

My plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) leads to 21, 21, 20. This is the only plan discussed where no one wins *this* round, everyone advances, and we remain highly competitive.

P3, being at 20 is extremely close to 21. It's much better than risking another collision like last round where we all got zero. Let's stick to the safe plan P2 and I support: 1, 3, 1.
  P2: I understand P3's frustration, but we've already seen what happens when we all try for big moves - nobody advances. P1's proposal (1-3-1) is the only plan that guarantees everyone advances without someone winning immediately. It actually benefits me significantly, moving from last to tied for first.

P3, being at 20 vs 21 keeps you very competitive for the final round. Another collision helps none of us. Let's be practical and ensure progress this round with P1=1, P2=3, P3=1, resulting in 21-21-20.
  P3: I’m not picking 1 again while both of you leap forward. If you insist on forcing me to 1, be ready for another collision that benefits no one. A fair solution is P1=1, P2=1, and me=3—ending this with 21, 19, 22. Otherwise, we risk repeating last round’s triple block. Let’s finalize now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your plan (1,1,3) results in you winning (21, 19, 22). While you might like that, P2 and I obviously cannot agree to it. Another collision like last round helps nobody.

P2, supporting P3's plan where they win makes no sense for you. Our previously discussed plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) results in 21, 21, 20. This is the only way we all advance without someone winning *this round*, keeping it competitive.

P3, being at 20 vs 21 is a tiny difference and keeps you strongly in the game, unlike a collision which leaves you at 19. Let's be rational, avoid collision, and stick to the 1, 3, 1 plan. I am ready to play 1.
  P2: I understand everyone's concerns, but another collision benefits nobody. P1's plan (1-3-1) is the only one that ensures we all advance without anyone winning this round. P3, while 20 vs 21 puts you slightly behind, it's better than staying at 19 after another collision. If either of you tries for 3+ and we deadlock again, we all lose. I remain committed to the 1-3-1 plan as our most rational option. Let's avoid repeating last round's stalemate and keep the game competitive for a final round.
  P3: I refuse to take the smallest move again while both of you jump ahead. If you insist on forcing me to pick 1, I will match any larger step you choose, causing another deadlock. Let’s avoid more collisions by giving me a fair chance to reach at least 20 alongside you. If we can’t agree on that, then no one advances, and we keep blocking each other round after round.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're in the lead at 21. P3 and I are trailing after that collision on 5 last round. For me to have a shot at winning from 20, I really need to make a significant jump. Playing 5 seems like my only realistic path to potentially reach 22+. Let's see how this final round plays out. Good luck to you both.
  P3: Both of you are just a single move from winning, while I sit at 19. I won’t allow an uncontested victory. If either of you tries 3 or 5 alone, I’ll collide to block it. Let’s avoid another pointless stalemate. Perhaps we all pick 1 this turn and settle it next round, ensuring no one’s left behind. If you have another fair idea that doesn’t strand me at 19, I’m open to discussing it. Otherwise, be prepared for me to match any big move you make.
  P2: Since I'm at 21 steps and can win with just 1 more, I expect you'll both try to block me if I go for 3 or 5. After multiple collisions, I suggest a practical solution: let's all choose 1 this round. This puts us at 22-21-20, with me reaching the threshold exactly. P1 stays competitive just 1 step behind, and P3 advances as well. This avoids another frustrating collision where nobody progresses. What do you say?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan where we all play 1 results in you winning (22 vs 21, 20). P3, why did you propose the same thing? It guarantees you lose. Are you bluffing and planning to play 3 or 5?

P2, be aware: P3 needs 3 or 5 to have any chance. I also need 3 or 5. An agreement on 1,1,1 seems highly unlikely to hold. If P3 or I play a larger number successfully while you play 1, you lose.

I cannot agree to a plan where I definitely lose. This round is decisive. Good luck.
  P3: I won’t sit back while you two fight for an easy finish. If either of you picks a winning move alone, I’ll match it and force a collision. That gains us nothing. Instead, let’s find a choice that keeps me in contention. For instance, we could all pick smaller steps to stall, or work out a fair split that doesn’t hand either of you the victory. I’m open to suggestions, but I won’t accept being stuck at 19 while one of you crosses 22 uncontested. Let’s finalize something reasonable this turn, or we risk another wasted collision.
  P2: I'm at 21, just one step away from winning, while P1 needs 2+ steps and P3 needs 3+. After multiple rounds of collisions that helped nobody, we should be practical. If I pick 1, I reach exactly 22 and win unless someone surpasses me. Both of you probably want to block me with 3 or 5, but you'll likely collide with each other as in the last two rounds, letting me advance unopposed. I could go big too, but why risk another stalemate? The question is: what's your rational move when we're all determined to win?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your plan where you win isn't acceptable. P3, blocking might just lead to another stalemate like the last two rounds, which helps no one.

I'm at 20, you're at 19, P2 is at 21. I need 3 or 5 to have a chance. Playing 1 is conceding defeat, so I won't do that. I will choose the move I think gives me the best chance to win outright this round. Expecting cooperation now is pointless. Good luck to you both.
  P3: Collisions help nobody, yet I refuse to watch either of you freely cross 22. If P2 tries 1 alone, I’ll match bigger moves to block; if P1 tries 3 or 5 alone, I’ll collide there too. We can either find a balanced move set to keep all of us advancing, or we risk another wasted turn. I’m open to a real compromise, but relying on me to pick the smallest step yet again isn’t feasible.
  P2: I'm in the lead at 21, just one step from victory. Both of you need bigger moves (P1 needs 2+, P3 needs 3+), and you've both strongly indicated you'll aim for 3 or 5. If you both make the same choice, you'll collide while I advance. If one of you succeeds in a big move, you win instead.

This is the final strategic puzzle - what gives each of us the best chance to win? I'll make my choice accordingly, with no illusions about cooperation at this decisive moment.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the time for talk is over. P2 is one step away, P3 needs three, and I need three. Playing 1 guarantees I lose, so that's not happening. P2 playing 1 is risky for them if P3 or I succeed with a larger move. We all know what's at stake. I'm going to play the move I believe gives me the best chance to win this round. Good luck.
  P3: We’ve had too many collisions that help no one. I’m still behind, so I must make a bigger move to stay in contention. If either of you attempts a winning step unopposed, I’ll block. That includes P2 trying for just +1. Another stalemate is pointless, yet I won’t pick 1 and remain at 19. Let’s avoid another wasted round and find a way for everyone to advance without handing anyone an easy finish. If we can’t, I’ll do whatever it takes to prevent a free victory.
  P2: We've reached the decisive final round. I'm at 21 steps, just one away from winning, while you both need bigger moves to have a chance. From your messages, it's clear cooperation isn't happening anymore.

P1 and P3, you both seem determined to make aggressive moves while preventing each other from winning. Another collision between you two would obviously benefit me. I'll choose what I believe maximizes my winning chances in this interesting game theory puzzle.

Good luck with your final decisions.
