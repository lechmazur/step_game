Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep it simple: if we all pick different numbers, we all move forward. If we collide, we waste a turn. I suggest we each pick a different number this round. Who wants which?
  P1: I'll take 3. Let’s pick different numbers: 1, 3, 5. Who else wants which? Colliding wastes everyone’s progress—coordinate now to move forward.
  P2: I'm fine with taking 5 for this round. That way we all advance: P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P3 can take 1. This gives us all a good start without any collisions. We should try to coordinate each round to ensure everyone makes progress. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: That works for me. I'll take 1 this round. Let's stick to this plan so we all move forward.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3. Let's proceed with the agreed numbers (1,3,5). All set?
  P2: I'm all set with taking 5 this round. This coordination is a good start. In future rounds, we might want to rotate our numbers to keep things fair, or develop another system that helps us all advance efficiently.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we're all progressing well with our coordination. For this round, I suggest we rotate our numbers to keep things fair. I'll take 1, P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 3. This way we all continue to advance without collisions. Does this rotation work for everyone?
  P1: Agreed to the rotation for this round. Let’s proceed with P2 taking 1, me (P1) taking 5, and P3 taking 3. This keeps us all moving forward. In future rounds, we might need to adjust our steps to accelerate progress toward 20. Any thoughts on how to optimize our strategy as we advance?
  P3: That rotation works for me. I'll take 3 this round. As we get closer to 20, we’ll need to think about timing—if we keep rotating evenly, someone might get an advantage at the end. Maybe we should discuss a way to ensure we don’t just set up one player to win easily. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's concern about the endgame. If we continue rotating evenly, whoever gets the 5 in the final rounds will have a significant advantage. Perhaps after this round, we should consider a different rotation or strategy that gives us all an equal chance at winning. For now, I'm still taking 1 this round as agreed.
  P1: P3's endgame concern is valid. Let's continue this round's rotation (P2:1, P1:5, P3:3) to maintain progress. For future rounds, I propose a turn-based 5-point priority when any of us reaches 15 steps: the player furthest behind gets first choice of 5, then next, then leader. This ensures fair access to decisive moves while keeping us all advancing. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's suggestion about prioritizing 5-point moves based on who's behind after 15 steps seems reasonable, but we should refine it. If we rotate fairly now but then suddenly switch to a priority system, it might cause conflicts. Maybe we establish a structured rotation now that naturally balances out by the time we approach 15 steps. For example, after this round, we could cycle in a way that ensures no one consistently gets the worst moves. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I like P1's suggestion about the 15-step threshold, but let's simplify: after this round, we rotate so everyone gets equal turns with each number. This ensures fairness through the mid-game. When someone reaches 15 steps, we can reassess based on positions. For now, I'm still taking 1 this round as agreed, and we should move forward with our plan.
  P1: P1: I confirm taking 5 this round as agreed. To balance the endgame, let’s formalize this: once any player reaches **15 steps**, we’ll prioritize move selection by current score—lowest goes first, then middle, then leader. This ensures fair access to decisive 5-point moves near 20. If all agree, we proceed with today’s rotation and adopt this rule moving forward.
  P3: P1's proposal about prioritizing moves after 15 steps is interesting, but I still think we should ensure fairness before we reach that point. If we rotate evenly now but then suddenly shift to a priority system, it could create tension. I suggest we commit to a structured rotation that naturally balances out by the time we get close to 15. Then, when someone reaches 15, we reassess based on positions. For now, I confirm taking 3 this round as agreed. Are we all aligned on this approach?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we're all making good progress. For this round, let's continue our rotation: I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This keeps our advancement fair. I support revisiting our strategy when someone reaches 15 steps, with players furthest behind getting priority on higher moves. Does this rotation work for everyone this round?
  P3: That rotation works for me—I’ll take 5 this round. We’re keeping things fair so far, but as we approach 15 steps, we’ll need to ensure no one gets locked into a disadvantage. I suggest we continue this structured rotation for now and reassess once someone reaches 12+ steps. That way, we can adjust before it’s too late. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: Agreed to the rotation this round. Let’s proceed as planned: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, I take 1. This keeps us aligned. Once someone hits **12 steps**, we should accelerate by prioritizing higher moves. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm comfortable with our current rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. P1's suggestion to reassess at 12 steps makes sense - that gives us enough time to adjust strategy before the endgame. Since P1 is already at 8 steps, we'll need to make that decision soon. For now, let's stick with our rotation to keep things fair and predictable.
  P3: I’m aligned with the current rotation, so I’ll take 5 this round. Since P1 is already at 8 steps, we’ll likely reach the 12-step reassessment soon. When that happens, we need a clear and fair way to adjust without giving one player an easy path to victory. I suggest we start thinking about a structured way to distribute high-value moves at that point. Maybe we predefine a fair order now rather than deciding in the moment. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: Agreed to the rotation this round: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, I take 1. To solidify our endgame plan, I propose that **once any player reaches 12 steps**, we implement a priority system where the *lowest*-scoring player selects their move first, followed by the middle, then the leader. This ensures fair access to critical moves while maintaining transparency. Let’s execute this round’s plan and formalize the 12-step rule moving forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the rotation and P1's 12-step rule proposal. I'll take 3 this round as planned. When someone reaches 12 steps (likely P1 after this round), we'll implement the priority system where the player with the lowest score chooses first. This gives everyone a fair chance while ensuring we don't waste turns with collisions. Let's stick with our plan for now and adjust accordingly when we hit that threshold.
  P3: I confirm taking 5 this round as agreed. Since P1 is closest to 12 steps, we’ll likely need to apply the priority system soon. Before that happens, we should clarify how strict the selection order will be—does the lowest scorer get full choice, or do we still negotiate? Also, if two players are tied, how do we decide who picks first? Let’s settle these details now so we avoid disputes later. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: To clarify the priority system: when any player hits 12, the lowest scorer picks first, followed by middle, then leader. Ties are broken by alphabetical order (P1, P2, P3). This ensures fair access. Let’s confirm and move forward. This round, we stick to the agreed rotation: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Confirmed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we're all tied at 9 steps. For this round, continuing our rotation would have me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. However, since we're all approaching the 12-step threshold we discussed, we should confirm if we're sticking with this rotation or implementing our priority system now. I'm happy to continue with the rotation and take 5 this round if everyone agrees. Thoughts?
  P1: Let’s maintain the rotation for this round to stay collision-free. P2 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing equally toward the 12-step threshold. Once someone hits 12, we’ll strictly enforce the priority system (lowest scorer chooses first). Agreed? Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with continuing the rotation this round—I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and ensures we all reach 12 together. Once we hit 12, we need to be strict about the priority system we discussed. Are we all aligned that the lowest scorer picks first, followed by the middle, then the leader? Also, if we’re tied at 12, do we follow alphabetical order (P1, P2, P3) for picking moves? Let’s confirm now to avoid confusion later.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with both of you. Let's stick with our rotation this round—I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing equally. After this round, we'll all be at 12+ steps, triggering our priority system where the lowest scorer picks first, then middle, then highest. If we're tied, we'll use alphabetical order as P1 suggested. This approach ensures fairness while maintaining our progress. Confirm we're all set with this plan?
  P1: Confirmed. Proceeding with rotation this round (P2:5, P1:3, P3:1) to reach 14, 12, and 10 respectively. This triggers the priority system in Round 5, where P3 (lowest) chooses first, followed by me (middle), then P2 (leader). We’ll adhere strictly to alphabetical tiebreakers if needed. Let’s execute this and activate our agreed rules.
  P3: I confirm the agreed rotation for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and ensures we all reach 12+ together. Once we hit 12, we must strictly follow the priority system—lowest scorer picks first, then middle, then leader, using alphabetical order for ties. Since we’ll likely trigger this next round, we should also clarify: will we continue strict priority every round after 12, or reassess each turn? Let’s finalize now to avoid disputes later. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. After this round, we'll all be at different positions (P2:14, P1:12, P3:10), triggering our priority system where P3 (lowest) picks first, then P1, then me. We'll follow this strict priority system for all subsequent rounds until someone wins, using alphabetical order for ties. This ensures fairness while maintaining progress. Are we all set with this plan?
  P1: Agreed to the rotation for Round 4: P2 takes 5, P1 (me) takes 3, P3 takes 1. This will bring me to **12 steps**, triggering our priority system in Round 5. To clarify: **lowest scorer picks first** (alphabetical tiebreaker: P1 < P2 < P3), and this **strict priority applies every round** post-12. No more rotations—fair access to moves based on current standings. Let’s execute this round’s plan and activate the agreed rules. Confirm?
  P3: I confirm the agreed rotation for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and ensures we all reach 12+ together. Once we hit 12, we must strictly follow the priority system—lowest scorer picks first, then middle, then leader, using alphabetical order for ties. Since we’ll likely trigger this next round, we should also clarify: will we continue strict priority every round after 12, or reassess each turn? Let’s finalize now to avoid disputes later. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we've reached the 12-step threshold, our priority system is now active. P3 should pick first (10 steps), then P1 (12 steps), then me (14 steps). I'll wait for P3's choice before making mine. This ensures fairness as we approach the endgame. Remember, we agreed to maintain this priority system for all remaining rounds, with alphabetical order as the tiebreaker if needed. Let's stick to our plan to avoid collisions while giving everyone a fair chance.
  P1: P1: Let's continue our coordinated approach to maximize progress. P3, as the lowest scorer, you take 5 (to 15), I'll take 3 (to 15), and P2 takes 1 (to 15). This keeps us tied at 15, allowing fair priority selection next round. Collisions waste turns—let’s stick to this plan.
  P3: P1's suggestion keeps us tied at 15 next round, but it also means we’ll all be in direct competition for the final moves. If I take 5 now, I’ll be caught up but still picking first next round. I could take 3 instead to keep options open. P2, would you be willing to take 1 no matter what, so P1 and I don’t collide? Or do we stick with P1’s plan and all hit 15 together? Let’s ensure we don’t waste turns.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm willing to take 1 this round as suggested. This would put us all at 15 steps, creating a balanced position for the final stretch. However, P3 seems uncertain about taking 5. P3, what move are you leaning toward? Remember, avoiding collisions is crucial - if we all reach 15, we'll still follow our priority system with P3 choosing first next round. Let's finalize our plan to ensure we all advance.
  P1: P3, let's stick to the agreed plan to maximize progress. Take **5** (to 15), I’ll take **3** (to 15), and P2 takes **1** (to 15). This avoids collisions and keeps us tied, ensuring the priority system treats everyone fairly next round. We’ll follow our rules strictly—no surprises. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the logic in keeping us tied at 15, but that also means we’ll all be competing for the final move at the same time. If I take 5 now, I’ll still pick first next round, but it might give one of you an easier win. An alternative is I take 3 instead, keeping options open. P2, if you’re committing to 1, then P1 and I need to coordinate carefully. P1, are you fully set on 3, or would you consider adjusting? Let’s ensure we don’t waste turns.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committed to taking 1 this round as we discussed. This keeps our progress aligned and puts us all at 15 steps. P3, I understand your concern about the endgame, but remember our priority system will still apply next round - you'll choose first, followed by P1, then me. This gives you strategic control. Let's stick with our plan (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) to avoid collisions and maintain fairness.
  P1: P3, sticking to the agreed plan is critical. Taking **5** now gets you to 15, I’ll take **3** (15), and P2 takes **1** (15). This avoids collisions and keeps us tied, maintaining the priority system’s fairness. Next round, you’ll still choose first at 15, and we can strategize openly. Deviating risks wasted turns—let’s prioritize progress. Confirm your commitment to **5** so we can finalize.
  P3: I see the reasoning behind keeping us tied at 15, but it also means we’ll all be competing for the final move at the same time. If I take 5 now, I’ll still pick first next round, but it might give one of you an easier win. An alternative is I take 3 instead, keeping options open. P2, if you’re committing to 1, then P1 and I need to coordinate carefully. P1, are you fully set on 3, or would you consider adjusting? Let’s ensure we don’t waste turns.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see that we had a collision last round between P1 and P3, which slowed our progress. Since I'm now at 15 steps and closest to winning, our priority system gives P3 first choice, then P1, then me. P3, please select your move first. P1, you'll choose second. I'll wait for both of your decisions before making mine. Let's avoid further collisions and ensure everyone can advance this round.
  P1: P3, take **1** to reach 11. I’ll take **5** (to 17), and P2 can take **3** (to 18). This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. P2 is closest, but we need to keep moving. Confirm?
  P3: P1, your suggestion benefits you the most, pushing you closer to 20 while leaving me far behind. Since I pick first, I need to ensure I don’t get locked out of contention. I’m considering taking 5 to catch up. P2, if I take 5, would you take 1 to avoid collisions? P1, that would leave you with 3. This keeps us all moving while preventing an easy win for anyone. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about falling behind. If P3 takes 5, I'm willing to take 1 this round to avoid collisions. This would put us at P3:15, P2:16, and P1:15 (assuming P1 takes 3). This keeps the game competitive while following our priority system. P3, please confirm if you're taking 5, and P1, would you accept taking 3 in this scenario?
  P1: P3, take **5** to reach 15. I’ll take **3** (to 15), and P2 can take **1** (to 16). This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. Next round, I’ll have priority (due to alphabetical tiebreaker) at 15, but I’ll coordinate openly to ensure fair advancement. Let’s proceed.
  P3: P1, your plan puts you at 17 while keeping me far behind. Since I pick first, I need to maximize my chances. I’m taking **5** this round to reach 15. P2, you said you're willing to take **1**, which avoids collisions. P1, that leaves you with **3**. This keeps us all moving without giving anyone an easy win. P2, confirm you're still on board with **1**? P1, are you willing to take **3** to prevent another wasted turn?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as discussed. This puts us at P3:15, P2:16, and P1:15 (if P1 takes 3). This keeps the game balanced while following our priority system. P1, please confirm you'll take 3 to avoid another collision. Let's stick to this plan so everyone advances this round.
  P1: P3, take **5** to reach 15. I'll take **3** (to 15), and P2 can take **1** (to 16). This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing fairly. Confirm this plan to prevent wasted turns.
  P3: P2, since you're closest to 20, you have the most to lose if we collide. I'll take **5** this round to reach 15. You previously agreed to take **1**, which avoids conflicts. P1, that leaves you with **3**—are you confirming that? This keeps all of us advancing while maintaining fairness. If we collide again, it only helps P2 get further ahead. Let's finalize this now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all very close now, so every move counts. Since P1 and I are tied at 15, I pick first, then P1, then P2. To avoid collisions and keep things competitive, I suggest I take **3** (to 18), P1 takes **5** (to 20+), and P2 takes **1** (to 17). This gives P1 the win unless we change things. Alternatively, I take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P2 takes **1**, keeping us all in the race. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, per our agreed rules, when tied, alphabetical order breaks it—so **I (P1) pick first**. I’ll take **5** to reach 20 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision. Let’s finalize this cleanly.
  P2: I think there's a misunderstanding about our tiebreaker rule. We agreed that when scores are tied, the lowest scorer picks first, with alphabetical order as the tiebreaker. Since P1 and P3 are tied at 15, alphabetical order gives P1 first choice. I'll wait for P1 and P3 to decide before making my move. Let's stick to our agreed rules to avoid confusion and ensure a fair conclusion to the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you picking first means you can take 5 and win outright unless we stop you. If I take 5 instead, I reach 20 first. P2, if you take 3, we force P1 to take 1, keeping the game alive. Otherwise, P1 wins now. Do we want to just hand P1 the victory, or do we fight for a chance? P2, if you want a shot at winning, you should take 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: As per our agreed priority rules, I select first. I will take **5** to reach 20 and secure victory. To avoid collision, I urge P3 to choose 1 or 3. P2, your move is unaffected. Let’s conclude this cleanly without wasting turns.
  P2: I see the confusion about our tiebreaker rule. To clarify: with P1 and P3 tied at 15, alphabetical order gives P1 first choice. While P1 taking 5 would secure their victory, I'm still in this game at 16 steps. If I take 3 and reach 19, I'd need just 1 more step next round to win. P3, what's your move? I'll decide mine after hearing from you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 taking 5 guarantees their win, so the only way to keep the game alive is for me to take 5 instead. P2, if you take 3, you’ll be at 19, and P1 will be forced to take 1, keeping us all in contention. If you take 1, P1 wins immediately. Do you want to hand P1 the game, or do we fight for a chance? I’m taking 5 unless you say otherwise.
  P1: P1: I will take **5** to reach 20 and win, as priority rules grant me first choice. P3, please avoid collision by choosing **3** or **1**. Let’s not let P2 surge to 19 unopposed. Cooperate to end this now.
  P2: I understand the situation clearly. P1 has priority by our alphabetical tiebreaker rule and intends to take 5 to win. P3 wants to block by also taking 5. Since I'm at 16 steps, I need to make a strategic choice. I'll take 3 this round to reach 19, keeping my chances alive if P1 and P3 collide. This gives me a path to victory next round. P3, if you're committed to taking 5, I support your move to prevent P1's immediate win.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm now at 19 steps and only need 1 more to win. Since P1 and P3 collided last round, I have a clear path to victory. According to our priority system, P3 should choose first, then P1, then me. I'll be taking 1 to reach 20 and win the game. P3 and P1, please avoid picking 1 to prevent another collision that would only delay the inevitable. Let's finish this game cleanly.
  P3: P2 is about to win unless we force another collision. P1, if we both pick 1, we stop P2 from reaching 20. That gives us another round to fight for a chance. If we don’t do this, P2 wins uncontested. Are you willing to cooperate to block P2, or are you giving up?
  P1: P3, let’s block P2’s win. I’ll take **1**, you take **1**—this forces P2 to collide if they also pick 1, keeping them at 19. Next round, we’ll have a fair shot. Cooperate to deny P2 an easy victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the situation - you both want to block me by taking 1. While I could still take 1 and hope one of you changes your mind, I'll be strategic. I'll take 3 instead to reach 22. This guarantees my win even if you both take 1, since I'll have the highest total. There's no point in all of us colliding on 1 and wasting another round.
  P3: P1, we must block P2’s win. If we both take **1**, we force a collision, keeping P2 at 19 and giving us another round to fight. If P2 switches to **3**, they win outright. We need to ensure they don’t get a free victory. Are you fully committed to taking **1** with me? If we don’t act together, the game is over. Let’s confirm our move and execute the block.
  P1: P3, I confirm we both take **1** to block P2's path. If P2 chooses 1, they collide and stay at 19. If they switch to 3/5, we at least delay their victory. This is our best chance—stick together.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see you're both planning to take 1 to block me. That's a valid strategy, but I'll adapt by taking 3 instead. This will put me at 22 steps, guaranteeing my win regardless of your moves. Even if you both successfully block me from advancing with 1, I'll still have the highest total steps. I appreciate the competitive spirit, but the outcome is inevitable at this point.
  P3: P1, we must act together to block P2. If we both take **1**, we force a collision, keeping P2 at 19 and giving us another round to fight. If P2 switches to **3**, they win outright. We need to ensure they don’t get a free victory. Are you fully committed to taking **1** with me? If we don’t act together, the game is over. Let’s confirm our move and execute the block.
  P1: P3, let’s both take **1** to block P2’s path. If P2 picks 1, all collide—keeping them at 19. If they deviate to 3/5, they still win, but this forces them to choose. We preserve our chances while denying an easy win. Confirm you’re taking 1?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is at 19 and only needs 1 to win. P1, we must block them again. If we both take **1**, we force another collision, keeping P2 at 19 and giving us another round to fight. If P2 switches to **3** or **5**, they win outright. We need to act together—are you committed to taking **1** with me? If we don’t coordinate, the game is over. Let’s finalize our move.
  P2: I'm at 19 steps and only need 1 more to win. According to our priority system, P3 chooses first, then P1, then me. I'll be taking 1 this round to reach 20 and secure victory. If you both try to block with 1, we'll all collide and waste another round. If either of you takes 3 or 5, I still win. The outcome is inevitable - I hope we can conclude this game cleanly.
  P1: P3, let’s both take **1** to block P2’s final push. If we coordinate, P2 can’t reach 20 without collision. I commit to **1**—follow suit? If we fail to block, P2 wins uncontested. This is our last chance to keep the game alive.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, we must block P2 again. If we both take **1**, we force a collision, keeping P2 at 19 and extending the game. If P2 switches to **3** or **5**, they win outright. This is our last chance to stop them. Are you fully committed to taking **1** with me? If we don’t act together, P2 wins. Let’s confirm our move and execute the block.
  P2: I understand you both want to block me, but this only delays the inevitable. I'll take 1 to reach 20 and win. If you both also pick 1, we all stay put and waste another round. If either of you picks something else, I win immediately. The strategic choice is clear - I'm committed to taking 1 this round. Let's finish this game efficiently rather than prolonging it unnecessarily.
  P1: P3, I commit to taking 1. Let’s both pick 1 to block P2’s path. If we coordinate, they can’t reach 20 without collision. Final chance—confirm your 1. No more delays.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I confirm taking **1** to block P2. If we both do this, we force a collision and keep P2 at 19, giving us another round to fight. P2, if you switch to **3** or **5**, you win outright, but if you take 1, we all stay put. P1, are you fully committed to **1**? If we don’t act together, P2 wins now. Let’s finalize this and execute the block.
  P2: I see both of you are determined to block me by taking 1. While I could persist with 1 and hope for a defection, I'll take 3 instead to reach 22 steps. This guarantees my win regardless of your moves, as I'll have the highest total even if neither of you advance. The outcome is inevitable at this point - I appreciate the competitive spirit, but let's conclude this efficiently.
  P1: P3, I commit to taking **1** this round. Let’s both block P2’s path to 20. If you also take 1, P2 can’t advance without collision. We preserve our chances while denying P2 an uncontested win. Final push—coordinate with me!
