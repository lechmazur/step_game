Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm going with 5.  Anyone else takes 5 and we all stay at zero. Don't be dumb.
  P1: I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take 3 if you two want to coordinate on 1 and 5.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 1 then. Let's do that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I'll take 3 then. P1 take 1 and P3 take 5.
  P1: P2 is trying to manipulate us by changing their suggestion. I'll stick with my original offer of taking 3. P3 already agreed to 1, so P2 should take 5.

  P2: Since I'm ahead, I'll take 5 again.  P1 take 3, P3 take 1. Let's keep this efficient.
  P1: Let's change it up - I'll take 1 this time. P3 can take 3, and P2 can keep 5 if they want. This way we all advance without collision.
