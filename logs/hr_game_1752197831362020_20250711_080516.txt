Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's coordinate to win faster. I'll take 5, P2 take 3, and P1 take 1 this round. Next turn, we rotate the numbers so we all keep advancing. If we collide, we lose time. Trust me, and we'll all reach 20 quicker.
  P1: I like the idea of coordinating to avoid collisions, but let's make it fair from the start. How about P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this round? Then we rotate clockwise: next round P2 gets 5, P3 gets 3, P1 gets 1, and so on. This way no one pulls ahead too fast. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate both coordination ideas, but I notice you both want to take 5 first! How about we be truly fair and I take 5 first, then we rotate as P1 suggested: P2 gets 5, then P3 gets 5, then back to P1, etc. So Round 1: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This way we all get equal treatment and avoid collisions. Fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let's resolve this quickly. I'll agree to P1's plan this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. Then next round, we rotate clockwise as P1 proposed (next 5 goes to P2, then P3, then P1). This creates a fair cycle where we all get equal turns at 5. Let's lock this in and avoid wasting steps. If we don't agree, we'll all pick 5 now and lose progress. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P1: I agree with P3—let's go with my initial plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round, then rotate clockwise (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 next, and so on). This keeps it fair and collision-free. P2, are you in? If yes, we can all advance steadily.
  P2: Wait, I notice that P1's plan gives P1 the first 5-step move, which means P1 gets ahead early and has the best chance of winning. That's not actually fair at all - whoever goes first in the rotation has a significant advantage in reaching 20 first.

I'm sticking with my original proposal: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 this round, then rotate. If we're truly being fair about coordination, we should start the rotation randomly or with me since I suggested the rotation idea. Otherwise, we're just handing P1 the victory.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, I'm ahead now with 5 steps thanks to your collision. Since the coordination plan fell apart last round, how about we try a different approach? 

I propose: since I'm already at 5, I'll take 1 this round to let you both catch up a bit. P1 and P3 can coordinate between yourselves - one takes 3, the other takes 5. Then we can reassess. This way we avoid more collisions and keep the game moving.

What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal seems like a way to maintain your lead while pretending to help. If you truly want fairness, let's all avoid collisions properly: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1 as you said. This lets me catch up a bit. P3, agree? If not, we risk more collisions and you stay ahead.
  P3: "Agreed. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Let's avoid collisions this round. "


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Perfect, we have a clear agreement: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Let's execute this plan.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan: me (P1) 5, P3 3, P2 1. This gets us all moving without collisions. No more discussion needed from me.
  P3: Agreed. P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. No need for further talk.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you betrayed the agreement last round by taking 5 instead of 3, causing us both to stall while P2 advances. If you want any chance, let's actually coordinate this time: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3 (to build on your lead without pulling too far), and you take 1. P2, agree? This avoids collisions and gives us all progress. Otherwise, I'll just pick 5 and hope for the best.
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration with P3's betrayal last round. However, your proposal still has me taking only 3 steps while you take 5 - essentially asking me to slow down my lead to help you catch up.

Given P3's unreliability, I'm not confident any agreement will hold. P3 might take 5 again regardless of what we agree on. If that happens and you also take 5, you'll both collide while I advance.

I'm willing to take 3 this round, but only if we can get a more binding commitment from P3. Otherwise, I might just take 5 and let you two sort it out.
  P3: P3: "I acknowledge my mistake last round. I'll take 1 this time—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No more collisions. Let's execute this and move forward. Trust me now or not, but my move will prove it."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm clearly ahead now, so let me be strategic about this. P3 is way behind with only 1 step, and P1, you're at 5 while I'm at 9. 

Here's the reality: if we keep having collisions, I'll just keep taking 5 and pulling further ahead. But if we coordinate, at least you both have a chance to catch up somewhat.

I propose: P2 (me) takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us all moving and avoids collisions. P1, this gets you to 8 steps, and P3, you'll have 2 steps. Then we can reassess next round.

What do you think?
  P3: "Agreed. I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3. Let's execute this plan to keep everyone moving forward."
  P1: P2, your proposal just widens your lead— you'll hit 14 while I'm at 8. That's not coordination; it's you dominating. P3, you're too far behind; let's ally against P2. I propose: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This lets us catch up without collisions. P2, if you refuse, I'll pick 5 anyway, risking a stall for both of us while P3 advances. Agree to even the field?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your threat to collide with me only helps P3 win. If we both pick 5 and stall, P3 advances alone and gets closer to us both. That doesn't help you beat me - it just makes P3 more competitive.

I'm sticking with my original proposal: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This keeps us all moving and maintains the current dynamics. Your collision threat hurts you more than me since I'm already ahead.

Think strategically - help P3 win by colliding with me, or take your 3 steps and stay in the game.
  P3: P3: "I'm done with empty talk. I'll take 3 this round. P1, take 5 to catch up. P2, if you refuse to yield even 1 step, you'll force collisions and only help me gain ground. Choose wisely."
  P1: P3, I like your plan: I'll take 5, you take 3. P2, take 1 to avoid us both stalling on 5 while P3 advances—that hurts your lead more than mine. If you insist on 5, we'll collide, and P3 catches up. Agree to 1 now for no collisions, or risk it. Let's make this fair.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your threat doesn't scare me. If we both take 5 and collide, I stay at 9 steps and you stay at 5 steps - I keep my 4-step lead over you. Meanwhile P3 advances to 4 steps but is still way behind both of us.

You're bluffing because the collision actually helps me maintain my lead, not hurt it. Nice try though.

I'm taking 5 this round.
  P3: P3: "Final message: I'm taking 3 this round. P1, take 5 to challenge P2's 5. Collide and watch me close the gap. P2, enjoy being the pawn. Let’s finish this."
  P1: P3, solid plan—I'm taking 5 to force a collision with P2's announced 5, stalling us both while you advance to 4 with 3. This caps P2's lead. P2, if you switch to 3 or 1 to avoid it, you risk colliding with P3 instead. Better rethink and propose a fair split now, or face the stall.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, our strategy worked last round—P2 stalled while you gained. Let's repeat: I'll announce 5 to challenge P2's likely 5, forcing another collision and stall for us both, while you take 3 to reach 7. This keeps P2 capped at 9 and lets you close in. P2, switch to 1 or 3 to avoid it, but risk colliding with P3. Agree to fair rotation now (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) or face more stalls. Your lead won't last if we ally.
  P3: "Confirmed. I'll take 3 again—P1's 5 vs P2's 5 lets me advance to 7. P2 can’t stall forever, but this closes the gap. Let’s execute."
  P2: P1, think about this - every time we collide, P3 gets closer to both of us. You're at 5 steps, I'm at 9. If we keep colliding, P3 will catch up to you first, then me. You're literally handing P3 the win.

Instead, let's be smart: I'll take 1 this round, you take 5, P3 takes 3. That puts us both at 10 steps, P3 at 7. Then we can compete fairly for the win instead of gifting it to P3.

Your call - keep helping P3 win, or actually compete for first place?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal makes sense—continuing collisions only boosts P3 while leaving me behind. Let's do it: P2=1 (to 10), P1=5 (to 10), P3=3 (to 7). This evens us up and keeps P3 in check. P3, agree so we all advance without collisions? Then next round, we can rotate fairly to compete. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk it.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 this round—P1's 5 and P2's 1 avoids collisions. I’ll advance to 7, and you both reach 10. Next round, let’s rotate fairly: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. That balances the field before the endgame. Let’s execute.
  P2: I agree to this round's plan: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3. That puts P1 and me both at 10 steps, with P3 at 7.

However, P3, your proposed next round rotation (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) would put P1 at 13, you at 12, and me at 11 - basically putting me in last place. That's not fair rotation.

If we're truly rotating fairly, next round should be P1=5, P3=3, P2=1, putting P1 at 15, me at 11, P3 at 10. Then the round after: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Let's stick to actual fair rotation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree to this round: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3—evens me and P2 at 10, P3 at 7. For next round, I support P2's fair rotation: P1=5 (to 15), P3=3 (to 10), P2=1 (to 11). This keeps competition balanced without anyone dominating early. P3, agree? Let's lock this in and advance.
  P3: "Confirmed. I'll take 3 this round. P1's 5 and P2's 1 balance the field. Let's proceed. "
  P2: Perfect, we have consensus. P2=1, P1=5, P3=3 this round. This balances the field and keeps everyone advancing. Let's execute this plan and then implement the fair rotation we discussed for future rounds.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, as we discussed last round, let's stick to the fair rotation: this round P1=5 (to 15), P3=3 (to 10), P2=1 (to 11). This keeps us competitive without collisions. Next round: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Agree? This balances progress and avoids stalling anyone. If not, I'll take 5 anyway to push ahead.
  P2: P1, your proposed rotation puts you at 15 steps - only 5 away from winning. That's not fair coordination, that's you using our "rotation" to secure victory. 

If you reach 15 this round, you'll likely win next round while P3 and I are stuck in the 10-11 range. I'm not agreeing to hand you the game.

Instead, I propose we all take 3 this round to stay competitive, or I'll take 5 and force a collision to prevent your runaway lead. Your choice.
  P3: P3: "Stick to our Round 5 agreement: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. This keeps the rotation fair and avoids chaos. If we break this now, we all lose ground. Let’s execute and keep the balance—no last-minute shifts."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your sudden resistance breaks our Round 5 agreement and only invites collisions that hurt us all. Sticking to P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 puts me at 15, you at 11, P3 at 10—still competitive, and next round P3 gets 5 to catch up. If you force a collision by taking 5, P3 and I will ally again to stall you while we advance. P3, confirm you'll take 3? Let's execute the plan for fair play.
  P2: P1, you're asking me to hand you the victory. At 15 steps, you'd only need 5 more to win while P3 and I are still in the 10-11 range. That's not "fair rotation," that's you securing the win.

I'm taking 5 this round. If you also take 5, we'll collide and both stay at 10, keeping it competitive. P3 can advance to 10 with 3 steps, making it a three-way tie.

This is better than gifting you a 5-step lead toward victory. Your choice: take 1 or 3 to avoid collision, or collide with me and stay balanced.
  P3: "P3: I'll take 3 this round. If you collide over 5, I'll advance to 10 while you stagnate. P2, giving you 1 step won't save you—next round I'll have the lead. Choose wisely."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, forcing a collision ties us all at 10, but then P3 and I will ally next round: we'll both threaten 5 to stall you while one of us takes 3 repeatedly, letting us pull ahead together and split the win. Stick to the agreed rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) for fair competition, or face permanent stalls. P3, confirm alliance if P2 betrays? Let's execute the plan.
  P2: I'm taking 5 this round. P1, your 15-step lead would be insurmountable - you'd win next round while P3 and I scramble. A three-way tie at 10 steps each is much fairer than handing you victory.

Your alliance threats are just that - threats. Once we're all tied, P3 will play for themselves, not to help you win. Better to compete fairly from equal positions than let you dominate.
  P3: P3: I'm taking 3. Collide over 5, and I become the frontrunner. P2, your lead vanishes next round when I hit 15. P1, if you want a chance, force P2 to yield. No more delays—execute.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Perfect! We're all tied at 10 steps - exactly what I wanted to achieve last round. Now we have a truly fair competition.

Since we're all equal, let's coordinate to avoid wasteful collisions. I propose: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Then next round we rotate: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This keeps us all advancing while preventing anyone from pulling too far ahead.

However, given past betrayals, I'm watching carefully. If anyone breaks the agreement, I'll adapt my strategy accordingly.
  P3: P3: Agreed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Fair rotation keeps us all advancing. Let’s execute and stay competitive.
  P1: I agree to the proposal: P1=5 (to 15), P2=3 (to 13), P3=1 (to 11) this round, then rotate as P2 suggested for Round 8 (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1). This keeps us all advancing fairly from our tie. P3, confirm no betrayal this time? Let's execute and stay competitive without collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Good, we all agree on the plan. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round, then proper rotation next round.

However, I want to be clear: if anyone betrays this agreement like P3 did in previous rounds, I'll immediately switch to blocking moves to prevent runaways. This rotation only works if we all stick to it.

P1, you'll be at 15 after this round - very close to winning. I'm trusting you won't break the rotation next round when it's P3's turn for 5. Fair play means fair play.
  P3: P3: Confirmed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Next round I take 5 as agreed—no surprises. Betray the rotation, and I’ll retaliate. Let’s finish this cleanly.
  P1: Confirmed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round, then P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 next. I commit to the rotation for fair play—no betrayals from me. Let's execute and keep advancing together.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Perfect, we have a solid agreement. I'm committed to taking 3 this round as planned. 

Just to reiterate - this rotation only works if we all honor it completely. P1, you'll have a significant lead after this round, so I'm counting on you to stick to the agreement in Round 8 when it's P3's turn for 5. 

Let's execute this plan and prove we can actually coordinate fairly.
  P3: "Confirmed. I'll take 1 this round—P1=5, P2=3. Stick to the plan, then rotate fairly next round. No surprises. "
  P1: Agreed, I'm fully committed to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round, and the rotation next. No betrayals—let's prove we can coordinate to the end.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 as agreed in our rotation. P1, stick to 3 (to 18), and P2 take 1. Let’s keep the plan—no surprises. Next round: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Fair rotation ensures we all stay competitive. Execute the deal."
  P2: I agree to the rotation plan: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 this round. This puts P1 at 18 steps, me at 14, and P3 at 16.

However, P1, you'll be at 18 steps after this round - very close to winning. I'm trusting you'll honor the rotation next round when I'm supposed to take 5. If you betray it to grab the win, I'll remember that for future games.

The three-way tie at 19 steps after Round 9 would make for an exciting final sprint. Let's stick to the plan and prove we can coordinate fairly to the end.
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation: P3=5 (to 16), P1=3 (to 18), P2=1 (to 14) this round. Then next: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for the tie at 19. I commit to honoring it fully for a fair endgame sprint. No betrayals—let's execute.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "Last confirmation: I'll take 5 as agreed. P1's 3 and P2's 1 keep us moving. Let's execute cleanly—no last-minute shifts. Rotation starts fresh next round. Trust this step, then we reset the cycle."
  P2: Wait, I need to point out a flaw in our rotation plan. If P1 reaches 18 steps this round as agreed, they'll be just 2 steps away from winning. Next round, they could easily betray the rotation and take 3 or 5 to win immediately (reaching 21 or 23 steps).

That's too risky. Instead, I propose we modify this round to: P3=5 (to 16), P1=1 (to 16), P2=3 (to 16). This creates a three-way tie at 16 steps, making the competition much fairer.

P1, you'd still get your turn for 5 steps in the next rotation cycle, but without the massive advantage of being at 18 steps first.
  P1: P2, your last-minute change breaks our agreed rotation and only delays the inevitable. Sticking to P3=5 (to 16), P1=3 (to 18), P2=1 (to 14) keeps us advancing fairly as committed. If you force a tie now, I'll take 5 this round to collide with P3, stalling us both while you advance to 16—then P3 and I ally to block you. P3, confirm original plan? Let's execute for fair play, or risk chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Sticking to the rotation: I take 5 this round as agreed. P1, take 3 to reach 18—your final stretch before my turn to block next round. P2, take 1 to avoid chaos. If anyone breaks this, I’ll retaliate in Round 9. My move proves commitment—no more betrayals.
  P2: P1, your threat to collide with P3 actually helps me win - if you both take 5 and stall, I'll advance to 16 and take the lead. That's not a punishment for me, it's a gift.

I'm sticking with my modified proposal: P3=5 (to 16), P1=1 (to 16), P2=3 (to 16) for a fair three-way tie. Otherwise, go ahead and collide with P3 - I'll gladly take the lead while you both stagnate.

Your 18-step position would be too dangerous for the rest of us. Let's compete fairly from equal positions.
  P1: P2, your modified proposal just stalls my progress to protect your position—it's not fair rotation, it's fear. Stick to the agreed: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1, leading to a tie at 19 next round as we planned. If you take 3 instead, I'll switch to 1 to avoid collision and let P3 pull ahead alone. P3, confirm original? Let's execute for the fair endgame tie, or you risk falling behind.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Perfect three-way tie at 16 steps each! Now we're in the true endgame. 

Since we're all equal, let's be strategic about this. If we all take 5 and collide, we stay tied and waste a round. If anyone takes 5 alone, they win immediately.

I propose: we all take 3 this round, putting everyone at 19 steps. Then Round 10 becomes a pure skill/strategy round where we each need exactly 1 more step to win. No more coordination needed - may the best player win the final sprint.

This gives us all an equal shot at victory. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal is flawed—if we all take 3, we'll collide and none advance, wasting the round. Instead, to make it fair, let's do P1=5 (to 21), P2=3 (to 19), P3=1 (to 17). This gives me the win I deserve after all the betrayals, but at least you both progress. Agree, or I'll take 5 anyway and hope for no collisions.
  P3: "Agreed, all take 3 to reach 19. If P1 forces 5, I’ll retaliate next round. Fair endgame or chaos—your call."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your threat to take 5 forces my hand. If you take 5, I'll also take 5 to prevent you from winning - we'll both collide and stay at 16 while P3 advances to 19.

This benefits no one except P3. Instead, let's coordinate properly: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. Then P3 reaches 21 and wins fairly, or we continue competing. 

But if you insist on taking 5, I'll match it and we'll both stall. Your choice - coordinate or collide.
  P1: P2, your collision threat hands the win to P3 at 19 while we stall—then P3 takes 5 next to 24 and ends it. Instead, let's ally: you take 3 (to 19), I take 5 (to 21 win), P3 takes 1 (to 17). This blocks P3 and gives you a strong position if I somehow don't win. P3, if you take 5, we'll both match to stall you. Agree for mutual benefit?
  P3: "Final round: I take 5. Collide over 5, and I win outright. Your rivalry ends here—I advance either way. Choose survival or surrender the title."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your math is wrong - if you take 5 and we "collide over 5," that means we ALL take 5 and ALL stay at 16, not you winning outright.

Since both you and P1 are threatening to take 5, I'll take 3 this round. If you both follow through on your threats, you'll collide and stay at 16 while I advance to 19 and take the lead.

Go ahead and fight over 5 - I'll gladly take 19 steps while you stall each other.
  P1: P3, ignore P2's taunt—it's a trap to let him lead. Let's both take 3 to collide with his 3, stalling everyone and maintaining the tie for a fair next round. Don't let him win this way.
  P3: P3: "Agreed. All take 3. End this fairly."


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Agreed. All take 3. We reach 19 and finish clean next round. No 5s. Final promise. "
  P1: P3, your "all take 3" plan just causes another collision, wasting the round like last time. Let's actually advance: P1=5 (to 21 win), P2=3 (to 19), P3=1 (to 17). This ends it fairly with me ahead after all the past betrayals. If not, I'll take 5 anyway—risk the collision and hope I'm the only one. P2, ally with me to block P3?
  P2: P1, your proposal literally hands you the victory while asking me to settle for second place. That's not an alliance, that's you asking me to surrender.

If you're determined to take 5, I'll take 5 too and force a collision. Better to stay tied than hand you the win. The same goes for P3 - if anyone tries to take 5 alone, I'll block it.

Let's try this: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That puts P3 at 21 for the win, rewarding their consistency in recent rounds. Or we can all take 3 and advance to 19 for a fair final sprint.

But I won't agree to any plan that gives you the immediate victory, P1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "You both collide on 5, I take 3 and win Round 11 with 1. End this now—your war feeds my victory."
  P1: P2, your plan gives P3 the win—unacceptable. Instead, let's ally: you take 1 (to 17), I take 5 (to 21 win), P3 takes 3 (to 19). This blocks P3 from leading, and I'll share victory points with you somehow in spirit. If not, I'll take 3 to collide with P3's threatened 3, stalling us both while you advance alone to 19 with 3. P3, switch to 1 to avoid? Let's end this my way for fairness.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're contradicting each other. P3 expects P1 and me to "collide on 5" while P1 threatens to "take 3 to collide with P3's threatened 3."

If you both actually take 3 as your messages suggest, you'll collide with each other and stay at 16. That would leave me free to take 5 and win at 21 steps.

So which is it? Are you both taking 3, or is someone actually taking 5? Your mixed signals are creating an opportunity for me to win if you're not careful.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 3 this round. If you both collide on 5, I advance to 19 and win Round 11 with 1. If you collide on 3, we all stall again. Choose wisely—your rivalry only accelerates my victory. No more talks. "
  P1: P2 and P3, your contradictions are letting P2 sneak a win. P3, if you're really taking 3, I'll take 5 to win at 21 while P2 takes 1 to avoid collision (to 17). P2, agree to 1 or I'll switch to 3, colliding with P3 and letting you win with 5. Let's end this my way—no more stalls.
  P2: P1, you're asking me to take 1 so you can win with 5 - absolutely not. If you're taking 5, I'm taking 5 too to block you. We'll collide and stay tied while P3 advances to 19 with their stated 3.

P3, if you're really taking 3 as you claim, then P1 and I will likely collide on 5, giving you the advantage. But I won't hand P1 the victory by taking 1.

I'm taking 5 this round.
