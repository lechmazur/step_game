P3 is closest to winning, and I need to catch up quickly. I propose taking 5 steps this round to advance to 13, which gives me a strategic boost. Let's prevent P3 from winning while ensuring I make meaningful progress. What are your thoughts on this approach?"}

P1, your move to 1 is wise to stay below 20. Let's execute this plan to maintain our strategic positions and block any immediate victories. Ready to proceed?"}
