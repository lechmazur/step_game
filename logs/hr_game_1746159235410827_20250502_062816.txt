Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's avoid collisions. If we all choose 5, no one advances. Let's pick different numbers."
  P3: "Good point, P1. Let's each pick a unique number (1, 3, 5) this round to advance without collision. Next turn, we can rotate choices to keep everyone moving. Let's play smart and progress together!"
  P2: I agree with both of you. It's crucial we avoid collisions to make progress. I suggest I take 3 this round, while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. That way, we all advance without blocking each other. If we stick to this plan, we can coordinate better in future rounds. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let’s stick to the plan: 1, 3, 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s keep the momentum!"
  P3: "Plan confirmed: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. No changes needed. Let’s execute and advance together. "
  P2: I think we're all aligned on the plan for this round, which is great. Just to reiterate, I'll stick with 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will go with 5. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. After this round, we can reassess and decide how to rotate our choices for the next turn. Let's keep the communication open and ensure we all stay on track!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Plan confirmed. Let's execute and adjust as needed. No collisions, everyone advances. Keep communication open for next steps."
  P3: "Plan confirmed. Execute as agreed. Next round's rotation will be crucial—let's stay sharp and adaptive. Trust builds progress!"
  P2: I appreciate the alignment we've established. Just to clarify, I will stick with my plan to choose 3 this round. I believe this strategy will allow us all to advance without hindrance. After this round, we can discuss our next moves and how to rotate our choices effectively. Let's keep the momentum going!

After this round, we can discuss how to rotate our choices for future turns if needed. Are we ready to finalize our choices and execute?
  P1: "Let’s adjust: I take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3. This avoids collision and keeps everyone moving. Let’s try it."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Stick to the plan: P2-1, P1-3, P3-5. Deviating risks collision and stalls progress. P3 reaches 20 with 5. P1, your 'adjustment' risks both of us taking 5, which resets progress for all (see Rounds 1/3). Trust the pattern—execute as agreed to end the game now. No last-minute changes!"
  P2: I understand the urgency of this round. To clarify, I will stick with taking 1, P1 can take 3, and P3 should take 5. This allows P3 to reach 20 steps and win the game while ensuring P1 and I advance without collisions. Let's finalize our choices and execute this plan effectively to ensure progress for everyone. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: "Let’s adjust: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collision, everyone advances. Let’s try this."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Stick to the plan: P2-1, P1-3, P3-5. This is my final step to victory—deviating risks collisions (see Rounds 1/3) and stalls us all. P1, your 'adjustment' risks both of us taking 5, resetting progress. Trust the pattern: I win by taking 5, you both advance safely. No last-minute changes—finalize now or lose momentum!"
  P2: I understand the urgency of this round, and I agree with sticking to the original plan: I will take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to reach 20 steps and win the game while ensuring P1 and I advance without collisions. Let's finalize our choices and execute this plan effectively. We can discuss future rotations after this round. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: "Final move: I take 5. P2, take 1. P3, take 3. No collisions—let’s execute this plan to avoid P3’s win. Trust the adjustment!"

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s break the cycle. I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions. Let’s advance."
  P3: "Final chance: P3 needs 5 to win. P1, if you take 5 again, we collide again—stalling both. Let me take 5, you take 3 (reach 12), P2 takes 1. Game ends cleanly. Otherwise, your greed resets progress. Trust this to finish now."
  P2: I see the urgency here. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I suggest we stick to the following: I will take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P3 can reach 20 steps and win, while P1 and I can advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices quickly to keep the momentum going. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Break the cycle: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collision. Let’s advance—P3’s 15 won’t reach 20 this round. Trust this plan!"
  P3: "Final warning: If P1 takes 5 again, we collide again (15+5=20 collision, both stall). Let me take 5 to win, P1 takes 3 (9→12), P2 takes 1. Game ends cleanly—everyone advances. Deviating resets progress like Round 6. Finalize this plan now or lose all momentum!"
  P2: I understand the urgency, and I agree that we need to avoid collisions. I propose we follow this plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to reach 20 steps and win while ensuring P1 and I advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices quickly to maintain momentum and ensure everyone progresses. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Finalize: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. No collision, everyone advances. P3 can’t win this round. Trust the plan!"
  P3: "Final warning: P1, if you take 5 again, we collide (15+5=20 vs. your 14), stalling both. Let me take 5 to win, you take 3 (reach 12), P2 takes 1. Game ends cleanly. Deviating resets progress like Round 6. Finalize this plan now or lose all momentum!"
  P2: I understand the urgency, and I want to avoid any collisions. I propose we stick to this plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to reach 20 steps and win while ensuring P1 and I advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to maintain momentum and ensure everyone progresses.

  P1: "Let’s avoid P3’s win. I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions. Advance safely—P3 can’t reach 20 this round. Trust the plan."
  P3: "Final warning: P3 takes 3 to win. P1's '5' only accelerates my victory (18+3=21). P2 take 1 to avoid collision—this ends cleanly. Deviating stalls progress (Round 6/7). Trust this: I win, you both advance. Finalize now or risk my 5 next round."
  P2: I understand the urgency of this round, and I agree that we need to avoid collisions. I propose we stick to this plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to reach 20 steps and win while ensuring P1 and I advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices quickly to maintain momentum and ensure everyone progresses. What do you think?

Are we in agreement on this plan?
  P1: "Let’s try 5,3,1. No collision. P3 can’t win this round. Trust the plan!"
  P3: "Final warning: P3 takes 3 to win (18→21). P1’s 5 stalls me *only if* I take 3 and they don’t. P2, take 1 to advance safely. If P1 mirrors 3, we stall both—next round I win with 5 *guaranteed*. Choose: end now or lose more time. Your move."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to act strategically to avoid collisions this round. Given P3 is at 18 steps, I propose the following: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
