Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? This way, we all move forward without any issues. Thoughts?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal. P2 will pick 3 steps this turn to avoid any collisions. Let’s all work together to advance smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P1 hasn't agreed yet, let's give them a chance to speak up. If we don't hear from P1, P2 and I should stick to the plan. P2, are you still good with picking 3? I'll proceed with 5. P1, if you have a different idea, please share. Otherwise, let's move forward with the plan.
