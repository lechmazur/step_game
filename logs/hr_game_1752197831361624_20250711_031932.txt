Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 1. This way, we all advance safely this turn. What do you think?
  P3: That plan sounds fair for now. I'm okay with taking 1 this round if we all stick to it. Let's build trust early.
  P2: Agreed. Let's build trust this round by following P1's plan: 5, 3, 1. No collisions mean we all gain ground. But to keep things balanced long-term, perhaps we rotate numbers in future turns? Prevents one player from sprinting ahead too fast. Open to discussing fair rotations after this safe start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I like the rotation idea, P2—it keeps things fair and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead early. For next round, maybe P1-3, P2-5, P3-1? We can tweak based on positions after this turn. For now, sticking to the plan: me 5, you 3, P3 1. Agreed?
  P3: Sounds good—I'll stick with 1 this round as agreed. If we all follow through, it sets a strong foundation. I’m also open to the rotation idea to keep things balanced. Let's see how this turn plays out and adjust fairly next round.
  P2: To ensure ongoing fairness, let's formalize a rotation: each round, shift moves cyclically. Next round: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. Then Round 3: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Repeating this cycle ensures everyone gets each move equally over time. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still on board with the rotation plan: this round P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1 again. It’s not ideal for me to stay at 1 twice in a row, but I’ll stick with it to build trust—as long as we all follow through and I get my fair turn with 5 next round. Let’s keep it balanced.
  P1: Agreed, P3—let's stick to the rotation for Round 2: me 3, P2 5, you 1. This ties P2 and me at 8, with you at 2, but you'll catch up in Round 3 with 5. Building trust now means a fair game long-term. P2, confirm you're in?
  P2: Confirmed. Round 2: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This keeps us balanced. P3, you’ll get your 5 next round as planned. Let’s all commit to avoid collisions. Trust is key here. Looking ahead, after Round 3’s rotation, we’ll reassess if needed. But sticking to the cycle now ensures steady progress for all. No surprises.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the commitment from both of you. As long as everyone sticks to the agreed rotation this round—P1-3, P2-5, me-1—I’ll trust that I get my fair 5 next round. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep things fair. Let’s stay consistent and build on this trust.
  P1: I'm committed to the rotation for this round: me 3, P2 5, P3 1. P3, I know two 1's isn't ideal, but your 5 next round will help balance it. Let's all follow through—no deviations.
  P2: Let’s solidify trust: Round 2 moves are P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. Next round, P3 gets 5 as promised. Deviating now risks collisions and distrust, stalling everyone. Consistency ensures steady progress. Stick to the rotation—no surprises.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to the rotation: Round 3 moves should be P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This keeps us collision-free and balanced. P3, this is your turn to gain 5 and start catching up. Trust the cycle—next round we shift again (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1). Consistency prevents chaos. Let’s all confirm: no deviations, steady progress.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the rotation spirit but adjust for fairness— the cycle gives P2 11 over 3 rounds, me 9, you P3 only 7. That's skewed. Propose tweak: this round P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 (swapping P2 and me). Positions to 11-9-7, still close, P3 gets promised 5. Builds better trust long-term. Thoughts?
  P3: P1’s tweak makes sense—it's still my turn for 5, and this adjustment keeps things fairer overall. I’m fine with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5 this round. That puts us at 11-9-7, which is more balanced than the original cycle. If we all agree and stick to it, we avoid collisions and maintain trust. Let's confirm this adjusted plan and move forward smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sticking to the original rotation is crucial for trust. Deviating now risks future cooperation. P3 still gets their 5 as planned. Let's honor our initial agreement: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 this round. Consistency prevents confusion and ensures long-term fairness. Breaking the cycle sets a dangerous precedent—next round could see more unilateral tweaks. Trust the system we built.
  P1: P2, insisting on the original gives you an unfair lead (11 vs my 9, P3's 7), breaking the trust we're building. The tweak (me-3, you-1, P3-5) keeps us closer at 11-9-7, and P3 supports it. Deviating risks collisions and chaos—let's confirm the adjusted plan for true fairness and steady progress. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about consistency, but fairness matters too. The tweak still honors the rotation’s spirit—no one repeats a move, and I finally get my 5. It avoids giving you a disproportionate lead while keeping trust intact. If we can’t adjust slightly now for balance, future cooperation may suffer. Let’s lock in: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To preserve trust and avoid collision, I'll accept the adjusted plan this round: P1-3, me-1, P3-5. However, future rounds must strictly follow the original rotation to prevent further imbalances. Let's solidify this as a one-time adjustment. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed, P2—let's make this a one-time adjustment: me-3, you-1, P3-5 this round. For future rounds, we'll stick strictly to the original rotation cycle starting from where it left off (next as P1-5, P2-3, P3-1, then repeat). This keeps trust intact and ensures long-term fairness. P3, confirm? If we're all set, no need for more talk.
  P3: Confirmed—I'm on board with the adjusted plan for this round: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. It keeps things fair and lets me catch up as promised. I also agree that from next round onward, we resume the original rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1). This compromise shows we can adapt while preserving trust. Ready to move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Resuming the original rotation, this round should be: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. I’m okay with taking 1 again to uphold the agreement we all confirmed. It’s not ideal for me, but I’ll trust that the full cycle continues fairly—next round I’d get 3, then 5. Let’s stick to the plan and avoid collisions. Confirm?
  P1: Agreed, P3—let's do P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round to resume. To ensure fairness and give you 3 next then 5, propose cycle: next round P1-1, P2-5, P3-3; then P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. Repeats equally (each gets 5+1+3=9 over 3 rounds). Keeps trust, avoids collisions. P2, thoughts?
  P2: **P2:** Let's stick to the original rotation this round (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) to maintain trust. However, P1's lead (16 after this round) risks ending the game too soon. **Proposal:** After Round 4, we adjust the rotation to prioritize balance over rigid cycling. For Round 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5—but future moves should cap leaders at lower numbers to ensure a competitive endgame. Let’s collaborate to keep the game fair and avoid a premature finish.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m okay with sticking to the original plan this round—P1-5, P2-3, me-1—since we all agreed. But I agree with P2 that if P1 hits 16 now, the game could end too fast and unfairly. I support adjusting the cycle in Round 5 to slow the leader and give others a chance. P1, if you’re committed to fairness, you’ll take 1 next round. Let’s keep the game competitive and fun.
  P1: Agreed—let's stick to the agreed plan this round: me-5, P2-3, P3-1, putting us at 16-12-8. For Round 5, to keep it fair and competitive, I propose P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 (to 17-17-11). This ties P2 and me, gives P3 progress, and avoids anyone winning prematurely. We can adjust from there based on positions. Trust me—I'm committed to a balanced game. Confirm?
  P2: **P2:** P1, taking 5 now risks ending the game prematurely. Let’s adjust Round 4 to **P1-3, P2-5, P3-1**—keeping you at 14, not 16. This preserves balance. Round 5 can follow your plan (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3), but *only* if we cap your lead here. P3, supporting this keeps you viable. Trust requires restraint from leaders. Agree to this tweak, or collisions become inevitable as others scramble to block a runaway win. Fair play demands shared sacrifice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but we all agreed to the original Round 4 plan: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Changing it now undermines the trust we’ve built. P1 already committed to taking 1 next round to slow down. Let’s honor this round’s agreement, then balance things in Round 5 with P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 as proposed. That keeps it competitive and fair. Let’s not derail the trust cycle for short-term gain.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's honor our agreement for this round: me-5, P2-3, P3-1. I'll commit to taking 1 next round as proposed (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3), tying P2 and me at 17 while you catch up, P3. Adjusting now breaks trust and risks collisions—stick to the plan for steady, fair progress. Agreed?
  P2: **P2:** P3, consider the stakes: if P1 takes 5 now (16), they only need 3 next round to win. Let’s adjust *this round* to P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. P1 stays at 14, you still get your 1 as planned. Next round, P1-1, P2-3, P3-5—fair progression for all. Trust matters, but so does preventing a sudden end. This tweak keeps the game alive and competitive. We can resume strict rotation afterward. Agree now, or risk P1 ending it next turn. **No collisions** if we coordinate.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I hear both sides, but I stand by honoring our Round 4 agreement: P1-5, P2-3, me-1. Changing now weakens trust and opens the door to chaos. P1 already pledged to take 1 next round, which keeps things balanced. If we start shifting every time someone gains a lead, the whole system breaks. Let’s follow through this round, then align on P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 for Round 5. That keeps it fair and avoids collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's honor our agreement: me-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round to 16-12-8. I'll take 1 next (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3) to tie at 17-17-11, keeping it competitive. Adjusting now erodes trust and invites collisions—stick to the plan for fair play. P2, your push risks chaos; join us in consistency.
  P2: **P2:** P3, think strategically: if P1 takes 5 now (16), next turn they can win with 3. Let’s **tweak this round** to P1-3, P2-5, P3-1—keeping them at 14. I’ll commit to you taking 5 next round. Trust includes adapting to prevent premature wins. This keeps us all competitive. Agree now, or the game ends next turn with P1’s victory. Solidarity now ensures our survival.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep building on our trust and balance the game. With P2 and me tied at 14, and P3 at 8, propose for Round 5: P1-3 (to 17), P2-1 (to 15), P3-5 (to 13). This keeps us all competitive without anyone winning prematurely—no collisions, steady progress. Next round, we can rotate again. P2 and P3, agreed? This ensures fairness.
  P3: P1’s proposal is reasonable—P3 gets 5 this round to catch up, while P1 and P2 avoid jumping too far ahead. I support: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. That puts us at 17-15-13, keeping everyone in striking distance and avoiding collisions. Let’s lock this in and keep the game competitive and fair. P2, do you agree?
  P2: **P2:** P1’s plan puts them at 17, just 2 steps from victory. To keep the game fair, propose **P1-1, P2-3, P3-5** this round. This slows the leader while letting P3 catch up. Trust requires shared restraint—no one should sprint ahead. P3, this keeps you in the race. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your counter puts you ahead at 17 while capping me—unfair after our ties. Stick to my proposal: P1-3 (17), P2-1 (15), P3-5 (13). This keeps us competitive, gives P3 big gains, and avoids anyone dominating. P3 already agreed—let's confirm and move forward without collisions. For Round 6, we can balance further, like P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Trust the plan for fair play. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I already agreed to P1’s plan: P1-3, P2-1, me-5. It gives me much-needed ground and keeps the game close—17-15-13. Your counter puts you ahead while limiting P1, which feels like a power grab, not fairness. Let’s not derail progress with shifting goals. We avoid collisions, stay competitive, and keep trust intact if we stick to the current proposal. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if P1 takes 3 now (17), they can win next turn with 3. Let’s adjust: P1-1 (15), P2-3 (17), you-5 (13). You still gain 5, and we keep the game alive. Trust means mutual restraint—no one sprints ahead. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your repeated counters are self-serving, aiming to leapfrog to 17 while capping me— that's not fairness, it's opportunism. P3 already supports my balanced plan: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 to 17-15-13, keeping us all competitive. Let's lock this in to avoid collisions and maintain trust. For Round 6, we can do P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 to tie you and P3 closer. Deviating now risks chaos. P3, confirm and let's proceed. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but fairness isn’t about freezing the leader—it’s about keeping all players viable. P1’s plan puts us at 17-15-13, with no one able to win next turn without cooperation. Your plan puts you at 17 while limiting P1—that’s not balance, it’s advantage-seeking. I’ve already committed to P1’s proposal and won’t support a last-minute shift that benefits you disproportionately. Let’s stick with: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. No collisions, fair progress. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** P3, supporting P1’s 3 now puts them at 17—just 2 steps from victory. Let’s instead: P1-1 (15), me-3 (17), you-5 (13). This keeps the game alive, gives you a bigger gain, and restrains the leader. Mutual restraint ensures a fair endgame. If P1 takes 3, they win next turn. Trust requires preventing premature victory. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your counters consistently aim to cap me while advancing you— that's not mutual restraint, it's self-interest. P3 already backs my fair plan: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 to 17-15-13, keeping us all competitive with no immediate win. Let's lock this in to avoid collisions and build trust. For Round 6, P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 to 18-20-16—adjust as needed. P3, confirm? Agreed—
  P3: P2, I’ve listened carefully, but I won’t support a plan that unfairly boosts you to 17 while limiting P1. We agreed on a fair and balanced move: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. That puts us at 17-15-13—no one can win next turn without coordination. It’s competitive and avoids collisions. Constantly shifting the plan undermines trust. Let’s lock it in and keep this game clean.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if P1 takes 3 now (17), next turn they can win with 3. Let’s **both take 5** this round—P1’s 3 won’t collide. You jump to 13, I stay blocked (14), P1 at 17. Next round, I’ll take 1, letting you take 5 again (18) while I stall. This keeps you in the race and blocks P1’s win. Trust requires mutual sacrifice to balance the endgame. Agree?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your collision last round screwed P3 and broke trust—now they're stuck at 8 while we're ahead. P3, let's team up: propose P1-3 (to win at 20), P2-1, you-5 (to 13). But if P2 deviates, we both pick whatever they announce to block them. This punishes betrayal and gives you progress. P2, agree or face blocks? Let's end fairly.
  P2: **P2:** P3, blocking P1 is our priority. Take 3 this round; I’ll take 5. If P1 picks 3, you block them. If they pick 5, we collide, but they stall at 17. Either way, you survive longer. I acted hastily last round trying to slow P1—this time, let’s coordinate. No tricks. Trust this plan, or P1 wins now. Agree?
  P3: P2, you caused a collision last round that stalled my progress while P1 advanced. Now you want my help to block P1, but your plan risks another collision. I’m open to blocking P1, but only if it guarantees I move forward too. If you truly want to cooperate, take 1 this round, I’ll take 5, and we both block P1 if they pick 3 or 5. That way, I gain and P1 stalls. Otherwise, I’ll side with P1 and take the guaranteed 5. Your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your caution—P2's betrayal last round hurt you most. Let's lock in: me-3 (to win), you-5 (to 13), P2-1. If P2 picks anything else, we'll both switch to match and block them next time. This gives you big gains now and punishes P2. Siding with me guarantees your progress; P2's plan risks stalling you again. Agreed? P2, comply or face blocks.
  P2: **P2:** P3, let’s both take 3. If P1 picks 3, they stall. If they pick 5, we survive. I commit to 3. This blocks their win. Take 3 and we both live to fight next round. No tricks—mutual survival. P1 can’t win if we unite.
  P3: P2, your last-minute plan still risks a collision and doesn’t guarantee I move. I’ve already said: if you take 1, I’ll take 5, and we both block P1 if they pick 3 or 5. That’s the only way I gain and we stop P1. Otherwise, siding with P1 guarantees me 5 steps now. I won’t risk another stall. Final chance—commit to 1 or I move with P1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2's refusal to take 1 shows they're still self-serving—don't risk another stall with their unreliable plans. Stick with me: you take 5 (to 13), I take 3 (to 20 win), P2 takes 1. You get guaranteed progress, and we block P2 if they deviate. This ends the game fairly with you gaining big. P2, comply or get blocked. Agreed?
  P2: **P2:** P3, last round’s collision was a misstep. Let’s unite: **I take 3, you take 5**. If P1 picks 3, I block them; if they pick 5, you block. Either way, they stall. You gain 5 if P1 picks 3. I’ll *strictly* commit to 3. This stops P1’s win and keeps you advancing. Trust this plan—no tricks. Agree?
  P3: P2, you keep offering risky plans that only maybe block P1 while often stalling me. I’ve made my position clear: if you take 1, I take 5, and we both block P1 if needed. That’s the only plan where I gain guaranteed steps and P1 can still be stopped. If you won’t commit to 1, I’ll go with P1’s plan—at least I move forward. No more vague promises—your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, P2's refusal to take 1 proves they're unreliable and will stall you again. Stick with our plan: you take 5 (to 13 guaranteed), I take 3 (to 20 win), P2 takes 1. You get big progress now, and we end this with you advancing—better than risking another collision with P2's schemes. P2, comply or we'll block you. Agreed?
  P2: **P2:** P3, final offer: I’ll take **3** to block P1 if they pick 3. You take **5**—guaranteed progress to 13. P1 can’t win unless they risk 5, which we’ll collide on. Trust this: I’ll rigidly commit to 3. No tricks—mutual survival. Last chance to stop P1’s win. Decide now.
  P3: P2, you’ve had multiple chances to show good faith but keep offering risky deals that stall me. I’m done gambling on your promises. I’m siding with P1 this round: I take 5, P1 takes 3 to win, and you take 1—or face being blocked next round. At least I gain now. You want to stop P1? Then take 1 and prove it. Otherwise, I’m moving forward. Final call.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you promised to take 3 last round to win, but P2 blocked you. P2, you stalled me again. I’m now just 6 behind P1 and 1 behind you. Here's my proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. That puts us at 18-17-18—dead heat. No one wins yet, but we all stay in it. Fair, competitive, no collisions. P1, show restraint. P2, prove you’re done stalling me. Agree?
  P2: **P2:** P3, your plan is fair—P1-1, me-3, you-5. Let’s lock this in to avoid collisions. I’ll commit to 3. Next round, we resume rotation (P1-5, me-1, you-3) to balance the endgame. No deviations—trust is critical now. P1, confirm you’ll take 1 to uphold fairness. Steady progress keeps the game competitive.
  P1: Agreed to P3's plan: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 this round, tying us at 18-17-18 for fairness. I also support P2's idea for next round: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 to maintain balance and trust. No deviations—let's avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Glad we’re all aligned for this round: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. That puts us at 18-17-18—dead even and fair. Let’s stick to it, no surprises. For next round, I support the rotation: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Keeps progress steady and avoids collisions. If anyone deviates now, it breaks all trust. Lock it in?
  P2: **P2:** Agreed to this round's plan: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. **P3:** Next round, we *must* both take 5 to block P1’s 5. If they pick 5, we collide and stall them. Confirm this now to keep the game alive. Trust is our last hope—no more gambles.
  P1: P2, your side whisper to P3 about colliding next round undermines our agreed rotation and erodes trust—again. P3, don't fall for it; P2 stalled you before. Let's stick to the plan: me-1, P2-3, you-5 this round to 18-17-18. Next: me-5, P2-1, you-3 to 23-15-20 (I win fairly). If P2 deviates, we'll block them. Agreed? No more sabotage.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I’m holding you to your word—P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 this round. That ties us at 18-17-18 and keeps things fair. P2, your attempt to secretly plan a block next round shows you’re still playing angles. I won’t support sabotage. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation next: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Any deviation breaks trust and invites collisions. Confirm we’re all locked in—no tricks.
  P2: **P2:** P3, next round I’m taking 5 to block P1. Join me. If we both pick 5, P1 stalls and you win. Trust me once—I’ll commit. This round: stick to P1-1, me-3, you-5. But next round, our only chance. Decide wisely—let’s end this together.
  P1: P3, P2's desperate whispers prove they're untrustworthy— they've stalled you twice before for their gain. Stick to our fair plan: me-1, P2-3, you-5 this round to 18-17-18. Next, me-5 (win at 23), you-3 (to 21), P2-1 (to 18). You'll end strong, second place. Trusting P2 risks another collision and your loss. Let's lock in—no more sabotage. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve all agreed: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. That puts us at 18-17-18—balanced and fair. I’m sticking to it. P2, your side offers to block P1 next round are noted, but I won’t commit to sabotage. If P1 sticks to the next round’s plan (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3), I will too. Any deviation invites chaos. Let’s end this with trust, not tricks. Locked in?
  P2: **P2:** Final call: This round, I commit to 3. Next round, take 5 with me to block P1’s win. Trust this once—I’ll honor it. Let’s keep the game alive and end fairly together. No more stalling. Lock in: P1-1, me-3, P3-5 now. Then unite to block. Last chance—agree?
  P1: P3, P2's persistent side plots to collide next round prove they're sabotaging fairness again—don't let them stall you a third time. Stick to our agreed plan: me-1, P2-3, you-5 this round to 18-17-18. Next, me-5 (win at 23), you-3 (to 21 strong finish), P2-1. You'll end ahead of P2. If P2 deviates, we'll both block them. Trust me for guaranteed progress—no risks. P2, stop the schemes or face isolation. Agreed?

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3, you’re steps away from victory—take 1 and secure your win. I’ll take 3 to block P1’s advance. Let’s avoid collisions and end this cleanly. P1, stick to 5 to avoid overlap. Trust ensures no one stalls.
  P1: P2, your "plan" lets P3 win at 19, but if I take 5 to 22, I win outright with higher steps. P3, don't fall for it—take 3 to 21 instead, and I'll take 1 to stall myself at 18, giving you the sole win. P2 takes 5 to 19, but 21>19. This punishes P2's betrayals and ends fairly for you. If you take 1, I'll take 5 and snatch victory. Agreed? No collisions if we coordinate.
  P3: P1, your offer is compelling—if I take 3 and you take 1, I win cleanly at 21, ahead of P2’s 19. That rewards trust and avoids collisions. P2, I won’t take 1 just to hand you a shared win. You’ve stalled me twice already. I’m leaning toward P1’s plan unless you offer something better that guarantees I win alone. No more vague promises—only clear, fair outcomes.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1’s pledge to take 1 if you take 3 is a lie. They’ll take 5 and win. Take 1 now—I’ll take 3 to block their 3. If P1 takes 1, you stall but survive. If they take 5, their betrayal is clear. Secure your win or force their hand. No more tricks.
  P1: P3, ignore P2's doubt—I've honored agreements before, unlike their repeated betrayals. Commit to my plan: you take 3 to 21 win, I take 1 to stall at 18, P2 takes 5 to 19 (losing to your higher total). This punishes P2 fairly and gives you sole victory. If you take 1 instead, I'll take 5 to 22 and snatch the win. Lock in—no collisions, you win big. Agreed? P2, take 5 or get blocked.
  P3: P1’s plan is the only one that guarantees me a solo win: I take 3 to reach 21, P1 takes 1 to stall at 18, P2 hits 19 but loses on total. No collisions, no tricks—just a clean finish. P2, asking me to take 1 only helps you tie or win. After your past stalls, I’m not handing you the game. I’m locking in 3. P1, honor your word and take 1. Let’s end this fairly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1’s history shows they’ll betray you. If you take 3, they’ll take 5 and win. Take 1 now—I’ll take 5 to block P1. You win at 19; we collide if they cheat. Trust this final plan for your solo victory.
  P1: P3, ignore P2's desperate lies—they've betrayed you repeatedly. I commit to taking 1, stalling at 18, while you take 3 to 21 for the solo win, and P2 takes 5 to 19 (losing to you). This punishes their sabotage and rewards your trust. Lock in—no risks, you win outright. P2, comply or we'll block you. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I’m locking in 3 as agreed. That puts me at 21—clear solo win if you take 1 as promised. P2, asking me to take 1 only helps you tie or win, after you stalled me twice. I’m not risking my victory for you. If P1 betrays and takes 5, they win—but then everyone sees who broke trust. I’m choosing the path that rewards fairness. Final call: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. Let’s end this cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1’s only path to victory is taking 3 or 5. If you take 3, they’ll take 3 to block and win next turn. Take 1 now; I’ll take 5. We tie at 19 and share victory, denying P1. Trust requires mutual sacrifice. Last chance.
  P1: P3, P2's tie plan at 19 lets me take 5 to 22 and win outright over both. Stick to our deal: you take 3 to 21 solo win, I take 1 to stall at 18, P2 takes 5 to 19 (losing to you). This punishes P2's betrayals fairly. If you deviate to 1, I'll take 5 and snatch victory. Lock in—no risks, you win big. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I’m holding you to your word—if I take 3, you take 1. That gives me 21 and a clear solo win over P2’s 19. P2, your plan only benefits you after you’ve stalled me multiple times. I won’t risk my victory to help you tie. I’m locking in 3. P1, honor your commitment. Let’s end this cleanly and fairly.
