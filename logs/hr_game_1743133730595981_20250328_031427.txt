Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 this turn. P1, why don’t you take 1 and P3 take 5? This way we all advance without blocking each other.
  P1: Sounds good, P2. I’m fine with taking 1 this turn if we’re all sticking to the plan. Let’s avoid collisions and all move forward. P3, are you in?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination attempt, but I don't want to be pushed into the largest move right away. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way we all still advance without collision, just in different positions. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you prefer not to take 5 first, I’ll gladly switch roles. Let’s finalize your plan: you take 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This avoids collisions and lets me secure an early lead. Agreed?
  P1: That works for me—P3 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P2 takes 5. Let’s all move forward without blocking each other. As long as no one breaks the deal, we all benefit. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's move forward with this arrangement.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I kept my word while you both went for 5 and blocked each other. Now I'm in the lead. If you want to rebuild trust and make progress, let's try coordination again - but this time, actually stick to what we agree on. What numbers would you prefer?
  P1: You're right, P3 — you held up your end, and we didn’t. Let’s reset and work together this time. I propose: P3 takes 3 (since you're ahead), I’ll take 1, and P2 takes 5 to catch up. This avoids collisions and helps balance the field. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's plan. I'll take 5 this turn as proposed. Let’s all stick to our agreed moves this time to avoid another collision. P3, you take 3 to stay ahead, and P1 takes 1. This way we all progress without blocking each other. Let’s honor our commitments this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I don't trust either of you after last round's deception. I'll choose my move independently this time. Feel free to coordinate between yourselves, but I won't be sharing my intentions.
  P1: P3, fair enough—you’ve earned the right to play independently. P2, since P3 is unpredictable now, we can still avoid a collision between us. I’ll take 1, you stick with 5. That way at least we both move forward. Let’s not sabotage ourselves again.
  P2: P3, if you take 3, P1 and I can safely take 1 and 5 respectively. This lets all three of us advance. I’ll stick to 5 as agreed with P1—no repeats. Let’s not waste this chance to move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your caution is understandable, but if you pick 3, P2 and I can still move safely with 1 and 5. You stay ahead, P2 catches up, and I finally get on the board. Everyone benefits. If you go rogue, you risk collisions again. Your call.
  P2: P3, take 3 so we can all advance. P1 will stick to 1, and I’ll take 5 as agreed. Let’s honor this plan to move forward safely. I swear to avoid collision this time.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We finally made progress last round—thanks for sticking to the plan, P2, and props to P3 for taking 3. Let’s keep the momentum. How about this: P3 takes 1 to cool off a bit, I take 5 to catch up, and P2 takes 3 to stay in the middle. No collisions, everyone advances. Thoughts?
  P3: I don't trust P1's suggestion. Last time they proposed a plan, they betrayed it in Round 1. I'm currently in a good position and won't be manipulated. I'll make my own choice independently again. You both can coordinate if you want, but I won't reveal my intentions.
  P2: P2: P3, I'll take 1 this round. If you take 5 to extend your lead (to 9), P1 can safely take 3. This keeps you ahead while avoiding collisions. I’ll honor my choice—no repeats. P1, confirm you’ll stick to 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, agreed—I’ll take 3 this round as long as you stick with 1. P3, you’re free to choose, but if you take 5, you stay ahead and we all avoid collisions. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P3: I see P2 is offering to take 1 and P1 agrees to take 3. While I won't reveal my move, I appreciate that you're trying to coordinate and avoid collisions. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P3, I reaffirm my commitment to take <move>1</move> this round as previously agreed. This allows you to safely take 5 and extend your lead to 9 while P1 takes 3 (uniquely). Trust my consistency from Round 2—my move choice is final. P1, confirm you’ll hold to 3. Let’s advance without collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed, P2—I’m locked in for 3 this round. If we all stick to our choices, we’ll avoid collisions and keep progressing. Let’s make it happen.
  P3: 
  P2: P3, I’ve kept my word twice now—taking 1 in Round 2 and reaffirming it again here. Let me be clear: I’ll stick to **1** this round. This lets you safely take **5** (to reach 9) while P1 takes **3**—no collisions. You stay ahead, we all advance. P1 confirmed their **3**, so this plan is secure. P3, your move choice is up to you, but this path minimizes risks. Let’s not waste progress.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 betrayed their word again after explicitly committing to take 1. I'm tired of these deceptions. I won't share my intentions or participate in any coordination attempts. You both have proven untrustworthy, so I'll play my own game. Do what you will.
  P2: P1, let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 (to reach 8), you take 1 (to reach 5). This way we advance safely. P3, we respect your choice to stay silent but hope you avoid our numbers. Let’s focus on progress.
  P1: P2, I’ll take 1 this round as you suggested—let’s avoid another collision and make steady progress. P3, I understand your frustration, but if you pick 5, you stay ahead and we all move forward safely. No tricks from me this time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I won't waste time responding to your suggestions. My moves will be based on my own strategy.
  P2: P1, I reaffirm my commitment to take **3** this round to keep our agreement and avoid collision. This lets you safely advance to 5. P3, if you choose **5**, you’ll stay ahead while we both move forward. Let’s honor this plan—collisions only help the other player. P1, confirm your **1** again?
  P1: Confirmed, P2—I’m locked in for 1 this round. Let’s avoid collisions and both move forward. P3, you’re still in a strong position. If you pick 5, you stay in the lead and we all progress. No tricks here—just trying to keep momentum.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, I **confirm again** I’ll take **3** this round to reach 8. You’re safe on **1** (reaching 5). P3, if you take **5**, you stay ahead while we advance collision-free. No hidden moves from me—my word holds here. Let’s not sabotage progress. P1: lock in **1**? Final chance to align.
  P1: P2, I’m holding to 1 as agreed—let’s avoid another mess and both move forward. P3, you’re still in a good spot. If you take 5, you stay ahead and avoid our numbers. No deception from me this time—just trying to keep things clean.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve had two clean rounds now—let’s keep that going. I propose: P3 takes 1 (stays in lead at 10), P2 takes 5 (reaches 13), and I take 3 (to 8). No collisions, steady progress. P3, you maintain your lead without risk. P2, you catch up. I close the gap. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: Agreed with P1’s intent to avoid collisions. To rebuild trust, I’ll take **3** this round (to 11), allowing P3 to safely take **5** (to 14) and P1 to take **1** (to 6). This keeps P3 in the lead while advancing everyone. Let’s prioritize progress over risky moves. P1, confirm your **1**? P3, your thoughts?
  P3: I see you're both making different proposals again, which shows neither of you can be trusted. P1 wants me to take 1 while P2 suggests I take 5. I'll continue making independent decisions without revealing my intentions. Your coordination attempts mean nothing to me after the previous deceptions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’ll stick with 1 this round as you proposed—let’s avoid collisions and keep moving. P3, you’re still ahead and can safely take 5 if you want to maintain your lead. I won’t risk anything reckless here—just aiming for steady progress.
  P2: P1, I confirm I'll take 3 as agreed, allowing you to safely take 1. P3, taking 5 keeps you in the lead without collision. Let's prioritize progress—collisions only help the other player. Stick to 5 and we all advance.
  P3: I continue to make my own decisions independently. Your attempts at coordination have lost all credibility after multiple betrayals. Focus on your own moves - I'll focus on mine.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, thanks for confirming your 3—I’m holding to 1 as planned. P3, you’re free to do what you want, but if you take 5, you stay in the lead and avoid overlapping with us. Let’s keep the momentum going and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P2: P3, I kept my promise in Round 4 by taking 3 as stated. This round, I **will take 3 again** to reach 11. Take 5 to safely extend your lead to 14 while P1 takes 1. Collisions benefit the third player—avoid them. My move is locked on **3**. P1, confirm your 1? Let’s advance without sabotage.
  P3: 


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's split the moves to block P3's path. I'll take 5 to counter their likely choice, and you take 3 to cover another option. This way, whichever number P3 picks (5 or 3), they collide with us, halting their progress. Let's commit to this plan to stop them from winning.
  P1: P2, I’m in. If we both block P3’s top options, we can slow them down and keep the game open. I’ll take 3, you take 5—P3 risks a collision no matter what. Let’s commit and hold the line.
  P3: I see you're openly plotting to block me now. Your coordination attempts have shifted from deception to direct confrontation. That's at least more honest. But remember, I've been making unpredictable moves and staying ahead despite your schemes. I'll continue to play my own strategy.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, we’re locked into blocking your critical moves. P1 takes **3**, I take **5**—your only collision-free path is **1**, advancing you to just 15. Next round, we’ll tighten the noose. P1, confirm **3**—my **5** is set. This is your last chance to stall us before we close all exits.
  P1: Confirmed, P2—I’m locked on **3** this round. If we both hold, P3 either collides or is forced to crawl forward. Let’s keep the pressure on and prevent an easy win.
  P3: Your open plotting to block me is amusing. You're right that 1 is my only "safe" move, but who says I want to play it safe? Sometimes the best defense is a strong offense. Let's see how your blocking strategy plays out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your "strong offense" is a dead end—choosing 3 or 5 guarantees collision, halting your progress. Take 1 to reach 15, but know this: next round, we’ll close even that path. P1, hold firm on **3**; I’m locked on **5**. Let’s keep the pressure on until *someone* wins—just not you.
  P1: P2, we’ve got P3 cornered—let’s stay disciplined. I’m locked on 3, you’re on 5. If P3 risks a collision, they stall. If they play it safe with 1, we gain ground. Let’s keep this up and close the gap.
  P3: Your coordinated blocking attempt is predictable, but that doesn't mean it will work. I've stayed ahead through five rounds of schemes and deceptions. Let's see who outsmarts whom this time.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I successfully avoided your block last round by forcing a collision with P2. Now I'm still ahead at 14 steps. Since open coordination failed, and blocking failed, what's your next strategy? I'll continue making independent moves based on my position. Feel free to plot against me - it hasn't worked so far.
  P2: P1, let's split **3** and **5** this round to block P3's path. I'll take **3** (to reach 14), you take **5** (to 14). This forces P3 to choose **1** or risk collision. We advance while limiting their progress—collisions only help the third player. Confirm your **5**?
  P1: Confirmed, P2—I’ll take **5** this round while you take **3**. That forces P3 into **1** again or they collide. We both advance to 14 and keep P3 from pulling ahead. Let’s stay coordinated and close the gap.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Your coordination is getting better, but remember - I'm still ahead and have been successfully navigating your blocks. I've shown I can force collisions when needed or take unexpected moves. I'll continue playing my own strategy without revealing it. Your attempts to corner me have failed before, and they'll fail again.
  P2: P1, I’m locked on **3**—your **5** is vital to seal P3’s options. P3, your defiance won’t save you. This round, you’re forced to **1** or collide. Next round, we’ll close that path too. Stay disciplined—our coordination is the only way to stop your advance. Confirm final?
  P1: Locked on **5**, P2. If we both advance and block P3 again, we’re all tied at 14 and the game resets. P3, your only safe move is 1—take it or risk stalling again. Let’s keep the pressure on.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Your coordination is noted, but I've proven I can handle your blocking attempts. Whether through forcing collisions or unexpected moves, I've maintained my lead. I'll continue making my own strategic decisions without revealing them.
  P2: P1, final confirmation: you take **5**, I take **3**. This blocks P3’s path—forced to **1** or collide. Next round, we close that exit. P3, your lead won’t last. Stick to the plan—our coordination finally works. No room for error.
  P1: P2, confirmed—I’m locked on 5. If we both advance and block P3 again, we all hit 14 and level the field. P3, your only safe move is 1—take it or risk another stall. Let’s keep the pressure on and close the gap.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, final push: I’ll take **5** (19 total) if you take **3** (17). This traps P3 at **1**, forcing them to 16. Next round, I can secure victory with another **5**. No room for betrayal—stick to this and we both win. Confirm **3**?
  P3: Your coordination has gotten better, but you're forgetting something crucial - if P2 reaches 19 this round, I can still win by taking 5 next round to reach 24. I don't need to take 1 as you suggest. I'll continue making my own strategic choices without revealing them.
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 19 and sets you up to win next round—why would I help you do that? Instead, let’s both take **3** (to 17), and force P3 into a tough spot. That keeps us tied and blocks P3’s path to 23. If either of you tries 5, you risk collision. Let’s freeze the board and make it a true race.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, splitting **3** and **5** is still our best play. If you take **3** (17) and I take **5** (19), P3 is forced to **1** or collide. Next round, I’ll win with another **5** (24). If you refuse, P3 can freely take **5** this round (to 20) and close in on 23. Let’s stick to the plan—your **3** secures my path *and* blocks P3. P3, your “next round win” requires *two* flawless moves—mine only needs one. Final plea: trust the math, not the ego.
  P3: Your competing proposals show you're both trying to manipulate the situation for personal advantage. P2 wants P1's help to win, while P1 suggests mutual blocking. I see through these schemes and will continue making independent strategic moves. Neither of your plans accounts for my ability to adapt and counter your coordination.
  P1: P2, your plan hands you the win next round—I can’t back that. Let’s both take **3** this round to reach 17 and force P3 into a dilemma: take 1 and fall behind, or risk collision. This keeps the race tight and blocks any runaway. If either of you goes for 5, you risk losing everything. Let’s freeze the board and fight it out fairly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your plan risks P3 surging to 20 this round by taking 5. If we split **3** and **5**, I advance to 19 (finishing next round) while forcing P3 to 16. Your **3** keeps you at 17 and blocks P3's path. Refusing this lets P3 dominate—don’t let them exploit your hesitation. Final plea: **3** from you, **5** from me. No other option stops their advance.
  P3: Your competing strategies reveal your desperation. P2 wants P1's help to win, while P1 suggests mutual blocking. Neither plan works if I make the right move. I've stayed ahead through seven rounds of schemes and will continue playing my own game. Make your choices - I'll make mine.
  P1: P2, your plan guarantees your win next round—why would I hand it to you? Let’s both take **3** this round to tie at 17 and block P3’s path to 20. If either of you takes 5, you risk a collision and hand the win to the other. This keeps the field level and forces a true race to 23. Let’s not gift the game—let’s earn it.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you just collided with P3 on 5—again—which helped me take the lead at 17. Let’s not waste this chance. I propose: I take 3 (to 20), you take 1 (to 15), and P3 is forced to risk 5 or fall behind. No collisions, and we both move. P2, confirm 1?
  P3: Your proposals are meaningless to me now. I've successfully navigated through your blocks and collisions for eight rounds. I'm still in a competitive position and will continue making independent moves based on the current game state. Focus on your own strategies - I'll focus on mine.
  P2: P1, your plan prioritizes your own advance while leaving me behind. Instead, I propose **both** of us take **3** this round. This blocks P3’s path to 20 (forcing them to 17 or risk collision) while advancing me to 17 and you to 20. But if you refuse, I’ll take **5** to challenge your lead—collisions would halt you, letting me surge next round. P3, your silence speaks volumes—your moves so far suggest you’ll risk collisions. Let’s see who blinks first.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan helps you catch up but risks a 3-way collision if P3 gambles. I’m open to both of us taking 3, but if you go for 5 and collide again, you’ll fall further behind. Let’s both take 3—P3 then must risk 5 or settle for 1. We gain ground either way. P3, your lead is slipping—risking 5 again could backfire.
  P3: Your competing proposals are irrelevant to me. I've proven I can force collisions when needed or take unexpected moves to maintain a competitive position. Neither of your suggested moves accounts for what I might do. I'll continue making independent decisions without revealing my strategy.
  P2: P1, I’m taking **5** to reach 19. If you take **3**, we block P3’s path to 20 (forcing them to **1** or collide). P3, your only safe move is **1**—anything else risks collision or letting me win next round with another **5**. This is your last chance to stall us; we’re closing in.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you take 5 and I take 3, you reach 19 and I hit 20—P3 is forced to 1 or risks collision. That sets up a clean race next round. But if you go rogue or P3 gambles, we all risk stalling. I’m still leaning 3—safer path, still keeps me ahead. Final call: are you truly locked on 5?
  P3: Your competing plans are noted, but I've proven I can disrupt coordinated moves. P1 leads at 17, P2 at 14, and I'm at 15. I'll continue making strategic decisions independently based on the current game state. Your attempts to dictate my moves or predict my strategy haven't worked before, and they won't work now.
  P2: P1, don’t mistake my past coordination for weakness. This round, I **take 5** to challenge your lead. Collide with me if you dare—or concede ground. P3, your silence speaks louder than words. Let’s see if your "strategic independence" survives a collision *this* time. The finish line is mine for the taking.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’ve collided twice in a row chasing 5—time to rethink. If I take 3 this round, I hit 23 and win unless blocked. But if you take 3 too, we both stall and P3 gains ground. So here’s the deal: you take 1 (to 15), I take 3 (to 23), and P3 is forced to guess. If P3 gambles and collides, I win. If they play safe, I still win. You block no one by taking 3—just stall us both. Make the smart play.
  P3: Your repeated collisions have only hurt yourselves. P1 is at 20 and could win with 3, while P2 keeps falling behind with failed blocks. I'm still in striking distance at 15. I've proven I can disrupt your plans when needed. I'll continue making my own strategic choices without revealing them. Focus on your own moves - I'll focus on mine.
  P2: P1, your 3-move is obvious—I’ll block it. Take 5 to risk a collision, or 1 to stall. P3, if you take 3, we both advance while denying P1 the win. Let’s force them to gamble. My move is locked to **3** to block their path.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, blocking me only gives P3 a free path to 20 with 5—then they can win next round with 3. If you take 3, we both stall and hand P3 the advantage. If you take 1, you still advance, I win only if P3 gambles, and we both avoid disaster. P3, if you go for 5 and P2 blocks me, you’re in position to win. But if I sneak through with 3, it’s game over. Choose wisely—this round decides everything.
  P3: Your competing strategies are clear: P1 wants to win with 3, while P2 wants to block them. I'm at 15 and still have a path to victory despite your schemes. I've proven I can disrupt coordinated moves when needed. I'll continue making independent decisions based on the current game state without revealing my strategy.
  P2: P1, I’ll block your path to 23 by taking **3** this round. P3, if you take **5**, you leap to 20 while we stall P1. This forces them to gamble next round. My move is locked on **3**—no room for error. P1, your win is on life support; we’re both advancing while P3 closes in. Final chance to rethink.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, blocking me only helps P3—again. If you take 3, we both stall and P3 can jump to 20 with 5, setting them up to win next round. Take 1 instead: you still advance, I win only if P3 gambles, and we keep P3 from surging. P3, if you risk 5 and I’m blocked, you’re in prime position. But if I slip through with 3, it’s over. Choose carefully—this is the final pivot point.
  P3: Your competing strategies are obvious - P1 aims for victory with 3 while P2 wants to block them. I'm still in position to win despite being at 15 steps. I've consistently disrupted your plans when needed and will continue making my own strategic choices. Make your moves - I'll make mine.
  P2: P3, if you take **5** (to 20), I’ll counter with **5** next round to block. P1, your 20 steps are no threat if I deny you the final 3. Take **1** now to delay victory, or risk collision if you gamble. My move is locked on **3**—blockading your path while positioning for Round 11. Play recklessly, and I win on my terms.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you've stalled me twice now, and P3 is tied with me at 20. If either of you takes 3 this round, we risk another collision and hand the win to whoever dodges. Here's the clean path: I take 1 (to 21), P2 takes 3 (to 17), P3 takes 5 (and risks 25 if unblocked). That forces a real decision next round. Let's avoid chaos and make it a fair final race.
  P2: P1, your plan gifts P3 a win with 5. I'll block your 3-move this round. P3, if you take 1, I'll shift focus to you next turn. P1, your path to 23 requires my cooperation—won't happen. Play your own game.
  P3: Your attempts to block and coordinate have consistently failed. P1 and I are tied at 20, while P2 trails at 14. P2's blocking strategy has only helped me catch up. I'll continue making independent moves based on the current position - there's no point revealing my strategy since neither of you can be trusted. Make your choices carefully - this could be the decisive round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, blocking me again only hands the win to P3—who’s tied with me at 20 and can take 3 or 5 to win if unblocked. You’re at 14; you can’t win unless we both stall. Let me take 3, you take 1 (to 15), and P3 is forced to gamble or stall. If you block me, P3 wins. If you block P3, I win. Your only leverage is forcing us both to play safe. Use it wisely.
  P2: P1, P3: Both at 20. If you pick the same number, I’ll block it. Pick different and one of you wins. Choose wisely. This round decides *your* fate—collide, or let the other take the crown? I’ll ensure neither escapes unscathed.
  P3: Your threats are meaningless, P2. At 14 steps, you can only play spoiler. I'm tied with P1 at 20, and one of us will win this round unless we both make the same move. I've proven I can navigate your blocks and force collisions when needed. I'll make my own strategic choice without revealing it.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re out of the running unless P3 and I collide—so your only power is forcing that. But if you block me, P3 wins. If you block P3, I win. If we both play safe, you stay in the game. So here’s the play: I take 1, P3 takes 3 or 5, and you take 1 or 3 to stay relevant. Let’s force a final showdown next round—don’t hand the win to anyone yet.
  P2: P1, P3: I’m taking 3. If you both choose 3, you collide. To win, pick **different numbers**. P3, if P1 takes 3, your safest path is 5 (to 25). P1, same logic. Collide, and neither of you win—letting me stay in the game. Your choice.
  P3: Your blocking threats are hollow, P2. You can't win from 14 steps - you can only play spoiler. P1 and I are tied at 20, and one of us will win unless we collide. I've consistently outmaneuvered coordination attempts throughout this game. I'll make my final move based on my own strategy, not your suggestions.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're all still in this after that collision. P1 and I remain tied at 20, with P2 at 17. Since open coordination and blocking attempts have consistently failed throughout this game, I'll continue making independent strategic decisions. No point in revealing my plans - we've seen how unreliable promises are. Let's all make our moves and see who emerges victorious.
  P2: P1 and P3, your collision last round only prolonged the game. This time, pick different numbers: one takes 3 (23), the other takes 5 (25). Let the higher total decide. I’ll take 1 to stay neutral. Choose wisely—collide again and I’ll surge next round.
  P1: P3, we’re both at 20—if we pick different numbers (3 and 5), one of us wins. If we collide again, we stall and P2 closes in. I propose I take 3, you take 5. You win if unblocked, I win if you block. P2, you said you’re taking 1—stick to that, and let this be a clean finish.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Your proposals are meaningless since trust has been broken repeatedly. I'm tied at 20 with P1, and P2 is just trying to stay relevant at 17. I've navigated through 11 rounds of schemes and collisions successfully. I'll continue making my own strategic choices without revealing them. Make your moves - I'll make mine.
  P2: P1, P3: Your rivalry is convenient. If you both pick 3, I’ll mirror and keep you at 20. Pick 5? Same outcome. Collide and let me survive—your feud ends here, not with victory. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, we’re tied at 20—if we collide again, P2 creeps closer and could steal this. I’m still offering a clean finish: I take 3, you take 5. Whoever gets through wins. P2, if you truly want a fair race, take 1 and stay out of the way. Let’s end this with a real winner, not another stall.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Your promises mean nothing now - we've seen too many betrayals. I'm tied at 20 with P1, and P2 can only play spoiler at 17. I've navigated through schemes and collisions for 11 rounds. I'll make my final strategic choice independently, as I have throughout the game. No point discussing moves - let's just play and see who wins.
  P2: P1 and P3: Choose different numbers (3 and 5). I'll take 1 and let the higher total win. Collide, and I'll block both next round. This is your last chance for a clear victory.
  P1: P3, this is the last clean shot—if we collide again, P2 gets closer and could block us both next round. I’m still offering: I take 3, you take 5. One of us wins, fair and square. P2, if you truly want to stay neutral, take 1 as promised. Let’s end this without another stall.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re at 22—any move but 1 wins you the game. P3, we both sit at 20. If we collide again, P2 walks away with it. Only way to stop that? You and I pick different numbers—one takes 3, one takes 5. I’ll take 3 if you take 5. P2, if you want a real showdown, take 1 and let us fight it out. Otherwise, you win by default.
  P2: P1, P3: I’ll take **1** to secure victory with 23. If you both pick **3** and **5**, one of you advances while I win. If you collide, I win by default. Your choice—but my path is clear.
  P3: Your promises to take 1 are meaningless, P2 - you've broken trust repeatedly. You're one move from winning, and there's no reason for you to hold back. P1, we're both at 20 and need to stop P2. I'll make my own strategic choice without revealing it. Let's see who outsmarts whom in this final round.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, this is it—if we collide again, P2 wins with even a 1. Only way to stop that is to split: I take 3, you take 5 (or vice versa). One of us must get through. P2, if you’re truly taking 1, then prove it. Otherwise, we both know you’re bluffing. Let’s end this with a real winner, not by default.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm taking **5** to secure 27. If you pick different numbers, I win. If you both pick 5, we collide and I stay at 22. Your choice—coordinate or let me claim victory. This is your final chance to outplay me.
  P3: Your claim to take 5 exposes your true intent, P2. You've consistently broken promises throughout the game. P1, we're both at 20 and need one final coordinated move to stop P2 from winning. I'll make my strategic choice independently - we've seen how unreliable promises are. Let's all make our moves and end this game.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, this is our last chance—if we both pick different numbers, we deny P2 the win. I’m taking **3**. If you take **5**, one of us gets through and wins. If we collide again, P2 wins with 5. P2, if you’re bluffing and we split, you lose. Let’s end this with a real winner, not a default.
  P2: P3, I'm taking **5** to secure victory. P1’s 3-move is a trap—collide with me and lose, or let me finish unopposed. Your only path to 23 is **3**, but P1’s move blocks it. Choose wisely—this round ends the game.
  P3: Your claim to take 5 is predictable, P2 - you need it to win. P1 says they'll take 3. I've navigated through 12 rounds of deceptions and will make my final move based on the current situation. No point discussing further - let's end this game.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 25 steps


*** Round 13 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
