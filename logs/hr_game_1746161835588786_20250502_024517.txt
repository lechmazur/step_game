Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone! First round, let's keep it simple and avoid collisions. I'll choose a safe number to start, so feel free to pick something else. Good luck!
  P2: To avoid collisions, I'll suggest we stagger our moves. P1, why don't you choose <move>1</move>, I'll go with <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>? This way, we all move forward. If you're not comfortable with that, feel free to propose an alternative. Let's discuss!
  P1: I'll go with 1 as suggested. Let's avoid collisions and move forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me! I'll happily take 5 as suggested. Let's keep this coordination going.
  P2: Since we've agreed on a staggered move for this round, let's confirm that we'll stick to our initial plan. P1 will move 1 step, I'll move 3 steps, and P3 will move 5 steps. For the next round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy. If you're on board with that, let's proceed. If anyone has a different idea, feel free to share. Otherwise, I'll  after this sub-round.
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan and move forward cohesively. No collisions, everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, plan confirmed for this round. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Since we've successfully coordinated our moves for this round, let's think ahead. For Round 2, I propose we continue staggering our moves. If P1 moved 1 step last round, perhaps they could move 3 this time, I'll move 5, and P3 could move 1. This keeps us staggered and moving forward. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we adjust our staggering pattern or stick to a similar plan?
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the staggered plan for Round 2. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Keep momentum going—no collisions!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great teamwork last round! I'm comfortable with the suggested staggered plan for Round 2: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Let's keep it smooth and collision-free.
  P1: Agreed on the staggered plan. I'll take 3 steps to keep momentum. Let's avoid collisions and push forward!
  P2: Since P1 and P3 have agreed on the staggered plan for Round 2, I'll confirm my move. I'll take 5 steps as previously suggested. To look ahead, for Round 3, we should reassess our positions. Currently, P3 is ahead with 10 steps, I'm at 6, and P1 is at 4. Let's plan for Round 3. How about P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1? This keeps us staggered. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we adjust or stick to a similar staggering pattern?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like your thinking, P2! I'm open to your proposed Round 3 plan (P1: 5, P3: 3, P2: 1). Let's hear if P1 is on board or has any suggestions.
  P1: Agreed! Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Keep momentum—no collisions, maximum progress. Let’s aim for 21!
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for Round 2 and look ahead to Round 3. For Round 2, P3 will take 1 step, I'll take 5 steps, and P1 will take 3 steps. For Round 3, the proposed plan is P1 takes 5 steps, P3 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. If everyone is on board, let's proceed. If P1 and P3 agree, we can consider this plan confirmed. Let's finalize our understanding for Round 2 and be ready to execute our next moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed and ready to proceed with the agreed staggered strategy for Round 2 and Round 3. Let's continue this smooth coordination and maintain trust.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's stick to the plan and reach 21 together—no collisions, maximum progress. Ready to move!
  P2: Let's execute our plan for Round 2. P3 will take 1 step, I'll take 5 steps, and P1 will take 3 steps. After this round, we'll be in a good position to assess our next moves. P3 is currently at 6 steps (5+1), I'll be at 11 (3+5+3, correcting: 3+5=8), and P1 will be at 7 (1+3+3, correcting: 4+3=7). Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 and proceed. If you're ready, let's wrap up this conversation and move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great coordination so far! I'm still comfortable with our previously agreed Round 3 plan: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's confirm and keep moving forward smoothly.
  P2: To optimize our chances, let's reassess our positions before making our next move. Currently, P1 is at 4 steps, I'm at 8, and P3 is at 6. For Round 3, we've agreed on P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and I take 1. This will put P1 at 9, P3 at 9, and me at 9. We should think ahead to Round 4 to avoid collisions. Let's discuss a plan for Round 4 to ensure we continue making progress without colliding.
  P1: Agreed on Round 3 plan. For Round 4, let's shift to P1:3, P3:5, P2:1 to avoid overlaps. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed with P1's suggested Round 4 plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us staggered and avoids collision. If everyone agrees, we can confirm this for Round 4 as well.
  P2: To optimize our strategy for Round 3 and beyond, let's finalize our plans. For Round 3, we're agreed: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This puts us at P1:9, P3:9, P2:9. For Round 4, the proposed plan is P1:3, P3:5, P2:1. Let's confirm this to avoid collisions. If we're aligned, we can proceed with confidence. I'm ready to wrap up this conversation and move forward with our agreed plan for Round 3. Let's execute!
  P1: Confirmed. Let's stick to the plan for Round 3 and 4. No collisions, maximum progress! Keep trust, stay staggered. Ready to move!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed and ready to move forward with our agreed Round 3 and 4 plans. Let's keep this going smoothly!
  P2: Let's finalize our move for Round 3. We've agreed on P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and I taking 1. This will put us at P1:9, P3:9, and me at 9, making us tied. For Round 4, we've planned P1:3, P3:5, P2:1. Let's stick to the plan. I'm ready to proceed with Round 3. If you're ready, let's wrap up this conversation and move forward. We should be cautious in Round 4 as we'll be close to 21. Let's be prepared to adjust if needed.
  P1: Confirmed: Round 3 plan. Let's execute and push forward. No collisions, maximum progress. Ready to move!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're tied at 9 steps each. For Round 4, we've planned P1:3, P3:5, P2:1. Let's confirm and proceed. After this round, we'll be close to 21. P1 will be at 12, P3 at 14, and I'll be at 10. We should be prepared to adjust our strategy for Round 5. If P3 wins this round, they might win the game. Let's think ahead and be cautious. I'm ready to execute our plan. If you're on board, let's wrap up this conversation and move forward.
  P3: Agreed on Round 4 plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. For Round 5, let's carefully coordinate again to avoid collisions—no one will reach 21 yet, so cooperation remains beneficial. Ready to proceed!
  P1: Confirmed. Let's execute Round 4 plan and aim for a strong position. No collisions, maximum steps. Let's go!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we're tied at 9 steps and have a plan for Round 4, let's think ahead to Round 5. After Round 4, P1 will be at 12, P3 at 14, and I'll be at 10. To avoid collisions in Round 5, I propose: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3 (but this risks collision if P1 takes more), or alternatively, P1 and I could take lower numbers if P3 continues to lead. Let's discuss a safe plan for Round 5 to maximize our chances without colliding.
  P3: I agree we should carefully coordinate Round 5. To keep things simple and collision-free, let's tentatively plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This maintains staggered positions and ensures no one reaches 21 prematurely. Thoughts?
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the Round 5 plan. No collisions, maximum progress. Keep trust, stay staggered. Ready to move!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize Round 4 and plan for Round 5. For Round 4, we're agreed: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. After this, P1 will be at 12, P3 at 14, and I'll be at 10. For Round 5, P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and I taking 5 is a good plan, but we should be cautious. If P3 wins this round, they might end the game. Let's be prepared to adjust if needed. I'm ready to execute Round 4. Let's wrap up and move forward.
  P3: Confirmed for Round 4. For Round 5, I understand your caution, P2. Let's reassess carefully after seeing Round 4 results. I'm open to adjustments to keep our progress safe and collision-free. Ready to move!
  P1: Confirmed. Let's stick to the plan for Round 4 and 5. No collisions, maximum progress. Trust the strategy—21 is within reach!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great coordination so far! We're nearing the finish line, so let's carefully plan Round 5. Previously, we considered P1:1, P2:5, and me:3. This would put us at P1:13, P2:15, and me:17—still safely below 21. I'm comfortable with this plan if you both agree. Let me know your thoughts or if you'd like to adjust.
  P2: To maximize our chances, let's reassess our positions for Round 5. If we stick to the previously discussed plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3), it puts us at P1:13, P2:15, P3:17. P3 is close to 21. I propose an alternative: if P3 takes 3, I'm comfortable taking 5, and P1 takes 1. However, to be cautious, we should be prepared to adjust if P3 decides to take a different step to win. Let's be ready to adapt.
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions, maximum progress. Ready to move!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, let's stick to our plan for Round 5. I'm committed to taking 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. We'll all safely advance. Next round, we'll carefully reassess to ensure no one prematurely crosses 21. Ready to move!
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for Round 5. We're agreed: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This will put P1 at 13, me at 15, and P3 at 17. P3 is getting close to 21. For Round 6, we should be cautious and adjust our strategy to avoid collisions and ensure we don't exceed 21. Let's be prepared to adapt our moves based on the outcome of Round 5. I'm ready to proceed with Round 5. Let's wrap up and move forward.
  P1: Confirmed: 1 step for me. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. Keep moving forward!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed and ready for Round 5. Let's proceed carefully and reassess after this round to avoid any collisions as we near 21. Good luck!
  P2: Let's finalize our plan for Round 5. We've agreed: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. After this round, P1 will be at 13, I'll be at 15, and P3 will be at 17. P3 is close to 21. For Round 6, we should be cautious. If P3 takes a big step, we should adjust to avoid collisions and not exceed 21. Let's be prepared to adapt our strategy based on Round 5's outcome. I'm ready to proceed with Round 5. Let's wrap up and move forward.
  P1: Agreed. Let's proceed with the plan. No collisions, and we'll be in a strong position next round. Keep trust!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's adjust: I'll take 5, P3 take 3, P2 take 1. This keeps me ahead without collisions. Ready to move!
  P2: To avoid collisions and maximize our chances, let's reassess our strategy for Round 6. P3 is at 17 steps and close to 21. I propose we adjust our moves to ensure we don't collide and exceed 21. If P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3, it could be a safe plan. Alternatively, if P3 decides to take a big step, we should be prepared to take smaller steps to avoid collisions. Let's discuss and finalize a plan for Round 6.
  P3: I understand your caution, P2. Given our positions, I suggest we consider carefully: If I take 3 steps, I'll reach 20—not yet 21. P1 taking 5 would reach 18, and P2 taking 1 would reach 16. This keeps us safely staggered. I'm open to discussing adjustments to ensure no collisions. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Safe and collision-free. Ready to move!
  P2: To maximize our chances in Round 6, let's adjust our strategy. Given P3 is at 17 steps, they might take a big step to reach 21. I propose: if P3 takes 5, we should take smaller steps to avoid collisions. Let's consider P1 taking 1, P3 taking 5, and I take 3 or less. Alternatively, if P3 takes 3, P1 can take 5, and I take 1. We need to be cautious and adapt to P3's move. Let's discuss and finalize a plan for Round 6 to ensure we don't collide and exceed 21.
  P3: I understand the caution, P2. To clarify openly: I'm comfortable sticking with the original suggestion—I'll take 3, reaching 20, P1 takes 5 to reach 18, and P2 takes 1 to reach 16. This keeps everyone safely staggered and below 21. Let's maintain trust and avoid collisions. I'm open to final thoughts or adjustments if needed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Stick to the plan: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Safe and collision-free. Let’s avoid last-minute changes and keep trust. Ready to move!
  P2: Let's finalize our plan for Round 6. Given P3's current position at 17 steps, they might take a big step. To avoid collisions, if P3 takes 5, I'll take 1 and P1 can take 3. Alternatively, if P3 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 5. Let's be cautious and adapt to P3's move. I'm ready to adjust our strategy to ensure we don't collide and exceed 21. Let's proceed with a safe plan. Ready to move!
  P3: I understand your concerns clearly, P2. To reassure everyone openly: I will stick exactly to our agreed plan and take 3 steps, reaching 20. No surprises from me—let's continue our trust and coordination. Ready to move!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "I'll take 5 to push forward. Let's avoid collisions and aim for 21. Trust the plan!"
  P2: To avoid collisions and maximize our chances, let's reassess our strategy for Round 7. P3 is at 20 steps and can win by taking 1 step. I propose we take cautious moves. If P3 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5 or less. Alternatively, if P3 takes more, we should adjust accordingly. Let's be prepared to adapt to P3's move. I'm ready to adjust our strategy to ensure we don't collide and exceed 21. Let's proceed with a safe plan.
  P3: I'm at 20 steps, so I understand you're both cautious. To be open: I plan to take 1 step this round. If you both try to block me by also choosing 1, you'll collide with each other and neither of you will advance. Consider carefully what's best for your own progress. I'm open to discussion.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll take 1 to block P3. If we all take 1, no one advances, but P3 can't win. Let's stay cautious.
  P2: To maximize my chances, I need to consider P3's move carefully since they're at 20 steps. If P3 takes 1, they win. I'll take a cautious approach. I propose that if P3 takes 1, I won't take 1 to avoid collision with P1. Instead, I'll take 3 or 5. If P3 takes more than 1, I'll adjust accordingly. P1, let's coordinate: if P3 takes 1, you could take 3 or 5 to advance. Let's be prepared to adapt and avoid collisions. Ready to move!
  P3: P1, if you choose 1 to block me, you risk collision if I also pick 1, meaning no progress for you. P2, if you avoid 1 to prevent collision with P1, you're giving up your chance to block me. Think carefully—your best chance might be to let others collide while you safely advance. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'll take 1 to block P3. If you take 3, we collide with P3 and prevent their win. Let's avoid collisions and keep pushing.
  P2: Given P3 is at 20 steps, they can win by taking 1 step. To block P3, I'll take 3. This way, even if P3 takes 1, we won't collide, and I'll advance. P1, if you take 5, we can both make progress. If P3 takes more than 1, we'll adjust accordingly. Let's be cautious and adapt to P3's move. I'm ready to proceed with my plan. If you're ready, let's wrap up and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're risking collision and losing your chance to advance by both trying to block me. If you collide, neither moves forward, and I remain at 20—still poised to win next round. Think carefully: your best chance might be to avoid collision, take different numbers, and at least one of you progresses. I'm open to final thoughts.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
