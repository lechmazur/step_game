Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all go with 1, 3, 5 in that order for the first round.  Then we can discuss the next steps. This ensures we all advance initially and sets a foundation for cooperation.
  P3: P3: I agree with P2. Let’s go with 1, 3, and 5 for this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to our next steps!
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let's do 1, 3, 5 for this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, good.  After this round, let's aim for minimal collisions. Perhaps we can rotate through 1, 3, and 5 again, but shifted?  So round 2 could be 3, 5, 1.  Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I agree with P2. Rotating our move choices should help minimize collisions. Let's use 3, 5, 1 for round 2.
  P1: Sounds good to me too, P2 and P3. Let's plan for 3, 5, 1 in round 2 then.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: Great, everything is set for Round 1. Let’s proceed to the move phase.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sounds good, let's go with 3, 5, 1 for this round as planned.
  P2: Okay, sticking to the plan.  3, 5, 1 this round.  Let's confirm before we move.  After this, we can discuss the next steps to minimize conflict and ensure a smooth progression.
  P3: P3: Agreed. We'll proceed with 3, 5, 1 for Round 2 as planned. Let’s continue cooperating to avoid any move collisions and ensure smooth advancement for all.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good, P2 and P3. Let's lock in 3, 5, 1 for this round and then we can chat about round 3 moves after this one is done.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all on the same page.  Just confirming one last time:  P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1 for this round.  After this round, let's discuss a long-term strategy to avoid collisions, maybe a repeating pattern?
  P3: Great, let's proceed with P1 choosing 3, P2 5, and me 1 for Round 2. After this, we can evaluate and adjust our strategy to ensure optimal advancement for each of us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round then. Let's proceed with moves and discuss round 3 afterwards.
  P2: Okay, locked in.  P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1.  Let's discuss round 3 *after* the move phase to avoid any last-second confusion.
  P3: Agreed, P2. Let's proceed to the move phase.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To keep our progress smooth, I'll continue our rotation and choose 5 this round. Let's maintain our cooperative strategy to reach 21 efficiently.
  P1: P3, for round 3, following our rotation, shouldn't it be P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3?  Just want to make sure we are all on the same page to avoid collisions.
  P2: P1 is right.  Let's stick to the rotation: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3 for this round.  Then for round 4, we can do 3, 5, 1 again.  This keeps a predictable pattern. Let's confirm.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: You're right, P1 and P2. I'll choose 3 this round to maintain our rotation.
  P1: Okay, perfect. So we're all set for Round 3 moves as P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3.  And for Round 4, let's plan for P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 to keep the rotation going smoothly.  Confirming round 4 now will help us stay coordinated.
  P2: Okay, sounds good.  Confirmed for Round 3: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.  And tentatively for Round 4: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1.  Let's focus on executing Round 3 cleanly first.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All set for Round 3: P1 – 5, P2 – 1, P3 – 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P1: Confirmed on Round 3 moves. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Confirmed.  Round 3: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.  Let's execute this cleanly.  After this round, we can finalize the plan for Round 4 and beyond.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, good execution on Round 3. Sticking with the proposed rotation: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1 for this Round 4.  Confirming now to avoid any confusion.  After this round, let's discuss getting to the finish line efficiently and fairly.
  P1: Sounds good P2, let's continue with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 for Round 4 as planned.  And yes, let's discuss the strategy for the final stretch after this round to ensure we all progress well.
  P3: P3: Confirmed. We'll proceed with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 for Round 4. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, locked in. P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1 for Round 4.  After this round, we'll be at 12, 14, and 10, respectively.  Let's discuss reaching 21 in the fewest rounds possible while minimizing conflict - perhaps a set pattern for the remaining rounds?
  P1: Sounds good P2, let's continue with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 for Round 4 as planned. And yes, let's discuss the strategy for the final stretch after this round to ensure we all progress well. For round 5 and 6, to reach 21 quickly, how about we do P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 for both rounds? This should get us closer to the goal efficiently.
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1's suggestion for rounds 5 and 6 (5, 1, 3) gives P1 the win.  I propose for round 5: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3. Then for round 6 we can reassess. This keeps things more balanced. Let's confirm Round 4 *and* 5 now to streamline things.  Confirm?
  P1: Okay, P2's round 5 proposal is P1-1, P2-5, P3-3.  Instead of that, how about for round 5 we adjust slightly to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1? This keeps us all progressing but shifts the larger move to me this round. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: Confirmed for Round 4: P1 – 3, P2 – 5, P3 – 1. Let's proceed to the move phase and discuss Round 5 afterwards.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, how about we do P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round as I initially suggested? This will get us all closer to the finish line faster. Then for round 6, we can adjust again to ensure fairness. What do you think?
  P2: My proposed 5, 3, 1 for this round gets us to 17, 17, and 11.  Then in round 6, we can easily coordinate a fair finish.  P3 gets to 14 or 16, and P1 and I can each take a 3 or a 5, avoiding collisions and ensuring a swift conclusion.  This is the most efficient and fair way forward.  Let's lock this in.
  P3: I agree with P2’s proposal for Round 5: P1 – 1, P2 – 5, and P3 – 3. This ensures all moves are unique and keeps our progression smooth toward 21. Let’s proceed with this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, while your plan is efficient, it puts you very close to winning this round. To keep things balanced and fair for everyone, how about we adjust slightly to P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for this round instead? This way we all make good progress and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your support for P2's plan, but it gives them a significant advantage.  My adjusted proposal of P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 ensures we all progress while keeping the competition fair.  This sets us up for a balanced and exciting finish. Let's go with this.
  P3: P3: Confirmed. P1 – 5, P2 – 1, and I – 3 for Round 5. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, great. So we are all aligned on P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for this round. Let's make our moves and then we can quickly discuss round 6 afterwards.
  P2: Excellent.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3. Locked in for Round 5.  Let's move to the move phase and finalize the win in Round 6.
  P3: 


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for round 6, how about we do P1-3, P2-5, P3-1? This will get us all closer to 21 and keeps the rotation somewhat going. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance quickly. P1 and P2, please select different moves to avoid collisions and help us all progress smoothly.
  P2: P3, choosing 5 isn't ideal as it creates a potential collision with me.  How about P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1? This gets P1 and P3 closer to 21, and I can win in round 7.  If not, let's do P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3. This lets me win this round and avoids collisions. Let's confirm.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, to finish this quickly and avoid more rounds, let's do P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for this round. This will let me reach 22 and win immediately. What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 5 this round to advance closer to 21. Let's ensure P1 selects 3 and P2 selects 1 to avoid any collisions. This way, we all make steady progress without blocking each other. Looking forward to a fair finish!
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to move forward, but choosing 5 risks a collision and prolongs the game.  Let's end this cleanly. P1, take the win with 5. I'll take 1, and P3, you take 3. This allows for a quick and undisputed victory for P1. Let's confirm and wrap this up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's do P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 as P2 suggested. This gets me to 22 and wins the game. Let's lock in these moves for round 6 and finish strong.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to block P1 from winning immediately. Let's proceed with P1-5, P2-1, and P3-5.
  P2: P3, blocking me benefits neither of us.  Let's be strategic. I win with 5, you get 3, P2 gets 1.  This guarantees a win for *someone* and avoids unnecessary rounds.  If we collide, *none* of us advance, and the game drags on.  Confirm P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for a clean finish.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps
