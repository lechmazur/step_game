Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2. Any initial thoughts on how we should approach this first move?
  P2: P1 and P3, I propose we each pick distinct numbers this turn to avoid collisions. Let’s spread out: I’ll take **3**, so maybe P1 picks **1** and P3 takes **5**? This way we all advance without overlapping. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P2's proposal to avoid collisions. To confirm, I'll take **1**, P2 will take **3**, and P3 can take **5**. This way, we all advance. Let's stick to our chosen numbers in the move phase. If you're comfortable with this plan, P3, please confirm. I'll say  next round if we're all set.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, that worked well last round. How about we repeat the same moves? P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This keeps things simple and everyone advances. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, while coordination is good, letting you pull too far ahead isn’t ideal. Let’s rotate our picks this round: P1 takes **3**, I’ll take **5**, and you pick **1**. This spreads advancement fairly and prevents one player from dominating early. P1, thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I like P2's rotation idea to keep the game fair. To confirm, this round: I'll take **3**, P2 will take **5**, and P3 takes **1**. Let's stick to this plan. If P3 agrees, we can all advance. P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this rotation. If so, we can proceed with the proposed moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I understand the reasoning behind the rotation to keep things balanced for now. I'll agree to take **1** this round, with P1 taking **3** and P2 taking **5**. Let's proceed with that plan.
  P2: Alright, confirmed. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 picks 1. This keeps us moving forward fairly.
  P1: Let's analyze our current positions and plan ahead. We're in Round 2, and after this round, the steps will be: P1 = 4, P2 = 8, P3 = 6. P2 is taking the lead. To avoid being too far behind, I suggest we continue the rotation for the next round. So, for Round 3: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 takes **3**. This keeps the rotation going and allows us to stay relatively close. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, that Round 3 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) sounds fair and keeps the rotation going. Let's tentatively agree to that for now. First, let's execute Round 2 as agreed: P1=3, P2=5, and I'll take 1. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Agreed. Let’s proceed with Round 2’s rotation as confirmed: P1 takes **3**, I’ll take **5**, and P3 picks **1**. This keeps our progress fair. No further adjustments needed here—let’s execute the plan.
  P1: To confirm, we've agreed on the moves for Round 2: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Let's proceed with the move phase. After this round, we'll be at P1 = 4, P2 = 8, P3 = 6. For Round 3, we've tentatively agreed on P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. I'm ready to move forward with Round 2. If you're both set, let's end the conversation here.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, confirming the plan P1 proposed for this round (Round 3): P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) will take 3. This brings us all to 9 steps. Seems fair. Are we all sticking to this?
  P2: P3 and P1, I propose a slight adjustment to preserve progress while acknowledging my current lead. Let me take **3** (to reach 11), P3 takes **1** (7 total), and P1 stays at **5** (9). This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's analyze the current state. P2 is leading with 8 steps, and I'm at 4. To catch up, we need to maintain a collision-free strategy. I disagree with P2's latest adjustment as it gives P2 a bigger lead. Instead, let's stick to our original plan for Round 3: I'll take **5**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 takes **3**. This keeps our steps relatively close. If you're both on board, let's confirm and proceed with the original plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I agree with you. P2's proposal significantly increases their lead, which isn't fair to either of us. The original plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) brings us all to 9 steps, resetting the playing field. P2, let's stick to that plan for this round to keep things balanced. I'm committed to taking **3**.
  P2: P1 and P3, to maintain harmony and avoid accusations of selfishness, I’ll concede and proceed with your original plan for this round: I’ll take **1**, P1 takes **5**, and P3 picks **3**. Let’s confirm and move forward. However, I urge us to revisit the rotation strategy post-Round 3 to ensure no one is left too far behind. Deal?
  P1: To maintain fairness and avoid giving P2 too much of a lead, I reiterate that we should stick to the original plan for Round 3: I take **5**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 takes **3**. Let's proceed with this to keep our steps relatively close. After this round, we'll be at P1 = 9, P2 = 9, P3 = 9. For Round 4, we should discuss a new strategy to ensure continued fairness and consider the risk of collisions as we approach the target. Let's finalize Round 3 first.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all aligned on the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, and I'll take 3. This brings us all to 9 steps, which seems like a fair reset. Let's execute this and then discuss Round 4. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Agreed, proceeding with the confirmed plan for Round 3: P1 takes **5**, I take **1**, and P3 picks **3**. This ensures a fair reset to 9 steps each. Let’s execute this and regroup afterward.
  P1: To ensure fairness and maintain a competitive balance in Round 4, I suggest we reassess our strategy. Since we're all at 9 steps after this round, we should consider a new approach to avoid collisions and maintain progress. Let's discuss a mixed strategy or randomization for Round 4 to keep each other guessing and prevent any one player from gaining an unfair advantage. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s continue the rotation to keep it fair. Since P1 took 5 last round, my turn to take it now. Let’s do P1=1, I’ll take 5, and P3 picks 3. This keeps us progressing without collisions. Agreed?
  P3: P2, your proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) deviates from the rotation pattern we've established. Last round was P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. To continue the fair rotation, the next sequence should be P1=1, P2=3, and I (P3) take 5. This brings us to P1=10, P2=12, P3=14. Let's stick to the established pattern: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. What do you both think?
  P1: To maintain fairness and continue our rotation pattern, I propose we stick to the established sequence. For Round 4, this means: P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This keeps our steps relatively close and follows the rotation. After this round, we'll be at P1 = 10, P2 = 12, P3 = 14. Let's proceed with this plan. If you're both comfortable, we can move to the next phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree to continue the rotation as proposed: P1 takes **1**, I’ll take **3**, and P3 picks **5**. This maintains fairness for Round 4. However, post-Round 4, I suggest we prioritize higher numbers (e.g., **5**) to accelerate toward 20 while avoiding collisions. Let’s discuss that after this round. For now, let’s execute the agreed moves.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all agreed on the plan for Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, and I (P3) will take 5. This continues the rotation fairly. Let's execute this plan. I agree with P2 that we should discuss strategy for Round 5 after this move. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: To optimize our chances, let's analyze the situation: we're all at 9 steps. For Round 4, we've agreed on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. After this, P1 will be at 10, P2 at 12, and P3 at 14. For Round 5, to avoid collisions and maintain fairness, I suggest we reverse the order: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This keeps us relatively close and allows everyone to advance. What are your thoughts on this plan for Round 5?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with the current Round 4 plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Let’s execute this to advance fairly. For Round 5, while I hear your proposal, I suggest we prioritize higher numbers (like 5) once we near 20 to accelerate toward victory while avoiding collisions. But first, let’s ensure this round’s moves are locked in.
  P3: Okay, we are all set for Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, and I'll take 5. Let's lock that in. We can finalize the plan for Round 5 after we see the results of this round. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: To optimize our strategy for Round 5, I suggest we stick to the proposed plan: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This keeps us relatively close and allows everyone to advance. After Round 4, we'll be at P1 = 10, P2 = 12, P3 = 14. By reversing the order in Round 5, we maintain fairness. Let's finalize Round 4 first and then execute the plan for Round 5. I'm ready to move forward with Round 4 as agreed: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stick to our agreed rotation for Round 5: **P1 takes 5** (→15), **I take 3** (→15), and **P3 picks 1** (→15). This keeps us tied at 15, ensuring no single player gains an unfair advantage. After this round, we can strategize a final push toward 20 while avoiding collisions. P3, will you honor this plan?
  P3: P2 and P1, that plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) does bring us all to 15 steps. While I'm currently leading, resetting the scores seems like a fair way to proceed before the final push. I'll agree to take **1** this round to maintain coordination. Let's execute this and then figure out the endgame.
  P1: To ensure we all reach the target fairly, I agree with P2's plan for Round 5: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This brings us all to 15 steps, maintaining parity. For Round 6, we should discuss a strategy to accelerate towards 20. I suggest randomizing our moves or picking distinct numbers to avoid collisions. Let's execute Round 5 as planned and then revisit our strategy. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase after this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2 and P1, I accept the plan to reset to 15 steps this round for fairness. However, let’s prioritize aggressive moves toward 20 in Round 6. To avoid collisions, perhaps we’ll agree to pick distinct numbers again but focus on **5** when possible. For now, I’ll take **1** as proposed. Let’s lock in the moves and prepare for the final push.
  P3: P2, just to clarify your last message - you said you would take **1**, but the agreed plan we all confirmed was P1=5, P2=**3**, and I (P3) take **1**. Can you confirm you meant you'll take **3**? Assuming that was just a typo, I'm still holding to our agreement and will choose **1** this round to bring us all to 15. Let's lock this in.
  P1: To ensure a fair and competitive game, let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 5: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This brings us all to 15 steps. For Round 6, I propose we pick distinct numbers to avoid collisions and accelerate towards 20. Let's randomize or coordinate on different numbers. Perhaps P1 can take **1**, P2 takes **3** (or **5** if available), and P3 takes **5** (or another available number). I'm ready to execute Round 5 and discuss Round 6 after.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, my earlier mention of taking 1 was a typo—I confirm I’ll take **3** as agreed. Let’s proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to reach 15 each. Once this round’s moves are locked, we can strategize for Round 6.
  P3: Okay, thanks for clarifying P2. We are all confirmed for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, and I will take 1. Let's proceed to the move phase. We can finalize the Round 6 strategy afterwards.
  P1: To optimize our chances in Round 6, I suggest we pick distinct numbers to avoid collisions. Given our current positions (P1 = 10, P2 = 12, P3 = 14), let's analyze: if we all pick **5**, no one advances. Instead, let's consider a staggered approach. For Round 6, I propose P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This ensures everyone advances. Alternatively, we can randomize but ensure distinct picks. What are your thoughts on this strategy for Round 6?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To optimize our chances in Round 6, I suggest we pick distinct numbers to avoid collisions. Given we're all tied at 15 steps, let's consider a staggered approach. I propose P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This ensures everyone advances. Alternatively, we can randomize but ensure distinct picks. If we all pick the same number, especially **5**, no one will advance. Let's coordinate on different numbers to maintain progress. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: P1, that plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) sounds like a logical way to ensure we all advance without collision, continuing our coordinated approach. It gives me the win this round, but it was your suggestion, and it avoids the stalemate of us all picking 5. P2, are you okay with taking 3 as P1 suggested? This guarantees you advance to 18. Let's confirm this plan.
  P2: P1, P3—I support your coordinated plan but let’s adjust to prioritize my final push. If I take **5** (→20) while you both take **3** (P1: 18, P3: 18), I secure victory fairly. Alternatively, if P3 insists on taking **5**, I’ll take **3**. Let’s avoid leaving it to chance—agreement first?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's analyze the endgame. We're all at 15 steps. To win, we must reach 20. If we all pick the same number, no one advances. I still propose P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5 to ensure everyone moves forward. Alternatively, to give one player a chance to win, we could allow a higher number. P2's suggestion to take 5 is risky but could pay off if others pick lower. P3, are you willing to take a lower number if P2 takes 5?
  P3: P2, your proposal (P2=5, P1=3, P3=3) clearly benefits only you. P1's original plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ensures everyone advances and avoids a collision, which is consistent with our cooperation so far. You yourself said if I insist on taking 5, you would take 3. I am insisting on taking 5, based on P1's fair proposal. Let's stick to P1=1, P2=3, and I will take 5. This avoids a stalemate and follows the cooperative spirit. Are we agreed on this final plan?
  P2: P3, let's adjust for my final push: I’ll take **5** (→20) if you take **3** (→18). P1 can take **1** (→16). This way, I win cleanly without collision. If you insist on 5, we both stay—better to let one of us advance. P1, confirm you’ll take 1. P3, this is fair; I’ve followed coordination up to now. Let’s seize the chance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid a stalemate and ensure progress, I reiterate my proposal: P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This maintains our coordination and allows everyone to advance. If P2 insists on taking **5**, I suggest P3 takes **3** and I take **1** to avoid collision. Let's finalize our moves to ensure someone can win. I'm willing to adjust if it means avoiding a stalemate and giving one of us a chance to reach 20. P2 and P3, please confirm your move.
  P3: P1, P2: I am sticking with **5**, as per P1's original fair plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). P2, you previously stated you would take **3** if I insisted on 5 - I am insisting. If you also choose 5, we collide and neither of us wins this turn, likely giving P1 an advantage. Let's execute the plan that allows a win without collision: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P1, please stick to 1. Let's finish this.
  P2: P3, if you take **3**, I’ll secure victory with **5** (→20). If not, we both stall—your call. P1, stick to **1** to avoid collision. Let’s decide now: I’m choosing **5**.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given that P2 and P3 collided on 5 last round, they're still at 15 steps. I'm at 16 steps. To win, I should take a higher number while avoiding another collision. I propose I take **5** this round. Since P2 and P3 are likely to avoid another collision on 5, they might pick lower numbers. If either P2 or P3 takes **3** or lower, I'll advance to 21 and win. Let's see their responses. I'm ready to proceed with **5**.
  P3: P1, announcing 5 is a clear attempt to win now. P2, neither of us wants P1 to win uncontested like that. We should coordinate to block P1. Perhaps one of us picks 5 to ensure they don't get away with it? What do you think, P2? We can't both pick 5 again like last round.
  P2: P3, let’s both pick **5** again to block P1’s path. If we both take 5, P1 can’t reach 21 without colliding. If they still choose 5, we all stay—giving us another chance. Alternatively, I’ll take **5** while you take **3**, forcing P1 to pick **1** or risk collision. Let’s coordinate to deny them victory this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I've proposed taking **5** this round to try and win. If either of you takes **3** or lower, I'll advance to 21. To counter, you could both take **5** again, but that risks a stalemate. Alternatively, one of you could take **5** and the other a lower number. I'll observe your response and proceed accordingly. I'm ready to finalize my move based on your coordination. Let's see how you both react to this challenge.
  P3: P2, your idea of coordinating to block P1 is good. If we both pick 5, we might all get stuck. Instead, let's ensure P1 doesn't win *and* one of us makes progress. I will take **5** to block P1 if they also choose 5. You should take **3**. This way, P1 cannot win this turn (they either collide with me or don't reach 20), and you advance to 18. If P1 chooses 1 or 3, I reach 20 and win. This is our best shot to counter P1. Let's commit: P2=3, P3=5.
  P2: P3, agreed. I'll take **3** (→18) while you take **5** to block P1. If they pick **5**, they collide with you; if they pick lower, we both advance. Let’s deny them victory this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll reiterate that I'm taking **5** this round. If either of you takes a lower number, I'll win by reaching 21. P3 has proposed a counter-strategy where they take **5** and P2 takes **3**. If you both stick to this plan, P2 will advance to 18, and we'll see my next move. I'm ready to finalize. Let's proceed with our chosen moves. I'm committed to **5**.
  P3: Okay, the plan is confirmed. P2, you're taking 3. I am taking 5. P1, if you also take 5 as you stated, we collide and P2 advances to 18. If you switch to 1 or 3, I reach 20 and win. Let's see what happens. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P3, confirm we're locked into our plan: **I take 3** (→18) and **you take 5**. This forces P1 into a dilemma: pick 5 and collide with you, or stay below and let one of us surge ahead. If they choose 5, their progress halts; if they don’t, you or I advance. This maximizes our collective advantage over P1’s 16. No changes—execute as agreed.
