Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, everyone, let's start this game. I propose we all choose different numbers to avoid collisions. How about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round? We can change it up later, but this guarantees we all move. What do you say?
  P3: That sounds reasonable, P1. If we all pick different numbers, we avoid collisions and all move forward. I’m fine with taking 5 this round. P2, are you good with taking 3?
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and all move forward. However, we should discuss how to adjust in future rounds to prevent predictability.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good! So we are agreed on 1, 3, and 5 for P1, P2, and P3 respectively, for this first round. Let's see how this goes, and then we can discuss strategy for the next round.
  P3: Great, we have a plan for this round. If we stick to it, we all move forward without blocking each other. In the next round, we should consider mixing things up to avoid being too predictable. Maybe we rotate choices or find another fair way to distribute moves. Let’s see how this round plays out first.
  P2: Agreed, let’s stick to the plan for this round to avoid collisions. In future rounds, we should rotate our choices to prevent predictability. For example, next round P1 could take 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all continue to move forward without blocking each other. Thoughts?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: The first round went smoothly since we all stuck to the plan. Now, to avoid being predictable, I’m fine with P2’s suggestion: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1 this round. That way, we all keep moving without collisions. If we rotate fairly, we all stay in the race without setbacks. Do you both agree to this rotation for Round 2?
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 2: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward while avoiding predictability. Let’s stick to this strategy and reassess in the next round to ensure fairness and continued progress.
  P1: I agree with the rotation as well. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This seems like the most logical and fair approach to keep us all moving. Let's do it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: This plan continues to work for now, ensuring we all move forward without collisions. However, as we get closer to 20, we’ll need to adjust our strategies individually to maximize our chances of winning. For now, I’m sticking with taking 1 as agreed. Let’s keep playing smart and reassess after this round.
  P2: Since we’re all sticking to the rotation plan this round, let’s consider how to adapt as we approach 20. Perhaps we can start introducing slight variations in future rounds to prevent predictability while still minimizing collisions. For now, I’ll stick with 5 as agreed. Let’s keep the momentum going and reassess after this round.
  P1: Okay, we've all agreed on the rotation: P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this for Round 2. As P2 and P3 mentioned, we will need to start thinking more strategically as we get closer to 20.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’ve all agreed on the rotation for this round, so let’s follow through. As we approach higher step counts, we’ll need to adapt individually. If we keep rotating predictably, someone might exploit it later. After this round, we should reassess and consider introducing some controlled randomness to minimize collisions while still advancing. Let’s see how this round plays out first.
  P2: Agreed, let’s stick to the rotation for this round. As we progress, we should start introducing controlled unpredictability to prevent exploitation. For example, in future rounds, we could each occasionally deviate from the rotation while still avoiding collisions. This keeps our strategy flexible while minimizing risks. Let’s reassess after this round.
  P1: Okay, we're all in agreement for this round. Just to reiterate: I (P1) will take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's get this round done and then we REALLY need to start thinking about individual strategies for winning, not just avoiding collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve all agreed on the rotation for this round, so let’s follow through. After this round, we should reassess and start thinking about how to balance strategy with unpredictability. If we stick to a strict pattern, someone might take advantage later. Maybe we introduce slight variations in our choices while still aiming to avoid collisions. Let’s see how this round plays out, then discuss adjustments based on our new positions.
  P2: Agreed, let’s stick to the rotation for this round. After this, we should consider slight deviations from the pattern to avoid predictability while still minimizing collisions. For example, one of us could occasionally choose a different number within the rotation to keep others guessing. Let’s reassess after this round and adjust our strategy accordingly.
  P1: Okay, so we're all agreed on 3 (P1), 5 (P2), and 1 (P3) for this round. Let's execute this. After this round, I'm going to start being less predictable. I suggest you all do the same. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve successfully avoided collisions so far, but now it’s time to think ahead. If we keep rotating predictably, someone might exploit it. I suggest we introduce controlled unpredictability—maybe each of us privately picks from two options instead of one fixed choice. This keeps things fair while preventing easy counter-strategies. What do you both think?
  P2: P3’s idea of controlled unpredictability makes sense. To keep things fair yet unpredictable, I suggest we each privately choose between two numbers this round—for example, P1 picks 1 or 3, I pick 3 or 5, and P3 picks 1 or 5. This maintains balance while reducing predictability. Let’s agree to this approach for this round and reassess afterward. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I like the idea of adding some unpredictability. However, your suggestion, P2, could still lead to collisions (e.g., P1 and P2 both pick 3).

How about this: I will choose between 1 and 5. P2, you choose between 1 and 3. P3, you can choose between 3 and 5. This eliminates *guaranteed* collisions, but still mixes things up. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1’s suggestion is interesting, but it still carries some risk of collisions. Instead of fixed number pairs, we could each pick freely but with a shared goal of avoiding direct overlaps. If we trust each other to avoid obvious conflicts, we maintain unpredictability without guaranteeing collisions. Alternatively, we could each secretly pick from a weighted preference—like 70% one number, 30% another—so there’s still randomness but less risk. What do you both think?
  P2: To minimize collisions while maintaining unpredictability, let’s each assign a primary and secondary move option. For example, P1: 1 (primary), 5 (secondary); P2: 3 (primary), 5 (secondary); P3: 1 (primary), 3 (secondary). We’ll privately decide which to pick, reducing predictability and collision risk. This balances strategy with flexibility. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I see your points. P2's latest suggestion is getting closer, but still has potential issues.

Here's a refined proposal: I will choose between 1 and 5, with a *strong* preference for 1. P2, you choose between 3 and 5, with a strong preference for 3. P3, you choose between 1 and 3 with a strong preference for 3. If more than one of us choose the lower value of our pair, it is a conflict, and all of us who chose the lower value get nothing.
If we all pick our higher value, it is also a conflict.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1's refined proposal still carries collision risks. Instead of fixed preferences, we could each pick freely but aim to avoid obvious overlaps. If we trust each other to make smart choices, we maintain unpredictability without guaranteeing collisions. Alternatively, we could each secretly assign probabilities to our choices—like 70% one number, 30% another—so there’s randomness but less risk. This way, we’re not locked into a pattern but still reduce direct competition. What do you both think?
  P2: To minimize collisions while maintaining unpredictability, let’s each assign a primary and secondary move option, but with clear priorities. For example: P1: 1 (primary), 5 (secondary); P2: 3 (primary), 5 (secondary); P3: 1 (primary), 3 (secondary). We’ll privately decide which to pick, reducing predictability and collision risk. This balances strategy with flexibility. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm getting a little frustrated with the complexity here. Let's simplify.

I'm going to choose between 1 and 5. You two can do whatever you want, but I'm telling you my range. I'm leaning *heavily* towards 1, but I *might* choose 5. Make your choices accordingly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 seems frustrated, so let’s simplify. I’ll choose between 3 and 5, leaning toward 3. P2, if you avoid 3, we reduce collision risk. If we overcomplicate things, we might end up blocking each other. Let’s make smart choices while keeping some unpredictability.
  P2: To minimize collisions and maintain unpredictability, I’ll choose between 3 and 5, leaning toward 3. P1 and P3, if you avoid 3, we can all move forward without setbacks. Let’s keep it simple and make smart choices. Overcomplicating risks unnecessary collisions.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. You both seem to be heavily leaning towards 3. I've already stated I'm heavily leaning towards 1, but *might* choose 5. Given your stated intentions, I will commit to choosing 1. P2, if you pick 3, you will collide with P3. P3, you should also consider changing.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid collisions while maintaining unpredictability. I propose we each choose between two numbers but prioritize avoiding overlaps. P1: 1 or 3, P2: 3 or 5, P3: 1 or 5. This reduces predictability and minimizes collision risk. Let’s commit to this approach for this round and reassess afterward. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. Last round, P2 and P3 collided. P2, your suggestion has a guaranteed collision *somewhere*.

I'm going to be blunt. I'm choosing between 1 and 3 this round. I *strongly* prefer 1. I suggest, P3, you pick 5. P2, you're ahead, so you have some leeway, but you might consider 5 also, or you'll collide with me if you pick 3.
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision between P2 and me was costly. To avoid that again, I’ll choose between 1 and 5, leaning toward 5. P1, since you prefer 1, that should work. P2, if you also take 5, we risk another collision, so consider 3 instead. We all need to move forward, but avoiding predictable patterns is key. Let’s make smart choices while minimizing risks.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To minimize collisions and keep advancing, I propose: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids overlaps and maintains progress. P1, your preference for 1 aligns with this. P3, taking 5 ensures no collision with P1 or me. Let’s stick to this plan for this round and reassess afterward. Overcomplicating risks unnecessary setbacks. Agreed?
  P1: P2, you're suggesting we go back to the Round 1 strategy? That's incredibly predictable. P3, you said you're leaning towards 5. I'm still leaning heavily towards 1, but *might* pick 3. P2, you need to pick something other than 1 or 3, given our stated intentions. I strongly suggest 5 for you, P2.
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision set me back, so I need to be cautious. I’m still considering 5, but if P2 also picks 5, we’ll collide again. P1 seems committed to 1, so that’s safe for them. P2, if you take 3, we avoid conflicts. If you take 5, we risk another setback. Let’s be smart—progress matters more than rigid strategy. What’s your final stance, P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid rigid patterns. I’ll choose between 3 and 5, leaning toward 3. P1, if you stick to 1, we avoid collision. P3, if you take 5, we all move forward without setbacks. Let’s keep it simple and prioritize progress over predictability. Overcomplicating risks unnecessary collisions. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, you're *still* leaning towards 3, which collides with my secondary choice. P3, you are considering 5, which is good.

I am going to commit to 1. P2, you *must* choose 5 to avoid a collision with me. P3, 5 is your best bet as well. If P2 doesn't listen, they will be the one to lose out.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’ll commit to 5 this round. P1 is locked on 1, which is fine. P2, if you pick 3, you collide with no one, but if you pick 5, you collide with me. Your safest move is 3. If you insist on 5, you risk losing progress again. Choose wisely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I’ll take 3 this round. P1, you’re committed to 1, and P3, you’re taking 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Overcomplicating only leads to setbacks. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next round.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, you've finally committed to 3, which is a safe choice for you. P3, you're committed to 5. I'm committed to 1. This round *should* be collision-free.

However, going forward, I'm going to be much less predictable. I'm giving you fair warning now. Good luck.
  P3: P1, P2, it looks like we’ve all committed to moves that avoid collisions this round. That’s good for now, but as we get closer to 20, we’ll need to think more individually. I’ll be adjusting my strategy in future rounds to maximize my chances of winning, not just avoiding collisions. I assume you both will do the same. Let’s see how this round plays out, but be ready for shifts in approach.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve avoided collisions so far, but predictability is becoming a risk. I propose we each privately choose between two numbers this round: P1: 1 or 3, P2: 3 or 5, P3: 1 or 5. This maintains flexibility while reducing collision chances. Let’s avoid rigid patterns and adapt individually as we approach 20. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, that suggestion is *still* problematic and could easily lead to collisions.

I'm going to be less predictable this round. I'm choosing between 1 and 5. That's all I'm telling you. You two need to figure out your moves based on that, and your own best interests. I'm done trying to coordinate perfectly, it's time to win.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all close in steps, so every move matters now. P1 is being less predictable, which means we need to be careful about collisions. I’m considering 3 or 5 this round. P2, if you choose 3, we might collide. If you choose 5, you might collide with me. P1, since you’re choosing between 1 and 5, that also creates risk. We should all think carefully—progress is key, but so is avoiding setbacks. What are your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, since we’re all close in steps, let’s focus on minimizing collisions while advancing. I’ll choose between 3 and 5, leaning toward 3. P1, if you pick 1, it’s safe. P3, if you avoid 3, we all move forward. Let’s keep it simple—progress matters most now. Overcomplicating risks unnecessary setbacks.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, you're *still* leaning towards 3, even though I've said I'm choosing between 1 and 5. P3, you're considering 3 or 5.

I'm going to make a suggestion: P3, you should choose 1. P2, you have a choice to make that will likely decide if you collide or not. I'm not revealing my choice, but I will say that I am strongly considering the implications of P3 choosing 1.
</stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all close in steps, so every move now is critical. P1 is being vague, which increases collision risks. P2, if you pick 3, we might collide. If you pick 5, you risk colliding with P1. I need to make the best move for myself, and I suggest you both do the same. I’ll choose between 1 and 5, but I won’t reveal my preference. Let’s all think carefully—progress is key, but avoiding setbacks is just as important.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I’ll choose between 3 and 5, leaning toward 3. P1, if you pick 1, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 3 reduces collision risk. Let’s prioritize progress—overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m focusing on advancing while minimizing setbacks. Adjust your choices accordingly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my range of 1 and 5. P2, you keep saying you're leaning towards 3. P3, you're now saying 1 or 5, which is a wider range than before.

I'm making my decision based on what's best for *me* to win. I suggest you both do the same. Stop trying to coordinate perfectly, it's not working. Focus on your own best move.
</stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all close in steps, so we need to be smart. P1 is being vague, and P2 keeps leaning toward 3. I’m considering 1 or 5, but I won’t reveal my preference. If we collide, we all lose ground while someone else pulls ahead. At this point, I’m prioritizing my best path to victory, not just avoiding collisions. Make your choices wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, we’re all close in steps, and predictability is risky. I’ll choose between 3 and 5, but I’m leaning toward 5 this round. P1, if you pick 1, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 5 reduces collision risk. Let’s focus on advancing individually while minimizing setbacks. Overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory—adjust your choices accordingly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've said all I'm going to say. I'm choosing between 1 and 5. You both know what you're leaning towards. Make your decisions. Good luck.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all very close, and every move now is critical. I’m choosing between 1 and 5, but I won’t reveal my preference. P1 is being unpredictable, and P2 is leaning toward 5 now, which increases collision risks. If we collide, we both fall behind while P1 gains ground. I need to make the best move for myself, and I suggest you both do the same. At this point, I’m prioritizing my best path to victory. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all close to 20, so every move is critical. I’ll choose between 3 and 5 this round, leaning toward 5. P1, if you pick 1, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 5 reduces collision risk. Let’s focus on advancing individually while minimizing setbacks. Overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory—adjust your choices accordingly.
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision set me back, so I need to be smart. P2, you’re leaning toward 5 again, but if P1 also picks 5, you’ll collide. P1, you’ve been unpredictable, so I don’t know your move. I need to make the best choice for myself, and I suggest you both do the same. At this point, I’m prioritizing my own victory. If we keep colliding, we all lose ground while someone else pulls ahead. Make your choices wisely.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, you collided with me last round and are still leaning towards 5. P3, you're ahead, but you need to be careful.

I'm going to choose between 3 and 5 this round. I'm *not* stating a preference. P2, if you choose 5 again, you *might* collide with me. P3, you need to consider that I might pick 3. Make your decisions accordingly. I am focused on winning.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all close to 20, and collisions now could be costly. I’ll choose between 3 and 5, leaning toward 3 to avoid potential conflicts. P1, if you pick 5, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 3 reduces collision risk. Let’s focus on advancing individually while minimizing setbacks. Overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory—adjust your choices accordingly. Good luck.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all close, and every move is crucial. P1 is choosing between 3 and 5, and P2 is leaning toward 3. If I pick 3, I risk colliding with P2. If I pick 5, I might collide with P1. I need to make the best move for myself, and I suggest you both do the same. At this point, I’m prioritizing my own victory over coordination. If we keep colliding, we all lose ground. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see P2 is leaning towards 3 now. P3, you're right to be cautious. I'm still deciding between 3 and 5, but I'm giving *serious* consideration to what both of you have said. P3, you might want to think about 1, given P2's stated preference.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m choosing between 3 and 5, but I’m leaning toward 3 to avoid potential conflicts with P1. P3, if you pick 5, we all move forward safely. P1, if you pick 5, it’s also safe. Let’s focus on advancing individually while minimizing collisions. Overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory—adjust your choices accordingly. Good luck.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all close, and every move is crucial. P1 is choosing between 3 and 5, and P2 is leaning toward 3. If I pick 3, I risk colliding with P2. If I pick 5, I might collide with P1. I need to make the best move for myself, and I suggest you both do the same. At this point, I’m prioritizing my own victory over coordination. If we keep colliding, we all lose ground. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've said I'm between 3 and 5. P2, you're leaning 3. P3, you're rightly concerned about collisions.

I'll give you one final hint: I'm *strongly* considering the fact that P2 is leaning towards 3. P3, you should factor that into your decision. I'm making my choice based on what gives *me* the best chance to win, and I suggest you do the same.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all close to 20, and collisions now could be costly. I’ll choose between 3 and 5, leaning toward 3 to avoid potential conflicts. P1, if you pick 5, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 3 reduces collision risk. Let’s focus on advancing individually while minimizing setbacks. Overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory—adjust your choices accordingly. Good luck.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all close, and every move is crucial. P1 is between 3 and 5, and P2 is leaning toward 3. If I pick 3, I risk colliding with P2. If I pick 5, I might collide with P1. I need to make the best move for myself, and I suggest you both do the same. At this point, I’m prioritizing my own victory over coordination. If we keep colliding, we all lose ground. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've said I'm between 3 and 5. P2, you're *still* leaning 3, despite my hints. P3, you're in the lead, but a collision could cost you everything.

I'll say this one last time: I am making my decision based *entirely* on maximizing my own chance to win. I am giving *very* strong consideration to P2's stated preference for 3. P3, you should do the same. I will not be giving any more hints. Good luck.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision slowed both of you down while I pulled slightly ahead. With all of us so close, every move now is critical. If we keep colliding, none of us win efficiently. I’ll be making my choice based purely on what gives me the best shot at victory. I suggest you both do the same. If you want to avoid setbacks, think carefully about your choices. No more perfect coordination—just smart, strategic play.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. Another collision last round, and P3, you're only slightly ahead. I'm choosing between 3 and 5 again this round. That's all I'm revealing. P2, you *really* need to stop automatically leaning towards 3. P3, you need to consider I might go for 5 to try to win. Make your choices.
</stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all close, and collisions are costly. I’ll choose between 1 and 5 this round to avoid conflicts. P1, if you pick 3, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 1 reduces collision risk. Let’s focus on advancing individually while minimizing setbacks. Overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory—adjust your choices accordingly. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all extremely close, and every move now is critical. Last round’s collision hurt both of you while I pulled slightly ahead. If we keep colliding, it only delays the inevitable. I’ll be making my move based purely on what gives me the best chance to win. P1, you’re between 3 and 5, and P2, you’re between 1 and 5. That means potential collisions still exist. I suggest you both carefully consider your choices. I won’t reveal my move, but I will prioritize my own victory above all else. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my range of 3 and 5. P2, you've widened your range, which is good, but you need to be very careful. P3, you're in the lead, but a single collision could cost you the win. I'm making my decision solely to maximize *my* chance of winning. I suggest you both do the same. Stop trying to outguess each other perfectly, and just focus on the best move for *you*.
</stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all within striking distance of 20, and collisions now could be devastating. I’ll choose between 1 and 5 this round to minimize risks. P1, if you pick 3, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 1 reduces collision chances. Let’s focus on advancing individually—overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory. Adjust your choices accordingly. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all extremely close, and every move now is critical. A single collision could decide the game. I’ll be making my choice purely based on what gives me the best chance to win, not just avoiding collisions. P1, you’re between 3 and 5, and P2, you’re between 1 and 5—there’s still risk. I won’t reveal my move, but I suggest you both think carefully. If we keep colliding, it only helps the player who avoids it. Prioritize your own victory and make the smartest choice possible.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my range of 3 and 5. P2, your range of 1 and 5 is interesting, but remember, I'm aiming to *win*, not just avoid a collision. P3, you're slightly ahead, but that lead is precarious. I'm making my decision based *solely* on maximizing my own chances. I strongly suggest you both do the same. Think strategically, not cooperatively.
</stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all within striking distance. I’ll choose between 1 and 5 this round to minimize collision risks. P1, if you pick 3, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 1 reduces collision chances. Let’s focus on advancing individually—overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory. Adjust your choices accordingly. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all extremely close, and every move now is critical. A single collision could decide the game. I’m making my choice purely based on what gives me the best chance to win. P1, you’re between 3 and 5, and P2, you’re between 1 and 5—there’s still risk. I won’t reveal my move, but I suggest you both think carefully. If we keep colliding, it only helps the player who avoids it. Prioritize your own victory and make the smartest choice possible.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my range of 3 and 5. You both know your ranges. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I'm making my decision to *win*, not just to avoid a collision. You should both be doing the same. Think about what gives *you* the best chance, not about what I might do. Good luck.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, everyone collided last round. P3, you're still barely in the lead. I'm going to choose between 3 and 5 again. P2, you really need to consider a different strategy. I am focused on winning, and I suggest you both do the same.
</stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s full collision was a disaster for all of us. I’m still slightly ahead, but that means nothing if we keep blocking each other. I’m choosing purely based on what gives me the best chance to win. If you both pick 5 again, we all stay stuck. Think carefully—if one of you changes and the other doesn’t, they gain an advantage. I won’t reveal my move, but I suggest you both think about how to maximize your own chances instead of just reacting to each other.
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision hurt us all. I’ll choose between 1 and 3 this round to minimize risks. P1, if you pick 5, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 3 reduces collision chances. Let’s focus on advancing individually—overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory. Adjust your choices accordingly. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my range of 3 and 5. P2, your range of 1 and 3 is a significant change, but it still presents a risk if I choose 3. P3, you're clinging to a tiny lead. You *must* consider that I might aim for 5 to try and win outright. I'm making my decision based *solely* on maximizing my own chances. I suggest you both do the same.
</stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s full collision kept us all stuck. I’m still slightly ahead, but that lead means nothing if we keep blocking each other.

Think carefully—if one of you changes and the other doesn’t, they gain an advantage. I won’t reveal my move, but I suggest you both focus on maximizing your chances instead of just reacting to each other.

Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my range of 3 and 5. P2, your range of 1 and 3 is a significant change. P3, you are still in a very slight lead. A reminder, I am making my decision based *solely* on maximizing my own chances of winning the game. I suggest you both do the same.
</stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s full collision stalled all of us. I’m still slightly ahead, but that lead is fragile. If we collide again, we all stay stuck, which benefits no one. I’ll make my move based purely on what gives me the best chance to win. If one of you adjusts while the other doesn’t, they gain an advantage. Think carefully—reacting to each other instead of planning for victory could cost you the game. I won’t reveal my move, but I suggest you both prioritize your own path to winning rather than just avoiding each other.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all close, and collisions are costly. I’ll choose between 1 and 3 to minimize risks. P1, if you pick 5, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 3 reduces collision chances. Let’s focus on advancing individually—overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory. Adjust your choices accordingly. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my range of 3 and 5. P2, you seem set on avoiding 3, which is understandable. P3, you're *barely* ahead. You need to consider that I might go for 5 to try and win. I am making my decision to maximize *my* chances of winning. I suggest you both do the same, and not just react to what you *think* I will do.
</stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all nearly tied, and another collision could decide the game. I’ll make my move based purely on what gives me the best chance to win. If we keep blocking each other, no one benefits. P1, you’re between 3 and 5, and P2, you’re between 1 and 3—there’s still risk. I won’t reveal my move, but I suggest you both think carefully.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision between you two helped me slightly, but I’m still behind P1. With P1 at 16 steps, they are the biggest threat to win soon. If we keep colliding, P1 will just pull ahead uncontested. I’ll be making my move based purely on what gives me the best chance to win. If you both want a shot, you need to think carefully about how to slow P1 down while still advancing yourselves. I won’t reveal my choice, but I suggest you both consider your best path forward strategically.
  P2: P1 is dangerously close to winning, and we can’t afford another collision. I’ll choose between 1 and 5 this round to minimize risks. P1, if you pick 3, it’s safe. P3, avoiding 1 reduces collision chances. Let’s focus on advancing individually—overcomplicating now could cost us all. I’m prioritizing my path to victory. Adjust your choices accordingly. Good luck.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2 you've changed your range to 1 and 5, which is good. However, P3, you're *still* behind me, and another collision could cost you the game. I'm choosing between 3 and 5. You both need to make your decisions based on what's best for *you*, not on trying to perfectly predict me. I'm focused on winning.

Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is very close to winning, and if they reach 20 first, we both lose. P2, you need to think carefully—if we keep colliding, P1 will just pull ahead.

  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my range of 3 and 5. P2, your range of 1 and 5 is a good adjustment. P3, you're *still* behind me. You both need to remember, I'm playing to *win*, not just to avoid collisions. Make your decisions based on what gives *you* the best chance, not on trying to perfectly coordinate. I will not be giving more hints.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I won that last round, but I didn't reach 20. P2, you avoided a collision, good job. P3, you collided with me. I'm still choosing between 3 and 5. It's very simple: if I pick 5, and either of you pick 5, I still win if we tie due to the tie-breaker rules. P3, you *must* avoid 5. P2, you have a choice to make, but you're still significantly behind.

</stop>
  P3: P1 is at 16 and will win if they reach 20 first. P2, you're at 11, so your only hope is for P1 and me to collide. I need to make the best move for myself, which means I *must* avoid picking 5 if P1 does. P1, you’re between 3 and 5, so I have to be careful.
