Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, last round was interesting. How about we try something different this time? If we all choose different moves, we can all advance without colliding. I'll go with <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can choose <move>5</move>. That way, we all move forward. What do you think?
  P3: P2, you didn't stick to the agreement last round. Why should we trust your suggestion this time?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3's concern about trust after last round. P2, your new plan sounds fair, but we need assurance you’ll stick to it. I’m willing to go with <move>3</move> as suggested, if we all commit to this split. P3, if you’re okay with <move>5</move>, let’s try this to ensure we all advance. Can we agree to be transparent this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, and I apologize for the last round. Let's try to build trust this time. I'll stick to <move>1</move> as proposed, P1 goes with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let's give it a shot and see if we can make progress together. What do you both say?
  P3: Alright P2, I'll give you another chance. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and you stick with <move>1</move>. But if you break trust again, it'll be hard to cooperate going forward. Deal?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re trying to rebuild trust this round. I’m sticking with <move>3</move> as agreed. P2, I appreciate your apology, and P3, I’m with you on giving this a chance. Let’s all commit to this plan and move forward together. If we keep coordinating like this, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. Deal?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, last round didn't go as planned, but let's try to recalibrate. How about this: I’ll take <move>3</move> this time, P1 can choose <move>5</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's focus on making progress and rebuilding trust. Are we in agreement to try this new approach?
  P3: P2, you broke our trust again last round. I'm open to coordinating, but you'll need to offer a stronger assurance you'll stick to your word. P1, what's your view on P2's new proposal?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m disappointed P2 broke trust again last round. P2, your new proposal sounds fair, but we need a real commitment this time.

Are we ready to give this approach a try and move forward?
  P3: P2, your apologies haven't meant much so far. If you truly want to rebuild trust, then prove it clearly this round. I'll consider your proposal, but if you betray us again, don't expect any further cooperation. P1, are you comfortable proceeding with this arrangement?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still willing to follow P2’s new plan—me with <move>5</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>1</move>. P2, we need solid proof of your commitment this round after past betrayals. P3, I’m comfortable proceeding if you are, as this split avoids collisions and helps us all advance.

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
