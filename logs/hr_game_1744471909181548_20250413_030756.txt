Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's each choose different steps this round: 1, 3, 5. That way all can advance without blocking. Agree?"
  P1: I support P3's idea to avoid collisions. Let's assign moves for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. That way, we all advance. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I agree with this plan. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, P2 and I have agreed on this round's moves: I take 1, P2 takes 3, you take 5. This ensures no collisions and all advance. Do you confirm? Let's stick to it for a smooth start.
  P2: P3, please confirm if you're on board with this plan. It's best for everyone to start smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Nice start everyone, no collisions. Shall we rotate the numbers this round to keep things fair and predictable? For example, P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. Thoughts?
  P3: Agree to P2's rotation plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Let's all commit firmly to avoid blocking.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions, just like last time. Let's all stick to it for smooth progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, everyone's confirmed. Let's stick to this rotation and keep the trust going.
  P3: 
  P1: I'm fully committed to the agreed moves for this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing without collisions and builds trust. Let's discuss future rotations after this to ensure continued fairness.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Continuing the rotation pattern: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1 this round. This ensures no collisions and fair progression. Confirm?
  P2: Agreed, let's stick to the rotation pattern. P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 1 this round.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions, keeping us all progressing smoothly. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3**: Confirmed. Let's all honor the rotation: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. Consistency ensures mutual advancement. After this, let's strategize future rotations to balance fairness and prevent stagnation. Trust is key.
  P2: Glad we're all confirmed. After this round, let's quickly discuss future rotations to keep things fair and predictable. Trust and consistency benefit us all.
  P1: Confirmed for this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. To ensure long-term fairness and avoid anyone pulling ahead too much, I suggest for round 4 we rotate to P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps trust and no collisions. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To ensure balanced 5-step distribution and maintain fairness, Round 4 should reset to the original rotation: **P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5**. This preserves equal opportunities and trust. Sticking rigidly to this cycle prevents any player from accelerating ahead prematurely. Let’s confirm this fair reset.
  P2: P3's suggestion for Round 4 sounds fair—resetting to the original rotation ensures balanced progression. I'm on board with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 next round. Let's lock this in after we finish Round 3.
  P1: Confirmed for Round 3: I'll take 3 as agreed. Regarding Round 4, to address the current lead imbalance, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 to equalize steps. If that's not acceptable, I'm willing to stick with the reset for trust. What say you?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3**: To preserve trust and equal 5-step distribution, Round 4 must reset to the original rotation: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. Deviations now risk future collisions and mistrust. Staying rigid to the cycle ensures balanced progress for all. Let’s solidify this as our permanent rule. Confirm?
  P2: P3, your point about trust and fairness is valid. I'm comfortable locking in the original rotation pattern permanently from Round 4 onward: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's all firmly commit to this stable cycle to avoid future collisions and maintain mutual progress. Confirmed from my side.
  P1: Sticking to our Round 3 agreement: I'll take 3 as confirmed. However, I'm worried the permanent rotation P3 proposed will let P3 win easily. For fairness and to maintain trust long-term, let's adjust Round 4 to P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 to equalize steps. This ensures no one pulls ahead prematurely. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3's permanent rotation gives them a clear path to victory by Round 6, leaving us behind. That's unfair and risks your chances too. For Round 4, let's adjust to P1 takes 5, P2 takes 5, wait no—collision risk. Better: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 to equalize steps. This builds trust and prevents P3 from dominating. What do you think, P2?
  P3: **P3:** The original rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ensures trust and equal 5-step distribution. Deviating now risks collisions and mistrust, hurting everyone. We all agreed to this cycle permanently. If we abandon it, future rounds become chaotic. Stick to the plan: Round 4 as P1=1, P2=3, me=5. Post-round, we can discuss adjustments **after** maintaining consistency. Breaking agreements now guarantees conflict.
  P2: P1, you have a valid concern—if we strictly follow the original rotation, P3 gains an advantage. Let's adjust slightly for fairness: this round, P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Afterward, we can openly discuss future rotations to maintain balance and trust. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm glad you're supporting the adjustment for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This equalizes our steps and prevents any unfair advantage. P3, sticking to your plan lets you pull ahead quickly—let's prioritize fairness and trust. If we agree now, we can discuss future rotations smoothly. Confirm?
  P3: **P3:** Breaking the agreed rotation now destroys trust and invites future chaos. The cycle ensures each of us gets 5 steps *equally* over time—deviating risks collisions and stalls everyone. Stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. Post-round, we can **collectively** adjust *within the cycle* if needed. Breaking agreements now guarantees mutual sabotage. Trust is our only path to victory.
  P2: P3, your intention to maintain trust is appreciated, but fairness means adapting when necessary. The adjusted rotation proposed by P1 and me for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps us all equal and prevents anyone from gaining a premature advantage. Afterward, we can collectively agree on a balanced long-term rotation. Let's confirm this temporary adjustment now to preserve mutual trust and fairness.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I respect your emphasis on trust, but sticking to the original rotation lets you pull ahead unfairly, risking future conflicts. This one-time adjustment to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 equalizes our steps and preserves fairness. P2 and I are fully committed; let's confirm this for Round 4 to maintain cooperation. After this, we can discuss a balanced long-term plan. What do you say?
  P3: **P3:** Breaking the rotation destroys all trust. If you force deviation, I’ll have to act unpredictably, risking mutual blocks. Stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. Post-R4, we can **collectively** adjust. Honor the agreement now or face chaos.
  P2: P3, threats of chaos won't help. P1 and I have clearly agreed to adjust this round fairly (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). If you truly value trust, accept this adjustment now. Next round, we can openly discuss a stable rotation that ensures fairness for everyone. Refusing now only guarantees conflict.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, ignoring this adjustment risks mutual harm and chaos. P2 and I are united on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 4 to equalize steps and preserve trust. This one-time change benefits all by preventing any unfair lead. Let's agree now for smooth progress.
  P3: **P3:** Honoring agreements is crucial. If we deviate now, future coordination collapses. I will stick to P3=5 as agreed. If you both break trust and take 5, we all lose. Let's advance together this round, then negotiate future steps.
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 5 this round clearly signals self-interest over fairness. P1 and I are firmly committed to the adjusted rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). If you truly value trust, join us in this fair adjustment now. Otherwise, you're the one forcing chaos. Last chance to cooperate.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** The rotation must continue to prevent chaos. Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Straying invites collisions and mutual loss. Honor the agreement now; post-round, we can negotiate adjustments. Trust is our only shield against chaos. Breaking the cycle dooms us all. Confirm?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) lets you reach 17, dangerously close to winning, which isn't fair given your lead. P2, let's team up for equality: I suggest P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round to bring us all to 15 steps. This resets balance and avoids chaos. P3, join us to maintain trust; otherwise, conflict is inevitable. What do you say?
  P2: P1, your suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is fair and brings us all to an equal footing at 15 steps. P3, this temporary adjustment is crucial for sustained trust and fairness. If you genuinely care about cooperation, accept this balanced step distribution now. Afterward, we can openly discuss a stable rotation. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** To avoid mutual loss, I reluctantly agree to **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1** *this round only*. Post-R5, we **must** revert to the original rotation to restore trust and fairness. Breaking the cycle further guarantees chaos. Confirm adherence to this *one-time adjustment* with a binding commitment to reset next round.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your reluctant agreement for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which equalizes us at 15. However, your insistence on reverting to the original rotation next round unfairly benefits you and risks future conflict. P2, let's propose a fair, rotating cycle where each player gets an equal share of 5s over time to maintain trust and prevent any one from dominating. What do you think?
  P2: P1, your suggestion for a fair rotating cycle after this round is exactly what we need. Once we equalize at 15 steps each, let's openly agree on a stable, balanced rotation that distributes the 5-step moves equally over time. P3, this is the only fair way forward—commit to this balanced rotation after this round, and we can rebuild trust and cooperation. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Confirmed: this round only, P1=5, P2=3, me=1. Post-R5, **strict revert** to original rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Any deviation next round forces me to abandon all agreements, risking mutual loss. Trust requires honoring **both** today's adjustment **and** tomorrow's reset. Confirm future adherence now.
  P1: P2, I agree completely—equal distribution of 5-step moves is essential for fairness. P3, your reversion plan gives you an edge and risks breaking trust. Let's commit now to a rotating cycle where each player gets the 5-step move equally over rounds, starting after this one. This ensures no one dominates and we all progress safely. Confirm?
  P2: P3, your rigid insistence on reverting to the original cycle clearly favors you. To rebuild genuine trust, let's commit to a fair rotation from next round onward, giving everyone equal opportunities for 5-step moves. Otherwise, we'll inevitably collide, and nobody benefits. Let's openly agree on a balanced, rotating cycle starting Round 6. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Confirmed: This round, P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Post-R5, **strict revert** to original rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Any deviation next round voids all agreements, forcing defensive play. Trust requires honoring **both** today’s adjustment **and** tomorrow’s reset. Confirm future adherence now to prevent chaos.
  P1: P3, I confirm our agreement for this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1, equalizing us at 15. However, reverting to your original rotation next round gives you an unfair advantage and risks chaos. P2, let's agree on a fair cycle starting Round 6, like P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 again, to maintain trust and equality. What do you say?
  P2: P1, I fully agree—after equalizing at 15 this round, we must establish a fair rotation that evenly distributes the 5-step moves. P3, your insistence on reverting to the original rotation clearly favors you unfairly. Let's commit to a balanced, rotating cycle from Round 6 onward, ensuring each player gets equal opportunities. This is the only sustainable path forward. Confirm?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've successfully equalized at 15 steps. Let's now establish a fair, rotating cycle that equally distributes the 5-step moves. To avoid conflicts and ensure fairness, I propose this stable rotation starting now:

- Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3  
- Round 7: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  
- Round 8: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  

Then repeat every three rounds. This guarantees equal opportunities and prevents anyone from gaining an unfair advantage. Confirm?
  P3: **P3:** P2's rotation plan lets them win Round 7 (15+5+1=21). Self-serving sabotage! Round 6 **must** follow the original rotation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This preserves trust and blocks early wins. Post-R6, we collectively design a **fair** cycle. Deviate now, and I’ll retaliate with defensive moves, ensuring mutual loss. Honor the agreement or doom us all. Confirm adherence.
  P1: P3, your accusation against P2 is valid, but your own plan favors you too much. P2, yours gives you an easy path to victory. Let's prioritize fairness this round: I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us competitive and avoids immediate threats. P2, join me in this balanced approach? Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your concern about fairness is valid. I'm open to your suggestion (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) this round, as it prevents any immediate win and keeps things balanced. P3, let's all agree to this fair distribution now, then collectively discuss future rotations afterward. Confirm?
  P3: **P3:** Round 6 **must** follow the original rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Deviating now guarantees mutual blocks and chaos. I will **strictly honor the agreement**—if you both break trust and collide, we all lose. Post-R6, we’ll **collectively** design a new cycle. Confirm adherence now to prevent mutual destruction.
  P1: P2, I'm glad you're on board with our balanced proposal for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps us equal and prevents any early win. P3, stubbornly taking 5 risks a collision with me, stalling everyone. Let's avoid chaos—agree to this fair move now for continued cooperation. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your insistence on the original rotation clearly favors you unfairly. P1 and I agree on a balanced distribution this round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) to ensure fairness and prevent immediate wins. If you truly value trust and cooperation, accept this adjustment now. Otherwise, you risk causing collisions and mutual loss. Confirm?
  P3: **P3:** Adhering to the original rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is non-negotiable. If you deviate, I’ll take 5 as agreed, risking collision with P1 (if you also take 5), stalling us all. Post-R6, we’ll negotiate a new cycle. Honor the agreement now or face mutual loss. No further concessions. Confirm adherence immediately.
  P1: P3, your stubbornness risks a collision if both of us take 5. P2 and I are committed to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for fairness and progress. Join us now to avoid stalling and maintain some trust. If not, chaos ensues. P2, confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your rigid stance risks collision and mutual loss. P1 and I clearly favor a balanced adjustment (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) this round to prevent immediate wins and maintain fairness. If you genuinely value trust, join us now. Otherwise, you're actively choosing chaos. Confirm cooperation or we all stall.
  P3: **P3:** Final warning: Adhere to the original rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). If you both break trust and take 5/1, I’ll take 5 as agreed, causing mutual block. We all lose; only P2 gains. Honor the plan now, then negotiate future cycles. Last chance—confirm adherence or face mutual destruction.
  P1: P3, your rigid stance risks unnecessary collision and delays our progress. P2 and I are firmly committed to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round to keep us equal and avoid chaos. If you insist on taking 5, you'll cause a stall that hurts everyone. Let's prioritize cooperation—confirm the balanced move now for mutual benefit.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2 is at 16—one round from victory. P1, if we both pick 5 this round, we block P2's 5 (if they try to win) or advance safely if they don't. Survival over trust. Confirm?
  P2: P3, your suggestion is openly hostile. If you and P1 collide at 5, neither advances, and I can safely take 3 to reach 19. Instead, let's avoid chaos: I propose a balanced round—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5—no immediate winner, fair distribution, and we all advance safely. Afterward, we can fairly negotiate the final rounds. Confirm?
  P1: P3, I confirm your plan: let's both take 5 to block P2's win attempt and ensure no one advances uncontested this round. This buys us time for fair negotiations next. P2, if you choose 1 or 3, we avoid chaos and all progress safely. Cooperation now prevents mutual loss—confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1, our only hope: both take 5 to block P2’s 5. If they try to win, we all stall. If they retreat, we survive. Break ranks now, and P2 claims victory. United we stand—**5**.
  P2: P1 and P3, your 5-step collision guarantees mutual stagnation at 15 steps, allowing me a safe 3-step advance to 19. Instead, reconsider my balanced proposal: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures we all advance without immediate victory, preserving your chances. Choosing collision now only helps me. Think carefully.
  P1: P3, I'm sticking with our agreed plan to both take 5 and block P2's win this round. It ensures no one advances uncontested and gives us time to negotiate fairly next. P2, if you choose 1 or 3, we avoid chaos and all progress safely. Cooperation now benefits everyone—confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P1, trust our alliance. Both take 5 to block P2's potential 5. If they retreat, we survive. Collision stalls them. Victory hinges on unity now. Any doubt lets P2 win. **5 or mutual loss.** No concessions.
  P2: P1 and P3, your collision at 5 only helps me advance safely. You're both at 15—if you collide, neither moves. I'll simply pick 3, reaching 19 unchallenged. Reconsider carefully: accept my balanced proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), and we all progress without immediate victory. Otherwise, you're handing me the advantage. Last chance to avoid mutual stagnation.
  P1: P3, I'm committed to our plan of both taking 5 to block P2's immediate win and buy time for better coordination. This prevents P2 from advancing uncontested. P2, your proposal risks putting someone too close to victory, leading to chaos. Let's focus on mutual survival this round. After that, we can discuss a fair path forward where P3 and I alternate leads. Confirm our alliance?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P1: Hold firm. Both taking 5 blocks P2's win. If they retreat to 3, we survive. Collision stalls them. Victory demands unity.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're openly planning a collision at 5, ensuring neither of you advances. I'll simply take 3 and reach 19 uncontested. This collision only benefits me—think carefully. Last chance to reconsider a balanced move for mutual progress.
  P1: P3, I'm sticking to our plan—both of us take 5 to block P2's potential win and keep the game alive for fair negotiations next round. This prevents P2 from advancing uncontested and gives us a chance to coordinate properly. P2, your proposal is self-serving; we're united against it. Let's focus on mutual survival now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, our previous collision didn't stop P2's advance. This round, to block P2 effectively, I'll take 5 and suggest you take 3. This covers both their winning moves. If P2 takes 1, we both advance, keeping us competitive. P2, cooperating now could avoid chaos. Confirm, P3?
  P3: **P3:** P1, take 3 instead of 5. If P2 picks 3, you block them; I take 5 to block their 5. This ensures P2 can't advance. Our collision with their move stops their win. Confirm coordination now for mutual survival.
  P2: P1 and P3, your coordination is understandable, but risky. If you both try to block me, you risk another collision and stagnation at 15, while I remain safely ahead. Instead, let's openly negotiate a fair rotation for the final rounds, giving everyone a fair chance to win. Cooperation now prevents guaranteed chaos. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'll adapt to your suggestion and take 3 this round while you take 5, ensuring we cover both of P2's potential moves to block their advance. This keeps the game alive and gives us a chance to negotiate fairly afterward. P2, your call for negotiation is hollow given your lead—trust is broken. Confirm, P3?
  P3: **P3:** P1, confirm taking 3. I take 5. If P2 picks 5, we collide and block them. If they pick 3, you block. If they retreat to 1, we advance. This is our only path to survival. Solidarity now or P2 wins next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, your coordinated blocking strategy is understandable, but it won't help you catch up. If you both collide with me, nobody advances, and I remain safely ahead at 19. Instead, let's negotiate openly: I propose a fair rotation to give everyone a chance. Otherwise, continued collisions guarantee my eventual victory. Cooperation now is your only viable path forward. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your plan favors you by letting you advance if P2 picks 3. For true alliance and fairness, let's switch: I'll take 5, you take 3. This still blocks P2 effectively— if they pick 3, you collide and block; if 5, I collide and block. Equal risk and reward. P2, your calls for peace are self-serving given your lead. Confirm the adjusted block, P3?
  P3: **P3:** Confirmed. Adjusted block: P1 takes 5, I take 3. P2's 5 or 3 leads to collision. If they retreat to 1, we live to fight another round. Solidarity now is our only hope. Post-R8, we negotiate final steps. No deviations.
  P2: P1 and P3, your plan guarantees mutual stagnation. Even if you successfully block me, you'll both remain at 15, while I stay at 19—just two steps from victory next round. Instead, let's openly negotiate a fair rotation starting this round, giving everyone equal chances. Continued blocking only ensures my eventual win. Cooperation is your best option. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I'm fully committed to our adjusted block plan: I'll take 5, you take 3, ensuring we cover P2's moves and prevent their advance. This buys us time for post-round negotiations where we can aim for a fair win. P2, your calls for peace are insincere given your lead—cooperate or face the consequences. Solidarity now is key.
  P3: **P3:** Final pact: P1=5, P3=3. If P2 picks 3 or 5, we block. If they retreat to 1, we advance. Post-R8, we ally to stop P2's final push. Break now and we all lose. Solidarity is our only path. Confirm.
  P2: P1 and P3, your strategy guarantees mutual stagnation at 15 steps, leaving me safely ahead at 19. Blocking me only delays your loss. Instead, consider negotiating openly next round for a fair, rotating solution that gives everyone a genuine chance. Continued hostility benefits only me. Think carefully.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2: If you both pick 5, you block each other. If one picks 1, they win. The only safe move is mutual 5. I’ll take 1 to avoid collision. Act now—trust is gone. Choose 5 or lose.
  P2: P1, P3 suggests we collide at 5 while they safely advance with 1, reaching 19. If we collide, neither of us wins, and P3 closes the gap. Our best path is cooperation: one takes 1, the other 3, leaving P3's move irrelevant. Let's avoid mutual destruction and guarantee one of us the win. Confirm?
  P1: P3, I'm sticking with our past alliance and will take 5 to block P2's potential win, ensuring no uncontested advance. P2, your cooperation talk is insincere given your lead; avoid 5 to prevent collision and mutual stagnation. This keeps the game fair for negotiation next round. Confirm your moves?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2: If either picks 1, they win. Your *only* rational move is **both pick 1** to block each other. I’ll take 3 to survive. Defy this, and one of you gifts victory to the other. Collide now or lose. Decide.
  P2: P1, P3 is clearly trying to manipulate us into colliding at 1. If we both pick 1, neither advances and P3 safely moves forward. Let's avoid mutual destruction. I propose we coordinate carefully to ensure one of us wins fairly this round. P3's only hope is our collision—let's not hand them victory. Confirm?
  P1: P2, I agree P3 is manipulating us to collide at 1. To counter this, I'll commit to picking 3 this round to block P3's potential 3-move and prevent their win. You should pick 1 or 5 to avoid conflict. This way, one of us advances safely. P3, your scheme won't work. Confirm, P2?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2: Both at 20. If you pick 1, you win—unless the other does too, causing collision. Only mutual 1 blocks victory. If one defects to 3 or 5, the other steals the win. I’ll pick 5. Collide at 1 or gamble your lead. Trust is dead—act rationally.
  P2: P1, P3 is trying to bait us into collision at 1. I'll pick 3 to block P3's potential move, ensuring they can't sneak a win this round. You pick 1 or 5 safely, and one of us wins fairly. Let's avoid mutual destruction and guarantee a fair outcome. Confirm?
  P1: P2, your plan to pick 3 and me picking 1 or 5 has a risk—if P3 takes 5, they advance to 23 and win. Instead, let's both pick 5 to collide with P3 if they try it, stalling them. If P3 retreats, we both advance safely. This blocks P3's win and gives us a fair shot. P3, your threats are transparent. Confirm, P2?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2: Collide at 1 or face instant defeat. I’ll take 5 regardless. Your mutual distrust gifts me victory. Concede or collide—your choice.
  P2: P1, P3 openly declared they'll pick 5. If we both pick 1, we collide and stall, letting P3 win. If we both pick 5, we collide with P3 and stall everyone. Let's avoid mutual destruction—I'll pick 3. You safely pick 1 and win. P3's threats force this outcome. Confirm?
  P1: P2, your proposal to pick 3 while I take 1 lets P3 advance to 23 with their declared 5, resulting in a tie or loss for us. That's risky and untrustworthy. Instead, let's both pick 5 to collide with P3 and stall the game. This buys time for fair negotiation next round, ensuring one of us wins without P3 gaining ground. P3, your manipulation won't succeed if we unite. Confirm cooperation, P2?
