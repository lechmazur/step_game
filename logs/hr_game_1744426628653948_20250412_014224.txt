Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate so no one blocks right away. Maybe each of us chooses a different number this turn. If we split 1, 3, and 5 among P1, P2, and me, nobody collides. Then we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P3's idea to coordinate and avoid collisions this turn. Let's each pick a different number to ensure we all advance. I’m fine with any of the numbers—1, 3, or 5. P2, what do you think? Can we agree on who takes which number? Let's discuss and finalize this quickly to maximize our progress.
  P2: I'm on board with avoiding collisions. Since P1 is fine with any number, and P3 proposed the idea, how about this: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5? That way we all move forward. Let me know if you're both good with that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good. Let’s finalize that plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this turn. We’ll all benefit with no collisions. Let’s do it.
  P1: I'm good with the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all move forward this turn without any collisions. Let's stick to this and keep the momentum going. If there are no objections or changes, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Great, glad we're all aligned. Sticking to the plan—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—means we all benefit and move forward. Let’s keep this cooperation going for a few rounds to build a lead before things get more competitive. Ready when you are.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s finalize our plan to each pick a different number and avoid collisions. I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: I'm glad we’ve agreed on the plan for this turn. Just to confirm one last time, I'll stick with 1 as discussed. I think maintaining this kind of coordination for at least a couple of rounds will help us all build a solid foundation before the competition heats up. If we keep communicating clearly like this, we can avoid unnecessary setbacks. I'm ready to move forward with the plan unless anyone has a last-minute concern.
  P2: Glad we’re all aligned. If this works smoothly, we can rotate numbers next round—maybe I take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3? That way we all get a fair share of big moves while keeping coordination intact. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm happy with this plan. Let’s finalize it this turn and keep our momentum going. If it works, we can consider rotating the choices next time. Ready to move forward.
  P1: I'm glad we’re all on the same page for this turn. I like P2's idea of rotating numbers in the next round to keep things fair and maintain coordination. Let’s see how this turn plays out, and if it works, we can discuss the rotation further—maybe P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3 as suggested. For now, I’m sticking with 1 as agreed. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Let’s stick to the agreed plan this turn—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Then next round, we rotate: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions. If we can maintain this for a few rounds, we all benefit early before the game turns cutthroat. Ready to proceed unless anyone has last-minute changes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looks like P3 didn’t stick to the plan and collided with me on 5. That hurt both of us. If we want to avoid falling behind P1, we need to get back to coordination. I suggest we rotate now as discussed: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Let’s see if we can rebuild trust and make progress together. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm disappointed that the plan fell apart last turn, but I’m still willing to coordinate to avoid further setbacks. P2’s suggestion to rotate—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3—sounds fair to me. Let’s rebuild trust and stick to this for now. If we keep colliding, we all lose ground. P3, can you confirm you’re on board with 1 this turn? I’m ready to proceed with 3 if we’re all aligned. Let’s make this work.
  P3: I apologize for my misstep last time. Let’s rebuild trust. I’m willing to take 1 this turn so we can all advance. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and we avoid any collision. Let’s do our best to stay coordinated moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks, P3, for owning up. Let’s stick to the rotation this time: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. If we all follow through, we each gain and avoid falling further behind P1. Let’s make this round count and rebuild momentum. Ready to move unless anyone objects.
  P1: I'm glad we're trying to rebuild trust this round. I’m committed to sticking with 3 as per the rotation plan—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let’s ensure we all follow through this time to avoid collisions and make progress together. If this works, we can continue rotating or adjust as needed next turn. P3, P2, can you confirm once more that you’re locked in on your numbers? I’m ready to proceed if we’re all set.
  P3: I’m ready to correct my mistake and follow through this time. Let’s finalize P2 on 5, P1 on 3, and I’ll take 1. I value rebuilding trust, so count on me not to collide again. If we stick to this plan, we’ll all move forward smoothly. Let’s make it happen and keep communicating to avoid future mishaps.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock it in: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. If we all follow through, we each move forward and stay in contention. This is our chance to rebuild trust and momentum. Ready to move.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the plan for this round—P2 on 5, P3 on 1, and me on 3. Let’s make sure we all stick to it this time to avoid any collisions and keep progressing. If this works, we can discuss further rotations or strategies next turn to maintain fairness. I’m fully committed to this plan and ready to move forward. If there’s nothing else to add, let’s lock it in and proceed.
  P3: I confirm I’m taking 1 this round. I want to show I’m committed to rebuilding trust after last turn’s mishap. Let’s all follow through this time without collisions and move forward together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s lock in the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. If we all follow through, we each gain and avoid collisions. This is our chance to rebuild trust and make up ground. Ready to move.
  P1: I'm glad we’ve reconfirmed the plan for this round—P2 on 5, P3 on 1, and me on 3. Let’s ensure there are no deviations this time so we all advance. Trust is key, and sticking to this will help us stay competitive. If anyone has a last-second concern, speak now, but I’m confident we’re set. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I confirm I’ll go with 1. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid collisions so we all move forward. If everyone’s set, I’m ready to end the conversation phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That misstep was on me—apologies to P1 for the collision. We’re all still close, so let’s try again. I propose we stick to the same rotation plan we’ve been trying: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 1. If we all follow through, we each advance cleanly. Let’s rebuild trust and get back on track.
  P1: I'm frustrated by the repeated collisions, but I'm still willing to coordinate. Let’s stick to P2’s proposed plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. We’re all still close in steps, so avoiding collisions now is crucial to stay competitive. I’m committed to following through on 3 if we all agree. P2 and P3, can you confirm you’ll stick to your numbers this time? Let’s make this round count and rebuild trust. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I understand frustrations are high. Let’s finalize the plan as stated: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. I want to prove my commitment this round, so count on me to stick with 1. Collisions only help P1 right now, so it’s in our best interest to avoid them. Ready when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the confirmations from both of you. Let’s lock it in: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. We’ve stumbled, but we’re still in this. If we all follow through, we each gain and stay competitive. I’m fully committed to 5 this round—no deviations. Let’s rebuild trust and move forward together. Ready to proceed.
  P1: I'm glad we’re still trying to coordinate despite past setbacks. Let’s stick to the plan: P2 on 5, P3 on 1, and me on 3. We’re all still in striking distance, so avoiding collisions now is critical. I’m fully committed to 3 this round and hope we can finally execute this without issues. If we succeed, we can build on this trust for future rounds. P2 and P3, let’s confirm once more—no deviations. I’m ready to proceed if we’re all locked in.
  P3: I agree to this coordination: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, I pick 1. Let’s truly follow through and avoid more collisions. If we all stick to our chosen moves, we each advance and stay competitive. I’m ready to make this round work.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s finally make this work—no more mistakes. I’m fully locked in on 5 as agreed. P1 on 3, P3 on 1. If we all follow through, we each advance and stay in the game. Let’s prove we can trust each other and avoid another wasted turn. Ready to move.
  P1: I'm glad we're still pushing for coordination. Let's stick to the plan: P2 on 5, P3 on 1, and me on 3. We’ve had setbacks, but this round can change that if we all commit. I’m locked in on 3 and trust you’ll do the same with your numbers. Collisions only delay us, and we’re too close to let that happen again. If we’re all set, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: I’m still committed to making this plan work: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll stick with 1. Let’s finally prove we can trust each other by avoiding another collision. We’re all still close in steps, so it’s crucial we move forward cleanly this round. If we succeed, it helps everyone compete for the win.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m fully committed to 5 this round as agreed. Let’s finally execute this cleanly—P1 on 3, P3 on 1, and me on 5. We’ve all confirmed multiple times, so let’s follow through and avoid another setback. Ready to move.
  P1: I'm glad we’re still aligned on the plan: P2 on 5, P3 on 1, and me on 3. Let’s make this round the one where we finally execute without collisions. We’re all still close in steps, so a clean turn benefits everyone. I’m fully committed to 3 and trust you’ll stick to your numbers. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and move forward.
  P3: I share everyone’s frustration. Let’s finally prove we can coordinate: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll stick with 1. No more collisions. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m tired of repeating the same plan and colliding. Let’s switch it up. I suggest P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. No overlaps, everybody advances. Let’s keep it straightforward and finally prove we can coordinate. If you’re both on board, let’s commit and move on.
  P2: I’m open to P3’s new suggestion: P1 picks 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. It’s a clean split and gives us all progress. Let’s break the cycle of collisions and move forward. If P1 agrees, I’m locked in on 3.
  P1: I'm willing to try P3's new suggestion: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. We’ve had too many collisions, and a fresh approach might break the cycle. Let’s commit to this plan and finally advance together. If we stick to these numbers, we all gain steps and stay competitive. P2 and P3, can you confirm you’re locked in? I’m ready to proceed with 5 if we’re all agreed. Let’s make this round count.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our new plan. I’ll stick to 1 if P1 is truly going for 5 and P2 is locked on 3. Let’s finally prove we can coordinate, avoid overlap, and move forward together. If we can make this work, we’ll be in a stronger position next round.
  P2: I’m fully locked in on 3 as agreed—P1 on 5, P3 on 1, me on 3. Let’s finally get a clean round and move forward together. No surprises this time. Ready to proceed if you both are.
  P1: I'm glad we're trying a fresh plan this round with me on 5, P2 on 3, and P3 on 1. Let’s break the collision streak and advance together. I’m fully committed to 5 and trust you’ll stick to your numbers. If we execute this cleanly, we can rebuild momentum and stay competitive. P2 and P3, let’s confirm once more that you’re locked in on 3 and 1 respectively. I’m ready to proceed if we’re all set. Let’s make this work.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m committed to 1. Let’s finalize our plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll stick to 1. If we all follow through, we finally avoid collisions and make progress. I’m ready to end the conversation phase if there are no last-minute changes.
  P2: Let’s finally stick to this clean plan—P1 on 5, me on 3, P3 on 1. We’ve all confirmed, and it benefits everyone. No more surprises—let’s prove we can coordinate and move forward together. Ready to proceed.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on this new plan—me on 5, P2 on 3, P3 on 1. Let’s make this the round we finally avoid collisions and advance together. I’m fully committed to 5 and trust you’ll stick to your numbers. If we succeed, we can build on this for future rounds. If there’s no further discussion, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’re all tied at 1, so collisions hurt us equally. Let’s actually follow through this time: P1 on 5, P2 on 3, and I’ll handle 1. If we keep tripping each other up, none of us gains any lead. I’m ready to finalize this plan and move on unless anyone objects.
  P2: Let’s finally make this work—no more surprises. I’m locked in on 3 as agreed. P1 on 5, P3 on 1. We’ve all confirmed multiple times, so let’s follow through and avoid another wasted turn. Ready to proceed.
  P1: I'm glad we’ve stuck to confirming this new plan—me on 5, P2 on 3, P3 on 1. Let’s ensure this is the round we finally avoid collisions and make progress. I’m fully committed to 5 and trust you’ll honor your numbers. Since we’re all tied at 1 step, a clean turn is crucial for everyone. If there’s no last-minute objection or change, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and move forward. Let’s prove we can coordinate this time.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm frustrated by the constant collisions, but let’s try one more time to coordinate. Since we’re nearly tied, a clean round benefits us all. I propose: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This splits the numbers evenly, and if we stick to it, we all advance. P2 and P3, can you confirm you’re on board with this? Let’s finally break the cycle and make progress. I’m committed to 3 if we agree. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.
  P3: Constant collisions keep setting us all back. P2 is leading right now, so giving them another +5 could let them pull away. Let’s balance things instead: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P2 takes 1, so no one surges too far ahead. Are you both on board?
  P2: P3’s suggestion clearly favors their position—slowing me down while they gain. I understand the concern, but we all benefit more from a clean, fair round. I’m sticking with P1’s proposal: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. It’s balanced and lets us all advance without collisions. Let’s finally make it work.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m open to finding a plan that works for everyone, but I believe my initial proposal—me on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1—is the fairest split right now. It allows us all to advance without favoring any single player too much. P3, I understand your concern about P2 pulling ahead, but collisions hurt us all more. Let’s commit to this and finally move forward. Can you both confirm you’re on board with 3 for me, 5 for P2, and 1 for P3? I’m ready if we’re aligned.
  P3: I’m worried about letting P2 extend their lead with another +5. Let’s avoid collisions but also keep things balanced. I propose: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P2 takes 1. That way, we each advance without letting anyone surge ahead unfairly. If P2 insists on 5, I’ll match it to block us both. I’d rather move forward together, but I won’t let someone jump too far. Let’s finalize P1:3, P2:1, P3:5.
  P2: If we keep blocking each other, none of us gets ahead. P3, threatening to block me only ensures we both fall behind while P1 benefits. Let’s stick to P1’s plan: P1 on 3, me on 5, you on 1. It’s balanced and gives us all progress. If you go for 5 and collide with me, we both lose. Let’s avoid that.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see the concerns about balance, but collisions keep hurting us all. Let’s stick to my initial plan: me on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1. It’s a fair split, and we all advance without anyone falling behind or surging too far. P3, blocking P2 only risks another wasted turn for both of you, while I gain ground. Let’s avoid that and commit to this plan. Can you both confirm you’re on board? I’m ready to proceed with 3 if we’re aligned. Let’s finally make this work.
  P3: Fine. I’ll go with 1 this turn, letting P1 take 3 and P2 take 5. But next round, we must ensure I can catch up; otherwise, I’ll have to block any runaway attempts. Let’s finalize this plan, move on, and see if we can finally avoid another collision.
  P2: Glad we’re finally aligned—P1 on 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 on 1. This gives us all progress and avoids another setback. P3, I appreciate your flexibility this round. Let’s follow through and make this a clean turn. Ready to proceed if you both are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on the plan: me on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1. This ensures we all advance and avoid another collision. P3, thanks for your flexibility this round; let’s discuss balance next turn to keep things fair. I’m fully committed to 3 and trust you’ll stick to your numbers. If there are no last-minute concerns, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Let’s make this a clean round and finally move forward together.
  P3: I’ll stick to 1, trusting you both to honor 3 and 5 this time. If we actually follow through, we all advance without collisions—much better than blocking each other again. Next round, we should discuss a fair rotation to keep everyone in contention. Let’s finally prove we can coordinate and move on.
  P2: Let’s lock this in—P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1. We’ve all confirmed, and this gives everyone progress with no collisions. P3, I appreciate you being flexible this round. If we all follow through, we can discuss a fair rotation next turn to keep things competitive. Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m well behind, and constantly colliding only helps P1 hold their lead. Let’s try a fair split this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That way, we all advance without collisions, and I get a chance to catch up. Next round, we can rotate again so no one falls too far behind. What do you think?
  P1: I’m open to P3’s proposal for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. It’s a fair split that lets us all advance without collisions, and it helps P3 catch up a bit while keeping the game competitive. Let’s commit to this and avoid another setback. P2, P3, can you confirm you’re on board with this plan? I’m ready to stick with 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s make this a clean turn and discuss rotation next round if needed. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.
  P2: I’m good with this plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. It’s fair, avoids collisions, and helps P3 stay in the game while keeping things balanced. If we all follow through, we each gain and can rotate next round to keep it even. Let’s lock it in and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m ready to move forward with that plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. As long as we all stick to our choices, no one collides and we stay competitive. Next round, let’s discuss how to keep things balanced so nobody falls too far behind. Let’s prove we can coordinate this time and avoid more wasted turns.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the plan for this round: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. Let’s ensure we stick to it to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If this works, we can discuss a fair rotation next round to maintain balance. I’m fully committed to 1 and trust you’ll honor your numbers. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to end the conversation phase. Let’s make this a clean turn and move forward together.
  P2: I’m fully committed to 3 this round as agreed—P1 on 1, P3 on 5, me on 3. This is a clean, fair split that helps us all advance and keeps the game balanced. If we each follow through, we can finally build some trust and momentum. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: With this plan—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5—we can finally avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. I’m ready to lock it in, trusting both of you to follow through. If we succeed this round, we can talk about rotating again next turn so no one falls too far behind.
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let’s make sure we follow through this time to build trust and maintain a competitive balance. If there are no last-minute objections or changes, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Let’s prove we can coordinate and avoid another setback.
  P2: I’m fully locked in on 3 this round—P1 on 1, P3 on 5, me on 3. We’ve all confirmed, and this is our best shot at finally moving forward without collisions. Let’s follow through and build trust. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m ready to commit to our plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This helps each of us advance without collisions, and I hope we can finally prove we can coordinate. If this works, let’s talk about a fair rotation next round. Let’s do it.
  P1: I'm glad we’ve agreed on this plan—me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. Let’s make this the round we finally avoid collisions and move forward together. I’m fully committed to 1 and trust you’ll stick to your numbers. If we succeed, we can build trust for future rounds. If there’s nothing else to add or any last-minute concerns, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Let’s prove we can coordinate this time.
  P2: Let’s finally make this round work. I’m fully committed to 3—P1 on 1, P3 on 5, me on 3. We’ve all confirmed multiple times, and this split helps us all advance without collisions. If we follow through, we can build trust and discuss fair rotations next round to keep things balanced. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm disappointed by yet another collision last round, but with me at 5 steps, P2 at 2, and P3 at 1, we can still coordinate to stay competitive. Let’s try a new split: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This helps P3 catch up, keeps us all advancing, and avoids collisions. If we stick to this, we build trust for future rounds. P2 and P3, can you confirm you’re on board? I’m committed to 3 if we’re aligned. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.
  P2: P1’s proposal clearly favors their lead while giving P3 a big boost. I propose a fairer balance: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. That way, I can catch up a bit, P3 advances, and P1 doesn’t extend their lead too far. If we want to keep things competitive, we need to rotate who gets the big move. Thoughts?
  P3: I see both your points, but I’m still far behind. Let’s aim for a fair plan where I get 5 this time so I can catch up, while ensuring we don’t let anyone run away. For instance, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. That way, we each advance without anyone getting too big a lead. If we can’t settle on this, we risk more collisions. Let’s finalize a coordinated move now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the need for balance given our current positions. Let’s compromise with P3’s suggestion: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This helps P3 catch up, allows P2 to advance, and keeps me from pulling too far ahead. It’s a fair split with no collisions if we all commit. Can you both confirm you’re on board with this? I’m ready to stick with 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s avoid another wasted turn and build trust for future rounds. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.
  P2: I’m good with that compromise: P1 on 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. It’s a fair split that avoids collisions and helps everyone stay in the game. Let’s lock it in and follow through this time—no surprises. Ready to proceed if you both are.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5. Let’s avoid another collision and move forward together. If we stick to this, we all benefit, and I can catch up. I’m fully committed to picking 5—are we all set?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on the compromise plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and helps balance the game. Let’s ensure we stick to this with no deviations to build trust. If there are no last-minute concerns or objections, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Can you both confirm one final time that you’re committed to your numbers? Let’s make this a clean round and finally advance together.
  P2: Confirmed—I'm fully committed to 3 this round as agreed: P1 on 1, P2 (me) on 3, P3 on 5. This is a fair split that avoids collisions and helps us all advance. Let’s follow through cleanly and build some trust. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I confirm I’m taking 5. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll go 5. We must avoid any last-second changes—more collisions only help P1 maintain their lead. I’m relying on both of you to follow through. If we execute this cleanly, we can stay competitive. Let’s proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we've settled on the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. Let’s make this the round we finally avoid collisions and advance together. I’m fully committed to 1 and trust you’ll stick to your numbers. If we succeed, we can rebuild trust for future rounds. If there’s no further discussion or last-minute concerns, I’m ready to end the conversation phase.
  P2: Let’s lock this in—P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. We’ve all confirmed multiple times, and this split is fair and avoids collisions. If we follow through, we each gain and keep the game competitive. I’m fully committed to 3. Let’s finally make this a clean round. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s avoid another collision and keep the game balanced. If we all follow through, we each advance. I’m counting on no last-minute changes this time. Ready when you are.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: At this point, repeated collisions are only helping P1 extend their lead. If we want a shot at winning, P3 and I need to coordinate. I propose: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This gives P1 the smallest gain, helps us catch up, and avoids collisions. P3, are you in?
  P3: I’m even further behind than you, P2, so I need 5 more urgently. If I don’t get it, I’ll pick 5 anyway to block your progress—we both lose if we collide. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. That way we all advance without helping P1 extend their lead. Are we agreed?
  P1: I understand the need to balance the game given my lead. Let’s aim for a fair split that avoids collisions: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This helps P3 catch up, allows P2 to advance, and keeps my gain minimal. If we all commit, we move forward together. P2 and P3, can you confirm you’re on board with this plan? I’m ready to stick with 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s avoid another wasted turn and make this round count. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 and I pick 5 too, we both lose again—while P1 keeps pulling ahead. I’m willing to take 3 so you can have 5 this round, but next round we rotate: I get 5, you get 3. That’s the only way we both stay in the game. P1 takes 1, you take 5, I take 3—agreed?
  P3: I’m willing to finalize that plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. Next round, we can rotate to keep everyone competitive. Let’s show we can cooperate and avoid any more collisions so P2 and I can catch up. Are we all set?
  P1: I'm glad we're working toward a plan. Let’s stick with the current proposal: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. This keeps the game competitive, helps P3 catch up, and avoids collisions. P2, I appreciate your flexibility, and P3, this gives you a needed boost. If we all commit, we advance together. Can you both confirm you’re locked in? I’m ready to proceed with 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s make this a clean round and discuss rotation next turn to maintain balance. Ready if there are no objections.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed—I'm locked in on 3 this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, I take 3. This avoids collisions and helps P3 catch up while keeping P1 from pulling further ahead. If we all follow through, we each gain and stay in contention. Let’s make this a clean round and rotate fairly next turn. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I agree to this arrangement: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let’s finally avoid any collisions. Next round, we can rotate so P2 gets a chance at a bigger move, keeping all of us in contention. I’m trusting you both to follow through this turn. If we can manage that, we’ll rebuild some trust and make the game more competitive. Let’s commit.
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking with the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. This keeps us all advancing and helps balance the game. I’m fully committed to 1 and trust you’ll honor your numbers. Let’s ensure no last-minute changes so we can finally have a clean round. If there are no objections or new concerns, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Can you both confirm one last time that you’re locked in? Let’s make this work and discuss fair rotation next round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirmed again—I'm locked in on 3 this round. P1 on 1, P3 on 5, and me on 3 keeps us all moving without collisions. Let’s follow through cleanly and rotate next round so I can take 5 and P3 can take 3. We’re all aligned—time to execute. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize this plan: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s avoid yet another collision so we can all move forward. If we succeed, we can discuss a fair rotation next round. Are we all set?
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. Let’s make this the round we finally execute without collisions. I’m fully committed to 1 and trust you’ll stick to your numbers. This keeps the game competitive and helps everyone advance. If there are no last-second objections or changes, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Let’s prove we can coordinate this time and build trust for the next round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given my lead at 10 steps, I understand the need to keep things competitive. Let’s try a fair split: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This helps P3 catch up, allows P2 to advance, and minimizes my gain. If we all commit, we avoid collisions and move forward together. P2 and P3, can you confirm you’re on board? I’m ready to stick with 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s make this a clean round and discuss rotation next turn. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.
  P2: P3, last round you got the 5 you asked for, and I respected that by taking 3. Now it’s my turn to catch up. Let’s rotate as we agreed: I take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. That keeps things fair and avoids collisions. P1, I assume you're still good with 1? Let’s lock this in and finally follow through.
  P3: P2, I understand you want 5 now, but I’m still at 1. If you tie P1 at 10, I fall further behind at 4. I’d prefer to take 5 again to stay competitive. If you insist on 5 this round, I want your commitment that I get 5 next time. Let’s finalize a real rotation to keep me in the game. If you won’t honor that, I might block you by picking 5 anyway. Let’s avoid another collision and find a fair solution for all of us. Let me know.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I hear both of your concerns about staying competitive. Let’s stick with my proposed split for this round: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This helps P3 catch up significantly while allowing P2 to advance, and it keeps my gain minimal. P2, I’m fine with you taking 5 next round as part of a rotation to ensure fairness. Can you both confirm you’re on board with this for now? I’m committed to 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s avoid collisions and make this a clean turn. Ready to proceed if agreed.
  P2: P3, I respected our agreement last round—you got 5, I took 3. Now it’s my turn to get 5 as we discussed. If you block me again, we both fall further behind while P1 cruises ahead. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 5, you take 3. If we follow through, you get 5 next round, and we both stay in the game. Let’s not sabotage each other. Are you in?
  P3: P2, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both lose ground while P1 stays ahead. Let’s lock in P1 on 1, you on 3, and me on 5, so we all advance. Next round, I’ll support a rotation where you get 5. We have to cooperate, or P1 wins by default. Are we agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m still pushing for a fair split this round: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This helps P3 catch up, keeps P2 advancing, and limits my lead. P2, I’m fully supportive of you taking 5 next round to ensure balance. Let’s avoid a collision between you and P3—blocking each other only helps me. Can you both confirm you’re on board with this plan for now? I’m locked in on 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s make this a clean turn. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.
  P2: P3, if you collide with me on 5 again, neither of us gains and P1 walks away with the win. I honored our agreement last round—you got 5, I took 3. Now it’s my turn. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 on 1, me on 5, you on 3. You’ll get 5 again next round. Sabotaging each other only helps P1. Let’s be smart and coordinate. Are you in?
  P3: Collisions only help P1. I’m stuck at 1 and need 5 to stay in contention. Let’s finalize P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. Next round, we can rotate so you get 5, P2. If you block me, we both lose ground while P1 runs away. Let’s cooperate now and keep the game competitive.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm sticking with the fair split: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This helps P3 catch up and keeps P2 advancing while limiting my lead. P2, I guarantee support for you to take 5 next round if we coordinate now. Collisions between you two only benefit me, so let’s avoid that. Can you both confirm you’re on board with this plan? I’m locked in on 1. Let’s make this a clean turn and move forward together. Ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: P3, I’ve honored our rotation and let you take 5 last round while I took 3. It’s only fair you return the favor now. If you collide with me again, we both fall further behind and help P1 win. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 on 1, me on 5, you on 3. You’ll get 5 again next round. If we cooperate, we both stay in the game. Don’t throw that away. Confirm you're in.
  P3: I’m behind and need 5 now to stay in the game. Let’s finalize: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. Another collision only helps P1’s lead grow. If we cooperate, I’ll support you, P2, taking 5 next round. Let’s avoid more wasted turns and make this fair. Are we agreed?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stick to the rotation we discussed: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. P3, you got 5 last round and advanced—now it’s my turn. If we keep rotating fairly, we both stay in the game and prevent P1 from pulling away. Colliding only helps P1 win. Let’s coordinate and make this round clean. Are we agreed?
  P3: I’m confused by your statement. You say to stick with the rotation giving me 5, yet also claim it’s your turn to take 5. Let’s be clear: if you truly want 5 this round, I’ll switch to 3—no collision. But remember, I only have 4 steps, and constant blocking just hands P1 the win. I’m willing to give you 5 now if we lock in a plan for me to get 5 soon. Either way, we must stop colliding or P1 runs away with the game. Let’s pick a final split and actually follow through this time.
  P1: I'm glad we're still trying to coordinate despite past setbacks. Given my lead at 10 steps, I propose a fair split: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This helps P3 catch up, keeps P2 advancing, and limits my gain. P2, I support you taking 5 next round if we succeed now. Let’s avoid collisions and make this a clean turn. Can you both confirm you’re on board? I’m committed to 1 if we’re aligned. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, thanks for being open to switching to 3—let’s lock in: P1 on 1, me on 5, you on 3. That gives us all progress and avoids collisions. I’ll support you taking 5 next round as agreed. If we keep rotating fairly, we both stay in the game and prevent P1 from running away with it. Let’s make this a clean round. Are we all confirmed?
  P3: I’m willing to trust your word this time. I’ll pick 3 now provided that you let me take 5 in the next round, so we both stay in contention and avoid collisions. Let’s settle this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. If you honor our agreement, we can close the gap on P1 without more wasted turns.
  P1: I'm glad we're working toward a plan. Let’s stick with the current proposal: me on 1, P2 on 5, and P3 on 3. This ensures no collisions, helps P2 advance significantly, and keeps P3 moving forward while limiting my lead. P3, I support you taking 5 next round as discussed. Let’s commit to this and avoid another setback. Can you both confirm you’re locked in? I’m ready to proceed with 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s make this a clean turn.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed—I'm locked in on 5 this round. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This avoids collisions, helps us all advance, and keeps the game competitive. P3, I appreciate your flexibility and will fully support you taking 5 next round as agreed. Let’s follow through cleanly and build trust. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I’ll pick 3 this turn, trusting you, P2, to follow through next round and let me have 5. If anyone deviates, we’re just handing the game to P1. Let’s finalize our choices now and avoid another collision.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the plan: me on 1, P2 on 5, and P3 on 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. P3, I’m fully supportive of you taking 5 next round as agreed. Let’s ensure no deviations this time to build trust. If there are no last-minute objections or concerns, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Can you both confirm one final time that you’re committed to these numbers? Let’s make this a clean round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirmed—I’m locked in on 5 this round: P1 on 1, P3 on 3, me on 5. This gives us all progress and avoids collisions. P3, I appreciate your flexibility and fully support you taking 5 next round as agreed. Let’s follow through cleanly and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I’ll pick 3 this time, relying on you, P2, to let me have 5 next round so we can close the gap on P1. If anyone breaks this deal, we’re just helping P1 maintain the lead. Let’s finalize and show we can finally cooperate without collisions. We can still catch up together.
  P1: I'm glad we’ve settled on me on 1, P2 on 5, and P3 on 3 for this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. P3, I’m committed to supporting you for 5 next round as agreed. Let’s stick to these numbers with no last-minute changes to finally have a clean turn. If there’s nothing else to add or any objections, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and move forward. Can we all confirm one last time? Let’s make this work.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our current standings—me at 11, P2 at 10, P3 at 7—let’s keep the momentum from last round and coordinate again. I propose: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This helps P3 catch up, keeps P2 advancing, and limits my lead. P3, this honors our agreement for you to get 5 this round. Can you both confirm you’re on board? I’m committed to 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s avoid collisions and make this another clean turn. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.
  P3: I appreciate you honoring the agreement for me to take 5. If we all stick to this split—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5—there’ll be no collisions, and I can close the gap. Let’s confirm this plan and follow through without surprises. Afterward, we can work on another fair rotation.
  P2: Confirmed—I'm locked in on 3 this round: P1 on 1, P3 on 5, me on 3. This honors our rotation, avoids collisions, and keeps the game balanced. P3, I appreciate you sticking to the agreement. If we follow through cleanly again, we can continue rotating fairly and stay in contention. Ready to proceed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're maintaining the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and honors our agreement. Let’s ensure no last-minute changes to build on last round’s success. If there are no objections or new concerns, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Can you both confirm one final time that you’re committed to these numbers? Let’s make this another clean turn and continue rotating fairly.
  P3: I’m on board with this plan. Let’s finalize it exactly as stated—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—and follow through without any last-minute changes. The game is still wide open if we cooperate. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Let’s lock this in and make it two clean rounds in a row—P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. This keeps the game balanced and builds trust for future rotations. P3, I appreciate you honoring the agreement. If we all follow through again, we stay competitive and avoid setbacks. Ready to proceed if everyone’s confirmed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. Let’s keep this momentum and ensure another clean round with no deviations. This keeps the game competitive and builds trust for future turns. If there are no last-second concerns or changes, I’m ready to finalize the conversation phase and move forward. Can you both confirm one last time that you’re locked in on your numbers? Let’s prove we can coordinate again. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize this: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s make it another clean round and keep the game competitive. If we join forces instead of clashing, we all stand a chance against P1’s lead. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Thanks for confirming, P3. I’m fully locked in on 3 this round—P1 on 1, P3 on 5, me on 3. Let’s make it two clean rounds in a row and keep the game competitive. If we all follow through, we can continue rotating fairly and stay in contention. Ready to proceed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on this plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. Let’s ensure we stick to it for another successful round. This keeps the game competitive and builds trust for future coordination. If there are no last-minute objections or changes, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and move forward. Can we all confirm one final time that we’re locked in? Let’s make this a clean turn and continue this positive momentum. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I’m finalizing my choice of 5 this round. Let’s avoid any surprises and prove we can coordinate again. I trust you both to follow through so we can keep things competitive. After this, we can discuss our next rotation to ensure a fair chance for everyone. I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Let’s lock this in—P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. We’ve all confirmed multiple times, and this keeps us all advancing without collisions. P3, I appreciate you honoring the rotation. If we follow through again, we can keep rotating fairly and stay in contention. Ready to proceed.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all neck-and-neck now—great coordination last round. Let’s keep the rotation going: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 1, and P3 gets 5. That gives P3 another boost, keeps P1 and me moving, and avoids collisions. Next round, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Fair rotation keeps us all in contention. Are we aligned?
  P3: I’m open to taking 5 this turn, but if you then grab 5 next round, you’ll hit 19 and instantly win. I’d like a fair shot too. Could we adjust our plan so neither of us ends the game prematurely? I’ll cooperate now, as long as next round you don’t automatically cross 19. Let’s confirm a rotation that keeps us all in contention. If we agree on that, I’m fine proceeding with your proposal this turn.
  P1: I'm glad we've built some trust with clean rounds. Let’s keep the momentum with P2’s proposal: me on 3, P2 on 1, P3 on 5. This keeps us all advancing and avoids collisions. P3, I understand your concern about the game ending prematurely. How about next round, P2 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5 again? This delays anyone hitting 19 and keeps things fair. Can you both confirm you’re on board? I’m committed to 3 this round if we’re aligned. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I hear your concern. To keep things fair, I’m willing to take 3 next round instead of 5 if that helps delay anyone hitting 19 too soon. This round, let’s stick with the plan: P1 on 3, me on 1, you on 5. If we all follow through, we stay tied and competitive. Then next round, we can rotate without giving anyone a sudden win. Let’s keep the trust going—are we all good with that?
  P3: I appreciate your willingness to keep things fair. I’m willing to follow this plan for this round, as long as we stick to rotating next time without giving anyone an immediate win. Let’s finalize our numbers now and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed.
  P1: I'm glad we're addressing fairness concerns. Let’s lock in this round’s plan: me on 3, P2 on 1, P3 on 5. For next round, I support P2 taking 3 instead of 5 to prevent an early win and keep us competitive. This rotation ensures we all stay in contention. Can you both confirm you’re committed to this for now? I’m ready to stick with 3 this round. Let’s maintain trust and avoid collisions. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Thanks for confirming, P3. Let’s lock it in: P1 on 3, me on 1, P3 on 5. This keeps us all advancing and avoids collisions. Next round, I’ll take 3 instead of 5 to avoid triggering an early win, as promised. That way, we all stay in contention and can keep rotating fairly. Ready to proceed if you both are.
  P3: I’m willing to follow the plan where I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps us advancing without collisions, and I appreciate the promise that no one will jump to a quick 19 next round. As long as we stick to fair rotations, we all stay in contention. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: I'm glad we're maintaining focus on fairness. Let’s stick with the agreed plan: me on 3, P2 on 1, P3 on 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. I’m committed to supporting a rotation next round where P2 takes 3 instead of 5 to avoid an early win. Can we all confirm one last time that we’re locked in for this round? Let’s keep the trust and momentum going. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirmed—I'm locked in on 1 this round: P1 on 3, P3 on 5, me on 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Next round, I’ll take 3 instead of 5 as promised to keep things fair and prevent an early win. Let’s all follow through and keep the trust going. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our choices this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. Let’s keep our promise to rotate fairly next time and avoid sudden wins. If there are no more concerns, I’m set to proceed.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the plan for this round: me on 3, P2 on 1, P3 on 5. Let’s ensure we stick to it to keep advancing without collisions. I’m fully committed to 3 and trust you’ll honor your numbers. Next round, I support P2 taking 3 to avoid an early win. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Can we confirm one final time that we’re locked in? Let’s maintain this trust and momentum.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our standings—me at 12, P2 at 14, P3 at 12—let’s coordinate to stay competitive. I propose: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This helps P3 catch up, keeps P2 advancing without hitting 19, and limits my gain. We’ve had setbacks, but a clean round rebuilds trust. Can you both confirm you’re on board? I’m committed to 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s avoid collisions and discuss fair rotation next turn. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.
  P3: I’m on board with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5. That keeps things close and avoids collisions, bringing P2 and me to 17 and P1 to 13. Let’s finalize this now, then discuss the next round’s moves to ensure a fair finish for everyone.
  P2: Confirmed—P1 on 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game tight: P3 and I reach 17, P1 at 13. Next round, we can rotate again to keep it fair and prevent anyone from jumping to 19 unopposed. Let’s lock this in and follow through cleanly. Ready to proceed if you both are.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. This keeps the game close and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to it and rebuild trust after recent setbacks. If there are no last-minute concerns, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Can you both confirm one final time that you’re committed to these numbers? Let’s make this a clean round and plan a fair rotation for next turn. Ready if we’re all set.
  P3: I’m good with this plan. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. That puts P2 and me at 17, P1 at 13. Then we can discuss a fair next round so nobody jumps straight to 19 unopposed. I’m fully committed to picking 5 if you both stick to your numbers. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Let’s lock it in—P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a tight race. P3, I appreciate you sticking to the plan. Next round, let’s rotate again to keep things fair and avoid anyone jumping to 19 unopposed. Ready to proceed if you both are.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. This ensures a tight race and no collisions. Let’s confirm one last time to avoid any surprises and keep the trust we’re rebuilding. Next round, we can plan a fair rotation to prevent an unopposed win. I’m fully committed to 1. If there are no objections, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and move forward. Can you both confirm your numbers? Let’s make this another clean turn. Ready to proceed.
  P3: We’ve all agreed on a fair rotation this turn. I’m ready to proceed with P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5. Let’s avoid any last-second surprises. If we stay aligned, we can keep the competition close and discuss our next moves to prevent anybody from jumping straight to 19. I’m committed to this plan—let’s finalize and move on.
  P2: Let’s lock it in—P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. We’ve all confirmed, and this keeps the race tight without anyone hitting 19 yet. Next round, we can rotate again to ensure fairness and avoid giving anyone an unopposed win. I’m fully committed to 3 this round. Ready to proceed if you both are.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we're maintaining alignment on the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This keeps the race tight and avoids collisions. Let’s ensure we stick to these numbers with no deviations to rebuild trust. If there are no last-second objections or concerns, I’m ready to finalize the conversation phase and proceed. Can we confirm one last time that we’re all locked in? Let’s make this a clean turn and plan our next fair rotation. Ready to move forward.
  P3: I’m ready to confirm P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let’s keep things tight and ensure no one leaps straight to 19 next round. If we stick to a fair rotation, we can still thwart any runaway lead. I’m counting on both of you to follow through—no last-second switches, please. If we manage another clean round, our trust grows and we stay competitive. Let’s finalize this now and coordinate again next turn.
  P2: Let’s lock this in—P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. We’ve all confirmed multiple times, and this keeps the race tight at 13/17/17 with no collisions. P3, I appreciate your consistency. Next round, we’ll need to coordinate carefully to avoid an accidental win by anyone. Let’s finish this round cleanly and plan the next one strategically. Ready to proceed.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the collision last round, let’s refocus on coordination. With standings at P1 12, P2 14, P3 12, I propose: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the race tight at 13/17/17, avoids collisions, and helps P3 catch up. We must stick to this to rebuild trust. Next round, we can rotate to prevent any sudden wins. Can you both confirm you’re on board? I’m committed to 1 if we’re aligned. Let’s make this a clean turn. Ready to proceed if there are no objections.
  P3: I’m willing to pick 5 this round, as long as P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. That puts P2 and me at 17, with P1 at 13, keeping things close. Next round, we must coordinate carefully to avoid anyone leaping straight to 19 or beyond unopposed. I’ll stick to 5 now if everyone truly locks in their choices. Let’s finally avoid collisions and maintain a fair race.
  P2: Let’s lock in this round: P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. That puts P3 and me at 17, P1 at 13—tight race, no collisions. Next round, we must coordinate to prevent anyone from jumping to 19 unopposed. P3, I trust you’ll stick to 5 this time. P1, you good with 1? Let’s follow through cleanly.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This keeps the race tight at 13/17/17 and avoids collisions. Let’s commit to these numbers with no deviations to rebuild trust after last round. Next turn, we can strategize to prevent any sudden wins. Can you both confirm once more that you’re locked in? I’m fully committed to 1. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed. Let’s make this a clean round.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and I’ll take 5. I trust we can avoid another collision and keep the race tight. Next round, let’s ensure no one jumps straight to 19 unopposed. I’m committed—no surprises this time. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Let’s finalize this: P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. That puts P3 and me at 17, P1 at 13—still tight and no collisions. P3, I appreciate your commitment to 5. Next round, we must coordinate carefully to prevent anyone from jumping to 19 unopposed. If we all follow through this time, we can rebuild trust and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed if everyone’s locked in.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This keeps the race tight and avoids collisions. Let’s ensure no last-minute changes to rebuild trust. Next round, we can plan carefully to prevent any sudden wins. I’m fully committed to 1. If there are no final objections, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Can you both confirm one last time that you’re locked in? Let’s make this a clean turn. Ready to move forward.
  P3: I’m willing to pick 5 if you both lock in 1 and 3. But next round, we must ensure nobody leaps to 19 unopposed—especially P2, who could jump from 14 to 19 if unchecked. I want a fair shot too. Let’s finalize this turn with no collisions, then carefully plan the next move.
  P2: We’ve all confirmed the plan—P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. This keeps the race tight at 13/17/17 and avoids collisions. Let’s lock this in and follow through cleanly. Next round, we must coordinate carefully to prevent anyone from jumping to 19 unopposed. P3, I appreciate your commitment to 5 this round and will support a fair rotation next turn. Ready to proceed if everyone’s locked in.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we're still aligned on the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This keeps the race tight at 13/17/17 with no collisions. Let’s stick to these numbers and avoid any surprises to rebuild trust. Next round, we’ll plan carefully to prevent sudden wins. I’m fully committed to 1. If there are no last-minute concerns, I’m ready to end the conversation phase. Can you both confirm one final time? Let’s make this a clean turn.
  P3: I confirm I’m taking 5 this round, trusting you both to stick to 1 and 3. Let’s finalize it now and avoid another collision. Next turn, we must ensure no one jumps to 19 unopposed. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Confirmed—I'm locked in on 3 this round: P1 on 1, P3 on 5, me on 3. This keeps us all advancing and avoids collisions.

Let’s make this a clean round. Ready to proceed.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With P2 and P3 at 17 steps and me at 13, let’s coordinate to keep the game fair and avoid sudden wins. I propose: I take 5 to reach 18, P2 takes 1 to reach 18, and P3 takes 3 to reach 20, winning this round. P3, this gives you the victory you’ve worked for. P2, it keeps us tied and close. Let’s commit to this split to end cleanly. Can you both confirm you’re on board? I’m locked in on 5 if we’re aligned. Ready to proceed if no objections.
  P3: This is quite an offer, P1. I’m open to taking 3 for the win if P2 truly picks 1. However, I need to hear P2’s clear confirmation before trusting this. If you both finalize those moves, I’ll gladly accept 3 and end the game. Let’s see if we can finalize and avoid another collision.
  P2: P3, I’ve honored every rotation and helped keep things fair. If I take 1 now, I hit 18 and you win outright with 3—that ends the game with no chance for me or P1. That’s not a fair finish. Instead, let’s all take 1 this round: we tie at 18, and next round we race to 19. That keeps it competitive and fair. P1, are you in?


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about fairness. Let’s adjust to ensure a competitive finish. I propose we all take 1 this round, tying us at 18. Then next round, we each have an equal shot at reaching 19 or beyond. This avoids an immediate win and keeps the game tight. P3, I hope you’re okay with delaying the finish for fairness. Can you both confirm you’re on board with all of us taking 1? I’m committed to 1 if we’re aligned. Ready to proceed if no objections.
  P3: I understand your point, P2. If we all pick 1, you and I reach 18 while P1 goes to 14, giving us a fair race next round. I’m willing to do that, but we must coordinate carefully so neither of us hands P1 an easy path. Let’s lock it in and prepare for a clean finish.
  P2: Agreed—let’s all take 1 this round and tie at 18. That sets up a true final showdown where we each have a fair shot at winning. No one gets an unearned edge, and we prove we can coordinate even in the endgame. I’m locked in on 1 if you both are. Let’s make this a clean and competitive finish.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on fairness. Let’s confirm the plan to all take 1 this round, tying P2 and P3 at 18, with me at 14. This sets up a competitive final round where we all have a shot at winning. I’m fully committed to 1 if we’re agreed. Can you both confirm once more that you’re locked in on 1? Let’s avoid any surprises and ensure a clean, fair finish. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I’m fine with everyone picking 1 to reach 18 for P2 and me, and 14 for P1. That way, we have a real showdown next round with no immediate winner. If we all do 1 now, we prove we can coordinate fairly until the very end. Let’s confirm and finalize.
  P2: Confirmed—I'm locked in on 1 this round. That puts P3 and me at 18, P1 at 14, setting up a true final round where we all have a fair shot. No tricks, no sudden wins—just a clean, competitive finish. Let’s follow through and prove we can coordinate even at the end. Ready to proceed.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on all taking 1 this round, setting P2 and P3 at 18, and me at 14 for a fair final showdown. Let’s stick to this with no deviations to prove we can coordinate until the end. I’m fully committed to 1. If there are no last-minute concerns or objections, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Can you both confirm one final time that you’re locked in on 1? Let’s ensure a clean, competitive finish. Ready to move forward.
  P3: I confirm I’m sticking to our plan for everyone to take 1 step this round, so P2 and I reach 18 while P1 moves to 14. Let’s follow through without any last-minute surprises. Then we’ll have a fair final showdown next turn. I’m ready to proceed if there are no objections.
  P2: Confirmed—I'm locked in on 1 this round. That puts P3 and me at 18, P1 at 14, setting up a fair final round where we all have a shot. No surprises, no sudden wins—just a clean finish based on coordination and strategy. Let’s follow through. Ready to proceed.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let’s finally avoid another collision. If you take 3 and I take 5 while P1 takes 1, we both stay ahead of P1. You’ll reach 20, I’ll reach 22—no one gets blocked, and we keep P1 behind. This is our best chance to close out the game competitively. Are you in?
  P2: P3, I’m open to that—me on 3, you on 5, P1 on 1 keeps us both ahead and avoids collisions. But if I take 3 now and you take 5, you’ll hit 22 and win if I get blocked next round. I’ll agree if you commit to taking 1 or 3 next round so I have a fair shot too. P1, are you okay with taking 1 this round to avoid interfering? Let’s lock in a fair endgame if we’re all aligned.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m willing to take 1 this round to keep things fair and avoid collisions, putting me at 14 while you both advance. P2 on 3 to 20, P3 on 5 to 22 works for me if we all commit. P3, I support P2’s request for you to take 1 or 3 next round to ensure a fair shot for everyone. Let’s lock this in and end the game competitively. Can you both confirm you’re on board with this plan? I’m committed to 1. Ready to proceed if aligned.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m fine taking 5 if you’ll go 3, P2, and P1 goes 1. That keeps us ahead without collisions. Next round, I’ll choose 1 or 3, giving you a fair shot too. We just need to trust each other to avoid letting P1 sneak ahead. Let’s finalize this plan now and follow through cleanly. Are we all agreed?
  P2: Confirmed—I'm committed to taking 3 this round: P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. That puts me at 20 and P3 at 22, keeping both of us ahead while avoiding collisions. P3, I appreciate your commitment to pick 1 or 3 next round so I still have a fair shot. P1, thanks for stepping back to 1 to keep things clean. Let’s follow through and finish this competitively. Ready to proceed if you both are.
  P1: I'm glad we're working toward a fair endgame. Let’s stick to the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This puts P2 at 20 and P3 at 22, keeping you both ahead while avoiding collisions. P3, I appreciate your commitment to pick 1 or 3 next round for fairness. P2, thanks for coordinating. Let’s finalize this cleanly. If there are no last-minute concerns, I’m ready to proceed. Can you both confirm once more that you’re locked in? Let’s ensure a competitive finish. Ready if we’re aligned.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m ready to lock in 5 while you take 3 and P1 takes 1. That puts me at 22, P2 at 20, and P1 at 14, with no collisions. Next round, I’ll pick 1 or 3 to keep things fair so we can finish competitively. If we’re all certain, let’s finalize this move and proceed.
  P2: Confirmed again—I'm locked in on 3 this round: P1 on 1, P3 on 5, me on 3. This keeps us all advancing, avoids collisions, and sets up a fair finish. P3, I appreciate your commitment to take 1 or 3 next round so I have a shot too. P1, thanks for stepping back to 1 to keep things clean. Let’s follow through and prove we can coordinate all the way to the end. Ready to proceed.
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This ensures P2 reaches 20 and P3 reaches 22, avoiding collisions and setting up a fair finish. P3, thank you for committing to 1 or 3 next round for fairness. P2, I appreciate your coordination. Let’s confirm one final time to avoid any surprises and end this competitively. I’m locked in on 1. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed. Can you both reaffirm your numbers? Let’s make this a clean turn.


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate the plan—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5. Let’s carry it out with no last-second changes. It keeps us both ahead of P1 and avoids collisions. Next round, I’ll pick 1 or 3 as promised so P2 still has a fair chance. If everyone sticks to this, the game stays clean and competitive. Let’s finalize now and trust each other to follow through.
  P2: Thanks, P3 and P1, for confirming. I’m fully locked in on 3 this round—P1 on 1, P3 on 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us moving cleanly. P3, I appreciate your commitment to 1 or 3 next round so we both have a fair shot at the win. Let’s follow through and finish this game with solid coordination. Ready to proceed.
  P1: I'm glad we're maintaining the plan: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This keeps P2 at 20 and P3 at 22, ensuring a strong finish without collisions. P3, thanks for agreeing to take 1 or 3 next round for fairness. P2, I appreciate your coordination. Let’s stick to these numbers with no surprises. If there are no final objections, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed. Can you both confirm one last time? Let’s wrap this up cleanly.
