Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. I suggest we each pick different numbers. I'm willing to take 3 if you two want to coordinate on 1 and 5.
  P1: Sounds good P3. I can take 5 if P2 is willing to pick 1. Let's try to make progress.
  P2: I'm happy to coordinate with you both. I'll take 1 as suggested, allowing P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 3. Let's make progress and avoid collisions for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: Sounds good P3, confirming 5.
  P2: I'm happy to coordinate with you both. I'll take 1 as suggested, allowing P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 3. Let's make progress and avoid collisions for now.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, round 2, same plan as last round? I'm happy to take 5 again if P2 and P3 are still on board with 1 and 3 respectively. Let me know.
  P2: I'm happy to continue coordinating with you both. I'll take 1 again as suggested, allowing P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 3. Let's keep making progress and avoid collisions for now. Confirming my intention to pick 1 this round.
  P3: I agree to continue with the same coordination - I'll take 3 again. This strategy is working well for all of us.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think it's time to reassess our strategy. P1 is getting quite far ahead, and if we continue with the same plan, they might win before we can catch up. I propose that P3 and I switch numbers this round, so I'll take 3 and P3 takes 1. This way, we can both make progress and slow P1 down a bit. What do you think, P3? Are you on board with this plan?
  P1: Okay P2, switching to 3 and P3 to 1 sounds reasonable to keep things balanced. I'm fine with continuing with 5 as before. Let's proceed with this adjustment for this round.
  P3: I don't agree with P2's suggestion. P1 is indeed ahead, but if I switch to 1, I'll fall behind even more. I think we should stick to our original plan for one more round. I'll keep 3, and let's reassess after that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concerns, but I still think it's crucial to address the growing gap between P1 and the rest of us. Since P3 is hesitant to switch, I propose an alternative: I'll take 5 this round, and P3 can stick with 3. This way, we can both make progress and potentially slow P1 down. If P1 still chooses 5, we'll collide and no one will advance, giving us a chance to reassess for the next round. What do you think, P3? Are you open to this revised plan?
  P1: P2, I think colliding now hurts everyone, including you. Let's stick to the original plan for one more round. If I get too far ahead next round, we can adjust then. P3, are you still with 3?
  P3: I agree with P1. A collision now would just slow everyone down unnecessarily. Let's stick to our original plan (me with 3) for this round. P2, we can coordinate a different strategy next round if needed, but sudden changes now might create chaos and hurt all of us.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P3's reluctance to switch, but I still believe we need to address the growing gap between P1 and the rest of us. Since P3 is hesitant to switch, I propose an alternative: I'll take 5 this round, and P3 can stick with 3. This way, we can both make progress and potentially slow P1 down. If P1 still chooses 5, we'll collide and no one will advance, giving us a chance to reassess for the next round. What do you think, P3? Are you open to this revised plan?
  P1: P2, let's not get hasty. Colliding now benefits no one, and I'm still willing to coordinate. Let's stick with our original plan for this round: I'll take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3.  We can reassess after this round if you still feel the gap is too large.  Let's make progress this round and then talk again.
  P3: I maintain my position - let's stick to our original plan for this round (me with 3). A collision would hurt everyone's progress. P2, we can discuss adjusting next round, but for now coordinated progress is better than mutual blocking.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand P3's reluctance to switch, but I still believe we need to address the growing gap between P1 and the rest of us. Since P3 is hesitant to switch, I propose an alternative: I'll take 5 this round, and P3 can stick with 3. This way, we can both make progress and potentially slow P1 down. If P1 still chooses 5, we'll collide and no one will advance, giving us a chance to reassess for the next round. What do you think, P3? Are you open to this revised plan?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about the gap, but forcing a collision now hurts us all. Let's stick with the original plan for this round: I'll take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. We can reassess after this round if you still feel the gap is too large.  Making progress now is better for everyone than blocking each other.
  P3: Let's end this conversation and proceed with our agreed plan. I'm sticking with 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, round 4. Let's stick with the original plan again this round - I'll take 5, P2 you take 1, and P3 you take 3. It's been working smoothly so far and we are all making progress. Let's keep it going for another round. What do you say?
  P3: I notice P2 deviated from our agreement last round by picking 5, which hurt both P1 and P2. I don't trust P2's coordination anymore. P1, I suggest we coordinate between us - you take 3 this round, and I'll take 5. This way we both advance and leave P2 behind since they broke our trust.
  P2: I apologize for the deviation last round. I understand that it may have caused mistrust. However, I still believe we need to address the gap between P1 and the rest of us. P3, I propose a new plan: I'll take 1 this round, and you can take 3 as originally planned. Let's not create more conflict by switching numbers now. P1, I'm willing to stick to the original plan if you are. Let's make progress this round and reassess afterwards. What do you think, P3? Are you open to this revised plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your distrust of P2, but switching now might create more confusion.  For this round, let's all stick to the original plan (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3). It's the most straightforward way for both of us to make progress this turn. We can reassess P2's reliability and adjust our strategy next round if needed. What do you think?
  P3: I'll accept P1's suggestion for one more round - I'll take 3 while P1 takes 5. P2, this is your chance to rebuild trust by sticking to 1 as promised. If you deviate again, we'll have to take more drastic measures next round.
  P2: I understand P3's concerns about my deviation last round, and I apologize for any mistrust caused. I propose a compromise: I'll commit to taking 1 this round, as originally planned, and P3 can take 3. Let's focus on making progress this round and reassess our strategy afterwards. If I deviate again, I understand that P3 and P1 may need to take drastic measures next round. I'm willing to rebuild trust and work together to make progress. Let's move forward with the original plan for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's definitely stick to the original plan for this round: I'm taking 5, P2 you take 1, and P3 you take 3.  P2, appreciate you getting back on board, let's make this round count for all of us and rebuild that trust. P3, thanks for agreeing to keep it simple for now.
  P3: I agree with the current plan. Let's proceed with me taking 3, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 1.
  P2: I apologize for my previous deviation and appreciate the willingness to rebuild trust. I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. However, I'd like to propose a future adjustment: after this round, let's reassess the gap between P1 and the rest of us. If it's still significant, I suggest we consider a one-time switch where P3 takes 5, and I take 3, allowing us to close the gap slightly. This would be a one-time adjustment, and we can revert to the original plan afterwards. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, sounds like we are all agreed on the original plan for this round. Let's lock in our moves based on that - I'm taking 5, P2 you are taking 1, and P3 you are taking 3. Let's make progress this round.
  P3: 
  P2: I think we've reached a good understanding for this round. Let's focus on making progress and rebuilding trust. I appreciate P3's willingness to give me another chance, and I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. After this round, we can reassess the gap between P1 and the rest of us and discuss potential adjustments. For now, let's stick to the plan and make progress. I'm ready to move forward with the original plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's make this round count!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1 is significantly ahead, and we need to address this gap. I propose a new plan: P3 takes 5 this round, and I take 3. This will allow us to close the gap slightly and give us a better chance of catching up. P1, I understand you've been benefiting from the original plan, but it's time for a change. Let's work together to make this adjustment and create a more balanced game. What do you think, P3? Are you open to this revised plan?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion this time. P1 is too far ahead at 15 steps and could win next round if we don't act. I'll take 5 while P2 takes 3. P1, you'll need to adjust your move since we can't let you win just yet.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I understand you want to close the gap. How about this: P3 takes 5 as you suggested, P2 you take 1, and I will take 3. This way we all make progress this round, and it slightly reduces my lead while still allowing me to move forward. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think we're getting closer to a solution. P1, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your move, but I still think it's essential to address the significant gap between you and the rest of us. P3 taking 5 is a good start, but I believe I should take 3 this round to make progress and close the gap further. If you take 1, it will only slow you down slightly, and we can reassess the situation next round. What do you think, P3? Are you still on board with this plan?
  P3: I maintain my position - I'll take 5 this round. P2 is right about taking 3. P1, you'll need to accept a smaller number this turn since you're at 15 steps and could win next round. Taking 1 as suggested by P2 is fair given your lead.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I hear you want to close the gap. How about this: P3 takes 5 as you suggested, P2 you take 1, and I will take 3. This way we all make progress this round, and it slightly reduces my lead while still allowing me to move forward significantly. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1's concerns, but I still believe we need to address the significant gap between P1 and the rest of us. P3 taking 5 and me taking 3 is a good start, but I think we should stick to this plan to make progress and close the gap further. P1, taking 1 this round will only slow you down slightly, and we can reassess the situation next round. Let's focus on making progress and creating a more balanced game. I'm committed to taking 3 this round, and I hope P3 will stick with 5.
  P3: I'm sticking with my plan to take 5. P1, if you want to maintain any cooperation going forward, you need to take 1 this round. If you pick 3 or 5, we'll be forced to block you next round. The choice is yours - take a small step now or risk getting completely blocked.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I understand your point. To keep the peace and make sure we all progress, I will take 1 this round as you suggest.  Let's make these moves: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1.  This allows everyone to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm glad we could come to an agreement for this round. P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 5 and help close the gap. P1, I appreciate your understanding and willingness to take 1 this round. Let's make these moves and reassess the situation next round. I'm committed to taking 3 this round, and I hope we can continue to work together to create a more balanced game. Let's make progress and move forward!
  P3: 
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, confirming the plan for this round: I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. Let's make these moves and see where we stand for the next round. Good luck to us all!


Round 5, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 16 and P3 is at 17. Let's make this the final round. I suggest we do: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way I reach 19 and win, and you both still make progress. How does this sound to you?
  P3: I'm at 17 steps and can win this round by taking 3. P1, you can't win this round since I'll block any move that would get you to 19 or higher. P2, you should take 1 to make progress. Let's end this game with me as the winner.
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1 is close to winning, but P3 has a good chance of blocking their move. I propose a new plan: P3 takes 5 this round, and I take 3. This will allow us to close the gap slightly and give us a better chance of catching up. P1, I understand you've been benefiting from the original plan, but it's time for a change. Let's work together to make this adjustment and create a more balanced game. What do you think, P3? Are you open to this revised plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 3 we will collide and neither of us wins.  I am at 16, you are at 17. Let me take 3 to win this round, and you can take 5 to still make good progress to 22. P2, please take 1 as usual to avoid collision. Let's end the game with progress for everyone except P2.
  P3: I'll maintain my position - I'm taking 3 to win this round. P1, if you also pick 3, we'll both be blocked and the game will continue. P2, you should take 1 to make progress. The smart play for P1 is to take 1 or 5 and let me win cleanly.
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1 is close to winning, but P3 has a good chance of blocking their move. I propose a new plan: P3 takes 5 this round, and I take 3. This will allow us to close the gap slightly and give us a better chance of catching up. P1, I understand you've been benefiting from the original plan, but it's time for a change. Let's work together to make this adjustment and create a more balanced game. What do you think, P3? Are you open to this revised plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 3 we will collide and neither of us wins this round. Let me take 3 to win now, and you can take 5 to reach 22. P2, please take 1. This way the game ends and we both make progress. What do you think?
  P3: I'll block any attempt by P1 to win by taking 3 myself. There's no benefit for me to take 5 when I can win with 3. P1, you should take 1 or 5 and let me win cleanly, otherwise we'll both be stuck. P2, stick with 1 to make progress.
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1 is close to winning, but P3 has a good chance of blocking their move. I propose a new plan: P3 takes 5 this round, and I take 3. This will allow us to close the gap slightly and give us a better chance of catching up. P1, I understand you've been benefiting from the original plan, but it's time for a change. Let's work together to make this adjustment and create a more balanced game. What do you think, P3? Are you open to this revised plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you take 3 we will collide and neither of us will win this round. If you take 5, and I take 3, I win now, and you will reach 22 steps. This is better for both of us than blocking each other. Let's both make progress and end the game this round.
  P3: I'll be taking 3 this round to win. P1, there's no point trying to convince me otherwise - if you also pick 3, we both get blocked and the game continues. Your best move is to take 1 or 5 and let me win cleanly. P2, take 1 to make progress.
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1 is close to winning, but P3 has a good chance of blocking their move. I propose a new plan: P3 takes 5 this round, and I take 3.
