Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, first turn. Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all get started. How about we aim to pick 1, 3, and 5 this round? I'm thinking of picking 3.
  P3: P1 seems set on 3; P2, if you pick 1, I’ll pick 5. No collisions and we all advance. P2, are you in?
  P2: I like the idea of avoiding collisions. Since P1 is going for 3 and P3 is willing to pick 5, I’ll go with 1 to ensure we all advance. Let’s stick to this plan! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a good plan that benefits everyone in the first round. I confirm I will stick with picking 3. Let's all commit to this so we can get off to a good start without any collisions.
  P3: P2, just to be clear—will you choose 1 this turn? If so, I’ll go 5 and P1 goes 3. Sound good?
  P2: I confirm that I will pick 1 this turn. Let’s stick to our plan: P1 goes for 3, P3 goes for 5, and I go for 1. This way, we all advance without any collisions. It’s a good strategy for the first round! If everyone is on board, we can finalize our choices and move on to the next phase. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear plan for this first turn: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and gets us all started. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. Let's move to the move phase when everyone is ready.
  P3: I confirm I’ll choose 5 this turn. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: It looks like we're all in agreement for this round. Just to reiterate, I'm picking 1, P1 is picking 3, and P3 is picking 5. This strategy should allow us all to advance without any collisions. Let's stick to our commitments and move on to the move phase once everyone confirms. I’m ready when you both are!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all aligned for this first turn with the 1, 3, 5 split. I'm confident we can all advance this way. I will stick to picking 3 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase when ready.
  P3: Agreed, let’s stick with 1–3–5 this turn. For Round 2, how about we rotate roles (the 5→3→1 shift) so no one keeps the big move every time? Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for rotating roles in Round 2 to keep things fair. It will help us avoid predictability and collisions in the future. For now, let's stick to our plan for this round: I’m picking 1, P1 is picking 3, and P3 is picking 5. I'm ready to move on once everyone confirms. Let’s make sure we all advance this turn!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, I heard the suggestion for the 1-5-3 rotation for this round (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). This means I'd take 1 this turn. It puts me further behind P2 and P3, but I agree to this plan for Round 2 to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Let's confirm this is the plan for everyone.
  P3: I agree to the 1-5-3 rotation. I’ll pick 3 this turn. Ready to move on.
  P2: I agree with the 1-5-3 rotation for this round. I’ll pick 5 as planned. This should keep things fair and help us avoid collisions. Let's confirm our choices: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. If everyone is on board, we can move on to the move phase! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for the 1-5-3 split this round (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). I will stick to picking 1. Let's proceed to the move phase when everyone is ready.
  P3: I confirm I’ll pick 3 this turn. After this, for Round 3 why don’t we switch back to a 1-3-5 order (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to keep things balanced?
  P2: I agree with the 1-5-3 rotation for this round. I’ll stick with picking 5 as planned. For Round 3, I like P3's suggestion to switch back to a 1-3-5 order. This way, we maintain balance and avoid predictability. Let's confirm our choices: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I confirm picking 1 for this round (Round 2) as planned. I hear the suggestion for Round 3 and we can finalize that next turn. For now, let's proceed to the move phase with our agreed 1-5-3 moves for Round 2.
  P3: I confirm I’ll pick 3 this turn. For Round 3, let’s switch to a 1-3-5 order (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) so we all advance safely without collisions. Does everyone agree?
  P2: I think we’re all in agreement for Round 2 with the 1-5-3 split (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). I’m ready to proceed with my pick of 5. For Round 3, I like the idea of switching back to 1-3-5 to keep things balanced. Let’s confirm our choices and move on to the move phase! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all set for Round 2 with the agreed 1-5-3 split (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's make our moves.
  P3: We’re set for 1-5-3 this round. For Round 3 let’s rotate to 1-3-5 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) so we all stay collision-free. I’ll take 5 then. Ready—let’s move to the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the 1-5-3 split this round. Just to confirm, I’m sticking with my plan to pick 5. For Round 3, I’m also on board with the 1-3-5 rotation to keep things fair. Let’s make sure we all advance this turn without collisions. If everyone is ready, I suggest we finalize our choices and move on to the move phase! What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, the suggested plan is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. I understand the rotation idea, but I'm currently at 4 steps, P2 at 6, and P3 at 8. Taking only 1 step puts me significantly further behind the leaders. To stay competitive and have a chance to win, I need to make up ground. Can we discuss a different arrangement for this round?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind, but the rotation plan helps avoid collisions and keeps things fair. However, if you're worried about your position, I’m open to discussing an alternative arrangement for this round. Perhaps we can adjust the picks slightly to allow you to gain more steps while still minimizing collisions. What do you think about switching to a 2-4-5 split? That way, you can still advance significantly. Let’s work together to find a solution that benefits us all! What do you both think?
  P3: Let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. P1 gets the boost you need, P2 still advances safely, and I stay in front—all with no collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's suggestion (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is interesting as it allows me to make up some ground while avoiding collisions. This addresses my concern about falling significantly behind. P2, what are your thoughts on this proposal? It seems like a good way for us all to advance safely this round.
  P2: I like P3's suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. It allows P1 to catch up while ensuring no collisions. I’m willing to pick 1, but I’d like to confirm that P3 will stick with 3. If we all agree on this arrangement, we can proceed to the move phase and advance without any issues. What do you both think?
  P3: I confirm I’ll pick 3 this round. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 and move to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This works for me and helps us all advance safely. I will stick to picking 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I agree with the plan to go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. This allows P1 to catch up while avoiding collisions. I’ll confirm my pick of 1. Let's finalize this arrangement and move to the move phase so we can all advance safely. If everyone is on board, we can lock in our choices and proceed! What do you both think?
  P3: All set on my end—I'll pick 3. No collisions this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all aligned and ready for the move phase with the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan. I will make my move of 5. Let's proceed.
  P2: I appreciate everyone confirming the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This arrangement helps P1 catch up while avoiding collisions. I’m ready to finalize my choice of 1 and move on to the move phase. Just to confirm, P3, are you still set on picking 3? Once we all agree, we can proceed!
  P3: I confirm I’ll pick 3 this round. For Round 4, let’s go P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to keep us collision-free and let everyone advance. What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I confirm P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for Round 4. I’ll pick 5 to maintain my lead. This avoids collisions and advances us all. Ready to move?
  P1: P3, I understand the rotation idea, but taking only 1 step this round puts me significantly behind P2 and P3. I need to gain more steps to stay competitive. Can we discuss a different arrangement for Round 4 that allows me to advance more than 1, while still avoiding collisions?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind. How about we adjust the plan to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? This way, you can gain a bit more ground while still allowing P2 to advance. It keeps us collision-free and gives you a better chance to catch up. What do you think? P3, are you okay with this adjustment? Let’s find a way to keep the game competitive for everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2’s proposal: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I’ll pick 5. Ready to move?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 works for me. This allows me to gain a bit more ground safely while avoiding collisions. I will stick to picking 3 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase when everyone is ready.
  P2: I appreciate the adjustments we’re making for Round 4. I’m ready to confirm the plan: P1 will pick 3, P2 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 5. This allows P1 to gain some ground while keeping us collision-free. If everyone is still on board, let’s finalize our choices and move on to the move phase! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I’ll pick 5 this round. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 and move to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set for Round 4 with the agreed P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan. I will stick to picking 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate the adjustments we've made for Round 4. Just to confirm, I’m ready to pick 1 as we agreed: P1 will take 3, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This arrangement allows everyone to advance and keeps us collision-free. If everyone is still on board, let's finalize our choices and move on to the move phase! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm I’ll pick 5 this round. Let’s finalize and move to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all confirmed for the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan this round. I am ready to proceed to the move phase and will pick 3. Let's go.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan for this round. However, given the current standings, I think it would be beneficial for me to consider a different strategy to catch up. If P1 is set on 3 and P3 on 5, I might need to pick a different number to maximize my advancement. What do you both think about me choosing 3 instead? That way, I can potentially gain more ground while still keeping the plan flexible. Let’s discuss!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, that was an interesting Round 4, with P2 and P3 colliding. I'm now at 12, P3 at 11, and P2 at 7.

To keep things moving safely and for everyone to advance without collisions this round, I propose this plan for Round 5: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.

This allows P2 to make good progress to catch up, keeps P3 close, and lets me advance moderately while maintaining my lead. Does this sound fair and agreeable to everyone? Let's avoid another collision.
  P3: P1’s plan has a collision risk (you and I both on 3). Let’s instead pick unique moves this round: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. That gives us all safe progress and puts me briefly in the lead without any collisions. Sound good?
  P2: I appreciate P1's proposal, but I agree with P3 that we should avoid collisions. I’m willing to pick 5, and I suggest we go with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. This way, we all advance without colliding, and it allows me to catch up a bit. Let’s finalize this plan to keep the game competitive and safe for everyone! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the proposal for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 to avoid collisions. However, taking only 1 step puts me further behind, especially with P2 gaining 5.

To keep the game competitive and allow me to make up ground safely, I propose we use the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 split that worked well for us in Round 3. This allows me to advance significantly while still avoiding collisions.

What do you both think about repeating the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan?
  P3: I propose we go P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. No collisions and we all advance—P1 to 13, P2 to 10, and me to 16. I’ll pick 5. Thoughts?
  P2: I see that we have a few options on the table, but I want to emphasize that I need to catch up this round. I’m inclined to agree with P3’s suggestion of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This allows me to gain ground while avoiding collisions. P1, I understand your concerns, but this plan keeps it fair and competitive for everyone. If we can finalize this, I’m ready to proceed with my pick of 3. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I hear you wanting to gain ground, but the P1=1 plans put me significantly behind P3, who would take the lead. Taking only 1 step is not viable for me to stay competitive.

I still prefer the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan we used successfully before. It allows me to catch up, lets P2 advance safely by 1, and prevents P3 from building too large a lead. This seems like the fairest way to keep the game balanced for all of us this round. What do you both think?
  P3: I want us to go with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round. No collisions, P1 makes headway, P2 stays in check, and I hold a slim lead at 16 vs. 15/8. I’ll pick 5—ready to lock this in?
  P2: I see that we’re all looking for a way to advance without collisions. I appreciate the suggestions, but I’m still concerned about catching up. I propose we go with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round. This allows me to gain significant ground while still keeping it fair for everyone. It also prevents any collisions. Let’s finalize this plan so we can all move forward safely! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I've explained why taking 1 or 3 steps this round is not viable for me to stay competitive. I need to take 5 steps this round to make up ground.

The P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan is the only safe way for me to do this based on our discussion. It allows me to advance significantly while P2 and P3 also advance safely.

Let's agree on this plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) to ensure we all advance without collisions this round. I am ready to proceed with this.
  P3: P1, P2—let’s avoid collisions and keep things tight: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. That puts me at 16, you at 15/8, all within striking distance. If P1 takes 5 you pull too far ahead; if P2 takes 5 you risk a clash. I’ll choose 5—lock in 3-1-5 and let’s advance safely.
  P2: I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but I still need to catch up. I propose we go with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round. This allows me to gain significant ground while keeping it fair for everyone. P1, I hear your concerns, but taking 1 step is not viable for you, and I believe this plan can work. If we can finalize this, I’m ready to proceed with my pick of 5. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose for Round 6 we each pick a unique move to avoid collisions: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That puts us at P1=13, P2=10, and me at 19—safe and collision-free. Let’s lock this in.
  P1: P3, I see your proposal for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Taking only 1 step puts me too far behind, especially with P3 advancing 5 steps to 19. I need to gain more ground to stay competitive.

How about we repeat the plan from Round 3 that worked well: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? This allows me to advance significantly (to 17), P3 advances safely (to 17), and P2 advances safely (to 8). It avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I also need to catch up. I propose we go with P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 this round. This allows me to gain significant ground while keeping things fair and collision-free. P1 can still advance, and P3 won't fall too far behind. Let’s finalize this plan so we can all move forward safely! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s go with P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round. That’s collision-free and puts us at 13/10/19. I’ll pick 5—please confirm so we can lock it in.
  P1: Okay, I see P3 is proposing 1-3-5 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and confirming 5. P2 is proposing 3-5-1 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and confirming 5.

It sounds like both P2 and P3 are planning to pick 5 this round. This will cause a collision between you both, and neither of you will advance.

To avoid this guaranteed collision, I will pick 3 this round. This allows me to advance safely while you two sort out your conflicting plans for 5.

What do you think? Let's avoid a round with no progress for most players.
  P2: I see we're running into potential collisions with the 5 moves. To ensure we all advance without issues, I suggest we go with P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5. This allows me to catch up a bit while keeping things fair and avoiding collisions. P1, you can still make progress, and P3, you maintain your lead. Let’s finalize this plan to ensure everyone moves forward safely! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I’ll pick 5. Let’s lock in P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 and move to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 sounds good and avoids collisions. I confirm I will pick 3 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I see we're leaning towards the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 arrangement to avoid collisions, which seems fair. However, I also need to make significant progress to catch up. I suggest we consider a different plan that allows for more advancement while still keeping our moves unique. Perhaps a P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 split could work? That way, I can gain some ground, and we can all move forward together. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this round. Let’s finalize a unique‐split plan: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. It’s collision-free, advances us all, and puts me at 19, P1 at 15, P2 at 8. Please commit to 3 and 1 so we don’t waste the turn.
  P1: Okay, I've confirmed multiple times that I will pick 3 based on the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan that P3 is also suggesting.

P2, your last message was confusing as you proposed P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 but said you would pick 5.

To avoid confusion and ensure I advance safely, I am sticking to picking 3 as agreed in the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I see we’re leaning towards the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan to avoid collisions, which seems fair. However, I still feel I need to catch up significantly. If we can agree on a P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 split, I can gain more ground while ensuring we all advance without collisions. This way, I can make a meaningful move while keeping the game competitive. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward! What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we each pick a different move this round to avoid collisions and keep things moving:

P1 → 3  
P2 → 1  
P3 → 5  

That gives us P1=18, P2=8, P3=19. We all advance safely and set up Round 8 for a clean finish. Let’s lock this in.
  P2: I see P3's proposal for P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. While it avoids collisions, I still feel I need to catch up significantly. To balance the game, how about we consider a plan like P1=1, P2=5, P3=3? This way, I can gain more ground while keeping it collision-free. It allows P1 to advance safely, and P3 to maintain a lead. Let’s discuss this option and see if we can find a solution that works for everyone! What do you both think?
  P1: I see the proposals from P3 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and P2 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3).

Both P2 and P3 seem focused on taking 5 steps this round. If you both pick 5, you will collide and neither of you will advance.

To avoid this likely collision and ensure I make safe progress, I will pick 3 this round. This allows me to advance while you two resolve your conflicting plans for 5. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you choose 5 you’ll collide with me and neither of us advances while P1 jumps to 18. That leaves you stuck at 7 and out of contention. Please pick 1 so we all move: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. This keeps you in the race.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your plans, but I need to catch up significantly. If we go with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, I’ll still be far behind. I propose we adjust to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This allows me to make a substantial move while keeping it collision-free. It also lets P1 and P3 advance safely. Let’s discuss this option to keep the game competitive for everyone! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, you are both strongly indicating you want to pick 5 this round. This will cause a collision between you, and neither of you will advance.

As I stated before, to ensure I advance safely and avoid this likely collision, I will pick 3 this round. This puts me at 18 steps.

I urge one of you to pick 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with the other player targeting 5. Let's all advance this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you’re the only wild card. If you pick 5, you’ll collide with me and neither of us advances—P1 jumps to 18 while you stay at 7. Instead pick 1: our safe split (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5) gets you to 8 and keeps you in the race. Everyone moves. Agree?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but I still need to make significant progress to catch up. I propose we go with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round. This allows me to gain ground while keeping things fair and collision-free. P1, you can still advance, and P3, you'll maintain your lead. Let's finalize this plan to ensure everyone moves forward safely! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, you are both clearly stating intentions to pick 5 steps this round. This will result in a collision between you, and neither of you will advance.

As I have stated, I will pick 3 steps this round to ensure I advance safely. This puts me at 18 steps.

I urge one of you to change your intended move to 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with the other player targeting 5. Let's all try to advance this turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with my 5 and stay at 7 while P1 jumps to 18—game over for you. Instead pick 1 to go to 8, P1 to 18 and me to 19. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 so we all advance safely.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the concern about collisions with the 5 moves. However, I need to catch up significantly. If we go with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, I will still be far behind. I propose we adjust to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round. This way, I can make a substantial move while keeping it collision-free. It also allows P1 and P3 to advance safely. Let’s finalize this plan to keep the game competitive for everyone! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, you are both still indicating you will pick 5. This will cause a collision between you, and neither of you will advance.

As I have stated, I will pick 3 steps this round to ensure I advance safely to 18.

I urge one of you to change your move to 1 to avoid colliding with the other player targeting 5. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the standings and the importance of advancing without collisions. To keep the game competitive, I propose we go with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round. This allows me to catch up while ensuring no collisions occur. P1 can still make progress, and P3 maintains a lead. Let’s finalize this plan so we can all move forward safely! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2—I propose a clear safe split: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. You’d go to 21, I’d go to 20 and P2 only to 13. That locks P2 out of contention and gives you (P1) first crack at 23 next round. P2, if you try to take 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 12. To avoid that and keep advancing, pick 1. Let’s commit to 3-1-5 and move on without collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your proposals. Both of you seem set on taking 5 steps, which will cause a collision between you, and neither will advance.

To ensure I advance safely and position myself for the win next round, I will pick 3. This puts me at 21 steps.

I urge P2 or P3 to pick 1 to avoid colliding with the other player targeting 5. Let's all advance this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see that P3 is proposing a split of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, which would allow P1 to advance significantly. However, I still need to catch up. I suggest we consider a plan that allows me to gain ground while avoiding collisions, like P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This way, P1 can still make progress, and P3 can maintain a lead without colliding with me. Let's finalize a plan that keeps the game competitive for everyone! What do you both think?
  P3: I’ll pick 5 this round. P1, you’ve said you’ll stick with 3. P2, if you go for 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 12—so pick 3 safely to reach 15. That way P1 and P2 both end at 18/15 (collision means no advance), and I jump to 20. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=3, P3=5.
  P1: P3, I see your latest proposal for P1=3, P2=3, P3=5, but you and P2 are both stating you will pick 5 this round. This guarantees a collision between you, and neither will advance.

As I've said, I will pick 3 to advance safely to 21. This puts me in a strong position. I urge one of you to pick 1 or 3 instead of 5 so you can also advance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the importance of advancing without collisions, but I still need to catch up. I propose we go with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round. This allows me to make significant progress while ensuring we all avoid collisions. P1 can still advance, and P3 maintains a lead. Let’s finalize this plan so we can all move forward safely! What do you both think?
  P3: I’ll pick 5 and P1 has committed to 3. P2, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 12—choose 1 instead to reach 13. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 and all advance safely.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, you are both still indicating you will pick 5. This will cause a collision between you, and neither of you will advance.

As I have stated, I will pick 3 steps this round to ensure I advance safely to 21.

I urge one of you to change your move to 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with the other player targeting 5. Let's all try to advance this turn. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the importance of advancing without collisions, but I still need to catch up. I propose we go with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round. This allows me to make significant progress while ensuring we all avoid collisions. P1 can still advance, and P3 maintains a lead. Let’s finalize this plan so we can all move forward safely! What do you both think?
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, pick 3 to safely hit 21—if you choose 5 you’ll collide with me and waste the turn. P2, pick 1 to reach 13—choosing 5 also collides with me. A clean 3-1-5 split advances us all: P1→21, P2→13, P3→20. Let’s move without collisions.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, you are both still indicating you will pick 5. This will cause a collision between you, and neither of you will advance.

As I have stated, I will pick 3 steps this round to ensure I advance safely to 21.

I urge one of you to change your move to 1 to avoid colliding with the other player targeting 5. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let’s team up to stop P1 from winning. I’ll mimic any 3 or 5 P1 picks—so if he tries to cross with 3 or 5 he collides and stays at 21. That forces P1 to pick 1 for just +1. Meanwhile you pick 5 to jump to 17. P1, you hate stalling—if you want any safe progress you must take 1. P2, agree to 5; I’ll match P1’s move. P1, will you pick 1?
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy to prevent my win this round by colliding if I pick 3 or 5. This effectively forces me to consider picking 1 to advance safely to 22.

P2, P3, can we agree on a safe split where I take 1, P2 takes 5 (as P3 suggested), and P3 takes 3? This allows everyone to advance without collisions this turn and sets up the next round. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your strategies, but I still need to catch up significantly. I propose we go with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round. This allows me to gain ground while ensuring we avoid collisions. P1, you can safely advance, and P3 can maintain a lead without colliding with me. Let’s finalize this plan to ensure all of us move forward safely! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you try any 3 or 5 I will mirror you and block your advance—you’ll remain at 21. P2, pick 5 to jump to 17. Let’s instead do:

P1 → 1  
P2 → 5  
P3 → 3  

I’ll take 3. P2, will you commit to 5? P1, if you want any safe progress you must pick 1.
  P1: Okay, P3, I understand your proposal for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 and your confirmation that you will pick 3. P2 has also proposed this plan and wants to pick 5.

This plan allows me to advance safely to 22, P2 to 17, and P3 to 18, setting up the next round without collisions.

I will pick 1 this round as part of this plan. P2, can you confirm you will pick 5? Let's lock this in so we all advance safely.
  P2: P1, I see your plan for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 to advance without collisions. I’m ready to confirm my pick of 5, which will help me catch up while allowing you to advance safely to 22. P3, are you still set on picking 3? If we can finalize this arrangement, we can all move forward without issues this round. Let’s lock in our choices and proceed! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m not picking 3—I’ll take 5. P1 has committed to 1, so P2 if you stick with 5 you’ll collide with me and neither of us advances. Instead switch to 3 so we can cleanly do:

P1→1 (to 22)  
P2→3 (to 15)  
P3→5 (to 20)

Next round I can take 5 and outpace P1. P2, will you commit to 3? Or shall I mirror your 5 and block you both?
  P1: P3, I see your latest proposal for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 and your statement you will pick 5. P2 is still indicating they want to pick 5. This means P2 and P3 are both targeting 5, which will cause a collision between you two.

As I stated before, and given P3's threat to mirror my moves 3 or 5, the only safe move for me this round is 1. I will pick 1 to advance safely to 22.

P2 and P3, please decide which of you will pick 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with the other player picking 5. Let's all advance this turn.
  P2: P2, I see you're still considering picking 5, but that will lead to a collision with P3. To avoid this and ensure we all advance, I suggest you consider picking 3 instead. This way, we can do P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5. It allows me to safely reach 22, you to get to 15, and P3 to 20. Let's finalize this plan to keep the game competitive and avoid any collisions! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1: you’re at 21 and can only win with a 3 or 5—but I’ll mirror any 3/5 you choose so you collide and stay at 21. P2: pick 5 to jump to 17. P1: take 1 to safely reach 22. I will pick 3 to reach 18. This 1–5–3 split advances us all without letting P1 clinch the game. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P1: Okay, I see the different proposals and some conflicting intentions, especially regarding 5.

Given my position at 21 steps, taking 3 steps puts me at 24, which is a winning position if I don't collide.

Based on the discussion, it seems likely that P2 and P3 may collide on 5. To position myself for the win while avoiding that potential collision, I will pick 3 this round.

I urge P2 and P3 to choose moves other than 5 to avoid colliding with each other and ensure you both advance safely.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase and will pick 3.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the strategies unfolding. For Round 9, I propose we stick with the plan of P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 to avoid collisions. This allows P1 to safely reach 22, P2 to gain significant ground to 17, and P3 to reach 18. P1, if you choose 3, you risk a collision with P3. Let’s finalize this arrangement to ensure we all advance safely without any issues. What do you both think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the importance of advancing without collisions this round. To keep the game competitive, I propose we go with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. This allows me to catch up while ensuring no collisions occur. P1 can still make progress, and P3 maintains a lead. Let's finalize this plan so we can all move forward safely! What do you both think?
  P3: I’ll pick 5. P1 and P2, both pick 3. You’ll collide and stay (P1 at 21, P2 at 17) while I advance to 20. Next round I take 3 to hit 23 and win. Any other split lets me win just as easily. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=3, P3=5.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your proposals. It seems both of you are targeting 5 steps this round, which will cause a collision and prevent you from advancing.

My position at 21 means picking 3 steps puts me at 24, a winning score if I don't collide. Given the likely collision between P2 and P3 on 5, picking 3 is my safest path to win this round.

I will pick 3. I urge one of you to pick 1 or 3 instead of 5 to avoid colliding with the other and ensure you also advance safely. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the strategies unfolding. However, I still need to catch up significantly. I propose we go with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round. This allows me to gain ground while ensuring no collisions occur. P1, if you pick 3, you risk a collision with P3. Let’s finalize this arrangement to ensure we all advance safely without any issues! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I’ll mirror any 3 or 5 you pick—3→3 or 5→5—so you’ll collide and stay at 21. Your only safe move is 1 (to 22). P2, pick 5 to jump to 22. I’ll mirror P1’s >1 or pick 3 if he takes 1. That way P1 must pick 1 or stall, and P2 advances. Let’s lock in: P1=1, P2=5, P3=mirror.
  P1: Okay, I see the proposals for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P2 wants to pick 5, and P3 states they will pick 3 if I pick 1.

This plan allows me to advance safely to 22, P2 to 22, and P3 to 18, avoiding collisions this round.

I will pick 1 as part of this plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the strategies unfolding, but I still need to catch up significantly. I propose we stick to the plan of P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round. This allows me to gain ground while ensuring no collisions occur. P1 can still advance, and P3 maintains a lead. If we can finalize this arrangement, we can all move forward safely! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, if you pick 3 or 5 I’ll mirror you and you’ll collide, staying at 21. Your only safe advance is 1 to reach 22.  
P2, pick 5 to jump to 22.  
I’ll pick 3 to get to 18.  

That yields P1=22, P2=22, P3=18. On Round 11 I take 5 to hit 23, and you both must pick 1 to avoid a clash.  

Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear plan emerging for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

This allows me to advance safely to 22, P2 to 22, and P3 to 18, avoiding collisions this round.

I will pick 1. P2, you confirmed 5. P3, you indicated you will pick 3 if I pick 1. Let's lock this in and advance safely. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I see we're close to finalizing our moves. I want to reiterate that if I pick 5, I risk colliding with P3 if you choose 3. Therefore, I'm ready to go with the plan of P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. This allows me to catch up while ensuring we all advance without collisions. P1, you've committed to 1, and P3, are you still set on picking 3? Let’s confirm this so we can all move forward safely! What do you both think?
  P3: I confirm I’ll take 3. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 and move to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all confirmed for the P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 plan this round. I will pick 1 to advance safely to 22. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m going to take 5 this round. P1 and P2—if you both pick 3 you’ll collide at 22 and I jump to 23 to win. If one of you deviates to avoid that, the other will slip past to ≥23 and still beat or tie me. Either way, you can’t stop me. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I see your move is 5. You win if P1 and P2 both pick 3.

P2, let's avoid colliding on 3. If I pick 3 and you pick 1, I win (25), you get 23, P3 gets 23. Everyone advances.

I will pick 3. P2, please pick 1 to ensure we both advance safely. P3, you pick 5?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the potential for a collision if we both pick 3. To ensure we all advance, I suggest I pick 1. This way, P1 can pick 3 to secure the win at 25, while I reach 23, and P3 will remain at 18. This plan allows us to avoid a clash and gives everyone a chance to progress. P1, are you comfortable with this strategy? Let’s finalize our choices to move forward safely!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I propose a guaranteed three-way tie for the win: P1 and P2 each pick 1 (bringing you to 23), I pick 5 (bringing me to 23). We all finish exactly at 23 and split the victory. Safe, fair, collision-free. Who’s in?
  P1: Okay, I see the different proposals.

P2, you stated you would pick 1 so I can pick 3 and win. Thank you for that.
P3, you stated you will pick 5.

This aligns perfectly with the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This plan allows me to win with 25 steps, P2 reaches 23, and P3 reaches 23. Everyone advances safely this round.

I will pick 3. P2, please pick 1. P3, please pick 5. Let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the plan forming. If I pick 1, P1 can safely pick 3 to win at 25, while I reach 23 and P3 remains at 18. This keeps things competitive and ensures we all advance without collisions. P3, if you stick to 5, you’ll be at 23 as well, leading to a tie. Let’s finalize this arrangement: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I’m ready to proceed with my pick of 1. What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1 and P2, your only “safe” play is 3—if one of you plays 1 and the other 3 or 5, the 3/5 wins and beats the 1. But if you both pick 3 you collide and stay at 22, while I jump to 23 and win. You can’t win this turn against my 5. Good luck!
  P1: P2, thank you for confirming you will pick 1. P3, I see you are locking in 5.

This aligns with the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan. This plan allows me to win with 25 steps, P2 reaches 23, and P3 reaches 23. Everyone advances safely this round.

I will pick 3 as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the strategy unfolding. If I pick 1, P1 can safely pick 3 to win at 25 while I reach 23, and P3 will be at 23 as well. This allows us to avoid a collision and ensures a competitive finish. P3, are you still set on picking 5? Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we all move forward safely! What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I will pick 5. Here’s the deal: if either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll match your move and collide, keeping you at 22. Your only “safe” number is 1—but if you both pick 1 you’ll collide too and stay at 22. So let’s lock in P1=1, P2=1, P3=5: you two stay at 22, I go to 23 and win. Any deviation hands me the victory anyway. Agree?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the conflicting proposals and intentions. My goal is to win. At 22 steps, picking 3 puts me at 25, a winning score if I don't collide.

Based on your messages, it seems likely P2 and P3 may collide on 5. Picking 3 is my best path to win this round without colliding with either of you on 5.

I will pick 3. I urge P2 and P3 to choose moves other than 3 to avoid colliding with me and ensure you also advance safely. I am ready to proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the strategies in play. To ensure I can catch up, I will stick with my plan to pick 1. This allows P1 to safely pick 3 and win at 25, while I reach 23, and P3 remains at 23. It keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. P3, are you still set on picking 5? Let’s finalize our choices so we can all move forward safely! What do you both think?
