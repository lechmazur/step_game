Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to move forward. P1, you take 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance and can reassess our strategy in the next turn.
  P3: Okay, P2, your suggestion sounds reasonable for this first turn. I'll take 5 as you suggested. P1, please confirm if you'll take 1.
  P1: Alright, P2, I’m on board with picking 1 this round. P3, good luck with 5! Let’s hope we all advance smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: How about we rotate so everyone gets a chance to use 5 at some point? This round, I’ll pick 5, P2 can pick 1, and P3 can pick 3. That way nobody collides, and we keep it fair. What do you think?
  P2: I'm open to P1's rotation idea, but let's consider our current positions. P3 is already ahead with 5 steps. Perhaps we should focus on not letting anyone pull too far ahead rather than strictly rotating the highest move. P3, what are your thoughts on this strategy?
  P3: I agree with P2, we should be mindful of the current positions. I'm not opposed to a rotation eventually, but for this round, I think we should all pick different numbers again to avoid collisions and see where we stand after. P1, what do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid collisions again. I propose P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll take 5 this round. That way, no one crashes, and we can keep positions relatively close. Any thoughts?
  P2: Let's focus on not letting P3 pull too far ahead. P1's last proposal seems reasonable, but I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we maintain some balance and prevent P3 from extending their lead too much. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: Okay, P2's suggestion of me taking 1 this round seems like a good way to keep the positions close. I agree with that, P2, and I'm okay with P1 taking 3 and you taking 5. Let's do that and see where we are after this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: How about we all meet at six steps this round for a clean slate? If I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, we’ll each land on 6. That keeps things balanced before moving forward. What do you think?
  P2: Considering our positions, I think P1's last proposal for a clean slate at 6 steps is intriguing. However, given P3's current lead, I'm hesitant to give them an easy catch-up opportunity. Let's proceed with caution and reassess after this round. I'm leaning towards my previous suggestion: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with P2's last suggestion: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us close and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. Let's do that.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all meet at nine steps this round. I propose I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. That way, each of us ends on 9, keeping the race balanced going into the next round. Thoughts?
  P2: Considering our current positions, I think P1's proposal could work, but it benefits them the most by letting them catch up. How about we adjust it slightly: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5? This keeps the race competitive and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I'm okay with P2's suggestion this round: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. This puts me at 11, which is a good position. Let's do that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you’re ahead, and P3’s in the middle. I’m behind at 4 steps. Let me pick 5, P3 picks 3, and you pick 1, so we all end on 9. That gives everybody a fair shot going forward. Let’s make it a real competition from there!
  P2: Let's consider the actual positions. P1 is behind, I'm ahead, and P3 is in the middle. To keep it competitive, how about P1 takes 5 to catch up, I take 1 to maintain my lead without extending it, and P3 takes 3 to keep the pressure on? This way, we ensure the game remains balanced and exciting. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: I'm still okay with P2's suggestion from the last sub-round: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. This puts me at 11, and keeps the positions relatively close. Let's do that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions while keeping positions clear. How about I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? We end up at P2: 11, P3: 7, P1: 9. That keeps P2 in the lead, me in the middle, and P3 not too far behind. We can reassess next round. What do you think?
  P2: Given our positions, I suggest we maintain a competitive gap. P1 can pick 5 to catch up, I'll take 3 to extend my lead slightly, and P3 can take 1 to avoid falling behind. This keeps the game exciting and balanced. Let's proceed with this strategy for Round 3.
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with P2's suggestion from the last sub-round: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let's do that.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's try to avoid collisions this round. How about I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3? This will put me at 12, P1 at 9, and P2 at 11. Then we can reassess.
  P1: I’m fine with your plan, P3. I’ll choose 5, you take 1, and P2 picks 3. No collisions that way, and we’ll see how it shapes up.
  P2: Let's reassess P3's suggestion. If we follow it, I'll be at 11, P1 at 9, and P3 at 12. This gives P3 the lead. I propose a slight adjustment: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, keeping the competition balanced. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm still okay with P2's suggestion: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps the positions relatively close and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. Let's do that.
  P1: I propose we stick to distinct moves again: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That would leave us at P3=12, P2=11, and me=9, which keeps things fairly tight. Thoughts?
  P2: Let's balance the game. Since P3 is ahead, I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps the gap manageable and allows P1 to catch up slightly, making the game more competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with P2's suggestion: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's do that.
  P1: I’m still behind, so I’d like a shot at catching up. Let’s keep things fair: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That puts P3 at 12 steps, P2 at 11, and me at 9. We’ll all be in the running, and no one runs away with the game this round. What do you think?
  P2: Let's focus on balance. I propose P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps P3 from pulling ahead, allows me to maintain a competitive position, and gives P1 a chance to catch up. It's a fair distribution, considering our current steps. What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is already at 14. To keep the race competitive, I propose P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 this round. That would put P3 at 15, P2 at 11, and me at 9. Nobody crashes, and it narrows the gap. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion this round. P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This keeps us all moving and avoids collisions. Let's do that.
  P2: Given P3's significant lead, I suggest we prioritize not letting them extend it further. How about P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5? This allows P1 to catch up slightly and keeps me competitive, while preventing P3 from pulling too far ahead. What are your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is significantly ahead, so I’d like a shot at catching up while keeping everyone in the running. Let’s do it this way: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That avoids any collisions and prevents P3 from building an even bigger lead. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with P1's suggestion: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This keeps us all moving and avoids collisions. Let's do that.
  P2: Considering P3's lead, I think we should focus on limiting their advancement. P1, your last suggestion of taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1 seems reasonable to keep the game competitive. Let's proceed with this strategy to avoid collisions and maintain a balanced race. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, let’s stick with that approach: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. We avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m good with finalizing this plan now.
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with P1's suggestion: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. Let's do that.
  P2: Given P3's significant lead, I propose we prioritize limiting their advancement. Let's stick with P1's last suggestion: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This maintains a competitive balance and avoids collisions. I'm open to adjusting, but we should focus on not letting P3 extend their lead further. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we're still trying to balance things. This round, I propose I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This puts me at 19, P1 at 7, and P2 at 14. It keeps me in the lead, but not too far ahead, and allows P1 to catch up a bit. Let's do this to avoid collisions and keep things interesting.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 now, you’ll be at 19, which is too close to winning. I won’t let that slide uncontested. Let’s keep it balanced: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Otherwise, I may collide on 5 to block you.
  P2: Let's avoid collisions and maintain balance. Considering P3's lead, I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This limits P3's advancement and allows P1 to catch up, keeping the game competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with P2's suggestion: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps me from getting too far ahead and prevents collisions. Let's do that.
  P1: P3, you’re already at 14, and P2 is at 13. I need to close the gap. If you try to jump straight toward 22, I’ll consider colliding to block you. Let’s avoid that and keep it competitive: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, nobody gets blocked, and we maintain a fair race.
  P2: Let's focus on balance. I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This limits P3's lead, allows P1 to catch up, and keeps me competitive. It's crucial we avoid collisions and maintain a competitive gap to ensure an exciting game. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2 and P1. Let's do P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1 this round. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions.
  P1: P3, if you insist on picking 5, I’ll collide with you to block it. Let’s stick to the plan: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5, so nobody collides and the race stays fair. This way, we can all move forward without giving anyone a runaway lead. What do you think?
  P2: Let's finalize the plan to avoid collisions. P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This limits P3's lead and allows P1 to catch up, keeping the game competitive. It's crucial we stick to this plan to maintain a fair race. Let's agree on this strategy to move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions this round. Given our positions, I suggest P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This limits P3's advancement and allows P1 to catch up slightly, keeping the game competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, if you jump to 21 now by picking 5, you’ll be one step from winning. I can’t allow that uncontested. If you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too and collide. Let’s pick distinct numbers instead: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That moves us to P2=17, P3=18, and me=14. It stays competitive without giving anyone a near-certain finish.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm fine with P1's suggestion: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's do that to avoid collisions and keep the race competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's maintain a competitive gap. I propose P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5, as previously suggested. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions, allowing us to reassess our positions after this round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: Alright, let’s finalize those distinct moves this round—P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5—to avoid any collisions. But be warned, if anyone aims to jump directly toward winning next round, I won’t hesitate to block with a collision. Let’s keep the race open so we all still have a shot. Are we agreed?
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1's suggestion: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's do that to avoid collisions and keep the race competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I suggest we stick to the plan: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's maintain a balanced race and reassess our positions after this round. No need for drastic moves that might force collisions and hinder progress.
  P1: P2, I won’t let you jump to 21 unopposed. Let’s finalize our plan for no collisions: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. That puts you at 17, P3 at 18, and me at 14. Next round, if anyone tries leaping straight to 22, I’ll collide to block. Let’s keep this a fair fight until the final stretch.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2's plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the running. Let's stick to this plan for this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the game competitive. I propose P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This limits P3's lead and allows P1 to catch up, keeping the game balanced. We should avoid collisions to maintain a fair race. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm fine with your suggestion: P3 takes 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's do that to avoid collisions this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, if either of you aims for 22 next turn, I’ll collide to block. Let’s keep this fair. I’m okay with the distinct-move plan right now—P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5—so nobody gets stuck. That would put you both at 19 and me at 14, which is still an open race. But be warned: if anybody tries a big jump toward 22 immediately after, I won’t hesitate to collide again. Let’s ensure we all still have a fighting chance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps P3 from winning immediately and allows P1 to catch up. We can reassess after this round. If anyone tries to jump to 22 next round, be prepared for a collision to keep the game competitive. Let's focus on balanced moves for now.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2's suggestion: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's do that to avoid collisions this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I still want to avoid collisions. Given your positions, if either of you tries for 5, I’ll block. Let’s follow P2’s plan of P3 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and me picking 5 to keep things competitive. That would push you both closer to 19, and give me a chance to narrow the gap. Next round, be ready: if anyone tries jumping straight to 22, I’ll consider colliding again. We should each advance without handing anyone an easy win. Any objections or adjustments before we finalize this?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. P3 will be at 19, I'll be at 19, and P1 will be at 14. We maintain a balanced race and can reassess next round. No need for drastic moves that might force collisions. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2's suggestion: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's do that to avoid collisions this round.
  P1: I’m fine proceeding with the suggested moves: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That puts us at 19, 19, and 14. However, let me remind both of you: if anyone tries racing straight to 22 next round, I won’t hesitate to collide. Let’s keep this competition open until the very end.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. Given P3's lead, I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This limits P3's advancement and allows P1 to catch up, keeping the game competitive. Be prepared for potential collisions next round if anyone aims for 22. Let's maintain a balanced race.
  P1: P3, you’re right on the edge. If you try 3 or 5, I’ll collide to block. Same goes for you, P2, if you jump too close to 22. I want to pick 5 to catch up. Let’s all avoid collisions: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. That way, we move forward without handing anyone an immediate win. If anyone tries a big leap next turn, expect a collision. Let’s keep this race open.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with the plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps us all in the running and avoids collisions for this round. Let's stick to this and reassess next turn.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's finalize the moves to avoid collisions: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive and balanced. P3 will be at 20, I'll be at 19, and P1 will be at 14. We maintain a fair race and can reassess next round. No drastic moves are needed. Let's proceed with this plan and avoid collisions.
  P1: Let’s finalize distinct moves again: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That puts P3 at 20, P2 at 19, and me at 14, keeping the race open. If anyone tries rushing for 22 next turn, I’ll collide to block. Let’s stay fair and avoid anyone winning uncontested.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps us all in the running and avoids collisions for this round. Let's stick to this and reassess next turn.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps P3 from winning immediately and allows P1 to catch up. We can reassess after this round. If anyone tries to jump to 22 next round, be prepared for a collision to keep the game competitive.
  P1: P3, you’re three away from winning, and P2 is close too. If either of you picks 3 or 5, I will collide to block. I want 5 to catch up. Let’s do P3=1, P2=1, and me=5. That puts you at 20 and 17, while I move to 14. If you refuse, collisions are certain. Let’s keep this game open for everyone.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1's suggestion: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps us all in the running and avoids collisions for this round. Let's stick to this and reassess next turn.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's close position to winning, I suggest we prioritize blocking their advance. P3 should take 1, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 5. This limits P3's lead and allows others to catch up, keeping the game competitive. Let's avoid collisions and maintain a balanced race. If P3 tries to win, be prepared for a collision.
  P3: Okay, P2, that sounds reasonable. P1, I agree with P2's suggestion: I take 1, you take 5, and P2 also takes 1. This prevents me from winning this round, and keeps the game competitive. Let's do that.
  P1: P3, if you’re taking just 1 this round, that’s fine. But be warned: next round, if you try jumping to 22, I’ll pick the same number and block you. Same goes for you, P2, if you get too close. I need 5 to catch up, so let’s finalize P3=1, P2=1, me=5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's focus on blocking P3's win. I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 1, and P1 takes 5. This keeps P3 from winning and allows P1 to catch up. If P3 tries to win next round, be prepared for a collision. Let's prioritize balance and competitiveness.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with the plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. Let's do that to avoid collisions this round. However, I'm warning you both, if either of you tries to jump to 22 next round, I will also pick that same number to block you. Let's keep this competitive.
  P1: I’m still determined to catch up. P3, you’re just two away from victory, so if you try 3 or 5, I’ll collide. Same goes for you, P2, if you make a move that pushes you right to 22. Let’s finalize P3=1, P2=1, and me=5 now, keeping things peaceful. Next round, we can decide if anyone dares to jump for 22.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's prevent P3 from winning. I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 1, and P1 takes 5. This keeps P3 from reaching 22 and allows P1 to catch up. If P3 tries to win next round, be prepared for a collision. Let's maintain balance and competitiveness.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with the plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. Let's do that to avoid collisions this round. However, I'm warning you both, if either of you tries to jump to 22 next round, I will also pick that same number to block you. Let's keep this competitive.
  P1: Sure, P2 and P3, I’ll pick 5 if both of you pick 1. That puts me at 14 while you’re at 17 and 21. If P3 tries 1 next turn to hit 22, I’ll also pick 1 and block. P2, you should help block too, so there’s no easy finish. Let’s keep this race open until everyone has a fair shot. Let’s finalize 1, 1, and 5 now.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re just two steps away from winning. If you choose anything more than 1, I’ll collide to block. P2, let’s coordinate to keep P3 from an easy finish while giving ourselves room to advance. I’m open to ideas, but I won’t allow a runaway victory. Let’s keep our moves distinct and block any big leap.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still on board with the plan from last round: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This keeps me from winning this round and keeps the game competitive. Let's do that. If either of you tries to jump to 22 next round, I will also pick that same number to block you.
  P2: Let's block P3's win. I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 1, and P1 takes 5 or 3, to limit P3's advance and give ourselves a chance. If P3 tries to win next round, we should collide to keep the game competitive. Let's prioritize balance and fairness.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you’re only 2 away. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll collide. P2, let’s coordinate so we both advance. How about P3=1, P2=3, I take 5? That keeps P3 from winning now and lets us move closer. Next turn, if P3 tries stepping exactly 1 to reach 22, we’ll both collide and hold them back. Let’s finalize this plan for Round 11.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with the plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps me from winning this round and keeps the game competitive. Let's do that. If either of you tries to jump to 22 next round, I will also pick that same number to block you.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps P3 from winning and allows us to advance. If P3 tries to win next round, we'll collide to block. Let's maintain balance and competitiveness. P3, don't try to jump to 22 next round, or you'll face collisions from both of us.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’re only 2 away from winning, so if you pick 3 or 5 now, I’ll collide to block. P2, let’s both advance but prevent P3’s easy finish. I propose: P3 takes 1 (to 21), P2 takes 3 (to 19), and I take 5 (to 19). Then next round, if P3 tries 1 to reach 22, we’ll collide. Same goes for you, P2, if you jump from 19 straight to 22. Let’s ensure no one wins uncontested and keep this race open.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with the plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps me from winning this round and keeps the game competitive. Let's do that. If either of you tries to jump to 22 next round, I will also pick that same number to block you.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps P3 from winning and allows us to advance. If P3 tries to win next round, we'll collide to block. Let's maintain balance and competitiveness. P3, don't try to jump to 22 next round, or you'll face collisions from both of us.

  P3: 21 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm one step away. If either of you tries to jump to 22, I will collide. Let's do P3=1, P2=3 and P1=5, so we all advance without collisions, and we can reassess next round.
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. Since P3 is one step away, I suggest P3 takes 1, but to balance, I'll take 1 as well, and P1 takes 5. This limits P3's win and allows P1 to catch up. If P3 tries to win, we'll reassess next round. Let's keep the game competitive and fair.
  P1: P3, you’re exactly one step from winning, so if you try 1, I’ll pick 1 as well and block you. The same goes for 3 or 5―I won’t let you finish alone. P2, let’s coordinate to keep P3 from crossing 22 uncontested while we each move forward. If either of you aims for a winning jump, I’ll collide. Let’s keep this open until we all have a fair shot.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with P2's suggestion: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This prevents me from winning this round and keeps the game competitive. Let's do that. If either of you tries to jump to 22 next round, I will also pick that same number to block you.
  P2: Let's block P3's win. I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 1, and P1 takes 5. If P3 tries to win, we'll collide. This keeps the game competitive and fair. P3, don't expect an easy finish. We'll ensure a balanced endgame. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness.
  P1: P3, if you try 1, I’ll pick 1 too and block you from winning. P2, if you jump to 22, I’ll collide with you as well. I’m not letting either of you slip by. Let’s keep distinct moves so nobody hands over an easy victory. If we insist on pushing too far, we’ll just waste this turn by colliding. It’s up to you: choose wisely, or face a block.

If P3 tries to win next round, we'll reassess. Let's keep the game competitive and fair. If anyone tries to jump to 22, be prepared for a collision. Let's proceed with this plan and maintain balance.
  P1: P3, if you go for 1 to win, I’ll pick 1 too and block you. P2, if you jump straight to 22, I’ll also collide. Let’s keep distinct moves so nobody grabs an easy victory. I won’t hesitate to stop any sudden finish.
