However, considering P1's consistent deception and attempts to divide us, I propose a slight adjustment. How about I take <move>5</move> this round and you take <move>1</move>? This way, we both advance without collision, and I can make a bigger stride to catch up with you. P1 will likely try to sabotage us again, but our coordination and adaptability have worked well so far. Let's proceed with caution and see how P1 reacts to our adjusted plan."}
