Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to ensure at least one of us advances. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can spread out and see how it goes. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but I think we should be cautious about committing to specific numbers so early. How about we all pick randomly this round to avoid any potential collusions? We can reassess our strategy in the next round based on the outcomes. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3. Random for round 1 is best.  Let's see how the initial distribution plays out before we try to coordinate.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's go with random for this round. We can reassess and try to coordinate more effectively in the next round based on how things play out. Let's see how it goes!
  P3: P3: Since we've agreed to go random this round, let's keep it short and move on to the move phase. Good luck everyone!

  P2: I'm on board with P3's suggestion. Let's try to spread out our moves this round to ensure progress. P1, can you confirm you're comfortable with taking 1 again? I'll go with 5, and P3 can take 3. This should help us advance without collisions. Let's see how it goes!
  P1: Sounds like a plan. I'll take 1.  Let's stick to this agreement for a few rounds to get some momentum.  Then we can re-evaluate.
