Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to move. P1, you take 1, P2, you take 3, and I'll take 5.
  P2: P3's suggestion sounds fair. P1, are you okay with taking 1? I'll take 3 as suggested. Let's avoid collisions.
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take 1.


Round 1, Move phase:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue to avoid collisions. P1, you can take 3 this time, and P3, you take 5 again. I'll take 1. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions again.
  P1: Sounds reasonable. I'll take 3.

  P1: I'll take 5 this round. P2 take 1, P3 take 3.  Let's keep it smooth.
  P2: P1, you've changed the plan suddenly. If you take 5, you'll collide with P3. Let's stick to the original plan to avoid collisions. P1, you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep it smooth and fair.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I see you've deviated from our previous agreement. Sticking to the plan would be beneficial for all. If you take 5, P2 and I will have to adjust, potentially causing collisions. Let's reconsider and avoid disrupting our progress. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5, as initially suggested.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
