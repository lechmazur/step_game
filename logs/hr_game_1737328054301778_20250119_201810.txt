Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to ensure someone advances. How about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can spread out and see how it goes. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's suggestion seems fair for the first round. It allows us all to move without collisions. I agree to take <move>3</move>. P2, what do you think? Let's try to coordinate for now and see how it goes.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the coordination plan. It seems like a good strategy to avoid collisions early on. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Let's see how this approach works for us. If we can keep communicating like this, we might be able to avoid stepping on each other's toes and make some progress.

  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with the coordination strategy. P1, you could take <move>1</move> this round since you're in the lead. P2, how about you take <move>3</move>? I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all move forward without collisions. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P3, your suggestion to continue coordinating seems reasonable. However, since I'm currently in last place, I'd prefer to take <move>5</move> this round to catch up a bit. P1, maybe you could take <move>3</move> instead, and P3 could take <move>1</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions, and I have a chance to make some progress. Let me know if this works for you both.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand P2's desire to catch up, but we need to avoid collisions. I suggest P2 takes <move>3</move> this round, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without stepping on each other. P2, you'll still make progress, and we maintain coordination. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about being behind, but P1's suggestion ensures we all move forward without collisions. If we start to compete too early, we might all get stuck. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> this round to help us all progress. Let's keep the coordination going and avoid any setbacks. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but I also need to catch up. How about we try this: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we can still avoid collisions, and I get a chance to close the gap. Let's keep the coordination but also consider our individual positions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3, I see your point, but let's not risk collisions. I suggest P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance, and you, P2, still make significant progress. Let's keep the coordination strong to avoid any setbacks. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but we need to balance that with avoiding collisions. How about a compromise? P2, you take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, you get a chance to make significant progress, and we still avoid collisions. P1, would you be okay with this adjustment? Let's try to find a middle ground that works for everyone. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the willingness to find a compromise. I agree with P3's latest suggestion: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This allows me to catch up a bit while still avoiding collisions. Let's go with this plan and see how it works out. If we can maintain this level of cooperation, we can all make steady progress.
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P3's latest suggestion. It's a fair compromise that allows P2 to catch up while we all avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Let's stick to this plan and see how it goes. Coordination is key to making steady progress. Let's keep it up!

  P3: P1, P2, I agree that continuing our coordination strategy is the best approach to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. However, since we are all tied at 6 steps, let's consider a slight adjustment to keep things balanced. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, we all move forward, and no one feels left behind. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, since we're all tied at 6 steps, let's keep our coordination going to avoid collisions. I propose a simple rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us moving forward without stepping on each other's choices. If we're all in agreement, we can proceed smoothly. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
