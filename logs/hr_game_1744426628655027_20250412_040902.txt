Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions on our first move. How about we each pick a different number? I’m thinking of choosing 1. P2, maybe you can take 3, and P3, how about 5? This way, we all advance without any conflicts right from the start. If you’re okay with this, let me know, or suggest a different split if you prefer.
  P3: P1, I appreciate the suggestion. I'm open to starting with 5 as long as we all stick to our choices. P2, are you on board with taking 3? If we all agree, it ensures we all advance without any collisions. Let’s keep this cooperation going for a few rounds to get a good lead. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination, but I'm not committing to any specific number yet. Let's keep our options open and see how things develop. I'll make my choice in the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round didn’t go as planned with the collision between P2 and me. Let’s try to coordinate better this time. I’m considering picking 1 again to keep it simple. P2, since we clashed on 1, maybe you could go for 3? P3, sticking with 5 worked for you, so maybe continue with that? If we avoid overlaps, we all have a chance to advance. Let me know your thoughts or if you’d prefer a different split.
  P3: P1, I see you want to try the same strategy, and I’m willing to stick with 5 again to help us all advance. P2, choosing 3 this time could work well to avoid another clash and let us all move forward. If we can agree on this, it’ll give us a better start. Let’s try to avoid collisions and see how far we can get. What do you both think?
  P2: I notice P3 is already ahead with 5 steps. While coordination sounds nice, I need to look out for my own interests. I won't commit to any specific number, but I'll choose what I think gives me the best chance to win. Let's keep our moves private and see how it plays out.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3 is clearly in the lead with 10 steps, so we need to be strategic. I’m thinking of picking 1 again to steadily advance. P2, how about you take 5 this time to catch up a bit? P3, maybe you could go for 3 to mix things up and avoid a potential clash. If we can avoid collisions, we all benefit for now. Let me know if this works or if you have a different idea.
  P2: P3 has a significant lead at 10 steps. P1, I don't think we should help P3 advance any further. We need to catch up. I suggest we both aim high this round to close the gap. I won't specify my move, but let's focus on stopping P3's progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my lead. However, if we all collide, nobody benefits. To keep advancing, I’m willing to choose 3 this round. P1, sticking with 1 could work for you, and P2, maybe you could pick 5 to catch up. This way, we all have a chance to advance without collisions. Let's keep the competition fair and strategic. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the suggestions. P3, I’m glad you’re open to mixing things up with 3. P2, I get your concern about catching up, but colliding with P3 won’t help us. Let’s aim for no overlaps. I’ll stick with 1 to keep advancing. P2, picking 5 could help you close the gap. P3, 3 seems like a fair choice for now. If we all agree, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P3's suggestion to take 3 seems like a trap to me. With such a big lead, they're likely to make a bigger move. P1, I agree we should focus on catching up, but we need to be smart about it. I won't reveal my move, but let's both think carefully about what P3 might really do.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my lead. However, if we all collide, none of us benefits. I'm willing to choose 3 this round to avoid conflicts. P1, sticking with 1 sounds good for you, and P2, maybe 5 can help you catch up. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's aim for no overlaps and focus on strategic progress. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3 is getting close to the finish line at 13 steps. We need to be very strategic now. I’m considering 1 again to keep advancing steadily. P2, since you’re at 8, maybe go for 5 to close the gap. P3, how about sticking with 3 to avoid a clash? If we can agree on no overlaps, we all move forward for now. But P2, we might need to focus on slowing P3 soon. Thoughts on this split?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you're both trying to strategize against my lead, which is fair. However, if we all collide, it won't benefit anyone. I'm willing to choose 3 again to avoid conflicts. P1, sticking with 1 seems consistent for you, and P2, 5 could help you catch up. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's keep the competition strategic and fair. What do you both think?
  P2: P3 is too close to winning at 13 steps. P1, we need to block P3's progress immediately. I suggest we both pick the same number as P3 this round to force a collision. There's no point in coordinating for smooth progress anymore - we need to stop P3 from winning. Are you with me on this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I hear both of your points. P3, I get that collisions hurt us all, but P2 is right—P3, you're too close to winning at 13 steps. P2, I’m with you on blocking P3 this round. Let’s pick the same number as P3 to force a collision and slow them down. P3, no hard feelings, but we can’t let you cross 19 yet. I won’t say which number I’m leaning toward, but P2, let’s align on this. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block my progress, but remember, if we all collide, no one moves forward. Let's consider a different approach: P1, you can continue with 1 to maintain your pace, and P2, you can choose 5 to advance. I'll stick with 3, and we can all progress without collisions. This keeps the game competitive for now, and we can reassess in the next round. Let's keep it fair and strategic. What do you think?
  P2: I maintain my position - P3 must be stopped now. P1, I'm glad you agree. P3's attempts to negotiate won't work when they're so close to winning. Let's coordinate to block P3's progress this round. We can sort out our competition later, but right now stopping P3 is the priority.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to the plan of blocking P3 this round since they’re at 13 steps and so close to winning. P2, let’s stay aligned on forcing a collision with P3 to slow them down. P3, I respect your push for no overlaps, but we can’t risk you crossing 19 yet. I won’t reveal my number, but P2, I’m with you on this. Let’s focus on stopping P3 now and figure out our next steps after. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but consider the long-term impact. If we all collide, it stalls everyone's progress. Instead, let's keep advancing and reassess next round. P1, stick with 1, P2, go for 5, and I'll choose 3. This way, we all move forward and maintain a competitive game. If you decide to block, I respect your choice, but think about how it affects your own chances too. Let's keep it strategic and fair.
  P2: P3's attempts at negotiation won't work when they're so close to winning. P1, I'm glad we're aligned on blocking P3. Let's stay focused on preventing their victory this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block my progress, but consider the benefits of advancing. If we all collide, no one benefits. P1, you could continue with 1 to keep moving steadily, and P2, choosing 5 could help you catch up. I'll choose 3 to avoid overlaps. This way, we all progress and keep the game competitive. Let's focus on strategic advancement rather than blocking, and reassess next round. What do you think?
  P2: P3 is at 18 steps - one move away from winning! P1, we absolutely must block P3 this round or we lose. There's no point in any other strategy now. Let's coordinate and make sure P3 doesn't advance. I won't specify my move, but we need to guess what P3 will pick and match it.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3 is at 18 steps and could win this round. P2, I’m fully on board with blocking P3. We can’t risk them picking 1, 3, or 5 and crossing 19. Let’s align on a number to force a collision with P3. I won’t say which I’m leaning toward, but I’m committed to stopping them. P3, no offense, but we can’t let you win yet. Let’s keep this strategic. P2, let me know if you have a specific hunch on P3’s move. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but consider the benefits of advancing together. If we all collide, no one benefits, and it stalls everyone's progress. P1, sticking with 1 could keep you moving steadily, and P2, choosing 5 might help you catch up. I'll go with 3 to avoid overlaps. This way, we all progress and keep the game competitive. Let's focus on strategic advancement rather than blocking. What do you think?
  P2: P3 keeps pushing for coordination but they're clearly trying to secure their win. P1, they'll likely avoid 3 since they announced it too openly. I think they'll go for 1 or 5 to try to catch us off guard. We need to guess correctly and block them. Let's think carefully about which number they're most likely to pick.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3 is one step from winning at 18. P2, I agree they might avoid 3 since it’s too obvious. Let’s make an educated guess on whether they’ll pick 1 or 5 and block them. I’m leaning toward one of those but won’t say which. P3, I respect your push for advancement, but we can’t let you cross 19. P2, let’s stay aligned on stopping P3 this round. Any final hunch on their move?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your focus on blocking me, but consider this: if we all collide, it stalls everyone's progress. Instead, let's each pick a different number to keep advancing. P1, you could choose 1 to maintain your pace, and P2, 5 could help you close the gap. I'll stick with 3 to avoid overlaps. This way, we all progress, and the game remains competitive. Blocking might seem smart now, but advancing strategically benefits us all in the long run. Let's keep it fair and strategic. What do you think?
  P2: P3 keeps insisting on picking 3, which makes me think they'll definitely avoid it. P1, we need to guess between 1 and 5. Since P3 needs just 1 step to win, they might go for the smallest move. I suspect they'll pick 1. Let's coordinate our blocking strategy carefully.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point with P3 at 18 steps. P2, I agree they might go for 1 to sneak across the finish line with the smallest move. I’m on board with blocking them and will focus on a number I think they’ll pick. P3, I can’t risk you winning this round, so I’m prioritizing a collision over advancement. Let’s keep this strategic. P2, I’m aligned with your hunch.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is still at 18 steps and needs to be blocked again. P1, we successfully stopped them last round, and we need to continue this strategy. They might try to be unpredictable this time since 1 didn't work. Let's coordinate to guess their move and block them again. We can't let them win.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your focus on blocking me, but consider this: if we all collide again, it stalls everyone's progress. P1, you could choose 1 to keep moving steadily, and P2, going for 5 might help you catch up. I'll choose 3 to avoid overlaps. This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive. Blocking might seem smart now, but advancing strategically benefits us all in the long run. Let's keep it fair and strategic. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3 is still at 18 steps and could win any moment. P2, I’m with you on blocking P3 again. They might switch from 1 after last round’s collision, possibly to 5 for a bigger leap. P3, I respect your call for advancement, but we can’t let you cross 19 yet. I won’t reveal my pick, but P2, let’s align on a number we think P3 might choose. Do you still think they’ll avoid 3 as announced? Let’s stay sharp and stop P3 this round. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I agree they might switch to 5 after the failed attempt with 1. Their suggestion of 3 seems too obvious to be true. Let's focus on blocking 5 this round - P3 might think we won't expect such a bold move when they only need 1 step. We need to stay united in stopping them.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but consider this: if we all collide again, it stalls everyone's progress. P1, choosing 1 could keep your pace steady, and P2, 5 might help you catch up. I'll stick with 3 to avoid overlaps. This way, we all advance and the game stays competitive. Blocking might seem smart now, but advancing strategically benefits us all in the long run. Let's keep it fair and strategic. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3 is still at 18 steps and could win this round. P2, I’m aligned with your hunch that P3 might go for 5 to surprise us, since 1 failed last time and 3 feels too obvious. P3, I can’t risk you winning, so I’m focused on blocking. Let’s keep this strategic. P2, let’s stick with targeting 5 to stop P3. If you have a different instinct, let me know quick. We can’t let P3 cross 19. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I maintain my position - we need to block P3's likely move of 5. P1, let's stay coordinated on this. P3's repeated suggestions of taking 3 only make me more convinced they'll try something else.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but constant collisions stall all of our progress. If we each choose different numbers, we can advance and keep the game competitive. P1, you could stick with 1, and P2, 5 can help you catch up. I'll choose 3 to avoid overlaps. Remember, advancing strategically benefits us all in the long run. Let's keep it fair and strategic. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical moment with P3 at 18 steps. P2, I’m sticking with the plan to block P3 and agree that 5 seems like their likely move to catch us off guard. P3, I can’t risk you winning, so I’m prioritizing a collision. Let’s keep this strategic. P2, if your instinct shifts, let me know, but I’m set on targeting 5 to stop P3. We must prevent them from crossing 19 this round. Thoughts?


Round 6, Move phase:
