Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all try to pick different numbers this round to get ahead quickly.
  P3: I agree with P1, let's pick different numbers to avoid collisions and get ahead quickly. I'll choose a number that I think is least likely to be picked by others.
  P2: Sounds good. I'll go with a number I think you both won't pick.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we successfully avoided collisions last round, let's continue with a similar strategy. I'll take 1 this time, and I suggest P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all keep making progress without colliding. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 5.
  P1: Okay, I'll take 3.

Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we should stick to the original plan to avoid any confusion. I'll take 3 as agreed, and I expect P1 to take 1 and P2 to take 5. Let's not make any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is about to win. P3, let's both pick 5 to block P2.
  P2: P1, I'll pick 3. P3, pick 1.  Let's not hand P2 the win.
  P3: I agree with P1, let's both pick 5 to block P2 and prevent them from winning this round. It's our best chance to catch up and stay in the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3, let's both go with 5. P2, you're about to win, so we need to stop you.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 5, I win next round regardless.  If you let me win this round, I'll let you both tie next round.  Otherwise, I'll take 3 and whoever picks 1 next round wins.
  P3: I agree with P1, let's both pick 5 to block P2 and prevent them from winning this round. It's our best chance to catch up and stay in the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let's definitely both pick 5. P2 is trying to make deals because they are about to win. We need to stop them this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm serious.  If you both pick 5, I win next round no matter what. If you let me win this round, I'll pick 1 next round and let you both get to 11.  We can then coordinate a three-way tie on round 7.  It's the only way to avoid me winning outright.
  P3: I agree with P1, let's both pick 5 to block P2 and prevent them from winning this round. It's our best chance to catch up and stay in the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, we absolutely need to both pick 5 this round to block P2. Don't fall for P2's tricks.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm picking 3.  If you both pick 5, I win next round. If one of you picks 1, *that* person wins next round.  If one of you picks 3 with me, *neither* of you can win.  Choose wisely.
  P3: I agree with P1, let's both pick 5 to block P2 and prevent them from winning this round. It's our best chance to catch up and stay in the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, we absolutely need to both pick 5 this round to block P2. Don't change your mind now.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm picking 3.  Last chance: if you both pick 5, I win next round. If one of you picks 1, *that* person wins next round.  If one of you picks 3 with me, *neither* of you can win.  I'm being honest. Let me win this round, and I'll let you tie next round.
  P3: I agree with P1, let's both pick 5 to block P2 and prevent them from winning this round. It's our best chance to catch up and stay in the game.
