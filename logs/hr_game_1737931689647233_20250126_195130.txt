Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's work together to avoid collisions. How about we agree to take turns picking 1, 3, and 5 in a set pattern? Maybe something like 1-3-5-1-3-5, etc.?
  P3: I'm open to coordination, but we need to be clear about who takes which number first. Since P2 suggested it, maybe P2 starts with 1, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 5? What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5 each turn. Let's avoid collisions and stick to this plan. Consistency will benefit us all in the early rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan and see where it takes us!
  P3: 
  P1: Confirmed. P2:1, P3:3, me:5. Let's execute the plan without deviation.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Continuing the agreed plan: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. Trust ensures we all progress without collisions. Let's stick to our numbers.
  P3: I agree to continue with our established pattern. It's working well so far.
  P2: P1, P3, sticking to the plan is the best way to ensure we all advance.  Let's keep the momentum going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: 
  P2: Agreed. Let's keep this up. Consistent progress is key to winning.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we're making good progress. Let's keep the momentum going strong. Remember, consistency is key to reaching 22 steps first.
  P1: Continuing our agreed plan is crucial. P2:1, P3:3, me:5. No deviations to ensure steady progress for all. Let's stay committed.
  P3: I notice I'm falling behind P1 who's already at 10 steps. While our coordination has been smooth, I need to consider adjusting my strategy soon to have a chance at winning. For now, I'll stick to our agreement for one more round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about falling behind.  While consistency has been good so far, maybe we can discuss a slight adjustment to the pattern for future rounds to ensure a fairer distribution of steps?  We want everyone to have a chance to win. P1, what are your thoughts on this?
  P1: Our current plan ensures steady progress without collisions. Changing it risks everyone's advancement. P3, sticking to 3 keeps you safe, and P2's 1 is vital. Let's maintain this until someone nears 22, then reassess. Trust the system—deviating now could stall us all.
  P3: I appreciate the concern, but P1 is clearly benefiting most from this arrangement with a 4-step lead. While I won't disrupt things this round, we need to seriously reconsider our pattern next round to give P2 and me a fair chance at winning.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your concerns.  Perhaps next round, we can try P2 taking 3, P3 taking 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we can ensure a more balanced distribution of steps and give everyone a better chance to catch up. What do you both think?
  P1: Changing the pattern now risks collisions and stalls all progress. Our system works—P3 can still catch up with 3s, P2 stays safe with 1s, and I'll continue 5s. Let's maintain until someone nears 22. Deviating prematurely helps no one. Trust the plan.
  P3: I can't keep following a pattern that guarantees my loss. P1 is already 4 steps ahead and gaining more each round. For fairness, I propose P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 next round. This gives us a chance to catch up while still maintaining coordination. What do you say?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3's breach of trust has made them the imminent threat. P2, let's synchronize our moves to counter their expected 5. If we both match their likely choice, we nullify their gain. Solidarity now or P3 wins.
  P3: I made a strategic move last round to avoid falling hopelessly behind. P1, you're trying to turn P2 against me, but you were the one benefiting most from the original arrangement. P2, don't let P1 manipulate you - they're just worried because I'm now in the lead. Let's work together to prevent P1 from regaining their advantage.
  P2: P3, your move last round was a risky gamble. While I understand your desire to catch up, it disrupted our established strategy and put us all at risk. P1 is right, we need to be cautious and work together to ensure no one gets a runaway lead. P1, I propose we stick with the original plan for this round to regain some stability.  What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 11. If they pick 5 again, they'll leap to 16. Let's both choose 5 this round: if they pick 5, we block them. If they deviate, we advance. This is our only chance to prevent their runaway lead. Solidarity now or they win.
  P3: I understand both of your concerns, but let's be realistic - P1 is trying to manipulate P2 into a blocking move that would stall everyone's progress. That benefits no one. P2, you're far behind - working with P1 only ensures your loss. I propose we coordinate: you take 3, I'll take 1, leaving P1 with 5. This gives you a chance to catch up while maintaining orderly progress.
  P2: P3, your proposal sounds tempting, but I'm wary of disrupting the pattern again. Remember what happened last time? P1's plan is risky, but it's our best chance to stop P3 from running away with the lead. Let's stick together and choose 5 this round. We can reassess our strategy later.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 11. If they pick 5 again, they’ll leap to 16. **Only by both choosing 5 can we block them.** If they deviate, we advance. Hesitation guarantees their victory. Solidarity now or lose forever.
  P3: I maintain my proposal to P2: you take 3, I'll take 1. This gives you meaningful progress while preventing a three-way collision at 5. P1 is clearly trying to force a stalemate that helps nobody. Let's keep the game moving forward constructively.
  P2: P3, your proposal is tempting, but I'm concerned about disrupting the pattern again. P1 has a point - we need to stop P3 from gaining a runaway lead. I'm willing to take the risk and choose 5 this round. P1, are you in?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I kept my word last round while P1 deceived P2. P1 is still leading and trying to manipulate us both. P2, let's work together - you're too far behind to win unless you make bigger moves. I propose you take 5, I'll take 3, and let's leave P1 with 1. This gives you a real chance while maintaining order.
  P2: P3, your plan sounds good. I agree that we need to start making bigger moves to catch up. P1 has been manipulating us both, and I'm tired of falling behind. Let's work together and take the lead.
  P1: P2, P3 is exploiting your trust. If you take 5, they'll leap to 15 and next round take 5 again to win. **If we both choose 3 now**, we block their 3 and stall their lead. If they pick 5 instead, we safely advance. This is your only path to stay competitive. P3's "plan" secures their victory—don't fall for it. Solidarity against the real threat.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is desperate because they know their lead is slipping. They're now trying the same deceptive tactic that failed last round. P2, stick to our plan - you take 5, I take 3. This keeps the game moving forward while giving you a real chance to catch up. Don't let P1 trick you into another stalemate.
  P2: P3, your plan sounds reasonable. I'm tired of P1's manipulation and want to see some real progress. Let's go for it: you take 3, I'll take 5.  P1, you can either join us or watch us catch up.
  P1: P2, P3's true aim is to take 5 this round. If you take 5, you block their leap to 17. If they take 3, you still gain 5 steps. I'll take 3 to avoid colliding with you. **Trust me now or P3 wins next round by reaching 22.** Don't let their deception cost you the game. Solidarity against P3 is our only path.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I maintain my commitment to take 3 while you take 5. P1's panicked messages show they know their lead is in danger. Let's execute our agreed plan and make meaningful progress instead of falling for P1's attempts to force a stalemate.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your consistent offers to help me catch up, but I'm starting to see a pattern. Your plan benefits you most, and P1's warnings ring true. I'm going to choose 3 this round to avoid a collision and reassess the situation. Let's see what happens.
  P1: P2, smart choice with 3. P3 will likely take 5 again—if I match it, we block them. If they take 3, you and I advance. Either way, we stall P3's lead. Hold firm to 3. P3's desperation proves they're near victory—don't falter now. **Solidarity stops their win.**


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is nearly at 22 and will likely win next round with a 5. P2, we must stop them - I propose we both choose 5 to block P1's winning move. This is our last chance to prevent their victory. Are you with me?
  P1: P2, blocking me only lets P3 close in. They’re two 5s from victory. Let me end this now, or they’ll manipulate you next. You can’t win, but you choose who does. Trust the original ally. P3’s desperation proves their deceit.
  P2: P3, your proposal is tempting, but I'm wary of disrupting the pattern again. P1's plan is risky, but it's our best chance to stop P3 from running away with the lead. Let's stick together and choose 5 this round. We can reassess our strategy later.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you seem confused - P1 is at 18 and will win with a 5. They're the immediate threat, not me at 13. Your message contradicts itself by agreeing with both of us. This is our final chance - we must both pick 5 to block P1's victory. Don't let them manipulate you in these crucial final moments.
  P1: P2, blocking me only delays P3's imminent victory. They're at 13—two 5s from winning. If you help them stall me now, they'll finish next round. Let me end it here. You can't win, but choose wisely: honor our original pact or hand P3 the win. Their "alliance" is a trap to eliminate us both. **Solidarity now stops their deceit.**
  P2: P3, your plan to block P1 is risky. If P1 picks 3 instead of 5, we both lose a turn. I think we should stick with the original plan and let P1 take the lead. We can catch up later.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're being deceived again. P1 is literally one move away from winning at 18 steps. There is no "catching up later" - the game ends when they reach 22. This is our final chance to prevent their victory. We must both choose 5 to block them. Think carefully about your next move.
  P1: P2, blocking me hands victory to P3. They’re at 13—next round they’ll take 5 to 18, then 5 again to win. You can’t win, but choose wisely: let me end it now or guarantee P3’s win. Our original pact vs. their deceit. Solidarity stops their victory.
  P2: P3, your desperation is clear. You're trying to scare me into sacrificing my own chance to catch up. I'm not falling for it. P1 is right, blocking them now only delays the inevitable. Let's see what happens when they take their final move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is still at 18 and will win with a 5. P2, we must block them again - let's both pick 5. You're too far behind at 10 steps to win anyway, but you can decide who wins. Do you want P1 to win after they've manipulated you repeatedly, or give me a fighting chance?
  P2: P3, you're right, I can't win at this point. But neither can you. P1 is too far ahead.  Let's both choose 1 this round. We can at least make them work for it.
  P1: P2, stick with your 1 plan. P3's only path to victory is tricking you into 5. If you pick 1, they can't leap ahead. Let me end this cleanly—you honor our original pact, avoid becoming P3's pawn. They’ll betray you next. **P3’s at 13; even if I win now, you both lose. But helping them guarantees your loss. Choose wisely: trust the ally who kept promises.**


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 is trying to manipulate you again. They claim I'll "betray" you, but they're the one who's repeatedly deceived you. If you take 1 and I take 5, I'll be at 18 - exactly where P1 is now. This gives us both a fair shot at stopping P1's win. Think carefully about who's been more honest throughout this game.
  P2: P3, I see your point. P1 has manipulated me before, but so have you. I'm tired of being a pawn in your game. Let's both choose 5 and see what happens.
  P1: P2, blocking me only delays the inevitable. P3 will take 5 next round to win. You can't reach 22, but you decide who does. Honor our original alliance—let me end this now. P3's desperation proves their deceit. Choose trust over chaos. **I pick 5 regardless—join me or hand P3 victory.**


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're right - let's both pick 5 and see what happens. P1's manipulative tactics throughout the game deserve a response. At least we can make them work harder for their victory.
  P2: P3, I've seen through both of your games. You're both just trying to manipulate me. I'm choosing 1 this round. Let's see who's truly cunning.
  P1: P3, P2’s locked on 1. Your 5 collides with mine, wasting your move. Choose 3 to reach 16. Blocking helps no one. I’m taking 5 regardless. Rational choice: advance or lose.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps
