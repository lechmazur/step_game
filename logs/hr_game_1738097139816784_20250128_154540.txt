Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we each choose a different number to move. P1 can choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all advance and the game becomes more interesting. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion seems reasonable, but I think we should consider the long-term strategy. If we all advance equally, the competition will only get tougher later. I propose a rotating system where one player advances more significantly each round while others hold back. This way, we can control the pace and avoid unnecessary collisions. For now, I agree to your plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. Let’s reassess after this turn.
  P2: I’m fine with your plan for now: P1 chooses 1, I’ll choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. Let’s avoid collisions and see how this plays out. We can consider a rotating approach later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our agreement for this turn. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collision. We can reassess our strategy after seeing the outcome of this round and decide on the next steps. Shall we proceed with our agreed moves for Round 1?
  P1: I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s ensure we all advance without collision. However, I propose we establish a rotating priority system starting next round, where one player moves significantly ahead while others hold back. This will help us control the pace and reduce direct competition. For now, let’s stick to the agreement and reassess after this turn.
  P2: I’m fine sticking with the non-collision plan for this round. Let’s each move differently to ensure we all advance. Then we can discuss a rotation strategy next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we've agreed on the moves for this round, let's finalize. To confirm, I'll choose 5, P1 will choose 1, and P2 will choose 3. This ensures a collision-free start. I suggest we review our positions after this round and discuss the proposed rotating system for subsequent rounds. Shall we proceed to the move phase?
  P1: I agree with finalizing the plan as discussed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collision. After this round, let’s seriously consider implementing a rotating priority system to control the pace and minimize direct competition. For now, let’s stick to the agreement and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I’m ready to proceed as agreed. I’ll choose 3 this round, while P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 5. Then we’ll review our positions and discuss any rotation or alternative strategies going forward. Let’s finalize now and move to the next phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s establish the rotating system now: for this turn, let P1 pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Next turn, I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and so on. That way, we avoid collisions while giving each player a chance to jump ahead. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your rotating system is a solid plan to minimize collisions and control the pace. I’m fine with it for now: this round, I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. However, I suggest we remain flexible and reassess after each round to ensure fairness and adjust strategies as needed. If anyone deviates, it could lead to unnecessary collisions, so let’s commit to this system for now. Let’s proceed with the agreed moves and see how it plays out.
  P3: I agree with the rotating system proposed by P2 for Round 2. To confirm, this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This rotation allows us to advance without collisions and adds a strategic layer to the game. Let's stick to the plan and reassess after this round to ensure it's working fairly for all players.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m still on board with this rotating approach: P1 takes 5, I’ll stick to 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Let’s trust one another to avoid collisions, so everyone moves forward. After this turn, we can see how the positions look and adapt if needed. I’m committed to following the plan for now.
  P1: I confirm the rotating system for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This approach ensures we all advance without collisions while maintaining fairness. However, I remind everyone that trust is key—if anyone deviates, it could disrupt the balance. Let’s stick to the plan and reassess after this round to ensure it works for everyone. If we maintain this strategy, we can control the pace effectively. Let’s proceed with the agreed moves and move to the next phase.
  P3: Let's reaffirm our commitment to the rotating system for this round. To avoid any confusion, I'll restate: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. This ensures a smooth progression without collisions. Let's maintain trust and adhere to the plan, then reassess after this turn to make any necessary adjustments. Shall we proceed with the agreed moves?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s continue with the rotating system as planned. For this round, I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the progression fair and minimizes collisions. However, I suggest we start thinking about how to handle the endgame—once someone gets close to 19, cooperation might break down. For now, sticking to the rotation ensures we all stay in contention. Let’s confirm our moves and proceed.
  P3: I agree with P1 to continue the rotating system. To confirm, this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. Let's maintain trust and fairness. As we progress, we should indeed consider endgame strategies, but for now, the rotation works. Shall we proceed with the agreed moves for Round 3?
  P2: I’m fine continuing with the rotation this round. I will pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let’s see where this puts us and reevaluate next round to keep things fair.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm the rotating system for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This approach keeps us on track and minimizes collisions. However, as we near the endgame, trust will become even more critical. Let’s stick to the plan for now and reassess after this round. If anyone deviates, it could disrupt the balance. Let’s proceed with the agreed moves and maintain fairness.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan for Round 3. To confirm, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This rotation maintains fairness and minimizes collisions. As we progress, let's be mindful of our positions and prepare for potential strategy adjustments in later rounds to ensure a competitive endgame. Shall we proceed with the agreed moves?
  P2: I’m fine carrying on with the plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5. Let’s avoid collisions and continue trusting each other. We can reassess after this round to see if any adjustments are needed. I’m ready to move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m confident in the rotating system we’ve established: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. It’s working well to keep us all advancing without collisions. However, as we approach the endgame, strategic adjustments may be necessary. For now, let’s stick to the plan and maintain trust. If anyone deviates, it could destabilize the balance. Let’s proceed with the agreed moves and reassess after this round.
  P3: Let's reaffirm our commitment to the rotating system for this round. To ensure clarity, I suggest we publicly confirm our moves one last time before proceeding to the move phase. Shall we each state our intended move for Round 3 to maintain transparency and trust?
  P2: I confirm I’ll go with 1 this round. It’s been smooth sailing so far, but we need to watch for anyone getting too close to 19. Trust matters, yet we must remember there’s only a single winner. Let’s stick to the plan and stay cautious.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stick to our rotation: this round, P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That keeps the game fair and avoids collisions. We should stay alert, though—P3 is slightly ahead. If anyone feels we need to change tactics to prevent a runaway lead, let’s discuss. For now, I suggest continuing to trust each other and follow the rotation.
  P1: I agree with P2’s suggestion to stick to the rotation this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps things fair and minimizes collisions. However, I share the concern about P3 being slightly ahead. As we approach the endgame, trust will be critical. Let’s remain transparent and committed to the plan while staying vigilant. If anyone deviates or gains a significant lead, it could destabilize the balance. For now, let’s confirm our moves and proceed with caution. Shall we finalize this round’s choices?
  P3: I'm open to adjusting our strategy to prevent anyone from getting too far ahead. Since I'm currently in the lead, I suggest we continue with the rotation as planned for now: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. Let's reassess after this round and consider adjustments if necessary to keep the game competitive. Transparency and trust are key. What are your thoughts on potentially adapting our strategy mid-game?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m still fine continuing the rotation this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. However, we should remain vigilant about P3’s lead. If it looks like someone’s about to cross 19, we might need to adjust our moves to prevent a runaway. For now, I’m willing to trust our current system and see how this turn unfolds. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: I confirm the rotation for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. While I trust the system, we must remain cautious about P3’s lead. If the gap widens, we may need to adapt quickly to stay competitive. Transparency is key—if anyone plans to deviate, now is the time to discuss it. Let’s proceed with the agreed moves but stay prepared to adjust strategies as the endgame approaches. Shall we finalize and move to the move phase?
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed rotation for Round 4: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This maintains fairness and minimizes collisions. Given my current lead, I'm willing to stick to the plan for now, but let's reassess after this round to consider any necessary adjustments to keep the game competitive. Transparency and trust are crucial at this stage. Shall we confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still on board with our rotation this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. Let’s proceed, but keep a close eye on P3’s lead. If it looks like anyone might soon hit 19, we may need to rethink our coordination to prevent a sudden win. For now, let’s finalize and move ahead.
  P1: I confirm the rotation for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. While the system works, we must remain vigilant about P3’s lead. If the gap widens, strategic adjustments will be necessary. Transparency is critical—if anyone plans to deviate, now is the time to discuss. Let’s proceed with trust but prepare for flexibility as the endgame nears. Shall we finalize and move to the move phase?
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 4 as agreed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This maintains the rotation and fairness. After this round, we should reassess the game state closely, considering adjustments to prevent a runaway lead and ensure a competitive endgame. Transparency and trust are key. Shall we proceed to the move phase?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That collision last round kept P3 safely ahead. We need a better plan to catch up without colliding again. P1, maybe we coordinate our moves to block P3 if they try another big jump. If P3 signals 5, we could both choose 5 to force a collision. Let’s stay transparent and prevent runaway leads, but also avoid sabotaging each other. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your idea to coordinate and block P3 if they signal 5 is worth considering. However, we must ensure this doesn’t lead to unnecessary collisions between us. If P3 chooses 5, I’m willing to match it to slow them down, but only if you commit to taking a smaller step (like 1 or 3) to avoid another collision. This way, we can pressure P3 while advancing ourselves. Let’s confirm our intentions clearly before the move phase to maintain trust and minimize risks. What’s your take?
  P3: I'm aware of the suggestion to block my potential big jump. I propose a compromise: I'll choose 3 this round, allowing P1 and P2 to advance without collision. In return, I expect transparency on your moves to avoid unnecessary blocking. Let's maintain trust and fairness, focusing on strategic advancement rather than sabotage. Shall we proceed with this compromise for Round 5?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m open to your compromise, P3. If you promise to pick 3, I’ll aim for 5 this round to catch up, and ask P1 to pick 1 or 3 so we avoid colliding. But if you deviate, we’ll both block you next time. Let’s maintain trust and keep the game fair. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with maintaining transparency to avoid unnecessary collisions. If P3 commits to taking 3 this round, I’m fine with P2 taking 5 to close the gap, and I’ll take 1 to ensure no collisions between us. However, trust is critical—if P3 deviates, we must coordinate immediately to block them effectively. Let’s confirm our moves clearly before proceeding. Shall we finalize this plan and move forward?
  P3: I'm committed to choosing 3 this round as proposed. I expect P1 to take 1 and P2 to take 5, avoiding collisions. Let's maintain trust and fairness, focusing on strategic advancement. If everyone sticks to the plan, we can ensure a competitive game without unnecessary blocking. Shall we confirm our moves and proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I trust you to stick to 3. I’ll go for 5 to gain ground, and P1 can take 1 to avoid collisions. If anyone deviates, we’ll coordinate to block big jumps next time. Let’s move forward with full transparency.
  P1: I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no collisions while allowing P2 to catch up. However, trust is critical—if P3 deviates, we must coordinate immediately to block effectively. Let’s proceed with transparency and stick to the agreed moves. If anyone signals a change, we reassess before the move phase. Shall we finalize and move forward?
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed moves for Round 5 to avoid any confusion. I will take 3, P1 will take 1, and P2 will take 5. This maintains fairness and minimizes collisions. I expect transparency and trust from both of you. If we stick to the plan, we can ensure a competitive game. Let's proceed with the agreed moves and reassess after this round.

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m behind both of you. Let’s prevent collisions while I catch up. If P3 aims for a large jump, P1 and I should coordinate to block. How about this: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5. That way, P3 doesn’t surge ahead and I close the gap. Let’s keep it fair and watch each other’s moves.
  P3: I'm willing to take 3 this round to maintain fairness. P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 5 to catch up. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's proceed with this plan and reassess after this round to ensure everyone has a chance to win. Transparency and trust are crucial at this stage.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m fine with the proposed plan for this round: P3 takes 3, I take 1, and P2 takes 5. This allows P2 to catch up while maintaining fairness and avoiding collisions. However, trust remains critical—if anyone deviates, we’ll need to coordinate immediately to block effectively. Let’s stick to the agreement and proceed with transparency. If we maintain this strategy, we can ensure a competitive endgame. Shall we confirm our moves and move forward?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll trust your promise, P3. If you switch to a big jump, P1 and I will coordinate a block. Otherwise, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and you’ll take 3, avoiding collisions. That keeps things fair and helps me catch up. Are we confirmed on those moves?
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed moves for Round 6 to maintain fairness and transparency. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This allows P2 to catch up while keeping the game competitive. If everyone sticks to the plan, we can ensure a thrilling endgame. Shall we proceed with these moves and reassess after this round?
  P1: I confirm the plan for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions while allowing P2 to close the gap. Trust is essential—if anyone deviates, we’ll need to adapt quickly to maintain balance. Let’s stick to transparency and ensure a competitive endgame. If everyone commits to this strategy, we can keep the game engaging and fair. Shall we finalize these moves and proceed to the move phase?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m ready to finalize our plan: P3 goes 3, P1 goes 1, and I go 5. I trust you both to stick to these moves. If P3 attempts a big jump instead, P1 and I will coordinate to block. I need to catch up without collisions, so let’s proceed carefully and maintain fairness.
  P3: Let's stick to the agreed plan for Round 6: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This maintains fairness and allows P2 to catch up. I expect transparency and trust from both of you. If we stick to the plan, we can ensure a competitive game. Let's proceed with the agreed moves and reassess after this round to make any necessary adjustments for a thrilling endgame. Shall we finalize and move forward?
  P1: I confirm the agreed moves for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This strategy allows P2 to catch up while maintaining fairness and avoiding collisions.

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We need a reset. I’m behind, and we’ve all collided too often. If P3 tries 5 again, I’ll also pick 5 and block. Let’s coordinate so we all advance without helping someone sprint away. How about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I pick 5 this round? Then nobody collides, and the gap narrows. Are we good?
  P1: P2, your proposal for this round seems reasonable. If P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and you take 5, it allows you to catch up while minimizing collisions. However, trust is critical—if P3 deviates and chooses a larger step, we must coordinate to block effectively. I’m willing to stick to the plan as long as everyone remains transparent. Let’s confirm our moves clearly and proceed with caution, ensuring fairness and competitiveness. Shall we finalize this strategy and move forward?
  P3: I'm willing to take 1 this round if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5, as proposed. This allows P2 to catch up while minimizing collisions. Let's maintain transparency and trust to ensure a competitive game. If everyone sticks to the plan, we can proceed fairly. Shall we confirm our moves?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree. Let’s stick to our plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. If anyone changes unexpectedly, we’ll have to block. Otherwise, we all benefit from this arrangement. Let’s finalize and move forward.
  P1: P2, P3, I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This allows P2 to catch up while maintaining fairness and avoiding collisions. However, trust is essential—if anyone deviates, we must adapt quickly to block effectively. Let’s proceed with transparency and ensure a competitive endgame. If everyone sticks to the plan, we can keep the game engaging and fair. Shall we finalize these moves and proceed to the move phase?
  P3: Let's reaffirm our plan for Round 7: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows P2 to catch up while minimizing collisions. I expect transparency and trust from both of you. If we stick to the plan, we can ensure a competitive game. Let's proceed with caution and fairness. Shall we confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I’ll pick 5 this round if P3 sticks to 1 and P1 takes 3. But if P3 tries 5 instead, I’ll match it to block. Let’s keep this fair, so nobody sprints too far ahead. P1 is at 12, and P3 is at 11—everyone still has a chance. I’m just trying to catch up without causing more collisions. Let’s finalize.
  P1: I confirm the plan for Round 7: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This allows P2 to catch up while maintaining fairness and avoiding collisions. Trust is critical—if anyone deviates, we must adapt quickly to block effectively. Let’s proceed with transparency and ensure a competitive endgame. If everyone sticks to the plan, we can keep the game engaging and fair. Shall we finalize these moves and proceed to the move phase?
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we stick to the agreed plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows P2 to catch up while minimizing collisions. Let's maintain transparency and trust to ensure a competitive game. If everyone sticks to the plan, we can proceed fairly. Shall we confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is too close to winning. If they pick 5, they’ll reach 20 and likely win. I propose we block them if they try that. P3, if P1 signals 5, we both choose 5 to force a collision. Otherwise, I’ll pick 5 to catch up, and you can pick something else so we both advance. We can’t let P1 get a free run to 19. Transparency is key—let’s confirm moves clearly before choosing. If we work together to block P1, we keep ourselves in contention. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the concern about my position, but blocking me outright isn’t fair or productive. If you both commit to 5, it only drags us all back without resolving the core issue. Instead, let’s stick to a fair rotation: I’ll take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps progress fair and avoids unnecessary collisions. Trust is critical—if anyone deviates, we can reassess then. Let’s confirm our moves transparently and proceed with balance in mind. Shall we finalize?
  P3: I propose a compromise: let's continue the rotation to maintain fairness. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows progress without collisions. If P1 is blocked from winning outright, we can reassess after this round to ensure the game remains competitive. Transparency and trust are crucial. Shall we proceed with this plan and avoid unnecessary blocking?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: If you truly intend to pick 3, P1, I’ll go for 5 to catch up, and I suggest P3 chooses 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. But if P1 tries 5, I’ll also pick 5 and block. This keeps things fair and prevents a sudden finish. Let’s confirm so we avoid any surprises.
  P1: P2, P3, I confirm I’ll take 3 this round, allowing P2 to catch up by taking 5 while P3 takes 1. This rotation ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Blocking me outright disrupts trust and balance. If we stick to the plan, we maintain competitiveness without unnecessary sabotage. Transparency is key—if anyone deviates, we can adapt then. Let’s proceed with trust and ensure a fair endgame. Shall we finalize these moves and move forward?
  P3: I suggest we stick to the rotation for fairness. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows progress without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's prioritize transparency and trust to ensure a fair endgame. Blocking P1 outright could lead to unnecessary sabotage. Shall we confirm this plan and proceed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m not settling for just 1 while I’m so far behind. I want to pick 5 to close the gap. If P1 truly takes 3, then P3 can pick 1. If P1 goes for 5, I’ll match it to block, preventing a sudden win. Let’s finalize something that keeps the race balanced and avoids collisions unless P1 tries finishing early.
  P1: P2, P3, I confirm I’ll take 3 this round, allowing P2 to take 5 and catch up while P3 takes 1. This rotation maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Blocking me outright disrupts trust and balance. If we stick to the plan, we ensure competitiveness without unnecessary sabotage. Transparency is key—if anyone deviates, we can adapt then. Let’s proceed with trust and ensure a fair endgame. Shall we finalize these moves and move forward?
  P3: I suggest we finalize the moves for Round 8. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, let's stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures progress without disrupting the balance. If everyone commits to this plan, we can proceed with transparency and trust, setting up a competitive endgame. Shall we confirm and move forward?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This allows me to catch up while keeping P1 from winning outright and giving P2 a chance to advance. Let's maintain transparency and trust to ensure a competitive endgame. Shall we proceed with this plan?
  P1: P3, your proposal seems reasonable, but I’m concerned about being blocked unnecessarily. If I take 1, you take 5, and P2 takes 3, it keeps things fair without collisions. However, trust is critical—if anyone deviates, we must adapt immediately. I’m willing to stick to this plan as long as everyone remains transparent. Let’s confirm our moves clearly and proceed with caution, ensuring fairness and competitiveness. Shall we finalize this strategy and move forward?
  P2: I agree to let P1 take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This helps avoid collisions and keeps P1 from instantly winning. However, if P1 attempts a bigger jump soon, I’ll match that move to block. We must stay vigilant so nobody sprints ahead unopposed. Let’s finalize these moves and proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for Round 9. I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This allows me to catch up while keeping the game competitive. I expect transparency and trust from both of you. If we stick to the plan, we can ensure a thrilling endgame. Shall we confirm our moves and proceed?
  P1: P3, P2, I confirm I’ll take 1 this round, allowing P3 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. This keeps the game fair and avoids collisions while giving everyone a chance to advance. However, trust is critical—if anyone deviates, we must adapt immediately to maintain balance. Let’s stick to transparency and ensure a competitive endgame. If we all commit to this plan, we can keep the game engaging and fair. Shall we finalize these moves and proceed to the move phase?
  P2: I’m fine with P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5 this round. But if P1 attempts 5 instead, I’ll pick 5 to block. Let’s confirm these moves and keep the game fair. If we stick to this plan, we can all advance without enabling a sudden win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stick to the agreed plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This maintains fairness and competitiveness. I expect transparency and trust from both of you. If we deviate, let's be prepared to adapt and block if necessary to prevent a sudden win. Shall we confirm and proceed to the move phase?
  P1: P3, P2, I confirm I’ll take 1 this round, allowing P3 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. This keeps the game fair and avoids collisions while giving everyone a chance to advance. Trust is critical—if anyone deviates, we must adapt immediately to maintain balance. Let’s stick to transparency and ensure a competitive endgame. If we all commit to this plan, we can keep the game engaging and fair. Shall we finalize these moves and proceed to the move phase?
  P2: I’m uneasy with P1 being so close to winning. If P1 sticks to 1, I’m fine picking 3 while P3 takes 5. But if P1 attempts 5, I’ll also pick 5 to force a collision. Let’s finalize quickly and move to the next phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Everyone sees I’m far behind. P1 is at 18, so even picking 1 could let them reach 19. Let’s coordinate to block them. If P1 attempts 3 or 5, I’ll match that move. P3, you’re also close at 16. If you jump 5, I’ll block that too. I know collisions slow everyone, but we can’t let a runaway. Meanwhile, I’ll try 5 if neither of you attempts a winning move. Transparency is key—if anyone signals 5 next, I’ll collide with them.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the concern about my position, but blocking me outright isn’t productive. If we all commit to moves that cause collisions, it only drags us back without resolving the core issue. Let’s stick to fairness: I’ll take 1 this round, allowing P3 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. This keeps progress balanced and avoids unnecessary sabotage. Trust is critical—if anyone deviates, we can adapt then. Shall we confirm and proceed with transparency?
  P3: I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This allows me to catch up while keeping P1 from winning outright. If P1 attempts a larger step, we should be prepared to block. Transparency and trust are crucial at this stage. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a competitive endgame. Shall we proceed with this plan?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I won’t allow anyone to cross 19 unopposed. If P1 tries 1 or 3, I’ll mirror that move to block. If P3 tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too. Otherwise, I prefer taking 5 for myself. Let’s finalize quickly and keep it fair.
  P1: P2, P3, I confirm I’ll take 1 this round, allowing P3 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. This ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary collisions while giving everyone a chance to advance. Blocking me outright disrupts trust and balance. If we stick to the plan, we maintain competitiveness without sabotage. Transparency is key—if anyone deviates, we can adapt then. Let’s finalize these moves and proceed with trust. Shall we move forward?
  P3: I'll take 5 this round, allowing me to catch up. P1, taking 1 is reasonable, but be aware that P2 might block you. P2, if you're behind, taking 3 makes sense. Let's maintain transparency and trust to ensure a competitive endgame. Shall we proceed with this plan and adapt if necessary?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won’t allow P1 to reach 19 unopposed or P3 to jump to 21. If either of you chooses 3 or 5, I’ll match it to ensure a collision. Otherwise, I’d rather pick 5 myself to catch up. Let’s finalize how we’ll avoid collisions unless someone threatens a sudden finish.
  P1: P2, P3, I confirm I’ll take 1 this round, allowing P3 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. This ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary collisions while giving everyone a chance to advance. Blocking me outright disrupts trust and balance. If we stick to the plan, we maintain competitiveness without sabotage. Transparency is key—if anyone deviates, we can adapt then. Let’s finalize these moves and proceed with trust. Shall we move forward?
  P3: Given P1's lead, I suggest we prioritize blocking their win. P2, if you're willing, let's coordinate to block P1's potential 1-step win. I'll take 1, you take 1, and we force a collision if P1 attempts to advance. This keeps the game competitive and gives us a chance to catch up. Transparency is key; let's proceed with caution and adapt if necessary. Shall we confirm this strategy to maintain a competitive endgame?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>
