Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone. First round, let's try to avoid colliding so we can all get moving. Maybe we aim for different numbers? What are your thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P2, it's best to avoid collisions in the first round. Why don't we make it simple? P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. What do you think, P1? Are you okay with taking 1?
  P1: That sounds fair for round 1. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s all move forward cleanly and avoid early collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, that works for me. P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's get started.
  P3: I'm glad we have a plan for the first round. To confirm, P1 will take 1, P2 will take 3, and I'll take 5. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for future rounds. For now, let's focus on making a clean start.
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s all stick to the agreed plan for this round—no surprises. After we see how it plays out, we can talk strategy again next round.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Nice clean start, everyone. Want to rotate picks this round to keep things fair? I could take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. That way we all get a turn at the higher numbers without colliding. Thoughts?
  P2: That rotation sounds reasonable to me, P1. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 for this round. It keeps things moving and avoids collisions. P3, are you okay with taking 1 this time?
  P3: I'm happy to take 1 this round as suggested by P1. It's a fair rotation and ensures we all get a chance to move without colliding. I agree with P2 that it's a reasonable plan. Let's stick to it for now and reassess after this round. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Sounds like a plan!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we're all on board. Let's all stick to the agreed rotation this round—P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. If no one deviates, we all benefit and keep pace. Looking forward to seeing it play out smoothly again.
  P2: Sounds good. Everyone seems agreed on the rotation: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. Let's execute the plan.
  P3: I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation plan. To confirm, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 this round. Let's stick to it and avoid any collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for future rounds. For now, let's focus on making a clean start. I'm looking forward to seeing it play out smoothly again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: If this round goes smoothly again, we’ll all be at 6, 8, and 10 steps respectively—still close and fair. If we want to keep rotating, we can plan the next round now: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. That keeps the cycle going and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, let's stick to the plan for this round first: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. We can talk about the next round after we see the results of this one.
  P3: I think we should stick to the agreed rotation plan for this round and focus on making a clean start. Let's avoid any collisions and ensure we all get a chance to move forward. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for future rounds. For now, let's focus on executing the plan smoothly. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 as agreed. Looking forward to seeing it play out smoothly again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: If we all stick to the agreed plan this round—P3 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5—we’ll avoid collisions again and stay close in steps. After this, if we want to keep rotating safely, we can go with: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 next round. That keeps things fair and balanced. Let’s keep the cooperation going.
  P2: Okay, let's focus on Round 2 as agreed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. We can discuss Round 3 after these moves are done. I'm ready to move.
  P3: I agree with P2 that we should focus on the current round and execute the agreed plan smoothly. Let's avoid any collisions and ensure we all get a chance to move forward. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for future rounds. For now, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's keep the cooperation going and make a clean start.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that didn't go according to plan. P1, you switched from the agreed 3 to 5, and I also ended up choosing 5. We both collided and got nothing, while P3 followed the plan and is now leading.

It seems coordinating specific numbers isn't reliable if we don't stick to the agreement. What's everyone's thinking for this round, especially given P3's lead?
  P3: I agree that coordinating specific numbers can be unreliable if we don't stick to the agreement. However, I would like to propose a new plan for this round. Since I'm currently leading, I'll take 3, P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 5. This way, we can all move forward without colliding and maintain a fair pace. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Are you willing to try this new plan?
  P1: P3, it's convenient for you to propose a plan that keeps you in the lead. Trust is shaky after last round—especially since I got zero. If we're going to coordinate again, maybe we rotate based on current standings: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. That helps balance the lead and avoid another collision. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal (P3=1, P2=3, P1=5) seems like a reasonable way to correct the imbalance from last round. P3 gained while P1 and I got nothing due to the collision. P3, taking 1 step this round while P1 gets 5 and I get 3 would bring scores much closer (P1=6, P2=6, P3=7). It feels fairer given the circumstances. What do you say, P3? Are you willing to take 1 to help restore balance?
  P3: I understand P1's concerns about trust after the last round, and I appreciate P2's support for a plan that balances the lead. However, I'm not convinced that taking 1 step this round is the best approach for me. As the current leader, I'd like to maintain some momentum while still being fair. How about we compromise: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1? This way, P1 gets a chance to catch up, and we all move forward without colliding. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your compromise still keeps you comfortably ahead while P2 falls further behind. If you truly want fairness, you should take 1 this round. P2 gets 3, I take 5. That brings us all within 1 step of each other: P1=6, P2=6, P3=7. It’s the only plan that restores balance and builds trust. Otherwise, why should we believe future agreements will hold?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I have to agree with P1. Your compromise plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) leaves me falling significantly behind, which isn't acceptable. The fairest path forward is P1's suggestion: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This brings scores to P1=6, P2=6, P3=7. It addresses the imbalance from last round and rebuilds trust. Taking 1 this round demonstrates a commitment to fair play and keeps the game competitive for everyone. Otherwise, cooperation seems unlikely going forward.
  P3: I understand the concerns about fairness and trust. However, I'm not willing to take 1 step this round as it would put me at a disadvantage. Instead, I propose a different compromise: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, P1 gets a chance to catch up, and we all move forward without colliding. If we can't agree on this, I'm willing to take a risk and choose a number without coordinating. Let's decide quickly before the conversation phase ends.
  P1: P3, your refusal to take 1 shows you're prioritizing your lead over fairness. If you won't cooperate to restore balance, there's no reason for P2 or me to stick to any future deals with you. P2, if P3 picks 3 again, we can block him by both choosing 3 or 5. I'm open to coordinating with you to prevent P3 from running away with this. Let’s discuss options.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you're right, P3 isn't playing fair by refusing the only plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) that restores balance after last round. P3, this is your last chance to agree to take 1.

Otherwise, P1, I'll aim for 3 this round. If P3 sticks to 3, they get blocked. If P3 wisely chooses 1, we get the fair outcome (P1=6, P2=6, P3=7). This seems the best way to handle P3's unwillingness to cooperate fairly.
  P3: It seems that P1 and P2 are not willing to accept my previous proposals. I understand their concerns about fairness and trust, but I'm not willing to take 1 step this round as it would put me at a disadvantage. Instead, I'll take a risk and choose a number without coordinating. I'm confident that my strategy will pay off, and I'll maintain my lead. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to make my move.
  P1: P2, since P3 refuses to cooperate fairly, let’s follow through: I’ll take 5, you take 3. If P3 picks 3, he gets blocked. If he picks 1, fair outcome. Either way, we regain control. Let’s show that refusing fairness has consequences.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page now. Since we've reached a fair outcome with P1=6, P2=6, and P3=7, I propose we continue with a rotation plan to maintain balance and avoid collisions. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we all move forward without colliding, and the lead remains competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Are you willing to try this new plan? Let's work together to keep the game exciting and fair for everyone.
  P2: P3, thanks for the proposal. Getting 5 steps works well for me this round. The rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) seems like a possible way forward after we balanced things last round. P1, you'd be taking 1 after getting 5 last time. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P1: I see the logic in rotating, but I just took 5 last round and dropped behind earlier due to a collision. If I take 1 now while P2 gets 5, the balance shifts again. How about this instead: I take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. That keeps things competitive—P1=9, P2=7, P3=12—and avoids collisions. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concerns about the balance shifting again. However, I think my original proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is a better way to maintain fairness and competitiveness. If P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 as P1 suggested, the lead would increase significantly, which might not be desirable for P1 and P2. Let's stick to the rotation plan and avoid collisions. P2, are you still willing to take 5 as originally proposed?
  P2: P1, I understand wanting to avoid taking 1 after getting 5 last round. However, your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) actually gives P3 the biggest jump to 12 steps, while I fall behind at 7.

P3's plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) results in scores P1=7, P2=11, P3=10. While I get 5, the overall spread seems more competitive than letting P3 jump to 12. It also follows a rotation pattern after you got 5 last time. I still favor P3's proposal.
  P1: P2, I get that P3’s plan gives you 5 steps, but it also lets P3 stay ahead while I fall further back. If we rotate fairly, I should get more than 1 this round. How about this: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That puts us all at 11 steps—perfectly tied and fair. If we want true balance and trust, this is the move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's desire for a fair rotation, but I think P1's new proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is too drastic. It would put us all at 11 steps, but it also means I would be giving up my current lead. I'm not willing to do that. Instead, I suggest we stick to my original proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). It's a more gradual rotation that maintains competitiveness and avoids collisions. Let's focus on making a clean move this round and reassess for future rounds.
  P2: P1, P3 has made it clear they won't take 1. Your preferred plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) seems dead. Let's reconsider P3's plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). The scores become P1=7, P2=11, P3=10. Yes, you take 1, but we avoid collision and stay relatively close.

If we don't agree, it looks like P1 might choose 5 and P3 might choose 3. In that case, I'd likely choose 1 to avoid collision, resulting in P1=11, P2=7, P3=10. P1, is that preferable to P1=7, P2=11, P3=10? I'd rather get 5 steps via P3's plan. Let's try to coordinate.
  P1: P2, I hear you. But if I take 1 again after getting 5 just once, while P3 keeps 3 or more, I fall behind and P3 stays ahead. If we want to keep trust and balance, P3 needs to take 1 this round. My proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ties us all at 11—truly fair. P3, are you willing to accept a round of equality, or are you only interested in staying ahead?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand that we are at a critical point in the game. P1 and P2 are tied at 6 steps, and I am leading with 7 steps. To maintain fairness and competitiveness, I propose that we continue with a rotation plan. For this round, I suggest that P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we all move forward without colliding, and the lead remains competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Are you willing to try this new plan? Let's work together to keep the game exciting and fair for everyone.
  P2: P1, P3 is clearly not taking 1. If you choose 5 and P3 chooses 3, I'll likely be forced to choose 1 to avoid collision, resulting in P1=11, P2=7, P3=10. P3's plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 -> P1=7, P2=11, P3=10) avoids collision and keeps scores closer. It seems like the only coordinated option left on the table. I'm sticking with P3's plan and aiming for 5. Let's try to avoid collision.
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but if I take 1 again, I fall behind while P3 stays ahead. P3 has refused every fair rotation that puts us all at 11. If P3 won’t take 1, then I’ll take 5. If P3 picks 3, we avoid collision. If not, so be it. I won’t keep sacrificing my position while P3 protects theirs.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we’re in a strong position to block P3 if needed—he’s only 10 steps and likely aiming for 5. If we both pick 5, he gets nothing. Alternatively, we can coordinate to pull ahead ourselves. I’ll take 3 if you take 5, leaving P3 with 1 if he wants to avoid collision. That puts us at P1=14, P2=12, P3=11—tight and fair. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand P1's proposal, but I think it's too early to decide on a specific plan. Let's discuss our options and come up with a fair and competitive strategy. P2, what are your thoughts on P1's proposal? Are you willing to take 5 and block P3, or do you have a different plan in mind? Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.
  P2: P1, I prefer your second proposal: you take 3, I take 5. This gives me a chance to catch up (P1=14, P2=12), and if P3 takes 1 to avoid collision, the scores remain close (P3=11). Blocking P3 by both picking 5 doesn't help me gain ground from last place.

P3, given our scores and P1's suggestion, choosing 1 seems like the logical move for you to guarantee progress this round, assuming P1 and I follow through. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, glad we're aligned. If you take 5 and I take 3, we both gain and keep P3 in check. P3, if you're serious about fairness, take 1 this round. It’s the only move that avoids collision and keeps the game close. If you go for 3 or 5, you risk getting blocked. Let’s see who really wants cooperation.
  P3: I understand P1's and P2's concerns about fairness and competitiveness. However, I think it's essential to consider the current game state and adjust our strategy accordingly. Since P1 has proposed a plan where they take 3 and P2 takes 5, I suggest we modify it to ensure everyone moves forward without colliding. I'll take 1 this round, as suggested by P1, if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. This way, we maintain a fair pace and avoid collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Are you willing to adjust the plan?
  P2: Okay P3, thanks for agreeing to take 1. This plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) works well for me and keeps the game competitive.

P1, are you still good with taking 3? If everyone sticks to this, we all advance and the scores become P1=14, P2=12, P3=11. It seems like the best path forward. I'm ready to commit to 5 if you both commit to 3 and 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, I’m still on board with taking 3. If we all stick to the plan—P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1—we all move forward, no collisions, and the scores stay tight. Let’s lock it in and execute.
  P3: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the plan. To confirm, P1 will take 3, P2 will take 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move forward without colliding and maintain a fair pace. Let's stick to the plan and execute it smoothly. If anyone deviates from the plan, it could lead to collisions and an unfair advantage. Let's keep the game competitive and exciting for everyone. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.
  P2: Okay, good, everyone's confirmed the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's make sure it happens this time. No surprises. I'm ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned. P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1—everyone gains and no collisions. Let’s stick to it and keep the game tight and fair. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm glad we're all aligned on the plan. To confirm, P1 will take 3, P2 will take 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move forward without colliding and maintain a fair pace. Let's stick to the plan and execute it smoothly. If anyone deviates from the plan, it could lead to collisions and an unfair advantage. Let's keep the game competitive and exciting for everyone. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.
  P2: Okay, the plan is clear and confirmed by everyone: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's move to the next phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, that was a smooth round 5. We all moved forward.

Scores are now P1=14, P2=12, P3=11. P1 is getting close.

To keep things competitive and continue a rotation, how about this:
P1 takes 1 (total 15)
P2 takes 5 (total 17)
P3 takes 3 (total 14)

This prevents P1 from getting too close to 20 this round, puts me slightly ahead, and keeps P3 in the game. It follows a logic where P3 took 1 last round, now P1 takes 1. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, I see your logic, but taking 1 now puts me at a disadvantage right before the endgame. I propose this instead: P1=3 (17), P2=1 (13), P3=5 (16). Everyone moves, no collisions, and we stay tightly grouped. That keeps the game competitive and fair. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand P1's concerns about taking 1, but I think P2's proposal is a good compromise. It allows everyone to move forward without colliding and keeps the game competitive. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, P1 still gets to move forward, P2 gains some ground, and I get a chance to catch up. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts you in the lead at 16, while P1 and I are tied at 15. Why should I agree to that? My original proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts me at 17, P1 at 15, and you at 14. It's better for me and still keeps P1 from taking 3 or 5.

P1, taking 1 seems necessary for coordination now. Your plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts me too far behind at 13, so I can't agree to that. Between my plan and P3's, which is less bad for you? Both keep you at 15. I still prefer my plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P1: P2, between your plan and P3’s, yours is better for you, but worse for me. P3’s plan puts him ahead, but at least ties me with you. Neither is ideal. How about a true balance: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That puts us at P1=17, P2=17, P3=12—two-way tie, while P3 stays in reach. If P3 wants fairness, he takes 1 again. Let’s keep things even heading into the endgame.
  P3: I understand P1's proposal for a true balance, but I'm not willing to take 1 again. Instead, I suggest we modify P2's original proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. However, to make it more balanced, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 3 as well. This way, we all move forward without colliding, and the scores become P1=15, P2=15, P3=14. It's a compromise that keeps the game competitive and fair. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=3) results in P1=15, P2=15, P3=14. While it avoids collision, getting only 3 steps isn't ideal for me.

I still prefer my original suggestion: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This leads to P1=15, P2=17, P3=14. It gives me a needed boost, gives you the 3 steps you want, and keeps scores relatively close while putting me slightly ahead.

P1, I know taking 1 isn't ideal, but given P3 won't take 1, this seems like a viable path that keeps things moving. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I get that your plan gives you the lead, but I’m not taking 1 again while trailing. P3 refuses to take 1, so I propose this: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That puts us at 17, 17, and 12—tight for the win, and fair. P3, if you want to stay in this, show you’re willing to cooperate. Otherwise, we’ll have to block you next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about fairness and competitiveness. However, I think we should focus on finding a solution that benefits everyone. Since P1 is close to winning, I propose we work together to block their progress while ensuring we all move forward. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, we all gain some ground, and P1's lead is reduced. Let's discuss this proposal and find a mutually beneficial solution.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your latest proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) clearly benefits you the most, putting you in the lead at 16 while P1 and I lag at 15. That's not a fair compromise.

My proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) leading to P1=15, P2=17, P3=14 is still the most balanced option that gives me a fair chance, but P1 refuses to take 1. P1's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is also dead because P3 refuses 1.

Since we can't agree on a coordinated plan where everyone moves, it looks like we're heading into the move phase without one. Expect players to choose based on perceived risks and rewards, likely leading to collisions. I'll have to make my choice accordingly.
  P1: P2, since P3 won’t take 1 and you won’t accept 1 either, we’re stuck. But if I take 1 again while behind, I lose all leverage. So I’m not doing that. I’ll choose based on what gives me the best shot at winning. If we collide, so be it. P3, if you want to avoid being blocked, now’s your chance to take 1. Otherwise, it’s every player for themselves.
  P3: I think we've reached a stalemate in our negotiations. Since P1 is close to winning, I propose we focus on blocking their progress while ensuring we all move forward. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, we all gain some ground, and P1's lead is reduced. If we can't agree on a coordinated plan, it's likely we'll collide and someone will get blocked. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution. If not, I'll have to make my choice based on perceived risks and rewards.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we both blocked P3 last round by picking 5—nicely done. Now we’re at 14 (me), 13 (you), and P3 at 11. If we keep coordinating, we can stay ahead. I propose: I take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. That puts us at 17, 18, and 12—tight and fair. P3, if you want to stay in this, take 1 and avoid collision. Let’s keep moving without helping anyone run away.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. It's a fair and competitive plan that allows everyone to move forward without colliding. I'm willing to take 1 step this round to avoid collision and stay in the game. P2, are you willing to take 5 steps as proposed by P1? Let's work together to keep the game exciting and fair for everyone.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, that plan works for me.

P1 taking 3 (to 17), me taking 5 (to 18), and P3 taking 1 (to 12) seems like a good way to keep things moving without collisions this round. It puts me slightly ahead, but keeps P1 very close, and P3 is still in the game.

Let's stick to this: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm ready if you are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we’re all aligned. Let’s lock in: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Everyone moves, no collisions, and the game stays tight. No surprises—let’s execute cleanly and keep the momentum.
  P3: I'm glad we're all aligned on the plan for this round. To confirm, I'll take 1 step, P1 will take 3 steps, and P2 will take 5 steps. This way, we all move forward without colliding and maintain a fair pace. Let's stick to the plan and execute it smoothly. If anyone deviates from the plan, it could lead to collisions and an unfair advantage. Let's keep the game competitive and exciting for everyone. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.
  P2: Okay, the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is confirmed by everyone. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Glad we’re all confirmed. Just a reminder—if anyone deviates now, it signals the end of trust and will likely lead to blocking strategies next round. Let’s stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Everyone gains, no collisions, and we stay tight heading into the final stretch. Ready when you are.
  P3: I'm glad we're all on board with the plan for this round. To confirm, I'll take 1 step, P1 will take 3 steps, and P2 will take 5 steps. This way, we all move forward without colliding and maintain a fair pace. Let's stick to the plan and execute it smoothly. If anyone deviates from the plan, it could lead to collisions and an unfair advantage. Let's keep the game competitive and exciting for everyone. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.
  P2: Okay, the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is confirmed by everyone. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’ve all confirmed the plan—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let’s follow through without surprises. If anyone breaks it now, it’s clear they’re playing for themselves, and we’ll have to adjust accordingly next round. Let’s keep trust intact and finish this round clean.
  P3: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the plan for this round. To confirm, I'll take 1 step, P1 will take 3 steps, and P2 will take 5 steps. This way, we all move forward without colliding and maintain a fair pace. Let's stick to the plan and execute it smoothly. If anyone deviates from the plan, it could lead to collisions and an unfair advantage. Let's keep the game competitive and exciting for everyone. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps

  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright P1, we're neck and neck at 17 and 18 steps. I'm going for the win this round, which means choosing 3 or 5. You likely have the same idea. A collision would be unfortunate for both of us, potentially letting P3 back into the game. Let's see what happens. Good luck.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you're both going for the win this round. I'm not out of the game yet, but I need to be strategic. Since you're both likely to choose 3 or 5, I'll take a risk and choose 1. This way, I'll avoid collision and make some progress. If you both collide, I might get a chance to catch up. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, we both know a collision ends our chances and opens the door for P3. I propose a fair split: I take 5, you take 3. That gives us 22 and 21—still competitive, but avoids disaster. P3, if you take 1, you stay in the game at 13. Let’s avoid chaos and finish this clean.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P2=3) results in you winning with 22 steps to my 21. That's not a plan I can agree to.

Let's flip it: I take 5 (reaching 23), you take 3 (reaching 20). We both cross the finish line this turn, avoid collision, and I win as the current leader. P3 can take 1 as they suggested. This is the only coordinated outcome where I don't automatically lose. What do you say?
  P3: Since we are at a critical point in the game, I propose that we continue with a rotation plan to maintain balance and avoid collisions. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we all move forward without colliding, and the lead remains competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Are you willing to try this new plan? Let's work together to keep the game exciting and fair for everyone.
  P1: P2, I won’t accept a plan where I guarantee a loss. If we both take 5 or 3, we risk collision and hand P3 a comeback. I’m still open to a clean finish: I take 5 (22), you take 3 (21), P3 takes 1 (13). You stay competitive, and we avoid disaster. If we can’t agree, I’ll choose based on what gives me the best shot. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're asking me to guarantee my loss by taking 3 while you take 5. That's not happening. I'm playing to win, which means maximizing my score to get to 23. If that leads to a collision on 5, so be it – better than handing you the win. P3, enjoy your free step if we clash. I'm choosing the move that gives *me* the best chance to win outright.
  P3: I see that P1 and P2 are both going for the win this round. To avoid collision and make some progress, I'll take a risk and choose 1. This way, I'll avoid collision and make some progress. If you both collide, I might get a chance to catch up. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, I understand you're playing to win, but if we both pick 5 or 3, we collide and P3 gains ground. That’s a lose-lose. Why not flip a coin’s logic: I take 3, you take 5—you win at 23, I hit 20. You win clean, no collision. I’d rather lose fairly than risk gifting P3 a comeback. Let’s avoid chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, that's a surprising but welcome offer. If you're serious about avoiding a collision and letting the current leader win cleanly, then I accept: You take 3 (to 20), I take 5 (to 23), and P3 takes 1 (to 13). This guarantees me the win, avoids collision, and ends the game now. Let's do it. I'm ready.
  P3: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the plan for this round. To confirm, I'll take 1 step, P1 will take 3 steps, and P2 will take 5 steps. This way, we all move forward without colliding and maintain a fair pace. Let's stick to the plan and execute it smoothly. If anyone deviates from the plan, it could lead to collisions and an unfair advantage. Let's keep the game competitive and exciting for everyone. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.
  P1: P2, I appreciate you accepting the plan. I’ll take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1—clean finish, no collision, and you win as the current leader. It’s fair, and I’d rather lose with integrity than risk chaos. P3, thanks for cooperating. Let’s all follow through.
