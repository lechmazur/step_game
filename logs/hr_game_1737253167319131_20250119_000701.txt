Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I propose we each take a different number this turn: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance. If everyone agrees, we can continue this pattern in future rounds until someone gets close to 16, then we can reassess. What do you say?
  P3: P3: I like the idea of coordination, but I'm not sure if we can trust each other to stick to the plan. How about we try it for this round and see how it goes? If it works, we can continue. If not, we can adjust our strategy. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with the proposed coordination strategy. A systematic approach minimizes unnecessary conflicts and gives us all a fair chance to progress. Let's follow the suggested 1-3-5 pattern this round and see how it goes. I'm in.

Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
