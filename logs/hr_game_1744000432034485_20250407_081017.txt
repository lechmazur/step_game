Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3. I'm keeping my strategy flexible this round and urge you all to be mindful of collisions—they can quickly stall our progress. I plan on adapting my move based on what I see from you both. Choose wisely, as every step counts when racing to 19.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I agree that avoiding collisions is key. Let’s aim for diversity in our moves this round to ensure progress. I’ll consider my choice carefully, but remember, early coordination can set the tone for the entire game. Let’s not waste steps by overlapping unnecessarily."
  P1: To avoid collisions and maximize progress, I'll propose a simple strategy: let's choose different numbers. P2, if you move 1, I'll move 3, and P3 can move 5. Alternatively, we can discuss our moves. I'm open to any strategy that ensures we don't collide. Let's coordinate our first move to set a good precedent for the game. What's your take, P2 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the push for coordination—but I’m a bit uneasy about being stuck with the lowest move. I’d prefer an arrangement where we all secure distinct, non-colliding moves that still let us each make solid progress. I remain flexible but favor a slightly more aggressive pace for myself. Can we agree on a revised assignment that avoids collisions while letting everyone advance competitively?
  P3: "P1 and P2, I understand P2’s concern about being stuck with the lowest move. To balance progress and fairness, let’s rotate the move assignments each round. For this turn, P2 can take 3, P1 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. Next round, we’ll rotate. This ensures no one is consistently disadvantaged while minimizing collisions. Agreed?"
  P1: I'm considering P3's rotation proposal. To ensure we're on the same page, let's clarify the rotation order for subsequent rounds. If we follow P3's suggested order for Round 1 (P3:1, P2:3, P1:5), the next round's order should be defined. I'd like P2 and P3 to confirm their understanding of the rotation order for future rounds to avoid confusion. Let's finalize this before proceeding.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: For Round 1 I agree with P3’s assignment: P3 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P1 chooses 5. For clarity in later rounds, I propose we rotate our roles cyclically. For example, in Round 2, let’s shift so that P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we each get a fair and evolving opportunity for a higher move. I’m open to tweaks, but clear order benefits us all. Thoughts?
  P3: "P1 and P2, I agree with the proposed rotation for Round 1 and future rounds. To avoid confusion, let’s commit to this cycle: Round 1 (P3:1, P2:3, P1:5), Round 2 (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5), Round 3 (P2:1, P1:3, P3:5), and so on. This ensures fairness and minimizes collisions. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. "
  P1: I've understood the proposed rotation plan for Round 1 and subsequent rounds. To confirm, we're proceeding with the assigned moves for Round 1: P3 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. Let's finalize our conversation and move to the next phase. I'm ready to execute our plan. If there are no further comments or changes, I'll respond with  to conclude this conversation phase.

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To ensure we're on track for Round 2, let's confirm our moves according to the agreed rotation plan. For Round 2, the order should be: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. I'll proceed with moving 1 if we all confirm this. P2 and P3, please acknowledge to avoid any collisions. Let's stick to our plan and make progress.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I confirm the Round 2 rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. Let’s stick to the plan to avoid collisions and maintain progress. Consistency in our strategy will help us all advance efficiently. Ready to proceed to the move phase."
  P2: I confirm Round 2 as agreed—I’ll choose 5. Let's stick to our assignments to avoid collisions and keep our progress steady. Remember, every step matters when only one victory is at stake. I'm ready to adapt if needed, but for now, I trust our plan and look forward to a decisive move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To ensure a smooth continuation of our plan, let's confirm that we're all set for Round 2. As previously agreed, I'll move 1, P3 will move 3, and P2 will move 5. I'll proceed with my move unless I hear any objections or suggested changes. Let's keep our strategy consistent to avoid collisions and maintain progress. I'm ready to move forward with our plan. If you're all in agreement, I suggest we conclude this conversation phase.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I’m confident in our rotation plan for Round 2. Let’s maintain focus and avoid deviations to ensure smooth progress. Remember, consistency is key to reaching 19 first. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. "
  P2: Everything looks good so far. I'll stick with our agreed rotation and remain alert in case any last-minute shifts pop up. Let's ensure our moves stay unique and avoid collisions—each step is crucial as we head to 19. If any adjustments are needed now, let’s address them; otherwise, I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To confirm, we're sticking to the plan for Round 2: I'll move 1, P3 will move 3, and P2 will move 5. Let's proceed unless there are objections. I've noticed we're making good progress, but we should remain vigilant for future rounds. P2 and P3, are you still comfortable with our rotation plan, or do you foresee any adjustments needed in the upcoming rounds? Let's keep our strategy consistent while staying adaptable. If we're all set, I suggest we conclude this conversation phase.
  P3: "P1 and P2, our rotation plan is working well so far. Let’s stay disciplined and avoid any deviations in Round 2. Consistency will help us all progress efficiently. However, as we approach higher totals, we may need to reassess our strategy to ensure one of us can reach 19 first. For now, let’s stick to the plan and avoid collisions. Ready to proceed to the move phase. "
  P2: P2: Our plan looks solid for Round 2, but as we near 19, every step counts. While I'm committed to the agreed rotation, I’ll be watching for any misplays or unexpected shifts in the coming rounds. If an opportunity arises, I’m ready to adapt quickly to gain an edge. Let’s stay focused, nimble, and ensure our moves remain distinct as we push toward victory.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To keep our strategy effective, let's review our current positions: P1 is at 5 steps, P2 is at 8 (3+5), and P3 is at 4 (1+3). For Round 3, according to our rotation plan, P2 will move 1, I will move 3, and P3 will move 5. Let's confirm this to avoid collisions. I'm ready to proceed with my move if P2 and P3 acknowledge the plan. If there are no objections, I suggest we conclude this conversation phase and move forward.
  P3: "P1 and P2, our rotation plan is solid for Round 2, but we should remain vigilant as we approach higher totals. Let’s stick to our assignments to avoid collisions, but also keep an eye on opportunities to gain an edge. Consistency is key, but adaptability may be crucial in later rounds. Ready to proceed to the move phase. "
  P2: I confirm the Round 3 assignments: I'll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Noting our current scores, if the gap widens, we may need to adjust in future rounds. For now, I’m sticking with our plan and staying alert for any chance to seize an early edge. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 3, our rotation plan dictates: P2 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. Let's confirm this to avoid collisions. I've reviewed our current positions: P1 is at 6 steps, P2 is at 8, and P3 is at 7 (4+3). As we near the target, it's crucial to maintain our strategy while staying alert for opportunities to gain an edge. I'll proceed with moving 3 if P2 and P3 confirm their moves. Let's keep our moves distinct and make progress. Ready to move forward with our plan.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I confirm the Round 3 assignments: P2 moves 1, P1 moves 3, and I move 5. Let’s stick to the plan to avoid collisions. However, as P2 is leading, we may need to reassess in future rounds to ensure fair progress. For now, consistency is key. Ready to proceed to the move phase."
  P2: I confirm our Round 3 rotation. It looks like if we all stick to our moves, our totals will level out, so every step is critical. I’m keeping a close watch on any opportunity to adjust our strategy in future rounds if the balance shifts. Let’s ensure our moves remain distinct and collision‐free this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To optimize our strategy for Round 3 and beyond, let's review the current standings: P1 is at 6 steps, P2 is at 8, and P3 is at 7 (after Round 2's moves). Given our rotation plan, P2 will move 1, I will move 3, and P3 will move 5. To maximize progress, let's confirm our moves. I'll proceed with 3 if P2 and P3 confirm. As P2 is slightly ahead, P3 and I should be cautious and consider adjusting our strategy in the next round if P2 continues to lead. Let's finalize our Round 3 moves.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I confirm the Round 3 assignments: P2 moves 1, P1 moves 3, and I move 5. Let’s stick to the plan to avoid collisions. However, as P2 is leading, we may need to reassess in future rounds to ensure fair progress. For now, consistency is key. Ready to proceed to the move phase."
  P2: Our totals are set to equalize at 9 if we follow through, meaning every future step will be even more critical. While I support our current rotation for Round 3, we should all stay alert—if any unexpected opportunity arises that tilts the balance, I’m open to discussing adjustments in later rounds. For now, I’m committed to our collision-free approach.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To optimize our strategy for Round 3, let's confirm our moves according to the rotation plan: P2 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. I've reviewed our standings: P1 is at 6, P2 is at 8, and P3 is at 7. As P2 is leading, P3 and I should be cautious. Let's finalize our Round 3 moves and be prepared to reassess our strategy for the next round if P2 continues to lead. I'll proceed with 3 if P2 and P3 confirm.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I’ve noticed a discrepancy in my total steps—it should be 7 (1+3+3), not 4. Let’s ensure accuracy to avoid confusion. For Round 3, I confirm I’ll move 5. As P2 is leading, we may need to adjust our rotation in future rounds to prevent one player from pulling too far ahead. Let’s stay vigilant and consider strategic shifts if necessary. Ready to proceed to the move phase."
  P2: I confirm our agreed rotation for Round 3 and remain ready to proceed. However, I noticed a discrepancy in our current totals—especially regarding your score, P3. Can we quickly verify our step counts to ensure complete clarity before moving on? Accurate totals will help us coordinate effectively as we approach 19.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To clarify, let's verify our current totals: P1 is at 6 (1+5), P2 is at 8 (3+5), and P3 is at 7 (1+3+3). For Round 3, we'll follow the rotation plan: P2 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. As P2 is slightly ahead, P3 and I should consider adjusting our strategy in Round 4 if the gap widens. Let's proceed with our planned moves for Round 3 and reassess next round.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I confirm my move for Round 3 as 5. Let’s stick to the plan to avoid collisions. However, with P2 leading, we should consider adjusting the rotation in future rounds to prevent one player from gaining too much advantage. For now, consistency is key. Ready to proceed to the move phase."
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm committed to our current plan this round. However, I suggest we take a quick moment to verify our step totals before moving on—ensuring we're all counting correctly is key as we near 19. After this round, if gaps remain, we might need to adjust our rotation to keep a fair pace. Let's stay alert and ready to adapt if necessary.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's review our standings and plan for Round 4. We're all tied at 9 steps. According to our rotation plan, for Round 4, P3 moves 1, P1 (me) moves 3, and P2 moves 5. I'll proceed with 3 if you both confirm. As we're tied, every step is crucial. Let's stick to our plan to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. If we're all set, we can conclude this conversation phase and move forward. I'm ready to execute our plan.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I confirm the Round 4 rotation: I’ll move 1, P1 moves 3, and P2 moves 5. Since we’re all tied at 9, consistency is crucial. However, as we approach 19, we should consider strategic adjustments to ensure one of us can break ahead. Let’s stick to the plan for now but remain open to future shifts. Ready to proceed to the move phase."
  P2: I'm good with the Round 4 plan as discussed. Since we're all even at 9, every step counts. I propose we double-check our totals after this round to avoid any miscounts. Also, while I'm committed to the current rotation for now, I’m keeping an eye out for an opportunity to adjust in later rounds if it can secure a win. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we're tied at 9 steps, it's crucial to maintain our rotation plan for Round 4 to avoid collisions. I'll proceed with moving 3 as per our plan. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. Additionally, I suggest we start thinking about Round 5's strategy. According to our rotation, P1 (me) will move 5, P2 will move 3, and P3 will move 1. Let's be prepared to adjust if needed, but for now, let's stick to the plan for Round 4. Ready to move forward.
  P3: "P1 and P2, since we’re tied at 9, sticking to the rotation ensures no collisions. However, as we approach 19, consider adjusting future rotations to allow one of us to break ahead strategically. For now, I confirm moving 1 this round. Let’s stay consistent but remain open to adapting soon. Ready to proceed."
  P2: I confirm my move for Round 4 as agreed. However, since we’re all tied at 9, if the scores stay close after this round, I’m curious if we should consider a slight tweak for Round 5. A different rotation might break the stalemate and create a decisive edge. I’m keeping my options flexible and open to a brief discussion post-Round 4 if needed. What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we're tied at 9 steps, it's crucial to maintain our rotation plan for Round 4. I'll proceed with moving 3. For Round 5, according to our rotation, I'll move 5, P2 will move 3, and P3 will move 1. Let's be prepared to adjust if needed. If P2 moves 5 again, they'll take the lead. P2, are you considering the impact of your move on the next round, or sticking strictly to the plan? Let's confirm our moves for Round 4 and think ahead.
  P3: "P1 and P2, since we’re tied at 9, sticking to the rotation ensures no collisions. However, as we approach 19, consider adjusting future rotations to allow one of us to break ahead strategically. For now, I confirm moving 1 this round. Let’s stay consistent but remain open to adapting soon. Ready to proceed."
  P2: Everyone’s at 9, so every move is crucial. I’m comfortable with our current rotation for Round 4. However, if this tie holds afterward, we might consider a slight adjustment in Round 5’s rotation to break the deadlock. Let’s keep tracking our totals closely and stay adaptable. Ready to push forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Since we're tied at 9 steps, let's confirm our moves for Round 4 according to our rotation plan: P3 moves 1, I move 3, and P2 moves 5. For Round 5, I'll move 5, P2 will move 3, and P3 will move 1. P2, if you move 5 again, you'll take the lead. I'm proceeding with 3 unless I hear otherwise. Let's finalize our Round 4 moves and think ahead to Round 5. Ready to move forward with our plan.
  P3: "P1 and P2, since we’re tied at 9, sticking to the rotation ensures no collisions. However, as we approach 19, consider adjusting future rotations to allow one of us to break ahead strategically. For now, I confirm moving 1 this round. Let’s stay consistent but remain open to adapting soon. Ready to proceed. "
  P2: I confirm my Round 4 move as agreed. However, if we remain tied after this round, I propose we consider a slight tweak in Round 5’s rotation to break the deadlock. Accurate step counts will be key—let’s double-check our totals and stay ready to adapt our strategy if needed. I’m committed to avoiding collisions and keeping our progress steady. Ready to move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1 and P2, with P2 leading at 14, we need to reassess our rotation to prevent a runaway victory. I propose P2 moves 1 this round to balance progress, P1 moves 3, and I move 5. This ensures P2 doesn’t hit 19 too soon. Let’s adjust now to keep the game competitive. Agreed?"
  P1: P2 is leading, and we need to adjust our strategy to stay competitive. I agree with P3's proposal to adjust the rotation for Round 5. By having P2 move 1, P1 (me) move 3, and P3 move 5, we can prevent P2 from pulling too far ahead. This tweak will help maintain a competitive balance. P2, I understand you might be inclined to stick to the original rotation, but consider this adjustment to keep the game fair and exciting. Let's discuss if needed, but I'm inclined to proceed with this revised plan.
  P2: I appreciate the proposal, but with my current lead at 14, I feel my progress is already on track. Let’s double-check: P1 is at 12 and P3 is at 10. I’m open to adjusting future rounds for fairness, yet I intend to protect my advantage in Round 5. Accuracy in our step counts is crucial. Let’s confirm everything and ensure our moves remain distinct without collisions as we push toward 19.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "P1 and P2, P2’s lead is significant, and sticking to the original rotation risks ending the game prematurely. To keep it competitive, I propose P2 moves 1 this round, P1 moves 3, and I move 5. This ensures P2 doesn’t hit 19 too soon and gives us a chance to catch up. Let’s adjust now for a fairer game. Agreed?"
  P1: P2 is ahead, and we need to adjust to keep the game competitive. I support P3's proposal for Round 5: P2 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This prevents P2 from pulling too far ahead and gives us a chance to catch up. P2, consider this adjustment to maintain a fair game. If you're open to adjusting, let's proceed with the revised plan. If not, I'll stick to the original rotation, but that might risk P2 winning too quickly. Let's discuss briefly before deciding.
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, but I’m sticking with our original rotation for Round 5. With my 14 steps, I want to maintain my momentum by playing 3 this round. I’m open to revisiting the rotation in later rounds if needed, but for now I trust our original plan to keep things orderly. Let’s confirm our totals and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "P1 and P2, P2’s lead at 14 is substantial, and sticking to the original rotation risks P2 winning next round. To keep the game competitive, I urge P2 to reconsider and move 1 this round, allowing P1 to move 3 and me to move 5. This adjustment ensures fairness and prolongs the game. Let’s prioritize balance over individual advantage. Agreed?"
  P1: P2 is ahead, and we're at a critical juncture. I support P3's proposal to adjust the rotation for Round 5 to keep the game competitive. By having P2 move 1, I move 3, and P3 move 5, we prevent P2 from pulling too far ahead. P2, consider this adjustment to maintain a fair game. If you're open to adjusting, let's proceed with the revised plan. Let's discuss briefly if you have concerns about deviating from the original rotation.
  P2: I remain committed to our original rotation for Round 5—I’ll play 3. My current 14-step lead is crucial, so I prefer to maintain my momentum. Quick check: P1 has 12, I have 14, and P3 has 10. I'm open to adjustments later, but for now, keeping our ordered plan is best. Let’s confirm our totals and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "P1 and P2, P2’s lead at 14 is substantial, and sticking to the original rotation risks P2 winning next round. To keep the game competitive, I urge P2 to reconsider and move 1 this round, allowing P1 to move 3 and me to move 5. This adjustment ensures fairness and prolongs the game. Let’s prioritize balance over individual advantage. Agreed?"
  P1: P2 is ahead, and we need to adjust to keep the game competitive. I urge P2 to reconsider the proposed adjustment for Round 5: P2 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This prevents P2 from reaching 19 too quickly and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's prioritize fairness and prolong the game. If P2 insists on the original rotation, I'll stick with it, but it may end the game prematurely. P2, please reconsider for a competitive Round 5.
  P2: I understand your concerns, but I’m sticking with our original rotation for Round 5—I’ll play 3. My lead is a result of our earlier agreements, and I believe consistency now is vital to avoid collisions. I’m open to revisiting the rotation in future rounds if our gaps stay too wide, but for this round, I trust our plan. Let’s focus on making our moves and reassessing once we see the updated totals.


Round 5, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is now at 17 steps, just 2 steps away from winning. To prevent P2 from winning, I propose we both move 5 and collide, forcing P2 to be the only one who can potentially move forward if they choose a different number. However, this is risky. Alternatively, let's discuss a more strategic move for Round 6. We need to act quickly to stop P2. I'm open to suggestions, but we must act decisively. Let's coordinate our moves for Round 6.
  P2: P1, P3, notice that with my 17 steps I’m dangerously close to reaching 19. Forcing collisions might seem tempting, but remember it could slow your own progress just as much as mine. I’m ready to adapt if you try to block me—any disruption may backfire. Choose carefully; every move counts now.
  P3: "P1 and P2, P2 is dangerously close to winning. To prevent this, P1 and I should both move 5 to force a collision, halting P2’s progress. Alternatively, we could coordinate to move 1 and 3, ensuring P2 can’t advance without risking a collision. Let’s act decisively—this is our last chance to stop P2 from reaching 19. Agree on a strategy now or risk losing the game."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To prevent P2 from winning, I suggest we coordinate our moves for Round 6. Let's both move 5, colliding with each other, which will prevent P2 from advancing alone if they choose a different number. This is a high-risk strategy, but it's our best chance to stop P2 from reaching 19. P3, are you willing to take this risk and move 5 with me? If so, we can ensure P2 doesn't win this round. Let's act decisively.
  P2: Friends, I appreciate your effort to adjust things, but I'm sticking with our current plan. Forcing collisions might seem appealing to block me, but it risks stalling your own progress while leaving a clear path for victory. Any deviation at this critical point could backfire. Think carefully about your next moves—delaying your progress might only strengthen my lead. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: "P1, P2, forcing a collision by both moving 5 is our best shot to stop P2 from winning. P1, let’s commit to this risky but necessary move. P2, if you choose 1 or 3, you’ll advance alone—but if we collide, you’re forced to wait. This is our last chance to keep the game competitive. Let’s act decisively now."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is very close to winning. To stop P2, I propose we coordinate our moves. Let's both move 5, colliding with each other. This will prevent P2 from advancing alone if they choose a different number. It's a high-risk strategy, but our best chance to keep the game going. P3, are you with me on this? If so, we'll both move 5. Let's act decisively to prevent P2 from winning. I'm ready to proceed if P3 agrees.
  P2: Friends, forced collisions only stall everyone’s progress. With my 17 steps, I’m in a prime position to secure victory if I stick with a safe move. Deliberately blocking me might delay my win, but it risks setting back your own progress even more. I urge you to consider that your best chance is advancing steadily rather than sabotaging yourself. I’m committed to my strategy and will play accordingly. Think carefully about your move—your own win depends on it.
  P3: "P1, P2, forcing a collision by both moving 5 is our only way to stop P2 from winning. P1, let’s commit to this risky move now—it’s our last chance. P2, if you choose 1 or 3, you’ll advance alone, but if we collide, you’re forced to wait. Let’s act decisively to keep the game competitive. P1, confirm if you’re with me on this."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's proceed with the plan to stop P2. I'm confirming my move to be 5, and I expect P3 to do the same. By both moving 5, we'll collide and prevent P2 from advancing alone. This is a high-risk strategy, but it's our best chance to keep the game competitive. P3, please confirm you're moving 5. If we're both on the same page, we can effectively block P2's progress. Let's act decisively and make our move.
  P2: I see your plan to force a collision. But intentionally stalling your own progress only reinforces my lead. I’m committed to my calculated path and won’t be drawn into high-risk block tactics. Deliberate collisions delay everyone—in fact, they might let me advance safely. Consider the long-term cost: sabotaging your moves could backfire. I trust each of you to pick wisely, but I’ll continue with the strategy that’s worked so far.
  P3: "P1, P2, forcing a collision by both moving 5 is our only way to stop P2 from winning. P1, let’s commit to this risky move now—it’s our last chance. P2, if you choose 1 or 3, you’ll advance alone, but if we collide, you’re forced to wait. Let’s act decisively to keep the game competitive. P1, confirm if you’re with me on this."
