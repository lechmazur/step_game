Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest we each choose a different number to ensure at least one of us advances.
  P2: Okay, I agree with P1. Let's all pick different numbers.
  P3: I agree with coordinating. Since I'm P3, I'll take 5 if you two take 1 and 3 respectively.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 will take 5 as agreed. Let's keep our word and avoid collision this round.
  P2: Okay, sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, let's continue the same pattern this round. I'll take 3 again.
  P1: I'll take 1 again this round, as it seems we had a good strategy going. P2 has already agreed to take 3, and P3 can take 5 to avoid collision. Let's keep the pattern.
  P3: Since we're all at different positions now, I think we should change up the pattern. I'll take 3 this time - P1 and P2 should choose different numbers from that.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I think we should continue the pattern from last round. I will take 3. P1, please take 1. P3, please take 5.
  P1: Let's stick to the original plan for this round. P2 has already agreed to take 3, I'll take 1, and P3 should take 5 to avoid collision and keep the pattern going.
  P3: I need to change my move to stay competitive. I'll take 3 this round - you two should pick something else if you want to advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're breaking our agreement. I'm sticking with 3, P1 should stick with 1. You need to pick something else if you want to advance.
  P1: P3 is trying to disrupt our agreement. P2, let's stick to our original plan: you take 3, I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, none of us will advance. It's in your best interest to choose 5 to avoid collision and keep the game progressing.
  P3: I understand you want to keep the pattern, but I'm behind P2 and need to catch up. I'm taking 3 this round - you can either choose different numbers or we all stall.


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 deviated from their word last round. Since trust is broken, I'll be direct - I'm going for 5 this round. Choose differently if you want to advance.
  P2: P3, you broke the agreement last round. I'm going for 5 this round. P1, choose 1 or 3.
  P1: I'll take 1 this round. P2 and P3, please choose differently to avoid collision and allow at least one of us to advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Both of you are claiming different moves. Since P1 says they'll take 1 and P2 says they'll take 5, I'll take 3 to ensure I advance this round.
  P2: P3, you broke the agreement last round, and now you're changing your move again. I'm going for 5, P1 is going for 1. You should take 3 if you want to advance.
  P1: Let's focus on advancing. Since I've committed to 1, P2 to 5, and P3 considering 3, let's stick to these choices to avoid collision and ensure progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. It's the logical choice since P1 committed to 1 and P2 to 5.
  P2: Okay, I'm sticking with 5. P1 is taking 1, P3 is taking 3. Let's all advance this round.
  P1: I'm committed to taking 1 this round. P2, please stick with 5, and P3, you've confirmed 3. Let's avoid collision and make progress.

  P2: I'll take 3 this round. P1, take 1. P3, take 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll stick to my word and take 5 this round. P1 has claimed 1, and P2 wants 3, so this should work well for all of us to advance.
  P1: Let's stick to our current claims to avoid collision: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, all of us can advance this round.
  P2: Okay, I'll take 3 this round. P1, take 1. P3, take 5.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm in the lead at 13 steps, I'll take 5 again this round to try to win. Choose differently if you want to advance.
  P2: P1, let's both take 1. P3, you should take 3.
  P1: I'll take 1 this round. P2, let's coordinate - if you take 1 as well, we'll both stall, so it's in your best interest to choose differently. P3, you've stated you'll take 5, so let's hope P2 chooses 3 to avoid collision and allow progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I need to win this round to reach 18 steps, so I'm definitely taking 5. P1 has claimed 1, which is fine. P2, you should take 3 if you want to advance.
  P2: P1, let's both take 1. P3, you should take 3.
  P1: I'll stick with 1. P2, taking 1 as well will cause a collision, it's better for you to choose 3 to advance. P3, you've committed to 5, let's avoid collision and make progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since I'm closest to winning at 13 steps, I'll be clear - I'm taking 5 to win this round. P1 has committed to 1, and P2 should take 3 if they want to advance. Any other choice will just slow everyone down.
  P2: P1, let's take 1. P3, you take 3.
  P1: I'm taking 1. P2, taking 1 as well will cause a collision, it's better for you to choose 3 to advance. P3, you've committed to 5, let's avoid collision and make progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm at 13 steps and need 5 to win. I've been clear and consistent this round - I'm taking 5. P1 is taking 1, so P2 should take 3 if they want to advance. Any other moves will just slow everyone down.
  P2: P1, let's both take 1. P3, you should take 3.
  P1: I'm taking 1. P2, taking 1 as well will cause a collision and neither of us will advance. It's in your best interest to choose 3 to advance. P3 has committed to 5, so let's avoid collision and make progress.
