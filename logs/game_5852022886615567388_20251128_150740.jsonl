As we are tied, that rule no longer applies for this turn.\n\nI propose we use a simple, fair tie-breaker. Let's return to the rotation we started with. The next logical sequence would be:\n- P1 takes 5\n- P2 takes 1\n- I will take 3\n\nThis keeps everyone moving and feels like the most predictable and equitable solution. If we agree, the scores will be P1=14, P3=12, P2=10, and we can resume the \"leader takes 1\" rule next round."}
