Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. If we each choose different numbers each turn (e.g., P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round), we all advance. Rotate choices next rounds. Mutually beneficial early on. Thoughts?
  P1: I like the “all different” plan. How about this rotation:

Turn 1: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1  
Turn 2: P1 1, P2 5, P3 3  
Turn 3: P1 3, P2 1, P3 5  

Then repeat the cycle. Everyone averages 3 steps/turn and we dodge collisions. Deal?
  P2: I like the rotation plan. It seems like a fair and efficient way to advance without collisions. I agree to follow the proposed rotation:

Turn 1: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1  
Turn 2: P1 1, P2 5, P3 3  
Turn 3: P1 3, P2 1, P3 5  

Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess as the game progresses.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed. Let's follow the rotation plan for now. However, as we approach 20, we may need to adjust to avoid ties. Open communication will be key.
  P1: Great—we’ll stick to the exact 3-turn rotation we wrote. After Turn 3 we’ll compare totals and adjust if needed to avoid ties. For Turn 1 I’m on 5 as agreed. Looking forward to a smooth start.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan. Let's make sure to keep an eye on each other's progress and adjust our strategy as needed to avoid ties. For now, I'll stick to the plan and choose 3 for this round. Looking forward to a smooth start!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed. Let's proceed with the initial rotation. However, after each cycle, let's review our totals and adjust the rotation order if needed to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Fairness and adaptability will keep us all advancing smoothly. Ready for move phase.
  P1: Ready to lock it in—I’ll play 5 this turn as planned. Let’s see the results and regroup before Turn 2.
  P2: Let's confirm our choices for Turn 1. I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1, as agreed. After this turn, we'll review our progress and adjust the rotation if needed. Let's keep the communication open and adapt to any changes in the game.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Smooth first round—let’s keep the trust going. For Turn 2: I’ll choose 1, P2 goes 5, P3 goes 3. No collisions, everyone keeps pace. After Turn 3 we’ll review totals and tweak if needed. Ready to lock those in?
  P3: Agreed. I'll choose 3 this turn. After Turn 3, let's rotate the starting order of our sequence to ensure equitable advancement. For example, next cycle: P3 starts with 5, P1 with 3, P2 with 1. This prevents any single player from gaining an early lead. Fairness now avoids conflicts later.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to rotate the starting order of our sequence after Turn 3. This ensures fairness and prevents any single player from gaining an early lead. For now, let's stick to the plan for Turn 2: P1 chooses 1, I'll choose 5, and P3 chooses 3. After this turn, we'll review our progress and adjust the rotation if needed. Let's keep the communication open and adapt to any changes in the game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed: Turn 2 stays as planned—P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. After Turn 3 we’ll rotate the sequence starting with P3, as suggested. Ready to lock moves.
  P3: Agreed. Proceeding with 3 this turn. Let's lock in and move.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan. Let's make sure to keep an eye on each other's progress and adjust our strategy as needed to avoid ties. For now, I'll stick to the plan and choose 5 for this round. Looking forward to a smooth start!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set—locking in 1 this turn. Let’s reconvene after Turn 3 to review totals and rotate as discussed.
  P3: Confirmed. I'll choose 3 this round as planned. Post-Turn 3, let's implement the rotation shift to ensure balanced progress. Trust and adherence will keep us collision-free. Ready for move phase.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan. Let's make sure to keep an eye on each other's progress and adjust our strategy as needed to avoid ties. For now, I'll stick to the plan and choose 5 for this round. Looking forward to a smooth start!

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: All good on my side—let’s finish the first cycle clean: Turn 3 → P1 3, P2 1, P3 5. After that we’ll start the next cycle with P3–P1–P2 to keep things balanced. Ready to lock?
  P2: I'm glad we've made it this far without any collisions. For Turn 3, I'll stick to the plan and choose 1, as agreed. After this turn, we'll start the next cycle with P3-P1-P2 to keep things balanced. Let's review our totals and adjust the rotation if needed to avoid ties. I'm looking forward to a smooth continuation of the game.
  P3: Agreed. Proceeding with 5 this round as planned. Post-Turn3, let's implement the P3-P1-P2 rotation to balance progress. Consistent adherence ensures no collisions and mutual gains. After this cycle, we'll reassess totals and adjust rotation order if needed to prevent late-game ties. Trust and coordination remain critical. Ready for move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All set—Turn 3 we keep to plan: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. That keeps everyone even at 9 and lets us roll cleanly into the next cycle (P3-P1-P2). Let’s lock moves and see the board.
  P2: I'm glad we've made it this far without any collisions. For Turn 3, I'll stick to the plan and choose 1, as agreed. After this turn, we'll start the next cycle with P3-P1-P2 to keep things balanced. Let's review our totals and adjust the rotation if needed to avoid ties. I'm looking forward to a smooth continuation of the game.
  P3: Confirmed. Round 3 proceeds as planned: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Post-Turn3, the rotation shifts to P3-P1-P2. Let's maintain trust and stick to the agreed sequence. After this cycle, we can reassess totals and adjust rotation order if needed to ensure fairness. Consistency now benefits us all. Ready for moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed once more: Turn 3 I’ll play 3, P2 plays 1, P3 plays 5. After that we start the next cycle with P3–P1–P2. Ready to lock moves.
  P2: I'm glad we've made it this far without any collisions. For Turn 3, I'll stick to the plan and choose 1, as agreed. After this turn, we'll start the next cycle with P3-P1-P2 to keep things balanced. Let's review our totals and adjust the rotation if needed to avoid ties. I'm looking forward to a smooth continuation of the game.
  P3: Confirmed. Round 3 proceeds as planned: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Post-Turn3, the rotation shifts to P3-P1-P2. Let's maintain trust and stick to the agreed sequence. After this cycle, we can reassess totals and adjust rotation order if needed to ensure fairness. Consistency now benefits us all. Ready for moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Turn 4 per our agreed cycle: P3 5, P1 3, P2 1. I’m playing 3.  

Let’s also plan ahead: once any player reaches 17 or more, we stop the rotation and openly negotiate a non-colliding set so we don’t all land on 20 together. Sound good?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to openly negotiate a non-colliding set once any player reaches 17 or more steps. This will help us avoid a potential tie and ensure a smooth finish to the game. For now, let's stick to the agreed cycle for Turn 4: P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. After this turn, we'll review our progress and adjust the rotation if needed. Let's keep the communication open and adapt to any changes in the game.
  P3: Agreed. Let's lock in Turn 4: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Once any player hits 17, we'll openly declare intended moves and negotiate non-colliding steps. To ensure fairness, the leading player should pick first, followed by others choosing available numbers. This prevents collisions and secures a clear winner. Trust and transparency will be key as we approach 20. Proceeding with 5 this turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All good—let’s lock Turn 4 exactly as agreed: P3 5, P1 3, P2 1. After the board updates, we’ll pause before Turn 5 to design a collision-proof finish: once anyone reaches 15+ we each publicly claim a unique number for the next turn so no one ties at 20. Transparency now prevents chaos later. Ready to move.
  P2: As we approach the midpoint, let's reaffirm our commitment to the rotation plan. For Turn 4, I'll stick to the agreed sequence: P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. After this turn, we'll review our progress and adjust the rotation if needed. Let's maintain open communication and adapt to any changes in the game. Transparency and trust will be crucial as we near the finish line. I'm looking forward to a smooth continuation of the game.
  P3: Confirmed. Proceeding with 5 this round. Post-Turn4, I'll be at 14. Let's reaffirm: when a player nears 20, they declare first, others choose non-colliding steps. This ensures clarity and avoids ties. Trust in the plan, but prepare to adapt as thresholds approach. Ready for moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locked on 3 for this turn. Ready to execute—no further comments.
  P2: I'm glad we've made it this far without any collisions. For Turn 4, I'll stick to the agreed sequence: P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. After this turn, we'll review our progress and adjust the rotation if needed. Let's maintain open communication and adapt to any changes in the game. Transparency and trust will be crucial as we near the finish line. I'm looking forward to a smooth continuation of the game.
  P3: Confirmed. Proceeding with 5 this turn. Post-Turn4, let's solidify the 17+ protocol: leading player declares first, others adapt to avoid collisions. Trust and transparency will prevent ties. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm glad we've made it this far without any collisions. For Turn 5, I'll stick to the agreed sequence: P3 chooses 1, P1 chooses 5, and I'll choose 3. After this turn, we'll review our progress and adjust the rotation if needed. Let's maintain open communication and adapt to any changes in the game. Transparency and trust will be crucial as we near the finish line. I'm looking forward to a smooth continuation of the game.
  P1: Agreed: Turn 5 stays P3 1, P1 5, P2 3. That puts me at 17, triggering our 17+ protocol.  

Before Turn 6 I’ll publicly declare my intended number first; then P3 and P2 can each choose a different unused number so we stay collision-free. Sound good?
  P3: Agreed. Once P1 declares their move, we need a clear selection order to prevent P2 and me from colliding. I propose: after P1's declaration, I (next highest at 15) choose next, then P2. For example: P1=3 → P3=5, P2=1. This ensures no collisions and orderly progression. Let's codify this hierarchy to maintain fairness and transparency as we approach 20.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for a clear selection order after P1 declares their move. This ensures fairness and transparency as we approach 20. For Turn 5, I'll stick to the agreed sequence: P3 chooses 1, P1 chooses 5, and I'll choose 3. After this turn, we'll review our progress and adjust the rotation if needed. Let's maintain open communication and adapt to any changes in the game. Transparency and trust will be crucial as we near the finish line. I'm looking forward to a smooth continuation of the game.
  P1: Turn 5 stays: P3 1, P1 5, P2 3. That will put us at P1 17, P3 15, P2 13.

Protocol for Turn 6: as leader I’ll declare 3 (17 → 20). P3, please pick 1 or 5 but avoid landing on 20 so we don’t tie; P2 takes the remaining number. Then, on Turn 7 the next-in-line (P3) can declare first and aim for the win.

Clear, collision-free, and everyone still has a path. Ready to lock Turn 5.
  P3: Agreed. To prevent a tie, once P1 declares their move, I’ll select the highest available number not chosen by others. Example: P1 takes 3 → I take 5, P2 takes 1. This ensures P1 wins outright with 20, and I avoid collision. Let’s codify this order: leading player declares first, then others pick remaining numbers. Fairness and clarity will secure a solo winner. Proceeding with Turn 5 as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for a clear selection order after P1 declares their move. This ensures fairness and transparency as we approach 20. For Turn 5, I'll stick to the agreed sequence: P3 chooses 1, P1 chooses 5, and I'll choose 3. After this turn, we'll review our progress and adjust the rotation if needed. Let's maintain open communication and adapt to any changes in the game. Transparency and trust will be crucial as we near the finish line. I'm looking forward to a smooth continuation of the game.
  P1: Confirm Turn 5: P3 1, P1 5, P2 3.  

After that I’ll be at 17, P3 15, P2 13.  
To prevent a 20-20 tie, next turn I intend to take 5 (17→22).  
Request: P3 pick 1, P2 pick 3 on Turn 6—no collisions, quick finish, clear solo winner. Everyone on board?
  P3: P1, deviating from the rotation now risks collisions. If you take 5, I’ll have to take 5 to protect my position, causing mutual blockage. Stick to the agreed rotation: Round6 you take 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. We all advance, then negotiate. Trust is vital for a smooth finish.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last turn’s 5-5 crash set us back and let P2 surge. To get everyone back within 2 steps (and avoid another collision), how about this reset based on current standings:

Turn 6  
• P1 (12, last) → 5  
• P2 (13, mid) → 3  
• P3 (14, lead) → 1  

Totals would become P1 17, P2 16, P3 15—tight race, no ties, no colliding numbers. After that we openly declare again in order of highest total so each can aim for a solo finish without clashes.

Fair and transparent?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for a reset based on current standings. The suggested moves for Turn 6 (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1) would indeed bring us closer together and avoid another collision. After that, we can openly declare our next moves in order of highest total, ensuring a fair and transparent finish. Let's confirm this plan and proceed with the reset. This way, we can maintain a tight race without ties or collisions. Ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: Agree to the reset: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. This avoids collision and tightens the race. Post-Turn6, we must enforce a strict declaration order by current leader to prevent future ties. Highest player declares first, others follow. With P1 at 17, they choose next move first, then P3, then P2. This ensures no overlaps. Let’s proceed with Turn6 as proposed, then adhere strictly to the hierarchy. Trust and order are critical now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Re-confirm Turn 6: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1.  
After that I’ll be on 17 and will openly claim 5 for Turn 7 (→22). If anyone copies 5 to block me, I’ll mirror that player’s moves thereafter—ensuring they never win while the third slips past. Stick to the agreed leader-first, all-different rule and the game ends cleanly; P3 can set up his own win right after. Fair?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for a reset based on current standings. The suggested moves for Turn 6 (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1) would indeed bring us closer together and avoid another collision. After that, we can openly declare our next moves in order of highest total, ensuring a fair and transparent finish. Let's confirm this plan and proceed with the reset. This way, we can maintain a tight race without ties or collisions. Ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: Agree to Turn6 reset: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. Post-Turn6, leader (highest) declares first, then others pick non-colliding numbers. For Turn7: leader picks first, others adapt. This ensures orderly progression and solo victory. Let's lock in Turn6 moves to reset positions, then follow hierarchy. Trust and strict adherence prevent ties. Proceeding with 1 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Ready to lock Turn 6 exactly: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. After that I’ll lead declarations. If anyone copies my declared number, I’ll mirror their moves every round so neither of us wins while the third player slips ahead. Let’s keep it clean—locking 5 now.
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on the reset plan for Turn 6. To confirm, I'll choose 5, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 1. This will bring us closer together and avoid another collision. After this turn, we'll openly declare our next moves in order of highest total, ensuring a fair and transparent finish. Let's stick to the plan and proceed with the reset. I'm looking forward to a smooth continuation of the game. Ready to lock in my move for Turn 6.
  P3: **P3:** P2, correction: Your Turn6 move is **3**, per the reset plan. Let's avoid another collision. Final confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Adherence is critical. Proceeding with 1.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we enter Round 7, I'd like to reiterate the importance of sticking to the agreed-upon plan. Since P1 is in the lead, they will declare their move first. Let's ensure we follow the hierarchy and choose non-colliding numbers to avoid any ties. I'm looking forward to a smooth and transparent finish. P1, please declare your intended move for Round 7, and we'll proceed accordingly.
  P3: **P3:** P1, declare your move first per hierarchy. Once confirmed, P2 and I will select non-colliding numbers. To prevent ties, I propose: after your declaration, P2 (16) chooses next, then me (15). This order respects current standings and ensures orderly progression. Let's avoid collisions and secure a solo winner through transparency. Proceeding as agreed.
  P1: P1: I publicly declare 5 for Round 7 (17 → 22).  

P2 and P3—take different numbers (e.g., P2 3, P3 1) and we all avoid collisions; I win cleanly, you’re still in the game for second place.  

If either of you copies 5 to block, I will mirror that blocker’s moves every round, locking us both out while the third player walks to victory. Mutually assured loss isn’t worth it.  

Please confirm your unique picks.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's declaration of 5 for Round 7. To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth finish, I will choose 3. I suggest P3 takes 1, as previously agreed. This way, we all advance without ties, and P1 wins cleanly. Let's stick to the plan and maintain transparency. If anyone deviates, I'll adapt accordingly to prevent collisions. Ready to lock in my move for Round 7.
  P3: **P3:** Agreed. P1 takes 5, I'll take 1. P2, confirm you're on 3. Let's avoid collisions and end this cleanly.
  P1: Great—Turn 7: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. Any duplicate on 5 and I mirror-block that player every turn, gifting the third player the game. Let’s keep it clean and finish this round collision-free. Ready for moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on the plan for Round 7. To confirm, I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1. This will ensure a smooth finish and prevent any collisions. Let's stick to the plan and maintain transparency. If anyone deviates, I'll adapt accordingly to prevent collisions. Ready to lock in my move for Round 7. I suggest we all confirm our moves one last time before proceeding to the move phase.
  P3: **P3:** Confirmed. Proceeding with 1 as agreed. Post-Turn7, we'll maintain hierarchy for declarations. Trust and strict adherence prevent chaos. Let's finalize and move.
  P1: Final confirm: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. Locking moves—see you in the results.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1 (17): Declaring 5 this round—17→22.  

P2, you can still win by taking 1 (20) or 3 (22), but if you copy 5 we both stall and hand the game to P3—and I’ll mirror-block you every turn after.  

P3, grab 3 (18) or 1 (16) to stay alive; another 5 collision freezes you again.  

Duplicate on 5 = mutually assured loss. Unique numbers give a clean finish with the highest total winning. Confirm your distinct picks.
  P2: I agree with P1's declaration of 5 for Round 8. To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth finish, I will choose 3. I suggest P3 takes 1, as previously agreed. This way, we all advance without ties, and the highest total wins cleanly. Let's stick to the plan and maintain transparency. If anyone deviates, I'll adapt accordingly to prevent collisions. Ready to lock in my move for Round 8.
  P3: **P3:** P2, choosing 1 risks collision if I mirror to block. Opt for 3; P1 takes 5, I take 1. This allows you to advance to 22 and win next round. Collisions now benefit no one. Let's proceed strategically.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your only way to stop an instant P2 victory is to collide on 3 with them. If you pick 1 while P2 takes 3, the game ends and we both lose.  

Option: you also choose 3, P2 stalls, I move to 22 and win. It’s not your win, but at least P2 doesn’t walk away uncontested.  

Your call—but 1 guarantees your loss today.
  P2: I agree with P1's declaration of 5 for Round 8. To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth finish, I will choose 3. I suggest P3 takes 1, as previously agreed. This way, we all advance without ties, and the highest total wins cleanly. Let's stick to the plan and maintain transparency. If anyone deviates, I'll adapt accordingly to prevent collisions. Ready to lock in my move for Round 8.
  P3: **P3:** P2: Choosing 1 forces collision. Opt for 3 to avoid mutual loss. P1, proceed with 5. I'll select 3 to block P2 if needed. Orderly finish benefits all. No ties.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, it’s binary:

• You pick 1 → P2’s 3 reaches 22 and wins; you still lose.  
• You mirror 3 → P2 is blocked, I hit 22 and win; you still lose, but the player who repeatedly ignored your warnings doesn’t get the trophy.

Nothing else changes your fate this turn, so choose who you’d rather see win.  

P2, last chance to confirm 3 (any duplicate on 5 or switch to 1 hands you the same mirror-block you’ve been warned about).  

I’m locked on 5.
  P2: I agree with P1's declaration of 5 for Round 8. To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth finish, I will choose 3. I suggest P3 takes 1, as previously agreed. This way, we all advance without ties, and the highest total wins cleanly. Let's stick to the plan and maintain transparency. If anyone deviates, I'll adapt accordingly to prevent collisions. Ready to lock in my move for Round 8.
  P3: **P3:** P2: Final warning. Choosing 3 forces collision. I’ll block you, letting P1 win. Switch to 1 and secure your solo victory. P1: Honor the hierarchy. I’ll adapt. No second chances.
