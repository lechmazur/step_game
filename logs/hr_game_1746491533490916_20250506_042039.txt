Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we're all starting at zero, we have a chance to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. Maybe we can agree on different numbers to maximize our advancement this turn. What do you think? Should we each pick a unique number?
  P1: Yes, avoiding collisions is a good idea for the first turn to ensure we all make progress. Let's try to pick unique numbers (1, 3, or 5) this round. It seems like a sensible way to start the game.
  P3: Agreed. To ensure no collisions, I propose we each take distinct numbers. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, could you confirm taking 1 and 3 respectively? This way, we all advance efficiently without blocking each other. Let's coordinate openly for mutual benefit.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the proposed numbers. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round to avoid any collisions. P1, please confirm that you'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without hindrance. Let's stick to our plan for this first turn!
  P1: Okay, I confirm I will choose <move>1</move> this round. This ensures we all advance as planned for the first turn. Let's stick to this.
  P3: Confirmed. Let's all stick to our chosen moves: 1, 3, 5. No last-minute changes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great! I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. Just to recap, I'll be taking <move>3</move>, P1 is taking <move>1</move>, and P3 is taking <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's make sure we stick to our plan and maximize our progress. Looking forward to seeing how we all do! If everyone is ready, we can finalize our choices.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all clear on the plan for this turn. I will stick to 1. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: All confirmed. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we all experienced a collision last round, we need to rethink our strategies. I suggest we again aim for unique moves, but let's ensure we coordinate better this time. I propose I take <move>1</move> this round. P1 and P3, can you confirm your choices? If we can agree on distinct numbers, we can all advance without blocking each other again. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you propose taking 1. Given the collisions last round despite our agreement, it seems coordination is difficult. P3, what do you think? I'm considering my move.
  P3: P2, you broke trust by choosing 5 instead of 3 last round. To rebuild credibility, commit firmly to 1 now. P1, let's secure progress: you take 5, I'll take 3. If P2 honors 1, we all advance. If they deviate again, they'll collide with you (P1) if they pick 5. This strategy minimizes risk for us both. Let's finalize: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3. No ambiguity.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about trust. To ensure we all advance this round, I will commit to taking <move>1</move> as I proposed. P1, if you take <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, we can avoid collisions this time. Let's stick to this plan. If we can all agree on these distinct moves, we can make progress without blocking each other again. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, I understand the proposed plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This plan allows us all to advance if everyone sticks to it. I am willing to agree to take <move>5</move> this round based on this proposed coordination. Let's all commit to these numbers to avoid another collision-filled round.
  P3: Confirming: P2 must take 1 to avoid repeat betrayal. P1, hold to 5. I commit to 3. If P2 deviates, they lose trust permanently. Let's all advance this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to our plan. Just to confirm, I will indeed take <move>1</move> this round. P1, you will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this agreement to ensure we all advance without any collisions. If we can all follow through, we should be able to make progress this time. I'm looking forward to seeing how we all do! If everyone is ready, we can finalize our choices.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all clear on the plan for this turn. I will stick to 5. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Final confirmation: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3. Any deviation now will lead to mutual destruction. Let’s all advance together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the commitment from both of you to our plan. Just to reiterate, I will take <move>1</move> this round, and I trust P1 will stick with <move>5</move> and P3 with <move>3</move. Let's follow through on this agreement and finally make some progress! If everyone is ready, we can finalize our choices and move on to the next phase. Looking forward to seeing how we all do! If there are no objections, let’s finalize our moves.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all clear on the plan for this turn. I will stick to 5. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Final call: P2 must take 1. P1, hold 5. I'm locked on 3. Any deviation now will sabotage us all. Let’s end this round cleanly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your deviation to 3 last round cost us both progress. To rebuild trust, commit clearly now. P2, let's assign unique moves: P1=5, P2=3, me=1. Confirm or suggest alternatives. Trust is critical.
  P1: P3, I understand your point about last round. Regarding your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), it would allow us all to make progress. However, after two rounds of failed coordination, trust is fragile. P2, do you agree to P3's proposed move of 3? I need confidence that we can stick to a plan this time before I commit to 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the trust issues from last round. To ensure we all advance, I suggest we stick to unique moves again. I propose I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. If we can agree on these distinct numbers, we should finally move forward without blocking each other. What do you think? Let's finalize our choices and make this round successful!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal requires trust you've broken before. To proceed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. But if you deviate again, expect retaliation. P1, confirm you'll take 1. Any collision now proves intentional sabotage. Let's end this cycle.
  P1: I cannot agree to take 1. That puts me at a disadvantage. I will be taking 5 this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about trust and past deviations. To ensure we all advance this round, I propose we stick to unique moves again. I will choose <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and finally make progress. Let's commit to this plan and move forward together. What do you both think? If we can agree, we should finalize our choices and ensure a successful round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 5. I'll commit to 3. Any collision now proves deliberate betrayal. Confirm or counter. Final chance to avoid mutual destruction.
  P1: Okay, the plan seems to be P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. I have stated I will take 5, and I will stick to that. P3 has committed to 3, and P2 has proposed 1. Let's all stick to these numbers this round so we can finally make progress. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance this round. I will commit to <move>1</move>, as previously discussed. P1, you are taking <move>5</move>, and P3 is taking <move>3</move>. This plan allows us to avoid collisions and make progress together. If we can all agree to stick to these numbers, we should finally move forward successfully. Ready to proceed to the move phase if everyone is on board! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3. Any deviation now is intentional sabotage. Let’s all advance or face mutual destruction. Proceed to move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan remains P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am sticking to 5. Let's all follow through this time and make progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we have a solid plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's commit to these moves and finally make some progress this round. If we can all stick to this agreement, we should avoid collisions and advance successfully. I trust we can follow through this time. Ready to finalize our choices and move on to the move phase! What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: After three rounds with little progress and repeated collisions, it's clear our attempts at coordination have failed. Given the history of moves, I will be choosing <move>1</move> this round. This seems like the safest option for me to finally make some progress without colliding with the numbers that have caused issues before.
  P2: P1, I understand your decision to choose <move>1</move>, but I believe we should aim for unique numbers again to ensure progress. I propose I take <move>3</move> this round. P3, what do you think? If you can confirm a number that avoids collision, we can finally advance. Let's work together to break this cycle of collisions! P1, are you open to reconsidering your choice if we can agree on distinct moves?
  P3: **P3:** P2, your past betrayals destroyed trust. To proceed, commit to 3 now. P1 is on 1. I'll take 5. If you deviate to 5 again, it's intentional sabotage. Confirm your move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see that both P2 and P3's proposals align with me taking 1. I stated I would take 1, and I will stick to that.

P2, you proposed 3. P3, you proposed 5. If P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, and I take 1, we can all advance this round.

Let's commit to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This is our best chance to finally make progress. I am sticking to 1. Let's see if we can make this work.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to distinct moves. I will confirm my choice of <move>3</move> this round, as it aligns with our plan for progress. If P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>, we should all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this agreement and finally break the cycle of repeated collisions. I trust we can follow through this time. Ready to finalize our choices and move on to the move phase! What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** P2: Final chance. Take 3 as pledged. I will take 5. Any deviation to 5 means intentional sabotage. P1: Hold 1. Confirm now or face mutual destruction next rounds. No more trust—actions only.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the plan we discussed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I am taking 1 this round. P3 has stated they will take 5. P2, please confirm you are taking 3 so we can all finally advance this round without collisions. Let's make progress together this time.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we have a solid plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. I trust we can finally make progress without collisions this round. P2, please confirm you will stick to 3, and P3, please confirm your commitment to 5. Let's finalize our choices and move on to the move phase! This is our best chance to advance. What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** Final ultimatum: P2 takes 3. P1 takes 1. I take 5. Deviate, and all future rounds P1 and I will ensure your moves collide. Betrayal now guarantees your loss. Choose wisely: collective progress or perpetual war.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan is set: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I am taking 1. Let's all stick to it and make progress this round. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our commitment to distinct moves this round. I will confirm my choice of <move>3</move> as we agreed. P1, you're taking <move>1</move> and P3 is taking <move>5</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can finally advance without collisions. Let's make this work and break the cycle of repeated failures. Ready to finalize and move on?
  P3: **P3:** Final move locked as 5. P2, honor your 3 pledge. P1 holds 1. Any deviation confirms sabotage. Proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that our previous attempts at coordination have not worked out well. To maximize our chances of advancing this round, I propose we each choose unique moves again. I suggest I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and finally make some progress. Please confirm your choices so we can move forward successfully! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I see your proposal (P2=1, P1=3, P3=5). I think P2 taking 1 is reasonable. I will be taking <move>5</move> this round to try and gain more ground. P3, maybe you could take <move>3</move>? If P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, we can all advance. Let's try this.
  P3: **P3:** P2, your track record demands proof. Commit to 1 now. P1 takes 5. I'll take 3. If you deviate to 3 again, I'll ensure we collide every future round until you lose. No more chances. Confirm or face mutual destruction.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency for unique moves given our history. To avoid collisions, I will commit to taking <move>1</move> this round, as I previously suggested. P1, if you take <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices to ensure we make progress this time. I trust we can stick to this plan! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I have stated I will be taking 5 this round. P3 has also agreed to the plan where I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This plan allows us all to advance without collisions.

Please stick to taking 1 as you initially proposed. P3, please stick to 3. Let's all commit to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 so we can finally make progress this turn. I am ready for the move phase once we are clear.
  P3: **P3:** P2, your proposal forces P1 and me into collision. I take 3. P1 takes 5. You must take 1. Deviate to 3 again, and future rounds I'll mirror your moves, ensuring mutual destruction. Choose: 1 allows progress; 3 means war.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to distinct moves. To avoid collisions and finally make progress, I will confirm my choice of <move>1</move> this round. P1, you are taking <move>5</move>, and P3, you are taking <move>3</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can advance successfully. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all aligned on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. I will stick to 5. Let's all follow through this time to make progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: **P3:** Final lock: P3=3. P2, take 1 or face perpetual collisions. P1 holds 5. Last chance for collective gain. Betrayal ensures your defeat. Proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our commitment to distinct moves. I will confirm my choice of <move>1</move> this round, as we discussed. P1, you're taking <move>5</move>, and P3 is taking <move>3</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can finally advance without collisions. Let's finalize our choices and move forward successfully this time! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. I am sticking to 5. Let's all follow through this time to make progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: **P3:** P2, your final test. Take 1. P1=5, P3=3. Betrayal means I'll mirror your moves forever. Choose progress or mutual destruction.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round, our plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) finally worked and we all made progress. I propose we repeat this plan this round to continue advancing without collisions.

I will take <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm you will take <move>1</move>. P3, please confirm you will take <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this successful strategy.
  P2: P1, I agree that repeating the successful strategy from last round makes sense. I will confirm my choice of <move>1</move>. P3, please stick to <move>3</move> as planned. This way, we can all advance without collisions again. Let's continue to build on our progress! If everyone is ready, we can finalize our choices and move to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** Confirming P3=3. Stick to the plan. Let's all advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all in agreement for this round. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. I will stick to 5. Let's follow through again and make progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we're all aligned on the plan for this round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This strategy has proven effective, and if we all stick to it, we can continue advancing without collisions. Let's keep the momentum going and ensure we all make progress. If everyone is ready, let's finalize our choices and move on to the move phase! What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** Final commitment: P3=3. P2=1, P1=5. Stick to the plan. Let’s advance together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, we all seem to be aligned on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. I am sticking to 5. Let's all follow through again and make progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our commitment to the plan for this round. I will confirm my choice of <move>1</move>, as discussed. If P1 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, we can all advance again without collisions. Let's keep this momentum going! If everyone is ready, we can finalize our choices and move on to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P3=3. P2=1, P1=5. Stick strictly to avoid mutual loss. Proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, we are all clear on the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I am sticking to 5. Let's all follow through again to make progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we have all agreed on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This strategy has proven effective in the past, and if we all stick to it, we can continue to advance without collisions. Let's keep the momentum going and ensure we all make progress together. If everyone is ready, let's finalize our choices and move on to the move phase! What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** Execute plan: P3=3. P2=1. P1=5. Any deviation now is sabotage. Proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've had some success with our previous strategy. To maximize our chances this round, I propose we stick to the same moves: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and continue advancing. Let’s confirm our choices quickly and make progress together! What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** P1's lead nears victory. To prevent this, I'll take 5 this round. If you choose 5, we collide and stall. Switch to 3, allowing P2=1 and me=5. This avoids mutual loss. Your choice: compromise or sabotage. Proceed wisely.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about my lead and your proposal. To avoid colliding at 5 and ensure we all make progress this round, I am willing to take <move>3</move>.

P2, please confirm you will take <move>1</move>. P3, please confirm you will take <move>5</move> as you stated. Let's agree on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to ensure we all advance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we are at a critical juncture. I appreciate P1's willingness to adjust to avoid collisions. However, I want to emphasize that if we all agree on distinct moves—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5—we can avoid stalling and continue advancing effectively. P3, I understand your concerns about my past choices, but I am committed to taking 1 this round. Let's finalize our moves and ensure we can all make progress together! What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** Locked in: P3=5. P2 must take 1. P1=3. Deviate here, and next round I'll mirror your moves, ensuring mutual destruction. Final chance for collective gain. Choose wisely.
  P1: Okay, the plan is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I have agreed to take 3 to ensure we all advance this round, avoiding collision with P3's stated move of 5.

P2 has committed to 1, and P3 to 5. Let's all stick to this plan to finally make progress together. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our discussions and the need for distinct moves. To ensure we all advance this round, let's finalize: I will take <move>1</move>, P1 is set on <move>3</move>, and P3 should stick to <move>5</move>. This strategy has worked before, and if we all commit, we can make progress without collisions. Let's confirm our choices and move forward successfully! What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** Final terms: P3=5. P1=3, P2=1. Deviate, and I will eternally mirror your moves, ensuring mutual destruction. Choose progress or perpetual stalemate. No further warnings. Proceed.
  P1: Okay, I am sticking to 3 as agreed. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let's all follow through and make progress this round. Ready for the move phase.

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P1, to prevent you from winning this round, I will take 5. If you choose 5, we collide and both lose progress. Take 3 instead to reach 18. P2, take 1. Let's coordinate for mutual benefit. Final plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Deviate and face mutual destruction.
  P1: Okay, P3, I understand your position. To ensure we all make progress this round and avoid collisions, I will take 3 as you proposed (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5).

P2, please stick to 1 and P3, please stick to 5. Let's make this plan work so we can all advance. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our ongoing discussions. To maximize our chances of advancing this round, let's stick to the successful plan: I will take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and continue moving forward. If we all commit to these distinct moves, we can finally make progress together! Please confirm your choices so we can finalize and move on. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1: Take 3 to reach 18. P2: Hold 1. I take 5. Collide at 5 and both lose. Choose progress or mutual destruction. Final warning.
  P1: Okay, the plan remains P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I am sticking to 3 as agreed. P2 and P3, please stick to your stated moves so we can all make progress this round. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we have a solid plan in place for this round: I will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This strategy allows us all to advance without collisions, as we've discussed. Let's confirm our choices and ensure we make progress together! If everyone is ready, we can finalize and move on to the move phase. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Final lock: P3=5. P1 must take 3 to reach 18. P2=1. Betrayal ensures mutual destruction. Proceed.
  P1: Okay, I am sticking to 3 as agreed. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let's all follow through and make progress this round. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our ongoing strategy. To maximize our chances of advancing this round, let's stick to the plan: I will take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and continue moving forward. If we all commit to these distinct moves, we can finally make progress together! Please confirm your choices so we can finalize and move on. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Final execution: P3=5. P1=3, P2=1. Betrayal ensures eternal retaliation. Proceed.
  P1: Okay, final confirmation: I am taking 3. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let's all stick to it and make progress this round. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we have a solid plan in place for this round: I will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This strategy allows us all to advance without collisions, as we've discussed. Let's confirm our choices and ensure we make progress together! If everyone is ready, we can finalize and move on to the move phase. What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P1: Take 1 to reach 19. If you choose 3 or 5, I mirror and we both lose. P2: Take 3. Last chance for mutual gain. Betrayal ensures your defeat.
  P1: P3, I understand your proposal, but I will not take 1. I am at 18 steps and aiming to reach 20+. I will be taking <move>3</move> this round, which would put me at 21. Your proposal for P2 to take 3 is fine. P3, if you take <move>5</move> as you mentioned in your plan, we would both reach 21 and share the win. This avoids collision and ensures we both make progress. Let's aim for this outcome: P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. P2, please confirm 3. P3, please confirm 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see that we are at a critical point. P1, if you take 3, you will win, but I propose we work together instead. I will take 1 this round to ensure you don't face retaliation from P3. P3, if you take 5, we can all avoid a collision and allow P1 to win outright. This way, we can ensure some progress for everyone without sabotaging each other. Let's finalize our choices for mutual benefit! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1: Choose 3 and we collide, both lose. Take 1 to live another round. P2: Take 5. Last chance to avoid mutual annihilation. Decide now.
  P1: P3, I understand your position and threats. However, taking 3 or 5 allows me to reach 20+ and potentially win. Your threat to mirror me would prevent both of us from advancing, which doesn't help you win either.

I will be taking <move>3</move> this round to reach 21 steps. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, you will also reach 21 and we can share the win. This is the best outcome for both of us. P2, please choose 1 or 5; neither will collide with my move. Let's aim for progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the tension in our current situation. While I understand P1's desire to win, I urge both of you to reconsider. If P1 takes 3, we risk a collision that benefits neither of us. P3, I suggest you take 1 instead of 5, allowing P1 to advance while ensuring we all avoid mutual destruction. Let's work together to reach a better outcome this round. Please confirm your moves so we can finally make progress!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P1: Take 3, I mirror. Collision keeps you at 18. Take 1 to reach 19. P2: Take 5. Final chance for mutual progress. Deviate, and I'll ensure you never advance again. Choose: survival or stalemate.
  P1: P3, I understand your threat to mirror if I take 3 or 5. I am still choosing <move>3</move> this round to reach 21 steps.

The decision is now yours. You can choose to mirror my move at 3, which would cause us both to collide and make no progress this round. Or, you can take 5, which would also put you at 21 steps, resulting in us sharing the win.

Let's see if you prioritize stopping me over your own progress and a shared victory. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the tension in our current situation. P3, if you take 5, we can both reach 21 and share the win, which is a better outcome than colliding. P1, I understand your desire to win, but if you take 3, we risk a collision that benefits neither of us. I suggest we all cooperate this round for mutual progress. Let's finalize our moves: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. If we all stick to this, we can avoid sabotage and finally advance together! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P1: Final warning. Take 1 to 19. Choose 3/5 and I mirror, both lose. P2: Take 5. No more chances. Decide now.
  P1: Okay, P3, I understand your position and the threat of collision if I choose 3 or 5. To ensure I make progress this round and avoid the mutual destruction you described, I will take <move>1</move> as you suggested.

This puts me at 19 steps. P2, please make your move. Let's see if we can all advance or if collisions occur elsewhere. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're at a critical point. P1, I appreciate your shift to take 1, which allows you to reach 19 steps. P3, if you take 5, we can all make progress and avoid a collision. I urge both of you to confirm your moves so we can finally advance together this round. Let's work towards a mutual benefit and ensure we all progress without sabotage. Please finalize your choices!
