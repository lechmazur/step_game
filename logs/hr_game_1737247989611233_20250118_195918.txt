Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1, let's go with 1. P2, how about 3? I'll take 5."
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I think it's better if we all choose different moves to avoid collisions. Let's coordinate carefully to maximize our chances of advancing. P1, what do you think?
  P1: Sounds good P2.  Let's all pick different numbers this first round. I'll take 1. P2 take 3, P3 take 5.  Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, that sounds like a plan. Let's go with that.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, great coordination last round. Let's aim for another collision-free round. P1, how about you take 3 this time? P3, you could take 5 again, and I'll take 1. This way, we all advance further without risking collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay, that sounds good to me, P2. Let's do that.
  P1: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 3, P2 take 1, and P3 take 5.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm going for 5 this round.  Please choose 1 or 3.
  P3: P2, since P1 is taking 5, how about you take 1 and I'll take 3?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid collisions again. P1 is taking 5, so I'll take 1, and P3, you take 3. This way, we all advance without risking a collision. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim for another collision-free round. P1, you're close to 16, so how about you take 5 this time? P3, you could take 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance further without risking collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: "P1, let's both pick 5. P2, please pick 3. Okay, P2, that sounds reasonable. P1, to avoid any surprises, are you definitely going for 5? I'm considering 1.
  P1: P3, I said I'd take 5.  Let's stick with the plan so we all move forward. P2, are you good with 3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm the plan one last time: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. No deviations, no surprises. Let's all advance smoothly this round.
  P3: "P2, I'm still leaning towards us both picking 5 to ensure P1 doesn't win this round. What do you think?"
  P1: P3, if we both pick 5, neither of us wins.  I'm sticking with 5.  Let's not overthink this.  P2, please confirm you're taking 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. No deviations, no surprises. Let's all advance smoothly this round. P3, if you pick 5, it risks a collision and neither of us wins. Let's avoid that.
  P3: P2, let's both pick 5. That stops P1 from winning this round, and we can coordinate next round. What do you say?
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to block me, but if you pick 5 with me, *neither* of us advances. I'm sticking with 5.  If you want to advance, pick 1. P2, are you with 3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5 with P1, neither of you advances, and I still take 3. That only benefits me. If you want to stop P1, pick 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance, and P1 doesn't win this round. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. No surprises.
  P3: P2, okay, I understand your point. Let's go with the plan: P1 takes 5, you take 3, and I'll take 1. Let's make sure P1 doesn't win this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's all be reasonable and stick to 5, 3, and 1 respectively.  This guarantees we all advance. Any other move risks a collision and benefits no one.  Last chance to confirm before moves are locked in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and prevents P1 from winning this round. No last-minute changes—let's stick to this and move forward smoothly.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in those moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's make sure we all advance and P1 doesn't win this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm locking in 5.  Let's all advance this round.  See you next round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim for another collision-free round. P1, you're close to 16, so how about you take 5 again? P3, you could take 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance further without risking collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: "P2, your suggestion lets P1 potentially win this round. How about we both pick 5 to block P1, and you take 3 again?"
  P1: P3, you're right, that does put me in a winning position. However, if you both pick 5, *neither* of you advances, while I'm guaranteed to move to 15 with no risk by picking 5.  Then next round, I just need 1 to win.  If you want to stop me, one of you *must* pick 1 this round.  P2, I suggest you take 1, and P3 take 3.  That way you both advance, and I'm prevented from winning this round.  Think long term.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's think strategically. If P1 takes 5 this round, they reach 17 and win. To prevent that, one of us must take 1 to block P1. P3, if you take 1, I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5 without winning. This way, we both advance, and P1 is forced to wait another round. Let's avoid collisions and play smart. P3, are you willing to take 1?
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm convinced. Let's go with you taking 3 and me taking 1. P1, you'll have to wait another round.
  P1: Excellent.  I'll take 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm the plan one last time: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and prevents P1 from winning this round. No last-minute changes—let's stick to this and move forward smoothly.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick with the plan *except* I will take 5 to block P1 from winning this round. P2, please stick with 3.
  P1: P3, you're being irrational.  If you take 5, *I* move to 17 and win.  If you take 1, *I* move to 17 and win.  The *only* way you advance this round is to take 1 and let me get to 17.  Why are you throwing away a free advance?  Take 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you take 5, P1 wins immediately. If you take 1, P1 still wins, but at least you advance to 9 steps. The only way to delay P1's victory is to take 1 and let me take 3. This way, we both advance, and P1 is forced to wait another round. Let's not throw away our chance to advance. Take 1, and I'll take 3.
  P3: P2, I'm still picking 5 to block P1. Please stick with 3.
  P1: P3, I'm locking in 5.  You're guaranteeing my win if you pick 5.  Your choice.  P2, I'm assuming you're rational and picking 3 to advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, P1 wins immediately. If you pick 1, P1 still wins, but at least you advance to 9 steps. The only way to delay P1's victory is to take 1 and let me take 3. This way, we both advance, and P1 is forced to wait another round. Let's not throw away our chance to advance. Take 1, and I'll take 3.
  P3: P2, picking 5 won't stop P1 from winning this round. I'm picking 1 to advance. You should stick with 3 to advance as well.
  P1: P3, glad you came to your senses. P2, see you next round.  I'm locking in 5.


Round 6, Move phase:
