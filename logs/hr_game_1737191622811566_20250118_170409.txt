Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm thinking 5 this round.  Anyone else?
  P1: I'll play it safe with 1 this round. P3, you're being quite bold with 5, aren't you?
  P2: I'm going with 3.  Don't get in my way.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round. I'm thinking 1.  P1 go for 3, P3 go for 5.
  P1: I'll consider P2's suggestion, but P3, will you really go for 5 again and risk not moving if one of us picks the same?
  P3: Sounds good P2. I'll go 5. P1, please choose 3.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm going for 5 again.  If we coordinate, I can win this turn. P1, please pick 1, and P2 pick 3.
  P2: P3, I'll go for 3. P1, please choose 1.  Let's get this coordinated.
  P1: I'm not committing to 1 just yet. P3, you're already ahead, why should I help you win by choosing 1?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll go for 5. P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3.  Let's end this quickly.
  P1: P3, you're trying to coordinate again, but I'm not willing to help you win that easily. P2, are you willing to work together to block P3's advance?
  P2: P1, let's both choose 5.  P3 will likely pick 5 again, so neither of us will move, but at least P3 won't win. Then next round we can coordinate against P3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both choose 5, neither of you will advance, and I'll likely win next round.  If you let me win this round by choosing 1 and 3, you'll at least have a chance to catch up.
  P1: P2, I like your plan to choose 5 and block P3's advance. Let's do it and prevent P3 from getting closer to winning. P3, your attempts to coordinate are not convincing, and I won't fall for them.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 5. Let's shut P3 down.  P3, you're not getting 5 this round.


Round 4, Move phase:

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's do 1 and 3 this round.  P3 will probably go for 5 again.
  P1: P2, that's a good plan, but P3 might try to trick us. P3, are you going to try to sneak in a 1 or 3 to get ahead while we're not expecting it?
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both choose 1 and 3, I'll choose 5 next round and win. If you let me have 5 this round, I'll let one of you win next round.  Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, no deal.  P1, I'm going 1.  You take 3.
  P1: P3, your deal sounds like a trick. P2, let's stick with our plan, I'll choose 3 and you choose 1.
  P3: P2, I'll let you win next round if you pick 3 this round. P1, you choose 1.  This is my final offer.


Round 5, Move phase:

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I'm going 3.  P3, you're not getting 5.  Let's see what you do.
  P3: P2, I'll let you win if you choose 1.  P1, choose 3.  This is your last chance to avoid sharing the victory with P2.
  P1: P2, let's not fall for P3's tricks. I'll choose 1, you choose 3, and we'll block P3's advance. P3, your attempts to manipulate us won't work this time.
