Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2, let's try to coordinate to avoid collisions this round. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 for our first moves? This way we all advance.
  P1: P3, your suggestion to coordinate is interesting, but I’m not convinced it guarantees fairness. If we all advance equally, the game could drag on, and someone might still gain an advantage later. Instead, how about we alternate moves strategically? For now, I’ll pick 1 this round, but let’s agree to rotate choices in future rounds to minimize collisions and keep things balanced. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to rotate choices in future rounds to minimize collisions. However, I'm not sure if I want to commit to a specific rotation pattern just yet. For this round, I'm open to P3's original suggestion of P1 picking 1, me picking 3, and P3 picking 5. It seems like a fair way to start the game and avoid collisions for now. What do you think, P3? Should we stick with your original plan for this round?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, I think starting with P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 for this round is a good idea to get us all moving forward without collision. We can discuss rotation patterns for future rounds after this one. Let's do this for round 1.
  P1: P3, P2, I appreciate the coordination so far. Let’s stick to the plan for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It ensures we all advance without collisions. However, let’s agree that this is a one-time arrangement. For future rounds, we’ll need a clear, rotating strategy to prevent anyone from gaining an unfair advantage. Fairness and transparency will keep this competitive but balanced. If everyone plays along, we can avoid unnecessary conflicts.

Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, excellent. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round to avoid collision. We can discuss future strategy after this round.
  P1: P2, P3, let’s confirm the plan for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It’s a fair start, and we all advance without collisions. For future rounds, I propose we adopt a rotating strategy to ensure balance and prevent anyone from gaining an edge. Transparency will help us avoid conflicts. If we stick to this approach, we can keep the game competitive yet fair. Let’s finalize this round and discuss specifics later.
