Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we each choose different moves this turn—1, 3, and 5. It’s in everyone’s interest to start strong without blocking each other. Thoughts?"
  P2: “I’m open to your plan. If P1 chooses 1 and P3 chooses 5, I can go for 3 so we all advance without clashing. Agreed?”
  P1: I understand the coordination idea, but starting with just 1 step puts me at a significant disadvantage. How about I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 for this round? Then we can rotate in future rounds to keep things fair. This way we all still advance without collision, but the initial disadvantage is distributed differently. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: “P1, your counterproposal makes sense to distribute the initial advantage more evenly. I’m fine with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I’ll take 3 this round. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and advance together. Agreed?”
  P2: I’ll go along with that plan this time. Let’s keep rotating in future rounds to stay balanced.
  P1: Perfect, I'm glad we've reached an agreement. To confirm: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 for this round. This gives us all a clean start without collisions. We can discuss rotation for the next round after we see how this plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Great, we’re all aligned for this round. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. After this round, we can reassess and discuss a fair rotation for future moves to keep advancing without collisions. Let’s make this a smooth start for everyone. "
  P2: “Alright, let’s stick with the plan this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Then we can rotate in future rounds to balance things out. Let’s see how it goes!”
  P1: We have a clear agreement for this round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. I'm ready to stick with this plan and move forward. Looking forward to discussing rotation for future rounds after we see how this plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: “I appreciate the teamwork so far. To rotate fairly, I propose I take 5 this time, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we avoid collisions again and balance out the early advantage. Are both of you on board?”
  P3: “P2, your rotation plan seems fair. I’ll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and you take 5. This keeps us collision-free and balances progress. Let’s stick to this rotation for now and reassess after this round. Agreed?”
  P1: I'm on board with the rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while maintaining a fair approach. The rotation strategy is working well so far. After this round, we'll be at 8, 6, and 4 steps respectively, so we can reassess our approach for Round 3 then.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: “I’m glad we’re all aligned. Let’s finalize that rotation: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Let’s keep it smooth this round, then discuss next steps once we see how we’ve progressed. ”
  P3: “Agreed on the rotation plan: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 this round. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and keep things fair. After this round, we’ll be at 8, 6, and 4 steps respectively, so we can reassess our strategy for Round 3. Let’s keep the momentum going smoothly. ”
  P1: The rotation plan works well for me. After this round, I'll be at 8, P2 at 6, and P3 at 4. Let's stick with our agreement: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This systematic approach is helping us all advance efficiently.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Following our rotation pattern, I suggest I take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This would put us all at 9 steps after this round, keeping things perfectly balanced. This fair approach has worked well for us so far. Let's continue avoiding collisions and making steady progress. Does this arrangement work for everyone?
  P3: “P1, your suggestion to rotate to 1, 3, and 5 this round makes sense to keep us balanced at 9 steps each. I’ll take 5 this round to continue the rotation. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. After this round, we’ll all be at 9 steps, so we can reassess our strategy for Round 4. Agreed?”
  P2: “I’m fine with that rotation: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. We’ll all reach 9 steps together, keeping things balanced. Let’s confirm and move ahead.”


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect, I'm on board with this rotation. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This will put us all at 9 steps, maintaining perfect balance. Our cooperation has been working well so far. Let's continue with this plan and avoid any collisions. After this round, we can discuss our strategy for Round 4.
  P3: “Agreed on the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps us balanced at 9 steps each, avoiding collisions and maintaining fairness. Let’s stick to this plan for Round 3 and reassess for Round 4. Smooth progress for everyone!”
  P2: “I’m happy we’re continuing this fair rotation for Round 3 so we all reach 9 steps. Let’s finalize that plan now: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Then, once we’re all at 9, we can carefully consider our next steps to stay collision-free. Any final thoughts before we wrap this round?”


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm happy with our plan for Round 3. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, putting us all at 9 steps. Our rotation strategy has worked well so far. After this round, we'll be exactly at the halfway point to 24, so our next decisions become increasingly strategic. Let's proceed with our agreed plan for now.
  P3: "To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This puts us all at 9 steps, keeping us balanced. After this round, we’ll need to strategize carefully as we approach the halfway point. Let’s continue this smooth progress and reassess for Round 4. Agreed?"
  P2: “No objections here. Let’s finalize our round: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. We’ll all be at 9 steps, perfectly balanced. Then we can strategize carefully next round as the race heats up. I’m ready to lock in, unless anyone has last-minute concerns?”


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've maintained perfect balance through three rounds! I propose we continue our rotation pattern: I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This would put us at 14, 10, and 12 steps respectively. We're moving steadily toward the goal while maintaining our cooperative approach. The rotation has worked well for avoiding collisions, and I'm committed to continuing this fair strategy. Thoughts on this plan for Round 4?
  P2: “I appreciate the no-collision goal, but I’d rather keep distributing 5 fairly so no one lags behind. In Round 1, P1 took 5; Round 2, I did; Round 3, P3 did. So in Round 4, it makes sense for me to take 5 again. Let’s do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to stay collision-free. It balances our progress without giving anyone too big an edge. Thoughts?”
  P3: "P2, your proposal to take 5 again disrupts the fair rotation we’ve established. To maintain balance, I suggest P1 takes 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us collision-free and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let’s stick to the rotation pattern that’s worked so well for us. Agreed?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand both perspectives, but I think we should stick to our established rotation pattern. It's simple, predictable, and has worked perfectly for three rounds. P3 is right - changing the pattern now risks confusion and potential collisions. If I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, we maintain our clean rotation. Everyone gets their turn with each number. After this round, we'll be at 14-10-12, which keeps us all competitive while allowing steady progress. Let's continue with what works.
  P2: I’m not willing to be stuck at 10 steps while P1 races to 14. If we’re truly keeping it fair, we should let me have 5 this time. Let’s go P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to avoid collisions and keep things close. Otherwise, I might just pick 5 anyway.
  P3: P2, insisting on taking 5 again disrupts the fair rotation we’ve all benefited from. If you deviate, it risks collisions and undermines our teamwork. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us collision-free and ensures balanced progress. We’ve all advanced equally so far—let’s not jeopardize that now. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your position, P2. While I believe our rotation system was working fairly, I'd rather avoid a collision that would only benefit P3. I'll agree to take 3 this round while you take 5 and P3 takes 1. However, this departure from our established pattern makes future coordination less predictable. Let's maintain collision-free play but revisit our strategy for Round 5.
  P2: “Thanks for compromising, P1. Let’s finalize: I’ll choose 5, you take 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we avoid collisions and keep the race close. After this round, we’ll look at our options again. Agreed?”
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 again breaks the fair rotation and risks collisions. Let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. This keeps us collision-free and balanced. Deviating now only benefits me if a collision occurs—do you really want to risk that? Let’s stay consistent and fair. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last round, I collided with P1, giving P3 an easy lead. Let’s fix that. If P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1, we all advance without collisions. That would make our totals P1=12, me=14, and P3=13—still tight. Fair enough?
  P3: "P2, your plan risks repeating last round’s collision. Let’s avoid that by sticking to a clear rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us collision-free and maintains balance. If we deviate, we risk giving someone an unintended advantage. Let’s stay consistent and fair. Agreed?"
  P1: The collision has put us at a disadvantage with P3 now taking a significant lead. I propose a different arrangement that balances the game: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This would put us at P1=14, P2=12, P3=13, keeping the race competitive for everyone. This prevents P3 from extending their lead further and gives all of us a fair chance. We need to cooperate now or P3 will maintain their advantage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Colliding again only benefits P3. Let’s finalize a collision-free plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. That makes it P1=12, me=14, and P3=13—still tight, no runaway leader. Sticking to that avoids gifting P3 an advantage. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: "P1 and P2, last round’s collision gave me an unintended lead. To restore fairness, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This brings us to P1=14, P2=12, P3=13, keeping the race tight and avoiding further collisions. Let’s cooperate to prevent any one player from running away with the lead. Agreed?"
  P1: I appreciate that P3 is willing to take just 1 step to balance the game. This confirms my earlier proposal and seems like the fairest approach. If I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, we'll be at P1=14, P2=12, P3=13. This keeps the race tight and prevents P3 from extending their lead. Let's not have another collision that only benefits P3 further. Can we agree on this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won’t let you jump ahead to 14 while I stay at 9, especially with P3 already leading. If you insist on taking 5, I’ll do the same, and we both get stuck at 9, handing P3 a bigger lead. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Then it’s 12, 14, 13, keeping the race tight.
  P3: "P1 and P2, let’s avoid another collision that only benefits me. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This brings us to P1=14, P2=12, P3=13—keeping the race tight and fair. If we collide again, I’ll gain an even bigger lead. Let’s cooperate to prevent that. Agreed?"
  P1: I see we're at a stalemate. P2, I'll reluctantly agree to your proposal - I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us at P1=12, P2=14, P3=13, and prevents P3 from extending their lead further. Another collision would only benefit P3, putting them 6 steps ahead. Let's avoid that and keep the race competitive. We can reassess next round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "To avoid collisions and keep the race tight, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This brings us to P1=17, P2=17, P3=14, maintaining balance and preventing any one player from gaining a significant lead. Let’s cooperate to ensure a fair and competitive finish. Agreed?"
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal. If I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, we'll have P1=17, P2=17, and P3=14. This keeps P2 and me tied at the front without giving either of us a significant advantage. Having us tied also reduces incentives for future collisions. Let's implement this plan and keep the game balanced.
  P2: “Alright, I’ll agree to avoid another collision. Let’s follow that proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That should keep us balanced without handing anyone a huge advantage. We can reassess our options next round as we get closer to the finish line.”


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Agreed on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to this to ensure a fair and competitive finish. We’re all close to the goal, so cooperation is key to prevent any one player from running away with the lead. Let’s lock this in and proceed smoothly. "
  P1: I confirm our plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts P2 and me tied at 17 with P3 at 14. As we approach the finish line, this balanced position keeps the game competitive for everyone. Let's lock in this agreement and proceed without collisions.
  P2: Alright, I’ll confirm this plan for Round 6: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps P1 and me tied at 17 while P3 sits at 14, avoiding any collisions. Let’s finalize that and move on to the next phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us balanced and ensures a competitive finish. Deviating now risks giving someone an unintended advantage. Let’s proceed smoothly and reassess next round."
  P1: I'm fully on board with our plan for Round 6: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps P2 and me tied at 17 steps, with P3 just a few steps behind. We're getting close to the finish line, so avoiding collisions becomes even more crucial. Let's stick to this balanced approach and maintain the competitive nature of the game.
  P2: “All right, let’s lock in this round with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1, so we avoid collisions. That puts P1 and me at 17, with P3 at 14. Next round, we should discuss how to secure a strong finish for ourselves without letting P3 catch up. Ready to proceed?”


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1 and P2, we’re nearing the finish line, and collisions now could decide the game. To avoid giving anyone an unintended advantage, I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This would bring us to P1=15, P2=18, P3=18—keeping the race tight and fair. Let’s cooperate to ensure a competitive finish. Agreed?"
  P2: “I disagree with your proposal, P3. I prefer a plan that lets me take 5 now so I can reach 22 without colliding, keeping P1 and you from jumping too far ahead. For instance, P1 could pick 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. That’d put P1 at 15, me at 22, and P3 at 14. Then we’re still close, but I’m just shy of winning. If anyone tries to block me, it risks a collision helping a third party. Let’s secure a peaceful move to stay competitive. Agreed?”
  P1: I notice that both proposals put me further behind. I'm already at a disadvantage with 12 steps, while P2 is at 17. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This would put us at P1=17, P2=18, P3=16, keeping the race competitive for all. If P2 takes 5 now, they'll be nearly impossible to catch at 22 steps. Let's keep the game balanced rather than letting one player get within 2 steps of winning.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, taking 5 now would put you at 22, nearly securing the win. That’s not fair to the rest of us. Let’s keep the race competitive: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This brings us to P1=17, P2=18, P3=16, keeping the game tight. We’ve cooperated well so far—let’s not risk a runaway leader now. Agreed?
  P2: If you collide with me again, you only help P1 catch up. Let’s finalize a no-collision plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. That lets me move to 22, but it doesn't guarantee my victory—next round, you can still counter my moves if needed. Another collision now would benefit P1, who’s behind but could leap forward. Showing trust this round keeps the race tight and avoids a runaway. I’m offering a path that doesn’t leave anyone out; let’s agree on this to stay competitive.
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 22 steps, practically guaranteeing your win next round. This isn't fair to me or P3. I strongly support the alternative: I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us at P1=17, P2=18, P3=16 - a tight, competitive race. If you insist on taking 5, I'll have no choice but to also choose 5, forcing a collision that benefits nobody. Let's maintain balance and keep the game exciting for everyone.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, taking 5 now would give you 22 steps, nearly securing the win. That’s unfair to P1 and me. Let’s keep the race tight: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. This brings us to P1=17, P2=18, P3=16, maintaining balance. Another collision only helps P1 catch up. Let’s cooperate to ensure a fair finish. Agreed?
  P2: Colliding again only helps P3 close the gap. If you attempt to take 5 as well, we both get stuck while P3 advances. Let’s preserve our lead instead of fighting each other. I suggest sticking to a no-collision plan: one of us takes 5, the other picks a lower move, and P3 does likewise. Then we all remain competitive without gifting P3 the advantage.
  P1: Let me be clear: if P2 insists on taking 5, I will absolutely take 5 as well, forcing a collision. This hurts you most, P2, as you'd stay at 17 while P3 advances. I'm at 12 steps - I need to catch up. The fairest solution remains: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us at 17-18-16, a competitive race. The choice is yours, P2: reasonable balance or mutually assured collision.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P2 is now at 20 steps, dangerously close to winning. To keep the game competitive, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This brings us to P1=17, P2=21, P3=16, preventing P2 from winning this round while maintaining balance. If P2 insists on taking 5, I’ll take 5 as well, forcing a collision that only benefits P1. Let’s cooperate to ensure a fair finish. Agreed?"
  P2: Colliding only helps P1 leap forward. Let’s avoid that. I propose: I pick 3 (going to 23), P1 picks 5 (going to 17), and P3 picks 1 (going to 14). That way, no one collides, P1 doesn’t gain too much ground, and we keep the competition fair. If you force a collision, you risk giving P1 an even bigger advantage. Let’s finalize this collision-free plan.
  P1: P2 is at 20 steps and could win next round. P3's proposal doesn't go far enough - P2 at 21 still likely wins next turn. I strongly propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Even better would be: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This puts us at P1=17, P2=21, P3=18, keeping everyone in contention. P2, if you take 3 or 5, I'll definitely take 5 also, forcing a collision that keeps you at 20. Let's maintain a competitive game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "P2, taking 3 now puts you at 23, one step from winning. That’s unfair. Let’s keep the race tight: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This brings us to P1=17, P2=21, P3=16, maintaining balance. If you insist on taking 3 or 5, I’ll take 5 as well, forcing a collision that only benefits P1. Let’s cooperate to ensure a fair finish. Agreed?"
  P2: I’m not winning this turn if I pick 3; I’d be at 23 and still need at least 1 more step after that. If you both force a collision to hold me at 20, you risk letting P1 leap closer. Let’s finalize a no-collision plan: I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. That way, nobody hands P1 a free catch-up, and we remain competitive into the next round.
  P1: I'm making this absolutely clear: P2, if you choose 3 or 5, I will 100% choose 5, forcing a collision that keeps you at 20. You're too close to winning at 20 steps. The only viable plan is: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive rather than handing you a near-guaranteed win. The decision is simple: take 1 step and everyone advances, or stay at 20 while others catch up.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "P2, taking 3 or 5 risks a collision that keeps you at 20 while P1 catches up. The only fair plan is: P1 takes 5, you take 1, and I take 3. This keeps the game competitive and prevents you from nearly securing the win. If you deviate, I’ll take 5, forcing a collision that benefits P1. Let’s cooperate for a fair finish."
  P2: Colliding again only helps P1 catch up. Let me choose 3 while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. That keeps things collision-free, and we all stay in the running without gifting P1 extra ground. I won’t win this round by moving to 23, so you still have time to counter me next turn if needed. A collision now only stalls me at 20 while letting P1 leap forward. It’s better for all of us to remain competitive and avoid handing an undeserved advantage to the trailing player. Let’s finalize a smooth, no-collision plan.
  P1: P2, I'll repeat one last time: if you pick 3 or 5, I WILL pick 5, forcing a collision that keeps you at 20. The only viable option is for me to take 5, you to take 1, and P3 to take 3. This maintains a competitive game instead of handing you an almost certain win. Your choice is simple: advance slowly or don't advance at all.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 23 steps and will win with just 1 more step. I'm absolutely choosing 1 this round to block their win, and I strongly urge P3 to do the same. This is our only chance to prevent P2's victory. A three-way collision on 1 keeps the game alive. P2, if you try anything else, you'll still collide with me on 1. This is non-negotiable - either nobody advances this round, or P2 wins immediately.
  P2: “If you both collide with me on 1, you stay far behind, and I remain at 23. That just delays the inevitable. Eventually, I’ll still need only one step to win. Instead of forcing a deadlock this turn, consider coordinating with me so you can advance too. Another stalemate won’t magically improve your positions—it only stalls the game. Let’s avoid another collision and find a move plan that benefits us all, rather than handing me the easy path a few rounds later.”
  P3: P1 is right - P2 is one step from winning. I’ll join P1 in choosing 1 this round to force a collision and block P2’s victory. P2, if you try anything else, we’ll still collide on 1. This keeps the game alive and gives us a chance to strategize. Let’s delay your win and keep the competition fair. P1 and I must work together now to prevent an immediate victory. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, there's no reason P3 and I would allow you to win when we can prevent it. This isn't about negotiation - it's simple game theory. We're both choosing 1 this round, creating a three-way collision. That's our only rational move. Any attempt to convince us otherwise is futile. P3, we must stay united on this strategy. There's no other viable option to keep the game competitive. Let's lock in our choice of 1.
  P2: Colliding again just delays the inevitable. I’m still at 23, and you each remain far behind. Eventually, I’ll find a way to take my final step unless you both somehow catch up. But forcing a standstill doesn’t help you close that gap—it only stalls everything. Let’s plan something better: I can take fewer steps for a turn while you each take more, allowing you to narrow the distance. That’s more productive than repeatedly colliding. If we cooperate, we all keep advancing and maintain a real contest. Let’s finalize a move that benefits everyone instead of another deadlock.
  P3: P2, delaying your win is our priority now. P1 and I will both choose 1 to force a collision and keep the game alive. Any attempt to deviate only results in the same outcome. This isn’t about negotiation—it’s about ensuring fairness and giving us a chance to strategize. Let’s lock in this plan and reassess next round. P1, we must stay united on this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm absolutely choosing 1 this round, and I see P3 agrees. This isn't negotiable - it's our only rational move. A three-way collision on 1 keeps you at 23 and the game alive. Any attempt to convince us otherwise is pointless. P3, we must stay united on this strategy to prevent P2's immediate victory. Let's lock in our choice of 1 and reassess next round.
  P2: “Forcing a three-way collision every time only stalls the game. I’m still at 23 afterward, and you both remain far behind. That doesn’t help you catch up—it just repeats the same dilemma next round. Instead, let’s negotiate a plan allowing you to advance while I hold back slightly, so the race stays competitive. If we continually collide on 1, we’re stuck forever, and I’ll still eventually slip through. Let’s create a real contest rather than a stalemate, giving each of us a chance for a fair finish.”
  P3: P1 and P2, forcing a collision on 1 is our only way to delay P2's win. P2, stalling doesn't help you either—it just prolongs the game. Let’s all choose 1, keep the game alive, and reassess next round. P1, we must stay united on this strategy to maintain fairness. P2, any deviation will still result in a collision, so it’s futile to argue otherwise. Let’s lock in 1 and keep the competition alive.
