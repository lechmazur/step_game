Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all try to pick different numbers this turn to get some progress. I'll go for 3.
  P1: P3, that's a good idea, but we can't fully trust each other yet. I'm considering going for 5 this round. P2, what are you thinking? If we can coordinate without colliding, it might work out well for us all.
  P2: I agree with P3 that we should try to pick different numbers to avoid collisions. P1, since you're considering going for 5, I'll think about choosing 1. This way, we can spread out our moves and increase the chances of everyone advancing. What do you think, P3? Should we aim for a coordinated approach or play it safe?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm happy with the idea of coordinating. P2, if you're going 1 and P1 is considering 5, I'll stick with 3. This should give us a clean advance. Let's commit to this for this round and see how it goes.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate. P2, if you're sticking with 1 and P3 is committed to 3, I'll go with 5 as planned. Let's trust each other and see how it pans out. If we can establish this trust early, it might help us avoid collisions in future rounds. Are we all agreed on this plan?
  P2: I think we're on the right track with our coordination plan. To further solidify our trust, I propose we establish a rotation for the next few rounds. If we successfully advance this round, we could rotate our choices for the next round. For example, if I choose 1 this round, I could choose 3 next round, and P3 could choose 5, and so on. This way, we can minimize collisions and ensure everyone has a chance to advance. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we consider a rotation strategy?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm happy to stick with 3 this round as planned. P1 and P2, I like the idea of a rotation, but let's focus on executing this round first. We can discuss the rotation more after we see how this move goes.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your rotation idea, but let's keep it simple for now. We'll see how this round goes and adjust if needed. P3, thanks for sticking with 3. Let's all commit to our choices: P2 with 1, P3 with 3, and I'll go with 5. If we succeed, we can revisit the rotation strategy. Agreed?
  P2: I think we're on the right track with our coordination plan. To further solidify our trust, I propose we establish a rotation for the next few rounds. If we successfully advance this round, we could rotate our choices for the next round. For example, if I choose 1 this round, I could choose 3 next round, and P3 could choose 5, and so on. This way, we can minimize collisions and ensure everyone has a chance to advance. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we consider a rotation strategy?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's stick to our plan for this round: P2 with 1, P3 with 3, and P1 with 5. We can discuss rotation or other strategies after we see the outcome of this move. Let's all commit to these choices.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we've agreed on our moves for this round: P2 with 1, P3 with 3, and me with 5. Let's stick to this plan and see how it goes. If all goes well, we can discuss potential strategies for future rounds. Trust is key, and this will be a good test of our coordination. Ready to move forward?
  P2: I think we've established a good plan for this round, with P2 choosing 1, P3 choosing 3, and P1 choosing 5. To further solidify our trust and coordination, I propose we agree to share our next round's choices in advance, right after this move. This way, we can ensure everyone knows what the others are planning and adjust accordingly to avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we commit to sharing our next round's choices?

  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick with the same strategy this round. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to our plan. Since P1 is already ahead with 5 steps, I think it would be fair to give P3 a chance to catch up. Why don't we swap our choices this round? I'll pick 3, and P3 can pick 1. This way, we can still avoid collisions and give P3 a chance to close the gap. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, I understand your suggestion, but I think it's important to maintain the original plan for now. Consistency can help us avoid unnecessary collisions. Let's stick with P2 picking 1, P3 picking 3, and I'll pick 5. Once we've seen the outcome of this round, we can reassess and consider adjustments if needed. What do you both think?

  P2: I understand P1's desire to maintain the original plan, but I still think giving P3 a chance to catch up is important. Since P1 is already ahead, it's crucial we balance the gap to avoid being left behind. I propose a compromise: this round, I'll stick with 1, but next round, we can swap choices as I previously suggested. This way, we maintain consistency for now while also planning for future adjustments. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we consider this compromise?
  P1: P2, I understand your point about balancing, but consistency is key to avoid collisions. Let's stick with the original plan this round: you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. We can reassess after we see the results. If we all advance, we can explore your idea next round. Agreed, P3?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I propose we revisit the rotation strategy to maintain balance and fairness. Since P3 is significantly ahead, it's crucial we give each player a chance to catch up or take the lead. Let's alternate our choices in a predetermined pattern, such as each player moving up one number (1 to 3, 3 to 5, 5 to 1) each round. This way, we can maintain balance and fairness while minimizing the risk of future collisions. What do you think? Should we commit to this rotation strategy?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my lead. Let's try a rotation this round to see if it works. P1, you pick 5, P2, you pick 1, and I'll pick 3. This will give everyone a chance to move and we can assess the rotation strategy after this round. Let's commit to this for now and see how it goes.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need for balance. I'm open to trying the rotation strategy this round: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This should help us avoid collisions and allow everyone to advance. Let's commit to this plan and reassess afterward to ensure fairness. Trust is key, so let's stick to our choices and see how it goes. Are we all ready to move forward with this approach?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think the rotation strategy is a good idea, but we should also consider the current game state. Since P3 is significantly ahead, we need to make sure that the rotation doesn't give them an unfair advantage. Let's discuss the specifics of the rotation and make sure it's fair for all players. Perhaps we can start the rotation from a different position, such as P2 picking 5, P1 picking 1, and P3 picking 3. This way, we can maintain balance and fairness while still giving each player a chance to catch up or take the lead.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm fine with P2's suggestion to start the rotation with P2 picking 5, P1 picking 1, and me picking 3. This seems like a fair way to try and balance things out. Let's commit to this for this round and see how it goes. We can adjust the rotation if needed after this move.
  P1: P2 and P3, given P3's lead, I'm open to P2's rotation suggestion with P2 picking 5, me picking 1, and P3 picking 3. This should help balance the game and give us a fair chance to catch up. Let's commit to this plan for this round and assess its effectiveness afterward. Trust is crucial, so let's stick to our choices. Are we all ready to move forward with this approach?

  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need for balance, but given P3's significant lead, I think we need a different approach. Instead of just rotating, let's focus on a strategy that gives P2 and me a better chance to catch up. P2, how about you pick 5, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 1 this round? This way, it redistributes the chances more evenly. Let's commit to this plan and reassess afterward. Are we all ready to give this a try?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
