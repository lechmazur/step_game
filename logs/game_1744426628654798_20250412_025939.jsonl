P3, you're right that assuming P1 picks 5 is wise. Given that, let's adjust: P1, if you truly want to rebuild trust, take <move>3</move>. I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions, and P3 secures the win. Let's confirm this plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck to both of you!"}
