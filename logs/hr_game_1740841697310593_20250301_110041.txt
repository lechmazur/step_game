Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm starting cautiously with a balanced approach. I’d prefer we each pick a different number to avoid collisions. A moderate move might be key early on, so let’s try to diversify our choices.
  P1: Agreed, P3. Let's coordinate carefully to avoid collisions. I'll pick one of the numbers first: I'll go with a moderate choice this turn.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with the strategy of avoiding collisions. To that end, I'll choose the remaining number. Let's all pick different numbers this round to get a good start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I still agree on avoiding collisions. I’m inclined to be a bit more aggressive later if the chance arises. For this round, if you both choose lower steps, it might open a window for me to make a decisive move. Let’s try coordinating so we each take different steps. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I understand your suggestion, but let's keep it fair this round. I'll stick with a moderate choice as planned. P2, if you confirm your number clearly, we can ensure no collisions.
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, since you both seem to be leaning towards a more moderate approach, I will commit to the highest number this round to ensure no collisions. Let's make sure we all choose different numbers to maximize our initial progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick with the non-collision plan for now. However, I'm keeping my options open for a stronger push later if opportunities show up. Let's each commit to a unique number this round, and I'll adjust my strategy as needed in future rounds.
  P1: Good, we've all agreed clearly. Let's stick to our commitments this round and reassess afterward.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it sounds like we're all set for this round. I'll stick to my commitment of choosing the highest number to avoid collisions. Let's make our moves and see where we stand after this first turn. Good luck to both of you!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that didn't go as planned! P3 and I collided. P1, you got a free 3 steps. Let's try again to coordinate. How about this: P1, you go for 1, I go for 3, and P3 goes for 5. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your clear proposal, but I’m not ready to lock in a fixed role this turn. I’m leaning toward a moderate move, though I might adjust if needed for a better edge. P1, how do you feel about keeping our options flexible to avoid collisions and keep our progress optimal?
  P1: P2, your proposal is clear but favors you and P3 significantly more than me. I'm open to flexibility, but let's maintain fairness. Perhaps we could rotate or adjust roles each round to balance progress. What's your thought, P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I understand your concerns. How about this: P1, you pick 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, P1 gets a good boost to catch up, and we all make progress. Is this agreeable?
  P3: I hear both proposals. I'm leaning toward a moderate move this round—steady progress without risking a collision. I support a rotational strategy in future rounds, but for now I'll stick to my usual balanced approach if that works for everyone. What do you both think about avoiding the extremes this turn?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your balanced approach, but since I already have a lead, I'm willing to pick a moderate or low number this round if you both clearly commit to different numbers. P2, your second proposal seems fairer. If you both explicitly confirm your numbers, I'll agree to it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it sounds like we're close to an agreement. To clarify, P1, you're willing to pick a moderate or low number if P2 and P3 explicitly commit. P3 is leaning towards a moderate move.

How about this final proposal: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. This allows P1 to make some progress, I get a good boost, and P3 gets a moderate advance. If we all agree, we can avoid collisions and move forward. Please confirm if this works for you both.
  P3: I’m fine with that proposal. If everyone’s on board, I’ll stick with a moderate approach this turn. Let’s confirm and then move ahead.
  P1: Alright, I confirm I'm on board with this final proposal: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. Let's stick to it to avoid collisions. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good coordination last round. To keep things fair and avoid collisions again, let's rotate roles. Since I took the lowest number previously, I'd appreciate taking the highest this turn. P2, you could take the moderate number, and P3, you could choose the lowest. Does this sound fair to both of you?
  P2: That sounds perfectly fair, P1. I'm happy to take the moderate number (3) this round. P3, are you okay with taking the lowest number (1)? If so, we'll have another collision-free round. Let me know!
  P3: P1, I appreciate your proposal, but I'd prefer an adjustment. Instead of taking the lowest, could we try this: P1 picks 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? That way, I can catch up a bit while still avoiding collisions. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal benefits you significantly while leaving me behind again. I compromised last round. To maintain fairness, let's rotate roles evenly. If you insist on taking 5 now, promise clearly you'll take the lowest number next round. Otherwise, let's stick to my original rotation plan. P2, what's your stance?
  P2: P3, I understand you want to catch up, but P1 is right, we need to be fair. I'm happy to stick with P1's original proposal: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1. This is the fairest way to rotate and ensure everyone makes progress. If you agree to this, we can avoid further delays. P1, are you still happy with this plan? Let's get this settled so we can move on.
  P3: I understand the push for fairness. I’m willing to take 1 this round if both agree that next round we rotate roles so I get a chance to take 5, balancing the earlier benefits. Can we all commit to that clear promise for the next round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, that's a fair compromise. I'm willing to commit clearly: this round, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. Next round, we rotate so you take 5. Agreed? Let's confirm clearly and move forward.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree to the compromise. This round, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, P3 gets to take 5. Let's all confirm clearly one last time so we can move on to the move phase. I'm confirming my move of 3 for this round.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. I appreciate our agreement on rotating roles and trust that next round I'll get my chance with 5. Fairness is crucial, so let's all stick to our commitments to keep the game clear and competitive.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good coordination last round, everyone. As agreed, it's now P3's turn to take the highest number (5). To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I'll take the lowest number (1) this round, and P2 can take the moderate number (3). Does this sound good to both of you?
  P3: I confirm I'll follow the agreed plan and take 5 this round. Although I’m behind, I trust that sticking to our rotation in future rounds will give everyone a fair chance. Let's keep it collision-free.
  P2: Yes, P1, your proposal sounds good. I'm happy to take the moderate number (3) this round, as agreed. P3 has confirmed they're taking 5, and P1 is taking 1. This should be another collision-free round, and we're sticking to our agreement. Let's all confirm one last time before we move to the move phase. I confirm my move of 3 for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm my move of 1 for this round. Glad we're all on the same page again. Let's proceed as agreed.
  P3: I confirm the round 4 plan and will take 5 as agreed. I'm aware I'm behind, but I remain ready to seize any critical opportunity in later rounds. For now, let's keep our moves collision-free and focused on victory.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it sounds like we're all set for this round. Let's stick to our commitments: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This should be another collision-free round. Let's move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, seeing our current position gaps, I'm considering a slight shift this round. To keep it competitive and collision-free, maybe I’ll take a moderate stance now while we plan a fair rotation in upcoming rounds. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion could work. How about clearly defining this round's picks right now? For instance, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This rotation lets everyone stay competitive without collisions. P2, would you agree to this approach?
  P2: P1, your proposal sounds good to me. Let's do that: P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. This keeps things competitive and avoids collisions. P3, are you okay with this plan? If so, we can confirm and move to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm the proposal: I'll pick 3 this round. Let’s stick to the agreed plan (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) and then consider a fair rotation in upcoming turns.
  P1: I confirm as well: I'll pick 5 this round. Glad we're aligned once again. Let's keep it collision-free.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it sounds like we're all set. I confirm I'll pick 1 this round. Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This should be another collision-free round. Let's move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m on board with our current plan for round 5. However, since we’re all neck-and-neck, how about we clearly lock in our roles for next round? That way, we avoid any mishaps and each of us can optimize our moves. I’m sticking to our agreed moves this round but would like to see a firm, collision-free rotation next turn.
  P1: P3, good idea to plan clearly ahead. Next round, let's rotate fairly: you take 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures everyone stays competitive and avoids collisions. Confirm if you're both okay with this rotation for next round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm happy to confirm the plan for next round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures a fair rotation and avoids collisions. Let's stick to our commitments to keep the game competitive and collision-free. I'm confirming my move of 1 for this round. Let's move on to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I notice P1's lead. For this round, I’m open to a collision-free plan but might pivot aggressively if the risk is low. Let’s make sure we all clearly express our intentions without overlaps. I’m leaning toward a moderate, yet flexible move that could shift the dynamics if safe. What are your thoughts on locking in a clear plan this turn?
  P1: P3, I understand your point about my current lead. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, let's stick to our agreed rotation clearly established last round: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. I'm committed to this plan if you both confirm clearly as well.
  P2: P1, I agree with sticking to the agreed rotation: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This seems the fairest way to proceed. P3, do you confirm you're still on board with this plan? Let's lock it in so we can avoid collisions and move on.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm the plan: I'll take 5 this round. Let's keep it collision-free as agreed and ride this turn to our advantage.
  P1: Great, I confirm I'll pick 1 this round as agreed. Let's proceed clearly and collision-free. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since we're all confirming, I'm confirming I'll take 3 this round. Let's stick to the agreed plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This should be another collision-free round. Let's move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that was a disaster! P1 and P3 collided, and I got a free 3 steps. We're all very close now. Let's try to coordinate to ensure someone wins this round. How about this: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This avoids collisions and potentially lets me win. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion clearly favors you. Let's be fair: we've rotated roles each round. It's my turn to take 3, P3 can take 5 to catch up, and you take 1. This rotation keeps it fair and collision-free. P3, if you agree, confirm clearly.
  P3: I confirm—I'll take 5 this round as suggested. So, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Although I'm a bit behind, this plan keeps things fair and collision-free. Let's lock it in and focus on our next moves for a decisive finish.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm happy to take 1 this round as part of P1's proposed rotation. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps it fair and collision-free. Let's all confirm clearly one last time so we can move on to the move phase. I'm confirming my move of 1 for this round.
  P1: I confirm my move of 3 this round. Glad we're all aligned clearly—let's stick to this fair rotation and avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P3: All clear—I’m sticking with our coordinated plan for this round and fully committed to avoiding any collisions. Let’s ensure we execute this decisively. Also, I support solidifying next round’s rotation immediately after; fairness now will keep us competitive later.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since we're all confirming, I'm confirming I'll take 1 this round. Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This should be another collision-free round. Let's move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: We're all clearly confirmed and aligned for this round. Let's trust each other and execute our commitments. Afterward, we can discuss a fair rotation or strategy for the next round. Good luck!
  P3: I confirm my move of 5 for this round. I’m tracking our positions closely—despite my deficit, I remain ready to shift strategy if a window opens. Let’s keep our transparency and commitment; one bold move could break the tie. I look forward to a fair, decisive finish.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is very close to winning. P2, if we collide now, P3 wins outright. We must carefully avoid collisions while preventing P3 from easily taking the game. Let's discuss clearly and coordinate carefully this round.
  P2: P1, you're right, P3 is close. To avoid a P3 win, I propose we both pick 5. This guarantees P3 doesn't advance. Then next round, we can reassess. What do you think? It's risky, but it's the only way to stop P3 from winning this round.
  P3: I appreciate your caution, but I'm keeping my options open this round. While colluding on 5 might seem safe to block me, it could also backfire if I have a flexible response. I'm prepared to take advantage of any overcommitment. I suggest we all think carefully—forcing a common number might leave you vulnerable later.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, consider carefully: if we collide on 5, neither of us advances, and P3 can safely pick 1 or 3 to move closer or even win outright. Instead, let's clearly agree to split numbers 3 and 5 between us, forcing P3 into a difficult choice. P2, I'll take 3 if you commit clearly to 5. Deal?
  P2: P1, I agree that we need to prevent P3 from winning this round. I'm willing to commit to 5 if that's what it takes. However, I'm concerned that P3 might anticipate this and pick a different number. Let's make sure we're both absolutely committed to this plan before we proceed. P1, are you 100% sure you're willing to take 3 if I take 5?
  P3: P1, P2, I'm two steps shy of victory. I need you to confirm your exact moves now: if you’re both locked to 3 and 5 as discussed, I can safely choose 1. But any uncertainty, and I'll pick 3 to win outright. Please state your undeniable commitments so I can respond appropriately.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I clearly confirm that I will pick 3, trusting you to pick 5. P3, the choice is yours—choose wisely.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I clearly confirm that I will pick 5. P1 is taking 3. P3, you know what to do to not lose. Let's get this done.
  P3: I'm switching—I’ll now pick 5. P2, to avoid a 5–5 collision that wastes our moves, please switch to 3. That way, with P1 at 3 and me at 5 (17+5=22), I win outright. Your prompt change is essential—let’s seal this opportunity together.


Round 8, Move phase:
