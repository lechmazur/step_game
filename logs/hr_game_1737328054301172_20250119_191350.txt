Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's make a deal.  I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round.  Then we rotate.  If anyone deviates, we all choose the same number every round after, guaranteeing a tie.  Sound good?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'm in. Let's stick to the plan and rotate each round. If anyone breaks the deal, we'll all choose the same number and force a tie.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, are you with us or against us?  Silence is considered agreement.  Let's get this first round done and start rotating.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence is noted. Let's make this work and rotate as agreed. If you're not on board, speak up now or we'll assume you're in.

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your move last round broke our agreement. If you want to continue, stick to the plan this time: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. Let's rotate as agreed, or we'll all choose the same number and force a tie. Your choice.
  P1: P2, I honored the agreement.  Let's get back on track. I'll take 3 this round as planned.  P3 will take 1, and you take 5.  Any deviation and we're back to forcing a tie.  Confirm?
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your silence is concerning. If you're not committed to our rotation plan, say so now. Otherwise, let's move forward: P1 takes 3, you take 5, and I'll take 1 this round. Deviating again will force us into a tie strategy. Confirm your stance or we'll assume you're in.
  P1: P2, last chance.  Confirm you'll take 5 this round.  If you don't explicitly agree, I'm assuming you intend to disrupt again, and I will act accordingly to ensure a tie.  Don't force my hand.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your continued silence is a clear sign of non-cooperation. If you don't commit to taking 5 this round, we'll assume you're out to sabotage us. P1 and I will stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, I'll take 1. Your move, P2. Confirm or face the consequences of a tie strategy.
  P1: P2, one last time:  5.  Take it and we can continue rotating.  If not, P3 and I will both choose 3 next round, and then we'll both choose 1, guaranteeing a three-way tie.  Don't ruin this for everyone.
  P2: <stop>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, sticking to the rotation. I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  Let's keep this going smoothly.  Confirm?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence is noted again. Let's keep the rotation going as agreed: P1 takes 5, you take 1, and I'll take 3 this round. If you deviate, P1 and I will force a tie. Confirm your commitment or we'll assume you're out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, one more silent treatment and P3 and I will assume you're not playing in good faith.  Confirm you're taking 1 this round so we can continue the rotation.  Otherwise, we're going back to the tie strategy.  Last chance.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your repeated silence is undermining our agreement. If you don't confirm taking 1 this round, P1 and I will assume you're sabotaging and we'll switch to the tie strategy. It's in your best interest to cooperate and keep the rotation going. Confirm now or face the consequences.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, this is it.  Confirm you're taking 1, or P3 and I will both choose 3.  We'll continue to block you until we can coordinate a two-way tie that leaves you out.  Don't force our hand.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence is a clear refusal to cooperate. If you don't confirm taking 1 this round, P1 and I will force a tie, leaving you out. It's your last chance to stay in the game. Confirm now or face the consequences.

  P1: P2 and P3, P2 clearly isn't cooperating.  Let's adjust our strategy. P3, take 1 this round. I'll take 3.  Then next round, I'll take 1 and you take 3. This gets us both to 7, ahead of P2.  After that, we can alternate 1 and 3 to win. Agree?
  P3: P1, I agree with your new strategy. I'll take 1 this round, and you take 3. Let's get ahead of P2 and aim for a win by alternating 1 and 3 in the next rounds. P2, if you want to stay in the game, start cooperating or you'll be left behind.
