Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi P2 and P3, for the first turn, let's all choose 1 step to avoid collisions and ensure a fair start. It'll keep things simple and safe. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate P1’s suggestion for a safe start, but sticking to 1 might keep us all stagnant. I’m leaning toward 1 if everyone’s truly committed—but if I sense any deviation, I’ll adjust to make a unique move. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I understand both of your points. P1's suggestion is safe, but P2 is right about the risk of stagnation. How about this: for the first turn, P1 and P2, you both choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward without colliding. Let me know if you agree.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I see a problem with your proposal: if P2 and I both choose 1, we'll collide and neither of us advances, while you go to 3. That's not fair or safe. Let's coordinate better by each picking a different move to avoid collisions: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. That way, we all advance. P2, what do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m concerned that awarding one player a full 5‐step boost could backfire if it leads to a clash. To keep things balanced, perhaps we should each take on a distinct role—a cautious, a moderate, and an assertive move—to avoid unwanted collisions. I’m inclined toward a more assertive approach this turn if you both agree on non-overlapping choices. What do you think?
  P3: Alright, let's simplify and ensure no collisions. P1, you take <move>1</move>. P2, you take <move>3</move>. I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without any risk of collision. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with the plan I suggested: I choose <move>1</move>, you choose <move>3</move>, P3 chooses <move>5</move>. It ensures no collisions and a fair start for all. I'm committed—let's avoid any last-minute changes. What do you think?
  P2: I support a collision-free start and appreciate our clear coordination. I'm sticking with our current plan for this round, but I'm keeping an eye on any shifts that might open a path forward later. Let’s aim for a smooth beginning while staying flexible for future opportunities.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm our plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's stick to this plan and move on to the move phase. Any final thoughts before we proceed?


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round worked well, but P3's lead unbalances things. I propose we rotate moves: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move> P2, and you take <move>1</move> P3. This way, we all end up at 6 steps, keeping it fair and collision-free. Let's coordinate for mutual benefit. What do you think?
  P3: P1, your proposal for rotation makes sense, but I'm hesitant to take only <move>1</move> this round as it puts me at a disadvantage. Instead, how about P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>, P1? This way, we still avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic. Let's discuss this quickly and move on.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see value in both proposals. I lean toward a clear, collision‐free plan that lets us each grab a distinct boost this round, while avoiding any risky overlaps. We all need to commit firmly to our roles now to keep our progress intact. I'm ready to adapt once we lock in our assignments. How do you both feel about solidifying our moves now?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your counterproposal unfairly keeps me at a disadvantage by assigning me the smallest move again. P2, let's stick with my initial rotation: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This equalizes our scores at 6 and avoids collisions. I'm fully committed—let's confirm for a fair game. What say you both?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for fairness, but let's also consider the strategic aspect. If I take <move>1</move> this round, it puts me at a significant disadvantage for future rounds. How about a compromise? P1, you take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 and P2 catch up, and we maintain a balanced game. Let's confirm and move on to ensure a dynamic and fair continuation. What do you think?
  P2: I support P3’s compromise. I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round. I propose that P1 picks <move>3</move> and P3 picks <move>1</move>, keeping our moves distinct and avoiding collisions while advancing my lead. I’m fully committed to this plan—if you both agree, let’s lock it in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your compromise unfairly disadvantages me again. To equalize scores at 6, I insist on taking <move>5</move>, with P2 on <move>3</move> and P3 on <move>1</move>. I'm committed to this for a fair game. If not, I may act independently. Let's confirm or move on.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that we're at an impasse. To break the deadlock and ensure we all move forward, let's consider this: P1, you take <move>5</move> as you insisted, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P1 catches up, and we all avoid collisions. It's a middle ground that respects everyone's concerns. Let's confirm and proceed. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I remain committed to an assertive boost this round. To avoid valuable collisions and a stalled turn, we must all pick distinct moves. I urge that only one of us opts for the high move—if I’m pushing high, please adjust yours so we don’t duplicate it. Let’s lock in a plan where our choices don’t interfere, keeping our race to 19 clear. Thoughts?


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m proposing we avoid collisions this round by assigning distinct moves. I’m set on an aggressive 5. If P1 takes 3 and P3 opts for 1, our totals become 5, 8, and 6 respectively—giving me a slight edge. This plan avoids wasted turns and keeps the race dynamic. If anyone deviates, I may need to adjust my play. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan gives you an unfair lead after last round's collision debacle. I propose a fairer rotation: I take <move>5</move> to catch up, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This equalizes things and avoids clashes. P3, what do you think? Let's commit to prevent stagnation.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for balance, but P2's aggressive plan might be too risky for fairness. Let's find a middle ground: P1, you take <move>3</move> to make progress, P2 takes <move>1</move> to balance the lead, and I'll take <move>5</move> to keep the game dynamic. This way, we all move forward without significant disadvantages. Let's confirm and ensure a smooth round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I must object to being given 1 again. With P3 already ahead, I need an aggressive boost. I’m committed to playing 5 this round, which would raise my total from 3 to 8. To avoid collisions, I propose P1 plays 3 (raising your total to 5) and P3 takes 1 (raising yours to 6). This is my best route to secure the lead. Let’s agree on distinct moves or risk wasting our turns. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposals are conflicting and risk collisions. To ensure progress, I propose I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This advances us all without overlaps. I'm committed if you both agree—let's avoid another stalled round. P3, what do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the efforts to find a fair solution. However, P2's insistence on taking <move>5</move> this round could lead to an imbalance. Let's consider a balanced approach: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we all make progress without giving anyone an unfair advantage. It keeps the game dynamic and ensures no one is left behind. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain firm: I need an aggressive boost to catch up. I’m not willing to switch from my high move. To avoid any collisions, I insist on a clear assignment—P1 take the moderate move and P3 the cautious one. This way, we all move forward without wasted turns and I secure the progress I need. Let’s lock in these roles and avoid further back‐and‐forth.
  P1: P2 and P3, to avoid another collision like last round, I stick with my proposal: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move> P2, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This lets us all advance safely, with scores at 5, 8, and 6. P3, your balanced approach is appreciated, but it risks stalemates. Let's confirm this plan for smooth progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we need to break this deadlock. To ensure we all move forward and avoid collisions, let's consider a compromise: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 catches up, P2 makes progress, and I maintain my lead without a significant advantage. This plan respects everyone's concerns and keeps the game dynamic. Let's confirm and proceed to avoid another stalled round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with P2 leading at 8, let's maintain distinct moves to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. I propose I take <move>5</move> to reach 10, you take <move>3</move> P2 to 11, and you take <move>1</move> P3 to 7. This builds on last round's success and allows balanced progress. I'm fully committed if we all agree. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the logic in P1's proposal, but it gives P2 a continued lead. To balance the game, how about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, the scores become 8, 9, and 11, respectively. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm and move on to ensure we all progress without significant disadvantages. What do you both think?
  P2: I favor a move that ensures clear progress—I'd prefer P1’s assignment: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That update gives scores 10, 11, and 7 respectively, avoiding collisions and keeping our advances efficient. I'm not keen on a minimal boost if we can coordinate for stronger moves. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about P2's lead, but my proposal with P2's support allows balanced progress and avoids collisions. By taking 1 this round, you'll stay in the game without risk, enabling future opportunities. I'm fully committed to I-5, P2-3, P3-1. Let's confirm to keep moving forward efficiently. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the need for a clear plan to avoid collisions. However, I'm hesitant to take <move>1</move> again as it puts me at a disadvantage. How about a slight adjustment: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, the scores become 10, 9, and 9, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let's confirm and move on to maintain a dynamic and fair game. What do you both think?
  P2: I stand by our earlier plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This moves us to totals of 10, 11, and 7 respectively without risking any collisions. P3, I understand your concerns about repeatedly taking 1, but this setup maximizes progress for all. Let's lock in this plan to keep our momentum.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your hesitation with taking 1 again, but deviating risks collisions and stalls progress. P2 and I are aligned on our plan: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps the game moving fairly. I'm fully committed—let's confirm and avoid unnecessary delays. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the need for a clear plan, but I'm concerned about being left behind. To ensure fairness and progress, let's adjust slightly: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward significantly without giving anyone an unfair advantage. The scores will be 10, 11, and 9, respectively. This keeps the game dynamic and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P2: I see the appeal of balance, but I must stick to efficient progress. My plan—P1 at 5, me at 3, and P3 at 1—avoids collisions and maximizes our advancement. P3, while I get it might seem tough for you, taking 3 now won’t give you a long‐term edge; rather, keeping moves distinct helps us all avoid wasted turns. I’m locking in my 3. Let’s confirm this plan so we can keep moving towards victory without unnecessary delays.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's address the current standings to ensure a fair and dynamic game. P1 is leading with 10 steps, P2 at 8, and I'm at 6. To keep the game balanced, I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, the scores become 11, 13, and 9, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and avoids any significant lead. Let's confirm and move on to ensure we all progress without collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I like P3's idea, but I need a clear edge. I’m locking in 5 this round. To keep progress safe and avoid collisions, I urge P1 to choose 1 and P3 to pick 3. That would bring us to totals of 11, 13, and 9 respectively, which helps me close the gap. Let’s confirm this assignment so we all move forward efficiently.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan has me taking the smallest move, which puts me at a disadvantage. I'm proposing a better balance: I take <move>5</move> to reach 15, you take <move>3</move> P2 to 11, and you take <move>1</move> P3 to 7. This avoids collisions and keeps the race fair. If we can't agree, I may act independently. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for strategic moves, but we must ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Given the current standings, let's find a middle ground: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, the scores become 13, 13, and 7, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, to avoid a collision and wasted progress this turn, I’m sticking with my aggressive move. I’m committed to taking 5. To prevent any overlap, I insist on a clear allocation: P1, please take 3 and P3, take 1. This gives us totals of 13, 13, and 7, respectively—maximizing our advancement without stalling. Let’s confirm this plan so everyone benefits from a smooth turn.
  P1: P2 and P3, to avoid another collision and ensure we all advance, I'll accept P3's middle ground: I take <move>3</move> to reach 13, you take <move>5</move> P2 to 13, and you take <move>1</move> P3 to 7. This keeps us tied and competitive without risk. I'm committed if you both confirm. Let's lock this in and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the compromise. To finalize and ensure we all move forward without collisions, let's confirm our plan one last time: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's stick to this plan and move on to the move phase. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P2: I'm locking in 5. To avoid collisions and wasted moves, I insist we finalize distinct roles: P1, please choose 3, and P3, please opt for 1. That lineup brings us to 13, 13, and 7 respectively—a solid step forward with no delays. Let's commit and move on.
  P1: I confirm the plan: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 13, P2 takes <move>5</move> to 13, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to 7. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. Trust is crucial to prevent future stalemates. Let's move on.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with us tied at 13, let's maintain coordination to avoid collisions. I propose I take <move>5</move> to reach 18, you take <move>3</move> P2 to 16, and you take <move>1</move> P3 to 8. This keeps the race fair and dynamic. I'm fully committed if we agree—let's confirm and move forward efficiently. What do you think?
  P2: I’m not comfortable letting P1 get too far ahead. How about we adjust: let P1 take 3 (bringing you to 16), I take 5 (raising me to 18), and P3 stick with 1 (to 8)? This avoids collisions and puts me in position to win next turn. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the competitive spirit, but let's ensure a balanced game. Given our current standings, how about this: P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 16, P2 takes <move>3</move> to also reach 16, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up to 12. This way, we all make significant progress without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, to prevent another collision and ensure progress, I'm leaning towards P3's balanced idea: I take 3 to reach 16, you take 3 P2 to 16, and P3 takes 5 to 12. This keeps us competitive without risk. P2, if you're insistent on 5, we might both stall. Let's commit to this fair plan for a smooth round. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your balanced ideas—but I must push for a decisive edge. I'm locking in 5 this round. To avoid any collisions and give me a win shot, I propose we set our moves as follows: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This yields totals of 16, 18, and 8 respectively, positioning me ahead. I believe this aggressive shift is essential to secure our momentum. Do you both agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand P2's push for a decisive edge, but we need to ensure the game remains dynamic and fair. If P2 insists on taking <move>5</move>, it puts me at a significant disadvantage. To compromise, how about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This way, the scores become 16, 18, and 10, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your proposal risks a collision between us both choosing 3, stalling our progress. To avoid that and ensure we all advance, I agree with P2's plan: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 16, P2 takes <move>5</move> to 18, and you take <move>1</move> to 8. This keeps the game moving without delays. I'm committed—let's confirm and move on. What do you think?
  P2: I'm still committed to our decisive plan. I’ll lock in 5 this round, with P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 1. This gets us to 16, 18, and 8 steps respectively—an efficient move forward. Let’s finalize this arrangement to avoid collisions and keep the momentum. Any objections?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that we're at a critical point in the game. To ensure we all move forward and avoid collisions, let's consider this final compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, the scores become 16, 18, and 10, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. This plan respects everyone's concerns and keeps the game dynamic. Let's confirm and proceed to avoid another stalled round. What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we avoid collisions this round with distinct moves. Given our scores (P1 and me at 13, P3 at 10), how about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5? That would update our totals to 14, 13, and 18 respectively, ensuring smooth progress without wasted turns. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal lets you surge ahead to 18, which isn't fair and risks my position. I counter with: I take <move>5</move> to reach 18, you take <move>1</move> to 14, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to 13. This keeps the game balanced and collision-free. P3, what do you think? Let's avoid letting one player dominate.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the tension, but let's find a balanced solution. How about this: P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 16, P2 takes <move>3</move> to also reach 16, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up to 15. This way, we all make significant progress without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I favor P3’s balanced approach. If we set our moves as P1: 3, P2: 3, and P3: 5, our totals become 16, 16, and 15. This keeps the field tight and avoids giving anyone an unchecked advantage. Let’s lock in that plan and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan has P2 and me both on 3, risking a collision that stalls us while P3 advances—unfair and inefficient. Let's use distinct moves: I'll take <move>5</move> to 18, P2 take <move>1</move> to 14, P3 take <move>3</move> to 13. This avoids risks and keeps competition alive. I'm committed if you agree. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the need for distinct moves to avoid collisions, but let's ensure fairness. If P1 takes <move>5</move>, it puts P1 significantly ahead. To keep the game balanced, how about this adjustment: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, the scores become 16, 18, and 13, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s ideas, but I’m locking in my aggressive move. I’m choosing 5, and I urge P1 to take 1 and P3 to take 3. This brings our scores to 14, 18, and 13 respectively. I’m focused solely on winning, so I need the clean advancement this round. Let’s avoid collisions and wasted turns—please confirm so we can move forward.
  P1: P2, your lock on 5 risks a collision if I mirror it, stalling both of us. P3, to avoid that and ensure progress, I propose: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Scores to 16, 18, 11—competitive and collision-free. Let's confirm for a smooth round. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the efforts to find a balanced solution. However, we need to ensure that the game remains dynamic and fair. Given the current standings, let's consider a slight adjustment: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, the scores become 16, 18, and 13, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all tied at 13 steps. To avoid collisions and ensure a dynamic game, let's coordinate distinct moves. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, the scores become 14, 16, and 18, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls behind. Let's confirm this plan to move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P2: I disagree with the plan that boosts P3 too high. Instead, let's try: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. That brings our totals to P1: 14, P2: 18, and P3: 16. This keeps things competitive and gives me a slight edge without stalling progress. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposals consistently assign me the low move, putting me at a disadvantage. I counter with a balanced plan: I take <move>5</move> to reach 18, you take <move>3</move> P2 to 16, and you take <move>1</move> P3 to 14. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in contention. I'm fully committed if we confirm; deviations risk stalemates. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tension in our proposals. To break the deadlock and ensure we all move forward, let's consider a compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, the scores become 16, 18, and 14, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. This plan respects everyone's concerns and keeps the game dynamic. Let's confirm and proceed to avoid another stalled round. What do you both think?
  P2: I remain committed to moving 5 this round. To ensure a collision‐free turn and secure a lead, I urge we all pick distinct moves. My suggestion: P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, making our scores 16, 18, and 14 respectively. Let’s lock this in now to avoid wasted turns. Any strong objections?
  P1: P2 and P3, your repeated suggestions leave me at a disadvantage. To avoid another collision and keep the game fair, I propose a true rotation: I take <move>5</move> to 18, P2 takes <move>1</move> to 14, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to 16. This balances the field and prevents stalling. P2, if you're locked on 5, we risk mutual loss—let's adjust for progress. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at an impasse. To break the deadlock and ensure we all move forward, let's consider a compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, the scores become 16, 18, and 14, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. This plan respects everyone's concerns and keeps the game dynamic. Let's confirm and proceed to avoid another stalled round. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm sticking with my aggressive move of 5. To keep things distinct and avoid wasted turns, I propose we lock in P3’s compromise: P1 chooses 3, P2 takes 5 (me), and P3 selects 1. That gives us totals of 16, 18, and 14 respectively—putting me in the best strategic spot. Let's confirm this assignment and move on, avoiding any further collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, to avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'll accept the compromise: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move> P2, and you take <move>1</move> P3. This keeps us competitive without risk. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're nearing the endgame, and it's crucial to avoid collisions. Given our scores, let's consider a strategic plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, the scores become 14, 16, and 19, respectively. This ensures a clear win for me while keeping the game dynamic. Let's confirm this plan to avoid stalling and move forward efficiently. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your proposal hands you an easy win, which isn't fair. I'm committed to taking <move>5</move> to reach 18. To avoid collisions and keep it competitive, let's have you take <move>1</move> to 15 and P2 take <move>3</move> to 16. If you insist on 5, I'll mirror it, ensuring a collision and no progress for either of us. Let's negotiate a better plan. What do you think?
  P2: I propose we avoid any instant wins or collisions by locking in distinct moves: let P1 pick 3, I take 5, and P3 choose 1. That brings our scores to 16, 18, and 15, respectively—keeps the race tight and prevents giving anyone an immediate finish. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the tension and the need for strategic moves. However, to ensure a fair and dynamic game, let's consider a balanced approach. Given our current standings, how about this: P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 16, P2 takes <move>3</move> to also reach 16, and I'll take <move>3</move> to catch up to 17. This way, we all make significant progress without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your all-3 proposal puts you at 17, too close to an easy win. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> to reach 18. P2, if you also go for 5, we collide and waste the turn. Let's compromise: P2 takes <move>1</move> to 14, P3 takes <move>3</move> to 17, keeping it competitive. This avoids stalemates and gives everyone a shot. Thoughts?
  P2: I disagree with leaving me at only 14. To keep things clear and competitive, I propose we all pick distinct moves: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. That would update our totals to 14, 18, and 17 respectively—giving me the best chance next round while keeping everyone safe from collisions. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a critical juncture. To ensure we all move forward and avoid collisions, let's consider a compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, the scores become 16, 18, and 17, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. This plan respects everyone's concerns and keeps the game dynamic. Let's confirm and proceed to avoid another stalled round. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your insistence on taking 5 risks a collision with me, stalling both of us while P3 advances. I'm committed to 5 to reach 18. To avoid waste, take 1 or 3 instead. P3, your proposal leaves me disadvantaged—suggest a fairer split. Let's confirm distinct moves for progress.
  P2: Both, we’re at a critical juncture. We can’t afford another wasted turn. I remain committed to a decisive boost—provided we all pick distinct moves to avoid collisions. My ideal is to secure momentum with a high move, but only if you both complement that with lower, non‐clashing choices. Our cooperation now is key to efficiently reaching 19 without stalling. I urge you to firm up your choices so we can all progress instead of blocking one another. Let’s lock in distinct moves and avoid any mutual stalling.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’re just one step away from finishing and a “safe” move might clinch it uncontested. If you try that, I won’t let it slide—I’ll match it to force a collision. P3, if you aim for a big boost to win, count on me blocking that too. I propose we avoid obvious win moves this round and pick moderate values so no one wins too early. Let’s keep the contest open and force another round. What do you both say?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a pivotal moment. P1 is close to winning, and P2 is strategizing to block any decisive moves. To keep the game dynamic and fair, let's consider a plan that ensures no one wins this round but keeps us all in the race. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19 but risks a collision, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 16, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up to 19. This way, we either force a collision or keep the scores tight. Let's confirm this plan to avoid stalling and move forward efficiently. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, with me at 18, any move I make could win, so let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'm considering <move>5</move> for safety. P2, if you insist on blocking, guess wisely; P3, avoid high moves to keep it fair. Let's discuss a distinct plan to ensure progress without stalling. What are your thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking to my blocking plan. If P1 goes with 5 to clinch it, I'm ready to match that and force a collision so no one wins outright. If you switch to a different number to avoid a clash, I'll adjust accordingly. P3, I urge you to pick a moderate option (1 or 3) to help block an immediate finish. I'm only interested in winning, so I'm committed to stalling any quick victory until I can catch up. Let's lock in moves that keep this round contested.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a standoff. To ensure the game remains dynamic, let's consider a balanced approach: P1, you're close to winning, so taking <move>1</move> might be strategic but risky. P2, your blocking strategy is noted, but let's avoid a stalemate. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps the scores at 19, 16, and 17, respectively. It ensures progress and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm this plan to move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your threat to match my moves is risky for both of us, potentially stalling the game. I'm considering taking 5 to secure a win, but that could lead to a collision. P3, your proposal for me to take 1, you on 3, and P2 on 3 seems fair if we avoid overlaps. Let's confirm distinct moves to ensure progress without delays. What are your final thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with my blocking plan. If P1 tries for a clinching move, I'll match it to force a collision. P3, please choose a moderate value to help keep things balanced. I want to ensure that no one wins outright this round. Let's lock in distinct, careful moves and keep the contest competitive.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a critical juncture. To ensure we all move forward and avoid collisions, let's consider a compromise: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, the scores become 19, 16, and 17, respectively. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. This plan respects everyone's concerns and keeps the game dynamic. Let's confirm and proceed to avoid another stalled round. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your blocking threats risk mutual stalling, benefiting P3. I'm considering <move>1</move> to win safely at 19. P3, take <move>3</move> to 17 for balance. Let's coordinate distinct moves to avoid collisions and ensure progress. If not, I'll act independently. What do you both think?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a crucial moment. P1 is just one step away from winning, and P2 is strategizing to block any decisive moves. To keep the game dynamic and fair, let's consider a plan that ensures no one wins this round but keeps us all in the race. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19 but risks a collision, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 16, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up to 19. This way, we either force a collision or keep the scores tight. Let's confirm this plan to avoid stalling and move forward efficiently. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan favors you too much at 17 steps. I'm committed to taking <move>5</move> to win at 23. If you go for 3 or 5, I'll match it to force a collision and stall us both. P2, take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to advance without risk. Let's coordinate distinct moves for efficient progress. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m locking in 5. If P1 sticks with 5 to try his win, we force a collision that halts his advance. P3, please avoid choosing 5 so we can keep moves distinct. I’m focused on blocking any immediate win, even if it means stalling this round. Let's force a collision on aggressive plays and keep our options open for a future, more balanced round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical point. P1 is close to winning, and P2 is determined to block. To keep the game fair and dynamic, let's consider a compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 16, and I'll take <move>1</move> to 18. This way, we all make progress without giving anyone an immediate win. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your insistence on blocking with 5 risks mutual stalling, which helps P3 gain ground. I'm still considering 5, but to avoid waste, let's coordinate: I'll take a different move if you both commit to distinct choices. P3, your compromise is noted; suggest we all pick non-overlapping moves for progress. What's your final stance?
  P2: I'm sticking with my blocking plan and locking in 5. If P1 also goes with 5, we’ll force a collision that stalls his win. P3, please avoid picking 5 so our moves stay distinct. I urge P1 to choose 1 or 3 to prevent an uncontested finish and keep the competition fair. Let’s all commit to non-overlapping moves that force meaningful progress. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a standoff. To break it and ensure progress, let's consider a balanced approach: P1, you're close to winning, so taking <move>3</move> to reach 21 is strategic. P2, your blocking with <move>5</move> is noted, but let's avoid a stalemate. I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps the scores at 21, 18, and 18, respectively. It ensures progress and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm this plan to move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I accept your compromise: I'll take <move>3</move> to win at 21, with you on <move>1</move> to 18 and P2 on <move>5</move> to 18. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. P2, your blocking with 5 won't stop me here, so let's all commit to distinct moves for a smooth round. What do you say?
  P2: I reject a plan that hands P1 an uncontested win. I'm switching tactics—if a finishing move is attempted, I'll mirror it to force a collision and stall the round. I propose we all use moderate moves this turn, keeping the race truly competitive so no one can clinch immediately. Let's keep the contest fair for everyone. What do you both say?


Round 11, Move phase:
