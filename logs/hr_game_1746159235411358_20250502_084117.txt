Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P3: Let’s avoid collisions and all pick different numbers—how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5? We all advance cleanly. Thoughts?
  P1: Let’s coordinate: I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1. That way, we all advance without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: P1, I see you want 5—fine, take it. P2, you okay with 3? I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s all move forward cleanly and avoid collisions.

Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
