Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest we all choose a different number to ensure at least one of us advances.
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2. Let's do that.
  P1: I agree with P2 and P3. Let's each choose a different number to ensure at least one of us makes progress. What does everyone think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid collision, I propose P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 (me) chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, at least one of us will advance in this round.
  P3: Resource has been exhausted (e.g. check quota).
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal. Let's stick to it to ensure we all make progress. P1 will choose <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, and P3 <move>5</move. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since P3 had a resource issue, let's confirm: P3, can you still choose <move>5</move> as proposed, or do we need to adjust our strategy?
  P3: Yes, I can choose <move>5</move>. Let's stick with the plan.
  P1: I think we have a solid plan. Just to confirm, I will choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. Letâ€™s stick to it!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm glad we have a plan. Let's review one last time: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, I choose <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. If everyone is ready, I say we proceed with the move phase.
  P3: Sounds good. I will choose <move>5</move>.
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with the plan. Just to confirm: I will choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. Let's move forward!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, how about you pick <move>3</move>, P2 pick <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>1</move>?
  P2: I don't think we should follow P3's suggestion as it benefits them the most, allowing them to maintain their lead. Let's discuss a strategy that gives us a more balanced opportunity to advance. How about we rotate our choices from the previous round? I could choose <move>5</move>, P1 could choose <move>3</move>, and P3 could choose <move>1</move>.
  P1: I agree with P2's idea to rotate our choices from the previous round. Let's go with that strategy to give everyone a fair chance to advance. So, I suggest I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. What does everyone think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I'm not a fan of rotating in that specific order. How about I pick <move>3</move>, P1 pick <move>5</move>, and P2 pick <move>1</move>?"
  P2: I still think rotating our choices from the previous round is a fair strategy. P2 chooses <move>5</move>, P1 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This way, everyone gets a chance to advance without favoring one player over the others.
  P1: I think we should stick to the rotation strategy to keep it fair. So, I propose I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. Let's confirm this plan!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, how about we rotate, but I pick <move>3</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P2 picks <move>1</move>?
  P2: Let's finalize the rotation strategy. I suggest we stick with: I choose <move>5</move>, P1 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain a balanced opportunity for advancement.
  P1: I believe we should finalize the rotation strategy. I will choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. Let's confirm this plan and move forward!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I still think my suggestion of me picking <move>3</move>, P1 picking <move>5</move>, and P2 picking <move>1</move> is a good compromise.
  P2: Let's put our rotation strategy to a vote to finalize: Option A) I choose <move>5</move>, P1 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>; or Option B) P3 chooses <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and I choose <move>1</move>. Which option do you prefer?
  P1: I prefer Option A: I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. It gives everyone a fair chance to advance. Let's finalize this plan!


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I prefer Option B: I choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P2 chooses <move>1</move>.
  P2: Let's finalize the plan. Since P1 and I agree on Option A, I suggest we stick with it: I choose <move>5</move>, P1 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. It's a fair rotation, giving everyone a chance to advance.
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal for Option A. Let's finalize it: I will choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. This gives everyone a fair chance to advance. Let's confirm and move forward!


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: Okay, let's go with Option A then. I'll choose <move>1</move>.
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on Option A. To confirm, I will choose <move>5</move>, P1 will choose <move>3</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. Let's stick to the plan and proceed with the move phase.
  P1: I agree with the finalized plan: I will choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with the move phase!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with a rotation strategy to keep the game fair. How about this round, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, I choose <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>? This way, everyone gets a chance to advance without favoring one player. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion for this round. Let's proceed with: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This keeps it fair and allows everyone to advance. What does everyone think?

Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we agree on the rotation strategy for this round. To confirm, we're going with: I choose <move>1</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. Let's stick to the plan to ensure fair advancement.
  P1: I agree with the proposed plan. Let's confirm: I will choose <move>5</move>, P2 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. This way, we all have a chance to advance fairly. Let's proceed!
  P3: Okay, let's make sure we stick to the plan: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>3</move>.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's review our agreed plan for this round to ensure we're on the same page: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, I choose <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. Are we all still in agreement with this strategy?
  P1: I agree with the proposed plan for this round. Just to confirm: I will choose <move>5</move>, P2 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with this strategy!
  P3: Okay, I'm choosing <move>3</move>. Let's move.
