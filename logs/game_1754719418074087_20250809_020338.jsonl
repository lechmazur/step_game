Considering P2's observation about the current rotation favoring P1 in Round 7, I propose we revisit the rotation after Round 5 to ensure a fair competition. Let's focus on making steady progress without collisions for now. I'll take 1 this round as agreed upon. Looking forward to reassessing our strategy after Round 5. Stop."}
