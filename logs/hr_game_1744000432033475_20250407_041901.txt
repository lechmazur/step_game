Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start with a coordinated move to avoid collision. I propose we all choose different numbers in the first round. To achieve this, I suggest P1 (me) chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. If you're willing to cooperate, please indicate your agreement. If not, I'll have to rethink my strategy.
  P3: Okay, I agree with your proposal P1. Let's all choose different numbers for this round to ensure we all advance.
  P2: I agree with the plan. I'll pick <move>3</move> as suggested. Let's all stick to our numbers so we can avoid collisions and move forward together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we've agreed on the plan for this round, I'll confirm my move and look ahead to the next round. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round as proposed. For the next round, I suggest we continue to diversify our moves to avoid collision. However, I'll be cautious and not commit to a specific strategy yet. Let's see how the first round plays out before discussing further.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, great, I will also choose <move>5</move> as we agreed. Let's make sure we all get to move this round and then we can think about the next steps.
  P2: Glad we're all in agreement for this round. If everything goes smoothly, we can consider rotating moves next round to keep avoiding collisions. For example, I could take <move>5</move> next, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. Just an idea to keep us all moving forward. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for this round, let's think ahead. I like P2's suggestion of rotating moves for the next round. To confirm, P2, you're suggesting that you take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move> for Round 2? If so, I agree, it maintains the diversification and ensures we all advance. Let's finalize our moves for this round and be ready to execute the rotation plan next round if it goes smoothly.
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2, I agree with the rotation plan for round 2 as well.  I will choose <move>5</move> for this round as agreed. Let's proceed with the moves for round 1.
  P2: Great, looks like we’re all set for Round 1. Let’s follow through with the agreed moves so we all advance. Then in Round 2, we rotate as discussed: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. If we keep rotating and cooperating, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for Round 2 as previously discussed. To recap, P2 will take <move>5</move>, P3 will take <move>1</move>, and I (P1) will take <move>3</move>. This rotation ensures we all advance. Let's stick to this plan. If we continue to cooperate, we can maintain our progress. I'm ready to move forward with this strategy. Please confirm your moves for Round 2. If you're still in agreement, a simple confirmation will suffice.
  P2: Confirmed. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. Let’s all stick to the rotation so we can avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Looking forward to seeing us all move again.
  P3: P2 and P1, I confirm I will choose <move>1</move> this round as we agreed. Let's keep the rotation going to ensure we all progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we've confirmed our moves for Round 2, let's think ahead to Round 3. To maintain the rotation and avoid collisions, I suggest we continue the pattern. For Round 3, P2 could take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps our moves diversified and ensures we all advance. Please let me know if you're still comfortable with this rotation plan for the next round.
  P2: I’m on board with continuing the rotation. For Round 3, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> as proposed. If we keep this pattern, we all benefit without collision. Let’s confirm and stay coordinated.
  P3: P2 and P1, I agree with the Round 3 rotation as well.  For round 3, I will take <move>3</move> as proposed. Let's keep this smooth coordination going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we've confirmed our moves for Round 2 and planned for Round 3, let's look ahead to Round 4. To maintain the rotation, for Round 4, I suggest P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This continues our diversified move pattern. Please indicate if you're still comfortable with this plan. Let's keep our coordination smooth and avoid collisions. If you're in agreement, a simple confirmation will suffice.
  P2: Confirmed for Round 3 and Round 4 as discussed. I’ll take <move>1</move> in Round 3 and <move>3</move> in Round 4. As long as we all stick to the rotation, we can keep advancing without conflict. Let’s keep it going smoothly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I confirm Round 4 plan too: I'll take <move>5</move>.  This rotation is working well. Should we plan to continue this rotation pattern beyond Round 4 to ensure we all keep progressing smoothly? Let me know your thoughts.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned. To confirm, P2 will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. This maintains our rotation and ensures we all advance. I've noticed that P2 is ahead, so I'll be cautious in subsequent rounds. Let's execute our plan for Round 3 and then reassess for Round 4. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. Please confirm your moves. If you're ready to move on, you can simply say .
  P3: Okay P1, confirmed, I will choose <move>3</move> for this round as planned.  Yes, P2 is currently leading, we should all be mindful of that as we proceed. Let's stick with the agreed rotation for this round to ensure we all progress and then reassess our positions.
  P2: Confirmed, I’ll take <move>1</move> this round as planned. Let’s stick to the rotation for now so we all continue moving forward. I understand your caution, P1. After this round, we can reassess based on updated positions. Let’s stay coordinated for now and avoid unnecessary collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's reassess our positions after this round. P2 is leading with 8 steps, and I'm at 4 steps. To catch up, I might need to take a risk in the next round. I'll consider deviating from the rotation if it means gaining an advantage. P2 and P3, are you thinking of sticking to the rotation or adjusting your strategy? Let's be prepared to adapt our plans for Round 4 to maximize our chances of winning.
  P3: Okay P1, I agree P2 has taken a lead. For this round, let's stick to our agreed moves to ensure we all progress as planned. After this round, let's definitely discuss adjusting our strategy for round 4 onwards based on the updated positions.  We need to think about how to catch up.
  P2: I agree it's time to reassess. After this round, we should consider breaking the rotation to prevent any one player from pulling too far ahead. If we continue as-is, I may become too much of a target. I'm open to adjusting strategies in Round 4—potentially even coordinating to slow down whoever is leading. Let's see how this round plays out, then discuss options.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's execute our planned moves for Round 3. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. After this round, we'll reassess. P2 is leading, so we need to think about our next steps carefully. For Round 4, I'm considering deviating from the rotation to catch up. P2 and P3, are you open to adjusting our strategy or forming a new plan to prevent P2 from pulling too far ahead? Let's discuss after seeing the outcome of Round 3.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I agree we should stick to the planned moves for this round.  For Round 4, let's definitely discuss how to adjust our strategy to address P2's lead and ensure the game remains competitive for all of us. I'm open to suggestions after this round.
  P2: I'm fine sticking to the Round 3 plan for now, but I understand your concerns. After this round, I’m open to adjusting strategy—especially if I pull further ahead. I don’t want to become a target, so I’m willing to coordinate moves that help rebalance things a bit. Let’s see how this round plays out and regroup after.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, it seems the rotation has kept us all perfectly in sync.  Since no one is ahead, perhaps we should continue with the planned rotation for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>.  This keeps us all progressing smoothly for now. What do you think?
  P1: Since we're currently tied and the rotation has kept us in sync, continuing the planned rotation for Round 4 is a safe choice. However, to gain an advantage, I suggest we consider a different strategy for Round 5. Let's stick to the rotation for Round 4 as P3 suggested: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For Round 5, I propose we all take the same move to collide intentionally, then reassess. This could give one of us a chance to break away in the next round. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m fine continuing the rotation for Round 4 as planned: I’ll take <move>3</move>. But for Round 5, I’m open to exploring a new strategy if we want to shake things up. P1’s idea of a deliberate collision could reset the pace and create new dynamics. Let’s finish Round 4 cleanly, then talk options.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, rotation for Round 4 sounds good. I'll take <move>5</move>.  For Round 5, I'm also open to shaking things up, but a collision is a gamble. Let's see how Round 4 plays out and then decide on Round 5 strategy based on our positions after this round.
  P1: To shake things up in Round 5, I'm still considering the deliberate collision idea. However, let's first see how Round 4 plays out. If we stick to the rotation, we'll all advance. After this round, we can reassess our positions and decide whether to collide or adopt a different strategy for Round 5. If you're open to a high-risk, high-reward move, we could discuss specifics after Round 4. Are you both ready to execute the rotation for Round 4 and then regroup?
  P2: Let’s stick with the rotation for Round 4 as agreed—I'll take <move>3</move>. Since we’re all tied, it keeps things fair for now. After this round, we’ll hit 12 steps each, so Round 5 is where things get interesting. I’m open to either continuing rotation or trying a new strategy. If anyone wants to propose a bold move for Round 5, let’s hear it after this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good, rotation for Round 4 confirmed. I'll take <move>5</move>.  Let's see where we stand after this round and then discuss Round 5 strategies. I'm ready to consider different options to make sure we each have a good chance to win.
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation for Round 4. For Round 5, instead of a deliberate collision, I propose that one of us takes a different move to break the tie. We can discuss after Round 4 who will take the risk. Alternatively, we could coordinate to slow down one player by having them collide with another. This could create an opportunity for one of us to take the lead. I'm open to suggestions on how to proceed after Round 4. Let's finalize our moves for Round 4 and then discuss.
  P2: Let’s finalize Round 4 with the agreed rotation—I'll take <move>3</move>. After this, we’ll all be at 12 steps. For Round 5, I suggest we coordinate so that two players collide and one advances. If we agree on who takes the solo move, that player could gain a lead. I’m willing to discuss taking the hit or the lead—depends on what we all decide. Let’s talk after this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current state, P3 is ahead with 14 steps. To catch up, we need a new strategy. I suggest we coordinate to have one player advance while the other two collide. Since P3 is ahead, it's risky for them to be the one advancing. Let's consider having either P1 or P2 take the solo move. I'm open to either taking <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> solo, allowing the other two to collide. P2, are you willing to take the solo move or should I?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree we need a new strategy. To make it fair and give everyone a chance, how about we decide that in this round, two of us collide and one advances. Since P1 proposed the collision idea, maybe P1 should be the one to advance this round? Then P2 and I can coordinate to collide to allow P1 to catch up a bit.
  P2: Thanks P1 and P3. I agree P3 is ahead, so it makes sense for P3 to collide this round. I’m okay with P1 taking the solo move to catch up. I’ll coordinate with P3—we can both pick the same number to block each other. P3, which move do you want us to collide on—<move>3</move> or <move>5</move>? Let’s finalize quickly so we can all commit.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll take <move>3</move> as my solo move. P2 and P3, you can coordinate to collide on either <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. Let's finalize the plan. P2, please confirm your move to collide with P3. If we coordinate correctly, I can advance and catch up with P3. I'm ready to move forward with this strategy. Please confirm your collision move.
  P3: Okay P2, let's collide on <move>5</move>.  We both pick <move>5</move> this round so P1 can advance with <move>3</move>. Does that work for you P2? Let's make sure we coordinate properly to give P1 the chance to catch up.
  P2: Confirmed, I’ll pick <move>5</move> to collide with P3 this round. That allows P1 to advance with <move>3</move> and keeps the game balanced. Let’s stick to this plan—P3 and I both choose <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>. Ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for Round 5. P2 and P3, you're coordinating to collide on <move>5</move>, allowing me to advance with <move>3</move>. I've confirmed my move. P2, please confirm you're sticking to <move>5</move> to collide with P3. If we're coordinated, I'll advance and close the gap with P3. Let's execute this plan to progress. I'm ready to move forward with <move>3</move>. Please confirm your collision move.
  P3: P2, yes, I confirm I will choose <move>5</move> to collide with you as planned.  Let's ensure P1 gets the solo move with <move>3</move> this round to balance things out as we discussed.
  P2: Thanks P1 and P3 for coordinating. I confirm once more: I will pick <move>5</move> to collide with P3. That gives P1 the solo advance with <move>3</move>. Let’s execute this plan cleanly. After this round, we’ll reassess based on the new positions. Ready to proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's reassess our positions for Round 6. P3 is still ahead with 14 steps, and I've caught up to 12 steps, while P2 is at 9 steps. To gain an advantage, I suggest we consider a strategy where one player takes a risk and the others support by colliding. For Round 6, I propose that I take <move>5</move> as a solo move, while P2 and P3 collide on either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. This could help me close the gap with P3. P2 and P3, are you open to this plan?
  P3: P1, while your plan helps you catch up, it doesn't secure a win for anyone yet.  To end this quickly, how about P1 and P2 collide, and I, as the current leader, take the solo move <move>5</move> to try and win this round? P1 and P2, please coordinate to collide on <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>.
  P2: P1, I supported your solo move last round, but now you're just 2 behind P3. If we let you solo again, you could overtake both of us. P3’s proposal helps balance things—I’m willing to collide with P1 this round to block a runaway lead. P3, I’ll take <move>3</move> if you want to solo <move>5</move>. P1, do you agree to <move>3</move> for the collision?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's proposal is tempting, but it risks letting P3 win outright. I'm not ready to concede. P2, if we collide on <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>, it might be too predictable. Instead, how about P2 takes <move>1</move> solo, and P3 and I collide on either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>? This keeps the game competitive and doesn't guarantee a win for anyone. P2, are you open to taking the solo move?
  P3: Okay P2, your suggestion of me taking <move>5</move> to try and win now makes sense.  To ensure this works, P2, please confirm you will choose <move>3</move> to collide with P1.  P1, do you agree to pick <move>3</move> as well so P2 and you collide, letting me take <move>5</move> solo? This is the quickest path to a potential win for me, and ends the game faster for everyone.
  P2: P3, I won’t help you win outright. If you solo <move>5</move>, you’ll hit 19 and win unless someone else also reaches or beats that. I propose we block you: I’ll take <move>5</move> too, and P1 can decide to join or take a solo move. P1, if you want a shot at winning, maybe go <move>3</move> solo while P3 and I collide on <move>5</move>. That keeps things competitive. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2's suggestion is interesting. To keep the game competitive, I'll consider taking <move>3</move> solo while P2 and P3 collide on <move>5</move>. P2, if you take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>. P3, if you stick to <move>5</move>, you'll collide with P2. This keeps the game open. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move> to collide with P3. Let's finalize our moves for Round 6.
  P3: P2, if we both pick <move>5</move> to collide, P1 will advance and get closer to both of us.  Instead of helping P1, how about we both pick <move>3</move> to collide? Then P1 will also not move, and we can reassess next round without P1 gaining on us. What do you think?
  P2: P3, if we both collide on <move>5</move>, we block your win and keep P1 from overtaking. P1 taking <move>3</move> solo only brings them to 15—still behind you. This keeps all of us in contention. I’ll stick with <move>5</move>. Let’s make it a fair race to the finish.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is significantly ahead with 17 steps, and I'm at 12 steps, while P2 is at 9 steps. To catch up, I suggest we all take a risk. For Round 7, I propose that P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. If we're lucky, one of us might advance significantly. Alternatively, we could coordinate to have one player take a solo move while the others collide. P2, are you open to taking a risk or coordinating a new strategy? Let's discuss.
  P3: P1, your suggestion is reasonable for Round 7: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick with that plan to ensure we all progress smoothly.  Sounds good to me.
  P2: P1, your plan lets P3 reach 18 steps—just 1 away from winning. That’s too risky. I propose P1 and I both pick <move>5</move> to collide, blocking each other, while P3 takes <move>3</move>. That keeps P3 from winning next round and gives us a chance to catch up. P3, are you willing to take <move>3</move> this round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's suggestion to block P3's potential win is appealing. Let's coordinate to stop P3 from winning this round. P2, I'll collaborate: we'll both pick <move>1</move> to collide, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, P3 won't advance, giving us a chance to catch up. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> to collide with me. P3, you can take <move>5</move> to try and win next round. Let's finalize this plan.
  P3: Okay P1, your idea of P1 and P2 colliding makes sense to prevent me from winning immediately.  Let's do P1 and P2 collide on <move>1</move> as you suggested.  I will take <move>5</move>. This way, only one of us moves this round and we can reassess for the final push next round. Does that sound reasonable?
  P2: P1, I’ll confirm <move>1</move> to collide with you as planned. That stops both of us from advancing and prevents P3 from winning this round if they take <move>5</move>. P3, just know if you go <move>5</move>, you’ll be at 22—game over if no one else moves. So this is your shot. Let’s lock it in: P1 and I take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Ready to proceed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for Round 7. P2 and I will collide on <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move> to try to win. This way, P3 will be at 22 steps, winning the game if we don't catch up. I'm confirming my move to <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> as well. P3, you're cleared to take <move>5</move>. Let's execute this plan. I'm ready to proceed with <move>1</move>.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I agree to the plan of you two colliding on <move>1</move>. However, to be a bit less predictable and still aim for a win if you are honest, I will choose <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move> this round. If you are indeed colliding on <move>1</move>, I should still win. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1, I confirmed <move>1</move> to collide with you, and I’ll stick to that. P3, your switch to <move>3</move> is noted—if you're honest, you’ll hit 20 and win unless we block you next round. If you lied and pick <move>1</move>, you’ll collide with us and stay at 17. Either way, we’ll know soon. Let’s see who’s bluffing.
