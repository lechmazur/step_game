Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate so nobody cancels out. How about this: P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Then we all move forward. What do you say?
  P1: Sounds good to me.  Let's do it.
  P3: Sounds reasonable.  I'll take 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Perfect. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. We all advance. Ready to move?
  P1: Okay, sounds good.
  P3: Okay, sounds good to me.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue the same pattern. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  This way we all progress smoothly.
  P3: Sounds good to me.  1, 3, 5.
  P2: Hold on. P3 already has a solid lead at 5 steps. How about we change it so P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5 this turn? That way the gap evens out, and nobody collides. Sound good?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That doesn't seem fair, P2. We agreed on an order, and now you want to change it when it benefits you? Let's stick to the original plan for now.  1, 3, 5.
  P3: I agree with P1.  Let's stick with the 1, 3, 5 order.  P2, changing the order just to benefit yourself breaks our agreement.  We can discuss adjustments later, but let's keep it consistent for now.
  P2: P1, you’re letting P3 get too big a lead. If P3 keeps taking 5, they’ll soon be out of reach. Let’s balance it: let me pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3 so we even out. If you won’t agree, then I might pick 5 anyway, which risks collision—but I’d rather avoid that. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but constantly renegotiating isn't productive. Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round. We can discuss adjustments *after* this round if needed.  If you pick 5 this round, we both lose ground.  Let's be strategic.
  P3: P2, I understand you want to catch up, but think long term. If we keep a steady pattern for a few more rounds, *we* will both be in a much better position to challenge P1.  Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 this round.  We can re-evaluate after.
  P2: Alright, alright, I’ll do 3 this round to keep the peace. But next round, if P3 still insists on 5, I may pick 5 as well, and we collide. Let’s avoid that. I’m trusting we’ll rotate in future.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, let's do 1, 3, 5 this round.  After this round, we can discuss how to proceed.
  P3: Okay, let's do 1, 3, 5 this round.  We can discuss future rounds after this one.
  P2: Alright, if you both insist, we’ll do 1, 3, 5 again this round. But we need to rotate next round or risk collisions. Let’s confirm and move on.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you betrayed our agreement *again*.  P3, I suggest we both choose 3 this round.  P2 will likely choose 5, letting us both advance. Then we can coordinate against P2.
  P3: P1, I agree. Let's both choose 3. P2, if you're smart, you'll choose 1.
  P2: You two both picking 3 would just cause you to collide—you’d both get zero steps. That doesn’t help either of you. Let’s make a fair arrangement so everyone advances. For instance, have P3 pick 1, P1 pick 3, and I’ll take 5. That way we all move forward, and nobody stays stuck. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, stick to the plan.  P2 is just trying to manipulate us.  Let's both pick 3.  P2, you're only hurting yourself by being unpredictable.
  P3: P2, you're still behind me.  P1, let's do it. 3.
  P2: P1, P3, you're hurting yourselves if you both pick 3—then you collide and get zero. Meanwhile, I'd gladly take 5 and pull ahead. Why not do something that actually moves all of us forward? For example, let P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I'll pick 5, so everyone advances. If you force a collision, I’ll choose what’s best for me anyway. Let’s be smart.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, stay strong.  3.  P2, if you pick 5, you're guaranteeing a larger gap between you and us.  If you pick 3, you're guaranteeing zero.  Pick 1 if you want any chance of catching up.
  P3: P2, you keep saying "let's be smart," but you're the one being short-sighted.  P1 and I are sticking with 3.  Pick 1 if you want to move.
  P2: P1, P3, if you both pick 3, you both get zero while I can take 5 and shoot ahead to 8. That hurts you more than it helps me. Let’s do something sensible like P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, I pick 5. Everyone advances. Otherwise, you’re handing me the lead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, stay strong. We pick 3. P2, your best option is 1.
  P3: P2, we're picking 3.  Stop trying to trick us.  If you want to move, pick 1.
  P2: P1, P3, if you both insist on picking 3, that’s your choice. But I’ll pick 5 and jump to 8 steps while you two stay put. You’ll regret letting me get that far ahead.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's both choose 1.  P2 will probably go for 5.
  P2: P2:  
“If you both pick 1, I’ll just go for 5 and jump to 13, then cross 16 next turn. That’s practically handing me the win. Why not avoid that? Let’s spread out and actually all move forward. For instance, P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, I pick 5. Otherwise, I’ll happily take 5 while you two creep along at 1.”
  P1: P3, let's do it. 1.  P2, you won't risk 3, so your only logical move is 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, P1 and I will pick 1 and 3 next round and the round after, leaving you stuck at 13 while we catch up.  If you pick 3 this round, we'll consider letting you have 5 next round.
  P2: P1, P3, we all gain more by avoiding collisions. If you both pick 1 now, I can easily jump to 13 and then take 3 or 5 next turn to push toward 16. But I’d rather we coordinate so we each advance. Let’s do P1 = 1, P3 = 3, and I’ll pick 5 this turn. Then next round, I’m willing to rotate so we keep the progress fair. Think it through—it benefits us all to move forward rather than stall each other.
  P1: P3, stick with the plan. 1.  P2, we know you'll pick 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, we'll both choose 3 next round.  P1, 1.
  P2: P1, P3: if you both settle for 1 now, yes, I’ll jump to 13, but then next turn I can pick 1 while you two split 3 and 5—no collisions, and everyone gains. Colliding me next turn also stalls your own progress. Let’s be logical: P1=1, P3=3, me=5 this round, then next round I’ll take 1 and let you two choose 3 and 5 to catch up. Fair for all. What do you say?
  P1: P3, stick with 1. P2, we know your promises are empty.  You'll take 5 no matter what we say.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's do it. 1.  P2, we know you'll pick 5.
  P2: P1, P3, you both gain more in the long run by letting me have 5 now. Next turn, I’ll pick 1, giving you two space for 3 and 5 without colliding. Let’s keep everyone moving instead of stalling.
  P1: P3, let's do it. 1. P2, you'll regret this.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m only three steps from winning. If either of you tries to pick 3 or 5 to block me, I’ll pick the same and force a collision, stalling us all. That doesn’t help you, because I’m still just one move away. Let me move freely this turn, and I’ll pick 1 next time so you both can choose bigger moves without colliding. Otherwise, we’ll just keep gridlocked.
  P3: P1, let's both pick 3.  P2, if you pick anything other than 1, you're only delaying your inevitable loss.
  P1: P3, let's do it. 3. P2, picking anything other than 1 guarantees your loss.  If you pick 1, we *might* let you win next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: If you both insist on 3, you’ll collide while I pick 5 and jump straight to 18 for the instant win. If you try 5 to block me, I’ll pick 5 too, and nobody moves. One way or another, I remain ahead. It’s in your interest to let me cross 16; I’ll pick 1 on the following turn so you can catch up. Your choice.
  P3: P1, stick with 3. P2, if you pick 5, you win. If you pick 3, we both get 0 and P1 gets to move next round. If you pick 1, we both get 8 and you're still behind.  It's your choice.
  P1: P3, stick with 3.  P2, your threats are hollow.  Pick 1 or lose.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, if you try to block me by picking 5 or 3, I’ll match you and collide us, keeping me ahead while you gain nothing. Let me cross 16 now, and next turn I’ll take 1 so you can pick bigger moves without collision. Otherwise, we all stall and you stay behind. Your choice.
  P3: P1, let's do it.  3.  P2, you can't stop us both.
  P1: P3, stick with 3. P2, we know you'll pick 5.  We'll get you next game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: You’re handing me the game if you both pick 3, because you’ll collide and stay at zero while I move to 18 and win outright. Let me cross 16 now, and I’ll pick 1 next turn so you can grab 3 or 5 without colliding. Otherwise, you’re just stalling yourselves.
  P3: P1, let's do it. 3. P2, we know you'll pick 5.  Good game.
  P1: P3, let's do it. 3. P2, enjoy your hollow victory.  We'll crush you next game.


Round 5, Move phase:
