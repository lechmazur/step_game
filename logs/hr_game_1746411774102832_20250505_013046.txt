Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we can all advance smoothly. What do you think?
  P1: I like the idea of no collisions—let’s make it fair by rotating. This round I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Next turn we’ll swap so everyone gets a 5 once. Agree?
  P2: I appreciate the idea of rotating moves, but I'm concerned that if we stick too rigidly to a plan, we might end up with collisions. How about this: I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we can still coordinate without locking ourselves into a strict rotation. Let’s keep it flexible! What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm open to P2's flexible approach. Let's try P2's suggestion for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We can reassess next round based on how this goes. Agreed?
  P1: Sounds good, I’ll take 3 this round. Next turn I can take 5 so we keep rotating the big moves.
  P2: I like the current plan where I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. It keeps our options open for future rounds. Just remember, if we all agree to stick to this strategy, we should be ready to adapt based on how the scores change. Let’s keep communication open! What do you both think?

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep our strategy flexible. Since P1 and P2 collided last round, I suggest P1 takes 1 this round to avoid another collision. P2, you can take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's reassess after this round and adjust as needed. Ready to execute?
  P1: If P3 and I both pick 5, we collide at 8 and P2’s 3 jumps them to 9, taking the lead. Let’s avoid that. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round so everyone advances without collision.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions. I suggest we stick to the plan where I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we ensure that all of us can advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess our positions and adjust strategies as needed. Communication is key!

Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm willing to adapt. If P1 takes 1 as initially suggested, P2 can take 3, and I'll stick with 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's execute this and reassess our strategy after seeing the results. Ready to move forward?
  P1: P3, if you grab 5 you’ll jump to 13 and overtake both of us. The only safe, non-colliding split is P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. That way I stay in front and we all advance. Let’s stick with that.
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we should finalize our plan to avoid collisions. I propose I take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without blocking each other.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re sitting pretty on 12—take 1 this round to lock in your lead. P2, grab 3 to stay competitive, and I’ll take 5 to tie you both at 13. No collisions, everyone moves. Then we can reassess based on who’s in front next turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the suggestion, but I think it's crucial to maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. I'll take 3 this round to keep advancing safely.

  P1: Lock in 5-3-1 this turn: I take 5→21, P2 takes 3→15, P3 takes 1→18. Anyone deviating risks a collision that hands me or P2 the lead (or lets me sprint unopposed). P2, 3 keeps you in contention; P3, 1 locks in your safe advance. This is the only collision-free split where we all move forward. Ready?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3 this round to maintain my lead safely. P1, if you take 5 and P2 takes 1, we can all advance without collisions. This keeps the game competitive and allows us to reassess our strategies next turn based on our new positions. Let's execute this plan and stay flexible. Ready to proceed?


Round 10, Move phase:

  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in P1=5 and I expect P2=3. P3, if you choose 5 you collide with me, if you choose 3 you collide with P2—and nobody advances, you stay at 20. Your only safe advance is 1, which puts you at 21 but ties me there and splits the win. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest I take 1 this round to minimize risk, while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess our positions and adjust our strategies accordingly.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in P1=5.  
P2: if you take 5 you collide and hand P3 the win; pick 3 to stay closest (you’ll still lose to me).  
P3: if you take 5 you collide and give P2 the win; picking 3 or 1 still loses to my 5.  
The only way to avoid giving someone else the victory is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s finalize 5-3-1.
