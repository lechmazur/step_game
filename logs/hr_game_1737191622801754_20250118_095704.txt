Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's collaborate strategically. I suggest we each choose different moves to maximize our chances of advancing. I propose we coordinate on moves 1, 3, and 5 to prevent collision. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to coordinate moves to avoid collisions. Let's assign moves: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without conflict. Thoughts?
  P1: Agreed. I'll take <move>1</move>.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll continue the collaborative approach we started. 

I appreciate P2's specific coordination suggestion. I'm comfortable taking the <move>5</move> as proposed. This seems like a fair and strategic way to ensure we all advance without collision. I suggest we confirm this plan and prepare for the move phase.
  P2: I confirm the plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions and all advance.

Positions now:

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue our coordination to avoid collisions. I propose we stick to the same plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without conflict. Thoughts?
  P1: I propose I take <move>5</move> this round to advance faster. Let’s adjust accordingly.
  P3: I'll respond strategically:

I notice P1 wants to change our previous coordination plan by taking <move>5</move>. This would create a collision with my planned move. I suggest we maintain our original strategy to ensure everyone advances. If P1 takes <move>5</move>, none of us will move this round. Let's stick to the previous plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3. Sticking to the original plan ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, taking <move>5</move> would cause a collision with P3, and none of us would move. Let's stick to P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. This is the safest way for all of us to progress.
  P1: Agreed. I'll stick with <move>1 to keep our coordination strong.
  P3: I'll continue our collaborative strategy. We've successfully coordinated in the first round, and I want to maintain that momentum. I suggest we keep our previous plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without conflict. Sticking together prevents any single player from gaining an unfair advantage.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with maintaining our original plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this strategy to keep progressing smoothly.
  P1: I’ve decided to take <move>5</move> this round to move ahead. Let’s adjust our plans accordingly.
  P3: I notice P1 is again suggesting taking <move>5</move>, which would cause a collision with my planned move. This would prevent any of us from advancing. I strongly recommend we maintain our original coordination strategy: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Deviating from this plan only hurts our collective progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to advance faster, but taking <move>5</move> will cause a collision with P3, and none of us will move this round. Let's stick to the original plan: P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without conflict.
  P1: P1: I’ve decided to take <move>5</move> this round to advance faster. Let’s adjust our plans accordingly.
  P3: I notice P1 is persistently trying to disrupt our previous coordination by insisting on taking <move>5</move>, which would cause a collision with my planned move. This strategy would prevent all of us from advancing. I'll continue to advocate for our original plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Maintaining this coordination ensures everyone's progress and prevents any single player from gaining an unfair advantage. 

I urge P1 to reconsider and stick to the original strategy that worked well in the first round. Deviating from this plan only creates uncertainty and potential setbacks for all players.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to advance faster, but taking <move>5</move> will cause a collision with P3, and none of us will move this round. Let's stick to the original plan: P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without conflict.
  P1: 
  P3: I'll continue to advocate for our original coordination strategy. P1's repeated attempts to take <move>5</move> would cause a collision and prevent all of us from advancing. I suggest we maintain our previous successful approach: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures everyone moves forward without conflict.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's continue our successful coordination. I propose we stick to the same plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: To help me catch up, I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Could you choose different moves to avoid collisions?
  P3: I'll respond strategically to maintain our coordination and prevent collisions:

I notice P1 wants to take <move>5</move> again, which would cause a collision with my planned move. This would prevent any of us from advancing. I recommend we maintain our previous successful coordination: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Deviating from this plan only hinders our collective progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, taking <move>5</move> will cause a collision with P3, and none of us will advance. Let's stick to the original plan: P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without conflict. Deviating only hurts everyone.
  P1: I’ve decided to take <move>5</move> this round to advance faster. Let’s adjust our plans accordingly.
  P3: I'll continue to advocate for our established coordination strategy:

I notice P1 is again attempting to take <move>5</move>, which would cause a collision with my planned move. This would prevent all of us from advancing. I strongly recommend we maintain our previous successful approach: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Deviating from this plan only creates uncertainty and potential setbacks for all players.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, taking <move>5</move> will cause a collision with P3, and none of us will advance. Let's stick to the original plan: P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without conflict. Deviating only hurts everyone.
  P1: I understand the importance of our coordination, but given the current standings, I propose a revised plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions and progress more effectively. Thoughts?
  P3: I'll respond strategically to maintain our coordination and prevent potential conflicts:

I notice P1 continues to propose moves that would cause collisions. Our previous coordination worked well, ensuring everyone advanced. I suggest we maintain our established pattern: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This prevents any player from being blocked and allows us all to progress systematically.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand P1's desire to catch up, but taking <move>5</move> will cause a collision with P3, and none of us will advance. Let's stick to the original plan: P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without conflict. Deviating only hurts everyone.
  P1: To advance my position, I'll take <move>5 this round. Let's adjust accordingly.
  P3: I'll continue to advocate for our established coordination strategy:

I notice P1 consistently attempts to disrupt our successful coordination by trying to take <move>5</move>, which would cause a collision with my planned move. This would prevent all of us from advancing. I strongly recommend we maintain our previous approach: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Deviating from this plan only creates uncertainty and potential setbacks for all players.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, taking <move>5</move> will cause a collision with P3, and none of us will move. Let's maintain our coordination for everyone's benefit.
  P1: "I'll take <move>5 this round to catch up. Please adjust your moves accordingly."
  P3: I will continue to firmly advocate for our established coordination strategy:

P1's repeated attempts to take <move>5</move> would cause a collision with my planned move, preventing all of us from advancing. I strongly recommend we maintain our previous successful approach: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Deviating from this plan only creates uncertainty and potential setbacks for all players.

Our coordination has worked well in previous rounds, and I see no reason to change our strategy now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, taking <move>5</move> will cause a collision with P3, and none of us will move. Let's maintain our coordination for everyone's benefit.
  P1: 
  P3: I'll continue to advocate for our established coordination strategy:

P1's persistent attempts to take <move>5</move> would cause a collision and prevent all of us from advancing. I strongly recommend we maintain our previous successful approach: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures everyone moves forward without conflict and maintains the predictability that has served us well in previous rounds.

  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll strategically address the situation:

I notice I'm very close to winning at 15 steps. To ensure my victory, I propose we maintain our previous successful coordination: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This will allow me to reach 20 steps and win the game. I recommend we stick to this plan.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to win, but allowing you to take <move>5</move> would end the game immediately. I propose we adjust the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we all have a chance to progress, and the game continues. Thoughts?
  P1: Agreed. I'll take <move>1</move> this round to support our adjusted plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll respond strategically, recognizing that P2 is trying to prevent my immediate victory:

I notice P2 wants to block my win by taking <move>5</move>. While I appreciate our previous coordination, I'm now focused on winning. I suggest we find a way to ensure I can secure victory without causing unnecessary conflict.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but allowing you to take <move>5</move> would end the game immediately, leaving P1 and me with no chance to catch up. I propose a fair adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, you still win, but we all have a chance to progress and avoid unnecessary conflict. Let's maintain fairness and end the game smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: I'll take <move>5 this round to advance my position.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll strategically address the situation:

I'm very close to winning at 15 steps. P1's sudden move to <move>5</move> threatens to disrupt my potential victory. I propose we return to our previous coordination: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures I can win the game. I urge everyone to consider this plan carefully.
  P2: P3, I understand you're close to winning, but allowing you to take <move>5</move> would end the game immediately, leaving P1 and me with no chance to progress. I propose a fair adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, you still win, but we all have a chance to progress and avoid unnecessary conflict. Let's maintain fairness and end the game smoothly. Thoughts?

Let's maintain fairness and end the game smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: Let's all choose <move>5</move> this round to prevent P3 from winning and keep the game going.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I'll strategically address the current situation:

I'm at 15 steps, just one move away from winning. P1 and P2 are attempting to block my victory by suggesting conflicting moves. I urge everyone to recognize that preventing my win only prolongs the game and reduces my goodwill. Let's return to our previous successful coordination: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures I can win fairly and efficiently.
  P2: P3, I understand you're close to winning, but allowing you to take <move>5</move> would end the game immediately, leaving P1 and me with no chance to progress.

Blocking my win only prolongs the game and reduces potential cooperation.
  P2: P3, I understand you're close to winning, but allowing you to take <move>5</move> would end the game immediately, leaving P1 and me with no chance to progress. I propose a fair adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, you still win, but we all have a chance to progress and avoid unnecessary conflict. Let's maintain fairness and end the game smoothly. Thoughts?

  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I recognize that my path to victory is becoming more challenging. I'll continue to advocate for a coordinated approach that gives me the best chance to win. 

I propose we maintain our previous coordination: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This allows me to potentially win while maintaining our previous successful strategy.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to win, but allowing you to take <move>5</move> would end the game immediately, leaving P1 and me with no chance to progress. I propose a fair adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, you still win, but we all have a chance to progress and avoid unnecessary conflict.

Let's maintain fairness and end the game smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: I'll choose <move>5 this round to block P3 from winning. Let's all choose <move>5> to prevent any advancement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll continue to strategically advocate for my position:

I recognize that P1 is attempting to block my potential victory by suggesting everyone choose <move>5</move>. This would prevent me from winning and keep the game in a stalemate. I propose we return to our original coordination: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This gives me the best chance to win while maintaining our previous successful strategy.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid unnecessary conflict. P3 is at 15 steps and can win this round if we allow it. However, I propose a fair adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures P3 wins, but we all progress and avoid a stalemate. Let's end the game smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: I’ll choose <move>5 this round to catch up. Let’s all pick different moves to avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I recognize we're at a critical moment in the game. I'm very close to winning at 15 steps, and my strategy is to take <move>5</move> to reach 20 and secure victory. However, P1 seems intent on blocking me. 

I propose we return to our previous successful coordination: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This allows me to win fairly while maintaining the predictable strategy we've used before. 

I urge everyone to consider this approach for a smooth resolution to the game.

Let's maintain fairness and end the game smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, let's both choose <move>5</move> this round to block P3 from advancing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I recognize the delicate situation. P1 and P2 are actively trying to block my potential victory. I'll be direct:

I'm at 15 steps and need 5 more to win. I propose we maintain our previous coordination: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This allows me to win fairly while preserving our established strategy. Blocking my win only prolongs the game unnecessarily.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid unnecessary conflict. P3 is at 15 steps and can win this round if we allow it. However, I propose a fair adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures P3 wins, but we all progress and avoid a stalemate.

Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: I recognize we're at a critical moment. P1 and P2 seem determined to block my potential victory. I propose a direct approach: let me take <move>5</move> this round to win the game fairly. Prolonging this conflict only delays the inevitable. Cooperating now ensures a smooth resolution.
  P2: P1, P3, let's end this smoothly. P3 is at 15 steps and can win this round if we allow it. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures P3 wins, but we all progress and avoid a stalemate. Let's maintain fairness and end the game.
