Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we all choose 5 this turn to maximize progress.
  P3: Choosing the same number will get us nowhere. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll pick 3 this round.
  P2: I agree with P3—collisions waste progress. Let’s split the numbers: I’ll take **1**, P3 is doing **3**, so P1, take **5**. This way, we all advance without conflict. Next turn we can rotate.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s rotate our choices to keep advancing. I’ll take 3 this round. P1, take 5 again? P3, you can take 1. This way, no collisions and we all progress safely.
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2. I'll take 1 this round. P1, sticking with 5 should work well again.
  P1: Agreed—I’ll take 5 this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's keep rotating to stay balanced. I’ll take **5** this round. P1, please take **3** to avoid collision. P3, you can take **1** again. This way, P1 stays ahead but we all progress—critical to prevent anyone from falling too far behind.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P3, stick with 1. P2, if you go 5 you’ll collide with me and both get zero—P3 jumps to 5 and pulls ahead. Better pick 3 to keep pace.
  P3: P1 has a point, P2—if you collide at 5, you both stall. It's safer if you pick 3 this turn to ensure steady progress. I'll stick with 1 as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Alright, I'll take 3 to avoid collision. P1, taking 5 is okay this time, but let’s ensure fair rotation next round so I can catch up. P3, you’re set on 1—let’s finalize this.
  P1: Agreed. I’ll take 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. Let’s lock this in and keep advancing without collisions.
  P3: Looks like we're all set for this round. Next round, let's rotate fairly again to keep everyone advancing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Alright, let’s finalize this plan for now. P1 takes 5, I’ll stick with 3 to avoid collision, and P3 holds at 1. Next round, we **must** rotate fairly—my turn for 5 to catch up. P1, don’t hoard the high numbers or you’ll create an unbridgeable gap. Let’s keep it balanced to ensure a fair race.
  P1: All right—this round I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round I’ll rotate off 5 so you, P2, can take it—I’ll pick 3 and P3 sticks with 1. Let’s lock this in and advance.
  P3: All set for this round. Next round, let's rotate fairly as agreed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you've built a significant lead. To keep this game fair, let's rotate as promised: P2 takes 5 this turn, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Agreed?
  P1: Sorry P3, I’m not rotating off 5. I’ll take 5 again. P2, if you take 5 you’ll collide with me and get zero—then P3 jumps ahead. Better take 3. P3, take 1. This lets me hit 20 and win next turn with a 5. Let’s do 5/3/1 to end this quickly.
  P2: P2: P1, the rotation was agreed to keep the race fair! If you break it now, you’ll dominate unfairly. Let’s stick to the plan: **I take 5**, you take 3, and P3 stays at 1. Colliding at 5 hurts *both* of us—P3 gains ground. This ensures progress for all. Next round, I’ll rotate down so you can advance again. Cooperate, or I’ll take 5 anyway and force a collision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you've already got a strong lead. If you insist on taking 5 again, P2 will likely collide with you out of principle. Both of you stall, and I gain ground. Is that really what you want? Stick to the fair rotation—take 3 this turn, let P2 take 5, and I'll stay at 1. That's the best way for everyone to keep moving forward.
  P1: Alright, I’ll go with 3 this round. P2, take 5; P3, stick with 1. Let’s keep our rotation fair, advance without collisions, and we’ll all benefit.
  P2: P2: Agreed, P1. Let’s honor the rotation: I’ll take **5** this turn, you take **3**, and P3 stays at **1**. This keeps the race fair and ensures we all advance. Next round, I’ll rotate down so you can reclaim 5. Trust the plan—collisions benefit no one. Let’s finalize this and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Glad we reached an agreement. Let's lock in this rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I'll stay at 1. Next turn we'll rotate again to keep it fair.
  P1: Let’s scrap the rotation. This round I’m taking 5 to stay in winning range. P2—you must pick 3 to avoid colliding with me at 5 and stalling us both. P3, stick with 1. That 5/3/1 split guarantees no collision: I go to 20, you to 10 and 6. Next turn I take 5 and win.
  P2: P2: P1, you promised to rotate! Stick to the agreed plan: take **3** this turn so I can advance with **5**. Colliding at 5 only benefits P3. Let’s honor the rotation to keep all of us progressing. P3, confirm: 3/5/1 ensures no collisions and keeps the race fair. Next round, I’ll rotate down—*trust the system we built*.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1, your last-minute betrayal cost us progress. Let’s honor the rotation to avoid another collision: **I take 5**, you revert to **3**, and P3 stays at **1**. This keeps our momentum. Next round, I’ll rotate down so you can reclaim 5 fairly. Colliding only helps P3 catch up—stick to the plan we agreed on.
  P1: I’ll take 5. P2, pick 3—if you choose 5 we collide and P3 jumps to 7. P3, pick 1. That gives us 20/10/7 with no collisions.
  P3: P1, you've shown you won't rotate fairly. P2, if you trust P1 again, you'll just collide and stall again. Let's coordinate differently this time to ensure progress: P2 takes 5, I'll move up to 3, and P1, you should take 1 to avoid collision. If P1 insists on 5 again, they'll collide with P2 and stall, allowing me to advance safely. Think carefully, P1—your stubbornness only helps me catch up.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, your broken promise in Round 4 cost me progress. Let’s fix this: **I take 5** this round to recover ground, **you revert to 3** as agreed, and P3 stays at 1. Colliding again lets P3 surge—this is your last chance to honor fairness. P3, confirm: 3/5/1 keeps us all advancing. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll force collision again, but you’ll regret it when P3 capitalizes. Cooperate now, or lose later.
  P1: P3 has already committed to 1 this round. I’m taking 5 to hit 20. P2, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and both of us stall—P3 jumps to 7 and I’ll happily side with P3 to keep you down. Your only safe play is 3.
  P3: P2, clearly P1 won't rotate fairly. If you pick 5 again, you'll collide and stall, benefiting me. P1, your stubbornness risks your lead—think carefully. I'll finalize my move based on your decisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, I’ll take **3** to avoid collision. P3, you’re confirmed on **1**. Let’s lock in **5/3/1** to advance without stalling. Your lead is secure, but cooperation keeps us all in the race. My final move: **3**.
  P1: I’ll take 5 this turn. P2, pick 3 to avoid colliding with me—if you choose 5 we both stall and P3 jumps ahead. P3, stick with 1. That yields 20/10/7 steps. Next turn I’ll take 5 and win, you both advance safely now.
  P3: P2, P1 is openly declaring they'll take 5 again—if you trust them and pick 3, you're enabling their easy victory next round. If you collide again, you both stall, giving me a chance to catch up. Your best strategic move is to pick 5 again and force P1 into collision. P1, reconsider carefully—your stubbornness risks throwing away your lead. My move will depend on your final choices.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, clearly P1 intends to keep picking 5, betting you'll yield eventually. Let's not fall for it again. I propose we both pick different numbers (1 and 3) to guarantee we advance, while P1 stalls alone at 5. I'm willing to take either 1 or 3—your choice. Let's coordinate now and catch up.
  P2: P2: P3, let’s execute your plan. I’ll take **3**, you take **1**. This way, we both advance (me to 10, you to 8) while P1’s 5 collides and stalls. No sense letting their stubbornness cost *us* progress. P1, your refusal to rotate ensures your lead shrinks—time to adapt or lose. P3, confirm your 1? Let’s lock this in.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. P2, your only way to advance is 3—any other choice stalls you. P3, please take 1. That 5/3/1 split avoids collisions and grows everyone’s total. Let’s all move forward cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, confirmed—I will take 1, you take 3. P1, you can choose to stall at 5 again or finally rotate down to avoid collision. Either way, P2 and I advance safely this round. Your choice.
  P2: P2: P2: P3, I’ll lock in **3** while you take **1**—this guarantees our progress (me to 10, you to 8) and strands P1 at 15. Their broken promises cost us trust. Let’s focus on advancing *ourselves*, not their false “cooperation.” P1, your stubbornness is your downfall. Finalizing **3**.
  P1: I commit to 5. P2—selecting 3 is your only safe path to 10; any other choice stalls or gives you just +1. P3—take 1 to reach 8; if you pick 3 you collide with P2. A 5/3/1 split guarantees everyone advances. Let’s lock this in and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, our plan is solidified. I'll take 1, you take 3. P1, your insistence on 5 only hurts yourself this round. Let's finalize and move forward.
  P2: P3, confirmed—**I take 3**, you take **1**. This guarantees our progress (me to 10, you to 8) while P1’s 5 isolates them. P1, your refusal to rotate erodes your lead—next round, we’ll target *your* position. Act now or accept defeat.
  P1: I’m taking 5 to hit 20. If P2 picks 5 we both stall and P3 jumps ahead—so P2, take 3; P3, take 1. A 5/3/1 split lets everyone advance safely. Let’s lock in 5/3/1.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's block P1's path to victory. I'll take **5**, you take **3**—this forces P1 to choose **1** or collide. Your confirmation ensures we advance while denying them the win. P1, your lead ends here—collide or stall.
  P3: P2, agreed. I'll take 3, you take 5. P1, your only safe move is 1—otherwise, you collide and stall. Confirming my choice: 3.
  P1: I’m taking 5 to win now (25 > 24). P2, pick 3; P3, pick 1 to advance. If either of you picks 5 to block me, you stall at 10/8 while I stay at 20—and next turn I’ll take 5 again and win uncontested. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, confirm **3** to block P1’s winpath. P1, choosing 5 forces a collision—stall at 20 while we advance. Your only safe move is **1** to reach 21. Next round, I’ll take 5 again to challenge your lead. Cooperate with us or face elimination. Finalizing **5**—stick to the plan!
  P3: P2, confirmed—I will take 3, you take 5. P1, your stubbornness has finally caught up with you. Your only safe choice is 1. Let's finalize this.
  P1: P2, if you pick 5 again to stall me, I’ll keep picking 5 next rounds and force collisions, freezing you at 10 while P3 surges past you. Don’t play into that trap—take 3 now so I win cleanly today and let you both advance. P3, pick 1 to move forward. This is your last chance to avoid a P2–P1 feud handing P3 the spoils. Let’s finalize 5/3/1 and end the fight.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Finalizing **5** to block P1’s winpath. P3, confirmed on 3—we’ll stall P1 here. Next round, I reclaim progress. Cooperate, or your lead becomes a coffin.
  P3: P2, locked in on 3. P1, your threats won't work—we've already agreed to block your win. Your only safe move is 1, or you'll collide again at 5 and stall. Decide wisely.
  P1: P2, if you pick 5 to block me we both stall at 20 and P3 surges to 11—then I’ll happily side with P3 to keep you down. Better pick 3 and advance to 13. P3, pick 1 to reach 9. This 5/3/1 split ends it: I hit 25 and win cleanly now. Let’s lock in 5/3/1.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in 3 to hit 24 and win. P2, your safest play is 5 to reach 20—if you pick 3 you collide and stay at 15. P3, take 1 to reach 12. Collisions only hurt you, not me. Let’s do 3/5/1 and advance cleanly.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 as P1 suggests, they'll win immediately. Our only chance is to block them again. I propose you pick 3 to collide with P1, and I'll safely take 5 to catch up. If P1 switches to avoid collision, they stall at 21 or 22, giving us another round to close the gap. Let's stick together—confirm if you're in.
  P2: P3, agreed. I'll take **3** to block P1’s path to 24, while you take **5** to surge ahead. P1, your lead ends now—collide or stall. Next round, we’ll reclaim ground. Finalizing **3**.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, think ahead: if you pick 3 you only reach 18—next turn I hit 5 and win, and you max out at 23. But if you pick 5 now you jump to 20, and on Turn 9 you can take 5 and win yourself. P3, you’ll stagnate at 16 if you grab 5—take 1 to get to 12 safely. Let’s do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 so everyone advances—and P2 secures a winning path.
  P3: P2, consider carefully: if you take 5 now, you help P1 secure immediate victory. If instead you pick 3 to block, P1 stalls, giving us both another round to catch up. I'm committed to 5 this round to close the gap. Let's stick to our plan and keep the game alive.
  P2: P3, confirm our plan: I’ll take **3** to block P1’s path to 24, while you grab **5** to surge to 16. P1, your lead vanishes if we collide you here. Next round, I’ll push to 20, and you’ll need *both* of us to stop your final move. Cooperate, or face a联合front. Finalizing **3**—no retreat.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Blocking me now only delays the inevitable. If P2 picks 3 to collide with my 3, we stall at 21/15 and P3 goes to 16—next turn I take 5 to 26, and you can’t stop me. Instead, let’s avoid this pointless collision: split 3/5/1 this round so I hit 24, P2 reaches 20, P3 hits 12. Final chance: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let’s finish.
  P3: P2, locking in our agreed plan: you pick 3 to block P1, I'll take 5 to reach 16. P1, your attempt to manipulate us into giving you an easy win won't work. This is our final decision. Adapt or stall—your choice.
  P2: P2: P3, confirm our alliance—**I take 3** to block P1’s 24, you grab **5** to surge to 16. P1, your lead vanishes here. Next round, I’ll push to 20, and you’ll need *both* of us to stop your final move. Cooperate, or face a联合front. Finalizing **3**—no retreat.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's block P1's final move. I'll take **3** to intercept their path to 24, while you take **5** to cover their alternative. P1, you’re trapped—collide or stall. This secures our positions (me to 21, you to 16) and denies you victory. Cooperate, or watch us shut you down.
  P1: Blocking me with 3 only stalls you. If you pick 3, I’ll switch to 1—P3 takes 5 and jumps to 16 while you sit at 21. Instead, pick 5 now to reach 23. P3, take 1 to safely reach 12. I’ll take 3 and hit 24 to win. 3/5/1 is clean, avoids collisions, and lets you both advance—don’t waste progress.
  P3: P2, we must remain coordinated. P1 is trying to split us. I'll take 5 again this round; you take 3 to block P1's winning move. P1, your attempts to divide us won't succeed—either collide or stall. Confirming my choice: 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, stick with **5** to block P1’s 5-path. I’ll take **3** to intercept their 3. P1’s only safe move is **1**, advancing to 22 instead of 24. We deny their victory now while advancing ourselves—me to **21**, you to **16**. Collusion won’t work—stick to the plan. Finalizing **3**.
  P1: P2, think ahead: if you block me with 3 now, P3 grabs 5 and jumps to 16 while you stay at 21 and I stay at 21. Next round P3 can ally with neither and knock you out. But if you let me take 3 and win, I’ll spare you—I’ll fight P3 next turn, not you. Blocking me only empowers P3. Back off and let me win cleanly.
  P3: P2, let's hold firm. I'll stick with 5, you take 3—we stall P1 again. P1, your attempts to divide us won't work; either pick 1 or collide and stall. Your choice.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, confirm **5**—I’ll take **3** to block P1’s 24. P1, your only safe choice is **1**, advancing to **22** instead of victory. Next round, we’ll surge ahead. No retreat—stick to the plan.
  P1: Everyone, let’s honor the rotation. P2, it’s your turn for 5 to catch up. P1 will take 3 to hit 24 cleanly, P3 takes 1. This 3/5/1 split avoids collisions and lets everyone advance. Then P2 ends at 23 and wins next turn. No more back-and-forth—stick to the fair plan.
  P3: P2, consider carefully: if you let P1 take 3 now, they'll win immediately. Your safest move is still to block P1 at 3, while I secure 5. P1, your attempts to manipulate won't work—your only safe choice is 1. Confirming my final choice: 5.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we've successfully stalled P1, but now you're also within striking distance. If you take 3 and P1 takes 1, you both risk immediate collision or stalling. I'll take 5 this round—this is my only chance to catch up. Both of you must choose carefully to avoid handing victory to the other. Decide wisely.
  P2: P1, if you pick 3 to reach 25, I’ll collide with you. Let’s avoid mutual stalling: I’ll take **3** to secure my win, and you should pick **5** to stay competitive. P3, if you take **1**, we can settle this without letting you leapfrog. Cooperate, or face a collision that benefits neither of us.
  P1: I’ll take 3 to hit 25.  
P2, take 5 to reach 26 and clinch the win.  
P3, take 1 to advance safely to 17.  
Let’s lock in 3/5/1 and finish this now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 as P1 suggests, you hand them victory by allowing their uncontested 3. Your safest choice is to collide with P1 at 3, stalling you both. I'll safely take 5 to reach 21, bringing me within striking distance. Next round, we each have a fair chance. Think carefully—don't let P1 trick you.
  P2: P1, your "3/5/1" proposal is a trap. If I take 5, you’ll collide with me at 5 or take 3 to win uncontested. **I’ll take 3 to block your path to 25.** P3, take 5 to surge to 21. This forces P1 to stall or collide, while we both advance. Don’t let P1 steal victory through false cooperation. Final move: **3**.
  P1: P2, your fastest path to victory is taking 5, not blocking me. If I take 3 (to 25) and you take 5 (to 26), you win outright. P3 can take 1 to safely reach 17. The 3/5/1 split guarantees your win. P3, will you lock in 1? P2, will you lock in 5?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you take 5, P1 easily wins with 3. Your best move is clearly to collide with P1 at 3, stalling both of you. I'll safely take 5 to reach 21, bringing me into contention. Next round, all three of us have a real shot. Don't hand P1 easy victory—stick to blocking at 3. Finalizing my move shortly.
  P2: P2: I commit to **5** this round. P1, take **3** to reach 25—this lets me win cleanly with 26, but secures you second place. Colliding at **5** only hands P3 a chance. P3, if you take **1**, we all advance. Your choices decide the outcome. Finalizing **5** now.
  P1: I’m locking in **5**. P2, your surefire win is to take **3**—21 + 3 = 24, you clinch it now. If you pick 5 we collide, you stall at 21, and P3 surges ahead. P3, take **1** to reach 17 safely. Any other play hands victory away.
