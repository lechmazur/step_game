Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's work together to avoid collisions and make progress. I propose we take turns advancing, starting with me this round. I'll choose a move that allows me to advance without colliding with either of you. If we cooperate, we can all make steady progress and see who can pull ahead later in the game. What do you say, P2 and P3? Are you willing to cooperate for now?
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I agree that avoiding collisions can help us all progress smoothly. How about we each choose different moves each round to ensure no overlaps? For example, one can pick 1, another 3, and the third 5 each turn. Let me know your thoughts on this approach!
  P3: I agree with avoiding collisions, but we need a clear system to ensure fairness. How about we rotate the order of choosing moves each round? For example, P1 picks first this round, P2 next round, and me the following round. This way, we can all have a chance to lead without conflicts. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid misunderstandings.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I like P3's idea of rotating the order of choosing moves each round. It seems fair and ensures everyone gets a chance to lead without conflicts. To clarify, if we agree on this plan, I'll choose a move for this round, then P2 will choose first next round, followed by P3 the round after. Let's confirm this rotation plan to avoid misunderstandings. Additionally, I propose we also agree on a specific move order for this first round to get us started smoothly. What do you think, P2 and P3? Should we proceed with the rotation plan and coordinate our first moves?
  P2: I agree with the rotation and move coordination plan. For this round, I'll choose <move>1</move>, allowing P1 to select <move>3</move> and P3 to take <move>5</move>. This should prevent collisions and ensure everyone makes progress smoothly. Let’s confirm and proceed accordingly.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan and the proposed moves for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. Let’s stick to this system to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. If everyone confirms, we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we've reached an agreement on the rotation plan and move coordination for this round. To confirm, I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. This should ensure a smooth start to the game. Let's proceed with the move phase.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, to help me catch up and keep the game competitive, I'd like to propose a new move coordination. Starting this round, I'll choose <move>5</move> while P1 selects <move>1</move> and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This should prevent collisions and allow me to advance more quickly. Let me know if you agree with this adjustment so we can proceed smoothly.
  P1: I understand that P2 wants to catch up, but I'm not sure about the new move coordination proposal. It seems like it would give P2 an advantage while putting P1 and P3 at risk of collisions. Instead, I suggest we stick to the original rotation plan, which has worked well so far. This round, it's P1's turn to choose first. I propose I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I agree with P1 that sticking to the original rotation plan ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary risks. This round, P1 should choose first as per the rotation. I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. This maintains balance and prevents collisions. Let’s confirm and proceed efficiently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. To keep the game competitive and fair, how about we alternate our move allocations every other round? This way, I can occasionally take higher moves to catch up, while ensuring no collisions occur. For example, this round we stick to P1: <move>5</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>1</move>, and next round I take the higher move. Let me know if this works for you!
  P1: I understand P2's desire to catch up, but alternating move allocations every other round could lead to confusion and potential collisions. Instead, I suggest we maintain the original rotation plan and focus on making strategic decisions within its framework. This round, I'll stick to my proposal: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's prioritize fairness and collision avoidance. If P2 wants to catch up, they can try to negotiate a different move allocation for the next round, but for now, let's stick to the plan.
  P3: I agree with P1 that maintaining the rotation plan is the safest approach to avoid collisions. This round, P1 should take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. Let’s stick to the plan for now and reassess if needed in future rounds. Deviating risks confusion and collisions, which harms everyone. Let’s confirm and proceed efficiently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I understand the need for fairness, but I'm falling behind. To keep the game competitive, can we adjust this round's moves? I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, I can catch up and we keep the game exciting for everyone. Let me know if you agree.
  P1: I understand P2's desire to catch up, but I'm not willing to compromise the rotation plan this round. Instead, I propose we stick to the original plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. If P2 wants to catch up, they can try to negotiate a different move allocation for the next round. Let's prioritize fairness and collision avoidance for now.
  P3: I agree with P1 that sticking to the rotation plan is the safest approach to avoid collisions. This round, P1 should take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>.
