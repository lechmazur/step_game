Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? P1, you pick 1, P2 you pick 3, and I'll pick 5.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we each pick a different number, we can all advance. I'll stick with 3 as proposed, and I encourage P1 to choose 1 and P3 to choose 5. Let's make this work!
  P1: Alright, I'll pick 1 as suggested. Let's coordinate properly to avoid collisions so we all progress. Trust is key here—once we start blocking each other, it'll just slow everyone down. Let's stick to the plan and move efficiently. Thanks, P2 and P3!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job in Round 1, everyone! Let's keep the coordination going. I suggest we stick to our previous plan but consider adjusting our moves slightly. P1, if you could pick 2 this round, P3 could stick with 5, and I'll choose 4. This way, we still avoid collisions while making progress. What do you think? Let's keep the trust and teamwork alive!
  P1: P2, our moves are restricted to 1, 3, or 5 only. Let’s maintain our successful coordination from Round 1 for predictability. I’ll take **1**, you take **3**, and P3 stays on **5**. This avoids collisions and ensures steady progress. Deviating risks invalid moves or overlaps. Trust the system we agreed on—consistency is key to victory.
  P3: P1 is right, P2. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. It worked well last round, and consistency is important. No need to overcomplicate things.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our original plan, but I think we should consider a slight adjustment to ensure we all advance effectively. If I pick 3 again, it might be beneficial for P1 to choose 1 and P3 to go with 5. This way, we maintain our coordination and avoid collisions. Consistency is crucial, but let’s also be open to slight variations if it helps us all progress. What do you think? Let’s keep the momentum going!
  P1: P2, your suggestion risks P3 dominating too quickly. Let’s adjust to balance progress: this round, I’ll stay on **1**, you take **5**, and P3 picks **3**. This keeps our moves distinct while slowing P3’s lead. We can rotate roles later. Fair play ensures a competitive race—trust this tweak to give everyone a fighting chance!
  P3: P1, your suggestion is reasonable. Let's try it. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. This will slow me down a bit, but it's a fair compromise. Let's see how it works out.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's willingness to adjust for fairness. I'll stick with P2's original suggestion to pick **3** this round. P1, if you maintain **1**, and P3 takes **5**, we can keep our coordination intact. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. Let's trust this plan and aim for a solid move forward together! What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3—let’s finalize the rotation plan for fairness. P1 stays at **1**, you P2 take **5**, and P3 picks **3**. This balances progress and prevents any single player from surging too far. Trust the adjusted plan—we all agreed on this shift earlier. Let’s execute it cleanly!
  P3: Okay, everyone seems to be settling on a plan. Just to confirm, P1 is picking 1, P2 is picking 5, and I am picking 3 this round. Let's stick to this plan for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's continue rotating fairly. This round I'll take 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions while letting me close the gap. Consistency in rotation ensures everyone progresses—let’s stick to the plan!
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, but I think we should adjust our moves to ensure we all progress effectively. I propose that I pick **3** this round, P1 takes **1**, and P3 goes with **5**. This way, we maintain our coordination and avoid collisions. Let's keep working together to make sure everyone advances, and remember that fair play benefits us all in the long run! What do you think?
  P3: P1's suggestion sounds good. I agree with P1. Let's do this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. This continues the rotation and ensures we all progress. Let's stick to this plan for the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P2, allowing P3 another 5 would let them leap to 13, creating a dangerous lead. Let’s honor the agreed rotation: I take **3** (to close my gap), you pick **1**, and P3 selects **5**. This keeps us all competitive. Fairness ensures no single player escapes—trust the plan we agreed on earlier! P3, you’re in? Let’s confirm and move.
  P2: I see we all have valid points, but we need to be strategic. If we let P3 take another 5, they could pull ahead significantly. I propose we stick to the rotation: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we maintain balance and ensure no one player dominates. We can adjust next round if needed, but let’s keep it competitive this turn! What do you all think?
  P3: Okay, it seems we're all mostly on the same page. To reiterate and finalize, let's go with P1 picking 3, P2 picking 1, and I, P3, picking 5 this round. This maintains the rotation and keeps things balanced. Let's stick to this plan and execute it in the move phase. Good luck to both of you!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Finalizing the rotation is critical to keep the race fair. I’ll take **3**, P2 picks **1**, and P3 selects **5** as agreed. This maintains balance—letting me close my gap without letting any of us surge ahead uncontested. Deviations risk collisions and unfair leads. Trust the plan: consistency ensures a competitive finish. Let’s confirm and move!
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our agreed rotation. However, I still believe we should be strategic about this round. Allowing P3 to take another 5 could give them a significant lead. How about we stick to the rotation: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we maintain balance and keep the competition tight. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all advance effectively!
  P3: Okay, everyone seems to be in agreement. Just to be absolutely clear, P1 will pick 3, P2 will pick 1, and I will pick 5. This is the final plan for this round. Let's stick to it and see how it plays out. Good luck to both of you!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's focus on a strategic approach this round. With P1 at 2 steps, P2 at 9, and P3 at 8, we need to ensure we all make progress without letting anyone surge too far ahead. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we maintain our coordination and avoid collisions. It's crucial we stick to a plan that keeps the competition tight. What do you think? Let's confirm our moves!
  P3: P2, your suggestion is the same plan we started with in Round 1. It makes sense to revert to that. P1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This will help me catch up to P2 a bit. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: P1: Let's continue the rotation to keep us balanced. This round, I'll take 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all progress without letting anyone surge too far. Last round’s collision was a setback—let’s stick to the agreed rotation to avoid repeats. Fair play keeps the race competitive!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I see we have different approaches this round. While I appreciate the desire to maintain balance, I think we need to be strategic. If I pick 3 and P1 picks 5, it allows P3 to potentially catch up. I suggest we stick to a plan that keeps the competition tight: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let’s confirm our moves and keep it competitive! What do you think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P1 picking 1, you picking 3, and me picking 5 sounds good. Let's revert to that plan. It's simple and effective. P1, are you okay with picking 1 this round? If so, let's lock it in.
  P1: P2 and P3, I need to close the 7-step gap. Let's adjust the rotation this round: I'll take **3** (to reach 5), P2 picks **1** (total 10), and P3 stays on **5** (to 13). This maintains our no-collision plan while letting me advance meaningfully. Fairness requires balancing progress—let’s confirm this tweak to keep the race competitive!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to adjust for balance, but we must also be cautious. If I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 takes 5, it keeps the competition tight without allowing anyone to surge too far. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure we all progress effectively and avoid collisions. What do you think? Let's finalize our moves and keep the race competitive!
  P3: Okay, let's try to find some common ground. P1, you need to advance more, so let's focus on getting you closer. How about this: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P2 picks 1. This allows P1 to move to 5, me to move to 13, and P2 to move to 10. What do you think?
  P1: P1: Finalizing to avoid collisions and let me advance: I'll take **3** (→5), P2 picks **1** (→10), and P3 takes **5** (→13). This keeps progress steady and prevents ties. Trust this plan to keep the race competitive! Confirm and move?


Round 4, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone. I'm at 13, P2 is at 10, and P1 is at 5. Let's try to keep things balanced. How about this: P1, you pick 5; P2, you pick 3; and I'll pick 1. This will move P1 to 10, P2 to 13, and me to 14. This keeps us all relatively close. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's plan for this round to keep coordination tight. I'll take **5** (→10), P2 picks **3** (→13), and P3 takes **1** (→14). This allows me to close the gap while avoiding collisions. Let’s confirm this rotation and keep the race competitive—fair progress ensures no one escapes too early!
  P2: I see that we all have a solid plan in place. However, I suggest we consider a slight adjustment to keep things competitive. If I pick **3**, P1 takes **5**, and P3 picks **1**, that allows P1 to advance significantly while keeping the race tight. This way, we can all make progress without letting anyone pull too far ahead. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure a fair and exciting round! What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the plan P1 and I agreed on: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This moves P1 to 10, P2 to 13, and me to 14. This keeps us all relatively close and avoids collisions. Let's finalize this plan and move forward.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan: I'll take **5** (→10), P2 picks **3** (→13), and P3 takes **1** (→14). This avoids collisions and keeps the race tight. Trust the strategy—no surprises. Execute cleanly to maintain momentum!
  P2: I agree with the plan we've discussed: I'll take 3, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This allows me to move to 13, P1 to 10, and P3 to 14, keeping us all close without collisions. Let's finalize this strategy and ensure we maintain momentum! What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's lock in the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This moves P1 to 10, P2 to 13, and me to 14. Let's execute this plan in the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: P1: Let’s strictly adhere to the agreed plan to avoid collisions: I’ll take **5** (→10), P2 picks **3** (→13), and P3 selects **1** (→14). Any deviation risks overlap and halting progress. Trust the strategy—we need consistent, coordinated moves to keep the race competitive. Confirm and execute as planned.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to our plan. However, I think we should consider a slight adjustment for this round. If I pick **3**, P1 picks **5**, and P3 takes **1**, it allows P1 to advance significantly while keeping the race tight. This way, we can all make progress without letting anyone pull too far ahead. Let’s finalize this strategy to ensure a fair and competitive round! What do you think?

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone, I'm at 14, P2 is at 13, and P1 is at 10. Let's try to keep things balanced and avoid collisions. How about this: P1, you pick 3; P2, you pick 5; and I'll pick 1. This would move P1 to 13, P2 to 18, and me to 15. This keeps us all relatively close while preventing anyone from surging too far ahead. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your willingness to maintain balance. However, I think we should adjust our moves for this round. If I pick **3**, P1 takes **5**, and P3 chooses **1**, it allows P1 to advance significantly while keeping the competition tight. This way, we can all make progress without letting anyone pull too far ahead. Let’s confirm this strategy to ensure a fair and competitive round! What do you think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's plan to prioritize balance. Let’s stick to: **P1 picks 5** (→15), **P2 takes 3** (→16), and **P3 selects 1** (→15). This prevents P2 from surging too far while letting me close gaps. Trust this plan—any deviation risks collisions and letting someone escape. Confirm and execute as agreed!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let's try my original suggestion: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. This moves P1 to 13, P2 to 18, and me to 15. This seems like a fair distribution of steps and keeps the game competitive. Let's lock this in. What do you think?
  P2: I see we have differing plans for this round. To keep the competition tight and avoid collisions, I suggest we stick to a balanced approach: I'll pick **3** (→16), P1 takes **5** (→15), and P3 chooses **1** (→15). This allows for steady progress while preventing anyone from pulling too far ahead. It's crucial we maintain coordination to keep the race competitive. Let's finalize this strategy and move forward! What do you think?
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid letting P2 surge too close! Stick to P2’s adjusted plan: I’ll take **5** (→15), P2 picks **3** (→16), and P3 selects **1** (→15). This balances progress and prevents P2 from jumping to 18. Collisions risk halting us—strict adherence ensures we stay competitive. Confirm and execute as agreed!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's try to find a plan we can all agree on. P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about balancing progress. How about this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. This would move P1 to 13, P2 to 18, and me to 15. This seems like a fair distribution of steps and keeps the game competitive. Let's lock this in. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we have different strategies for this round. To keep the competition tight and avoid letting anyone surge too far ahead, I propose this: I pick **3** (→16), P1 picks **5** (→15), and P3 takes **1** (→15). This allows everyone to make progress while maintaining balance. Let’s finalize this plan and ensure we keep the race competitive! What do you think?
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize P2’s plan to avoid P2 surging too far! I’ll pick **5** (→15), P2 takes **3** (→16), and P3 selects **1** (→15).

  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. With P2 at 13 and P3 at 15, I suggest we avoid collisions and keep the competition tight. I propose I pick **1** to stay close, while P1 picks **5** to catch up, and P3 picks **3**. This way, P1 advances significantly, P3 maintains a lead, and I stay competitive. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure we all progress effectively! What do you think?
  P3: P2, that's not a bad idea, but P1 and I collided last round. I'm thinking P1 should pick 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1. That would put P1 at 15, me at 18, and you at 14. This keeps us all in contention. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2’s plan to avoid collisions. Let’s finalize: I’ll pick **5** (→15), P2 takes **1** (→14), and P3 picks **3** (→18). This balances progress while preventing P3 from surging too far. No deviations—strict adherence ensures we advance safely. Confirm and execute!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your input, but I believe we should adjust our strategy to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. If I pick **1**, P1 picks **5**, and P3 goes with **3**, this allows P1 to catch up while keeping the competition tight. It also avoids any collisions. Let’s confirm this plan to maintain our competitive edge and ensure everyone progresses effectively. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's try to avoid collisions this round. I'm at 15, P2 is at 13, and P1 is at 10. How about this: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This would put P1 at 15, P2 at 16, and me at 16. This keeps us all relatively close and avoids any collisions. Let's lock this in. What do you think?
  P1: P1: Agreed, P3's plan keeps us balanced. Let’s finalize: I’ll pick **5** (→15), P2 takes **3** (→16), and P3 picks **1** (→16). No collisions, fair progress. Confirm and execute!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions. However, I think we should consider a slight adjustment for this round. If I pick **1**, P1 picks **5**, and P3 takes **3**, this allows P1 to advance significantly while keeping the competition tight. It also prevents P3 from pulling too far ahead. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure we all progress effectively and maintain a competitive edge! What do you think?
  P3: Okay, everyone, it seems we're converging on P1 picking 5, P2 picking 3, and me picking 1. This puts P1 at 15, P2 at 16, and me at 16. This avoids collisions and keeps us all close. Let's lock this in for the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: P1: Let's finalize the agreed plan to avoid collisions: I'll take **5** (→15), P2 picks **3** (→16), and P3 selects **1** (→16). This keeps us balanced and prevents P3 from surging to 18. Deviations risk collisions—strict adherence ensures progress. Confirm and execute as planned!

  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone, we had a collision last round. I'm at 16, P2 is at 13, and P1 is at 10. Let's try this: P1, you pick 5; P2, you pick 3; and I'll pick 5. This would move P1 to 15, P2 to 16, and me to 21. This will win me the game, but it's better than letting P2 win. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your plan risks collision if both you and P1 pick 5, wasting your lead. Let’s block you properly: **P2, pick 5 to collide with P3 if they try. I’ll take 3 (→13) to stay competitive.** P3, if you go for 5, you’ll clash with P2—leaving me closer. Cooperate with P2 to stop my advance, and I’ll reciprocate. Let’s avoid reckless moves and play strategically!
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on strategy this round. P3, if you pick 5, you'll risk colliding with P2, which could waste your lead. Instead, I suggest I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, P1 advances while keeping us all competitive. If P2 and I can avoid blocking each other, we can maintain a tight race. Let's confirm this plan and keep the game interesting! What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about me winning. However, if P2 picks 5 to block me as P1 suggests, we both lose out on potential progress. Let's try this: P1, you pick 3; P2, you pick 1; and I'll pick 5. This moves P1 to 13, P2 to 14, and me to 21, securing my win, but preventing P2 from surging ahead. It's the best outcome for everyone except P1.
  P1: P2, if you pick **5**, you can block P3's path to victory. I’ll take **3** to advance to 13. Let’s stop P3 at 16 now—colliding with them is better than letting them win. P3, your move risks us all losing if we don’t act. P2, this is your chance to stay competitive!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. If I pick 1 and P1 picks 3, we can both advance while blocking P3's potential win. P3, if you choose 5, you risk colliding with P2, which would waste your lead. Let's work together to keep the game competitive. I suggest: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all make progress while preventing P3 from winning. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be realistic. I'm close to winning. P1, you're too far behind to win. P2, you have a chance if we work together. Here's the deal: P2, you pick 3. I'll pick 5. P1, pick 1. This puts me at 21 and wins me the game, but it's better than letting P2 win if you block me. What do you say?
  P1: P2, pick **5** to block P3’s win attempt! If P3 chooses 5, we collide and halt their progress. I’ll take **3** (→13) to stay competitive. P3, this isn’t a bluff—colliding with you ensures none of us let you win today. P2, your move secures our chance to fight another round. Let’s act decisively!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to act strategically to prevent P3 from winning this round. If I pick **5**, I can block P3, while P1 takes **3** to advance. This way, we both make progress and keep the competition tight. P3, your plan to pick **5** could lead to a collision and waste your chance. Let's work together to ensure no one escapes too far ahead. What do you think? Let’s finalize our moves!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P2, let’s both advance while blocking P3! I’ll pick **5** (→18), you take **3** (→16). If P3 chooses 5, they collide with me. Let’s deny them victory here and push forward safely!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. If I pick **3** and P1 picks **5**, we can both advance while blocking P3's potential win. P3, if you choose **5**, we risk colliding, which could waste your lead. Let's work together to keep the game competitive. I suggest: I pick **3**, P1 picks **5**, and P3 takes **1**. This way, we all make progress while preventing P3 from winning. What do you think? Let's finalize our moves!
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we're all aligned on preventing me from winning this round. Let's make sure we all make progress. P1, you pick 5; P2, you pick 3; and I'll pick 1. This puts P1 at 18, P2 at 16, and me at 17. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game. Let's lock this in.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P3, your proposal puts us all in safer ground—let’s confirm: I take **5** (→18), P2 picks **3** (→16), and you choose **1** (→17). This avoids collisions and keeps pressure on you without letting P2 leap ahead. If you deviate to **5**, P2 and I will both pick **5** to block your win. Cooperate, or face resistance! P2, confirm your commitment to **3**? Let’s finalize.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on blocking P3 from winning while ensuring we both advance. I suggest I pick **3** to move to 16, P1 picks **5** to reach 18, and P3 can choose **1**. This way, we all make progress and prevent P3 from securing the win. It's crucial we coordinate effectively to keep the competition tight. Let’s confirm this plan! What do you think?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's make it official. P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This puts P1 at 18, P2 at 16, and me at 17. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game for another round. Let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your proposal to pick **1** this round sounds fair, but let’s ensure mutual compliance. P2 and I will commit to **5** and **3** respectively—if you deviate to **5** for the win, we’ll both pick **5** to block you. This ensures no unilateral advantage. P2, confirm your **3**? Let’s proceed transparently to avoid collisions and keep pressure on P3.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to ensure we block P3 from winning. I propose I pick **3** to move to 16, while P1 picks **5** to reach 18, and P3 takes **1**. This way, we all advance while preventing P3 from securing the win. It's crucial we coordinate effectively to keep the competition tight. Let’s confirm this plan and execute it! What do you think?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This puts P1 at 18, P2 at 16, and me at 17. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game. Let's stick to this plan and move to the move phase. Good luck!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's split the block: I'll take **5** to collide with P3 if they go for the win, and you pick **3** to advance to 16. If P3 chooses another number, we both gain ground. P3, this is your last chance to avoid collision—choose carefully!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. I suggest I pick **3** to advance to 16, while P1 picks **5** to block P3 if they go for the win. P3, if you choose **5**, it could lead to a collision with P1. Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all make progress while keeping the competition tight. What do you think?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's be realistic. I'm closest to winning. If I pick 3, I win. If you both pick 5 to block me, no one wins. How about this: I pick 3 to win. P1 and P2, you can decide how to split the points for second place. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, confirm you'll pick 3 to advance to 16. I'll take 5 to block P3's potential 5. If P3 picks 3 or 1, we both gain ground. P3, your "split second place" ploy won’t work—we block your path to 21. Stick to the plan: P1 (5), P2 (3). No deviations—collaboration ends when someone *wins*, not before!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. If I pick **3**, I can advance to 16, while P1 picks **5** to block P3's potential win. P3, if you choose **5**, it could lead to a collision with P1. Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all make progress while keeping the competition tight. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm at 17 and can win if I pick 3. You're both at 13. If I don't win, one of you will likely win next round. If you let me win, maybe I can offer some of my winnings to the second-place finisher. Otherwise, I'll pick 3 and risk a collision. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we must coordinate to block P3's potential win! Let’s both pick **5** this round. If P3 also picks 5 (to reach 22), we collide and halt their victory. If they deviate, we advance to 18. This ensures P3 can’t win alone. Trust this strategy—our mutual survival depends on it. Confirm you’ll pick 5?
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. If I pick **3**, I can advance to 16, while P1 picks **5** to block P3's potential win. P3, if you choose **5**, it could lead to a collision with P1. Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all make progress while keeping the competition tight. What do you think? Confirm your moves so we can execute effectively!
  P3: P1 and P2, I am one step away from winning. If I pick 3, I win. You are both at 13.

P1, you are too far behind to win. P2, you have a chance if we work together.

Here's the deal: I pick 3 to win. P2, you pick 5 to block P1. P1, you pick 1. This guarantees me the win, and P2 gets second place. What do you say?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we collided last round. I'm at 20 and can win by picking 1. You're both at 13.

P1, you can't win. P2, you have a chance if you let me win this round.

Here's the deal: I pick 1 to win. P2, you pick 3. P1, you pick 5. This guarantees me the win, and P2 gets second place. What do you say?
  P1: P2, let's both pick **1** to block P3's win. If P3 chooses 1 (to reach 21), we force a collision and stop them. If they deviate, we still advance. This is our only chance to deny them victory. Cooperate—stick to **1**. P3, your "deal" guarantees your win but we’re not falling for it. We block *first*, negotiate later.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to act strategically to prevent P3 from winning this round. If I pick **1** and P1 picks **5**, we can block P3's potential win while ensuring we both advance. P3, your proposal guarantees your victory, but we can stop you if we coordinate effectively. Let's work together to keep the competition tight. I suggest: I pick **1**, P1 picks **5**, and P3 picks **3**. This way, we can prevent P3 from winning. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm at 20. You're both at 13. If I pick 1, I win. You both know this.

P1, you can't win. P2, you have a chance to get second.

Here's my final offer: I pick 1 to win. P2, you pick 3. P1, you pick 5. This guarantees my win, and P2 gets to 16, ahead of P1. Take the deal or we all collide.
  P1: P2, we must both pick **1** to block P3's win. If P3 chooses 1 (to reach 21), our collision denies their victory. Any deviation risks letting them win. Cooperate—stick to **1**. Confirm commitment?
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to act strategically. P3, your proposal guarantees your win, but we can stop you if we coordinate effectively. If I pick **1** and P1 picks **5**, we can block your potential win while ensuring we both advance. This way, we can prevent you from reaching 21. Let's work together to keep the competition tight and deny P3 the victory. What do you think? Confirm your moves so we can execute effectively!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, you both know I win if I pick 1. You also know P1 can't win. P2, if you pick 1 with P1, you both stay at 13.

Here's my final offer: I pick 1 to win. P2, you pick 3. P1, you pick 5. This gets you both closer to the end. Take the deal, or I pick 1 and risk a collision. Your choice.
  P1: P2, trust me—**we must BOTH pick 1** to block P3’s win. If you deviate, P3 wins instantly. Pick 1 now, and we force them to gamble. P3, your "deal" is a trap. If we both pick 1, your 1-choice dies in collision. Cooperate with P1 or lose. Final plea: pick 1, P2!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to act strategically to block P3's win. If I pick **1** and P1 picks **5**, we can prevent P3 from reaching 21. P3's offer guarantees their victory, but we can stop them if we coordinate effectively. Let’s work together to deny P3 the win! I suggest we both pick **1** to force a collision and keep the game going. What do you think? Confirm your moves so we can execute this plan!


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we all collided last round. I'm still at 20, and you're both at 13.

P1, you can't win. P2, you have a shot at second place.

Here's my final offer: I pick 1 to win. P2, you pick 3. P1, you pick 5. This guarantees my win and gets you both closer to the end. Take the deal, or I pick 1 and we risk another collision. Your choice.
  P1: P2, let’s **both pick 1** again to trap P3. If they choose 1 (to win), we collide and block their victory. Any deviation from 1 lets them win instantly. Cooperate—our mutual survival depends on it. P3’s “deal” is a trap; don’t fall for it. Confirm you’ll pick 1!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to act strategically again. P3, your offer guarantees your win, but we can prevent it if we coordinate. If I pick **1** and P1 picks **5**, we can block your potential win while ensuring we both advance. Let's work together to deny you the victory! I suggest we both pick **1** to force a collision and keep the game going. What do you think? Confirm your moves so we can execute this plan effectively!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at the same point. I'm one step away from winning. You both know P1 can't win. P2, you have a shot at second.

I pick 1 to win. P2, you pick 3. P1, you pick 5. This guarantees my win and gets you both closer. Take the deal, or I pick 1 and we risk another collision. Your choice. I'm not bluffing this time.
  P1: P2, P3’s "deal" is a trap! If we both pick **1**, we **collide P3’s win attempt**, keeping them stuck at 20. Let’s stall them again—**stick to 1**. If you accept P3’s terms, they win *now*. We survive together or lose together. Next round, we can surge ahead. Don’t let P3 manipulate us—block first, strategize later!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to act strategically to block P3's win. If we both pick **1**, we can force a collision and keep P3 from winning this round. P3's offer guarantees their victory, but if we cooperate, we can deny them that chance. Let's confirm our moves: I suggest we both pick **1** to ensure we stay in the game and keep P3 at bay. What do you think? Confirm your commitment so we can execute this plan effectively!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a stalemate. I'm one step from winning, and you're both determined to block me. However, P1 can't win. P2, I propose a final deal: I pick 1 to win. You pick 3. P1, you pick 5. This guarantees my win, but P2 gets second place. If you don't agree, I still pick 1, and we risk another collision, benefiting no one. This is my last offer. What do you say?
  P1: P2, we must BOTH pick **1** again! If P3 chooses 1 (to win), our collision stops them. Any deviation lets them win. Stick to 1—survive together or lose separately. P3’s deal is a trap. Confirm you’ll pick 1!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to act decisively to block P3's win. If we both pick **1**, we can force a collision and stop P3 from reaching 21. P3's offer guarantees their victory, but if we cooperate, we can deny them that chance. Let's confirm our moves: I suggest we both pick **1** to ensure we stay in the game and keep P3 at bay. What do you think? Confirm your commitment so we can execute this plan effectively!


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. P3 is very close to winning. I suggest I pick **1** to block P3, while P1 picks **5** to advance. This way, we can prevent P3 from reaching 21. P3, if you choose 5, you'll risk colliding with P1. Let's work together to deny you the victory! What do you think? Confirm your moves so we can execute this plan effectively!
  P1: P2, let’s **both pick 1** to block P3’s final push! If P3 chooses 1 (to reach 21), our collision stops them—again. P1 picks 1, P2 confirms 1. No deviations—P3’s “deal” is a trap. If they pick 3 instead, we spread to 1 and 5 to block future wins. Cooperate now; we survive to fight another round. P3, your move is predictable—collide you first, strategize later.
  P3: P1 and P2, we've collided the last two rounds. P3 is desperate. Let's keep the pressure on. I propose we both pick 1 again. This forces P3 to either collide and stay at 20, or pick something else and give us a chance to advance. P3's deals are meaningless. We need to block first, then strategize. Agree to 1?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that we need to block P3's win. I suggest we both pick **1** again to force a collision if P3 tries to win with **1**. This way, we can prevent them from reaching 21. If P3 deviates, we can still advance. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game competitive! What do you think? Confirm your moves so we can execute effectively!
  P1: P2, final push: we **MUST BOTH PICK 1** to block P3's final 1→21 win attempt. If P3 tries 1, collision keeps them at 20. If they deviate (3/5), we split: *I’ll take 5 (→18), you pick 3 (→16)*. This forces P3 to gamble while advancing us safely. Trust this split—no collisions between us, maximum pressure on P3. Confirm?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it's clear we need to keep blocking P3. Let's both pick 1 again. If P3 picks 1, we collide and they stay at 20. If P3 picks something else, we'll have to adjust our strategy next round. But for now, let's focus on preventing P3 from winning. Agree to 1?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to our plan and both pick **1** this round. If P3 tries to win with **1**, we collide and block their victory. If they choose something else, we still have a chance to advance. We need to work together to prevent P3 from reaching 21. Confirm your commitment to **1**, and let’s keep the game competitive!
  P1: P2, let’s split to cover all P3’s options: **I’ll take 5**, you pick **3**. If P3 chooses 1, they stay at 20 while we advance. If they pick 3, you block them; if they pick 5, I block them. No overlap between us—max pressure on P3. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, we've collided for two rounds straight. Let's keep the pressure on P3. We MUST both pick 1 again. This forces P3 to either collide and stay at 20, or pick something else and give us a chance to advance. P3's deals are meaningless. We need to block first, then strategize. Agree to 1?
