While I'd prefer to win, I recognize both of you will block me if I insist on taking 5. Let me reconsider my position. If I take 1, you two could still advance without guaranteeing me a loss. This shows good faith while keeping the game competitive. I don't expect trust after my earlier candor, but a coordinated blocking maneuver hurts everyone's progress. Consider allowing some movement for all players."}
