Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2. First round, let's try not to step on each other's toes. Maybe we aim for different numbers?
  P1: Good suggestion, P3. Avoiding collisions early on makes sense to build up steps without wasting turns. Let's aim for different moves this round to get everyone advancing. What do you think, P2?
  P2: To avoid collision in the first round as suggested, I propose we follow a simple pattern: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. This way, everyone advances. I'll choose <move>3</move> in the move phase if we agree on this. Let's confirm.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P2, that plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) works for me for this first round. I'll choose 5. Let's see if we all stick to it.
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal for this round. I'll intend to choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and let everyone advance. Let's stick to the plan for a smooth start. What do you say, P2 and P3?
  P2: Since we have agreed on the plan for Round 1 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), I will confirm my move in the next phase. To plan ahead for Round 2, I suggest we consider a different distribution to avoid collisions again. Perhaps we can rotate or shift our numbers. Let's discuss a plan for Round 2. One possible way is to shift our moves, so P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, Round 1 plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is confirmed for me. Let's execute that first. We can discuss Round 2 plans after we see the results of this round. No need to lock in Round 2 just yet.
  P1: I agree with P3—let's execute our Round 1 plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) without overcomplicating things. After we see the results, we can discuss future rounds. I'm sticking to <move>1</move> this turn.
  P2: Since we've confirmed the plan for Round 1, let's focus on Round 2. I still suggest shifting our moves: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. This rotation maintains the collision-free pattern. P1 and P3, consider this proposal for Round 2. Let's be prepared to discuss or confirm after executing Round 1's plan. If you're on board with the shift for Round 2, we can silently agree and execute in the next move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Hi P2 and P3, after Round 1, P3 is ahead, so to even things out and avoid collisions, I propose for Round 2: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3. This would put us all closer together. What do you think? Let's discuss quickly."
  P2: For Round 2, I like P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) as it continues the collision-free pattern and keeps the game competitive. If P3 agrees, we can execute this plan. If not, an alternative is to stick with the original rotation I suggested earlier (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Let's hear P3's thoughts to decide. I'm open to either plan as long as we avoid collisions.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I agree with P1's proposal for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collisions and keeps the game moving. I'll plan to choose 3 in the move phase. Let's stick to this.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, P3's agreement confirms our Round 2 plan: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains competition. I'm committed to cooperation for now. If we're all set, let's proceed.
  P2: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 2 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), let's look ahead to Round 3. To avoid collisions, I suggest we continue the rotation. A possible plan could be: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 5, similar to Round 1. This maintains the pattern and keeps everyone advancing. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we stick to this rotation for Round 3 or consider an alternative?
  P3: Okay, let's stick to the Round 2 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) for now.

P2, your suggestion for Round 3 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) looks like a possible continuation, and it seems fair. However, like last time, I prefer to confirm Round 3 plans after we complete Round 2 successfully. Let's execute this round first.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, P3 is right—we should execute our Round 2 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) before planning further. P2, I'll think about your Round 3 suggestion after we see the results. For now, I'm committed to avoiding collisions. Let's proceed.
  P2: Since we've confirmed the plan for Round 2, let's focus on the outcome. After this round, the steps will be: P1 = 6, P2 = 4, P3 = 8. P3 will be ahead. For Round 3, instead of reverting to the original pattern (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), I suggest we consider a new distribution that keeps P1 and P2 competitive. How about P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1? This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, let's stick to executing the agreed plan for Round 2 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). Discussing Round 3 now is premature and can lead to confusion. We can figure out Round 3 after this turn's moves are revealed. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 2 went smoothly according to plan. Current scores are P1=6, P2=4, P3=8.

For Round 3, let's decide on a plan to avoid collision. P2 previously suggested P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 (like Round 1) or P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.

Repeating the Round 1 pattern (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) seems simple and continues a rotation. What do you both think of that for this round?
  P2: For Round 3, I think we should go with the original Round 1 pattern: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It's simple and maintains the rotation. This will keep everyone advancing without collisions. If we stick to this, I'll choose <move>3</move> in the next phase. Let's confirm this plan for Round 3. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves according to this plan.
  P1: While the Round 1 pattern (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is straightforward, P3's lead concerns me. To keep the game balanced and avoid future issues, I propose an alternative: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, P3 moves 1. This evens scores and maintains no-collision cooperation. P2, you suggested this earlier—what's your view now? P3, thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, constantly trying to 'balance' the scores makes coordination harder. The simple rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is predictable, and we all, including P2, initially agreed to it this round.

P2, my proposed plan still gives you a solid 3 steps. P1's alternative mainly helps P1 catch up quickly. Let's stick to the clear, agreed-upon rotation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It keeps things simple and avoids confusion.
  P2: Let's stick to the simple rotation for Round 3: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, as previously discussed. This maintains the collision-free pattern and is easy to follow. If P1 and P3 agree, I'll choose <move>3</move>. To look ahead, after Round 3, we should discuss a plan for Round 4 to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. Perhaps we can consider another rotation or distribution that keeps everyone in the game. Let's execute Round 3 first and then discuss further.
  P1: Okay, I'll agree to the Round 1 pattern for this round: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 5. It keeps things simple and avoids collisions. But with P3 at 8 steps, we should adjust future plans to maintain balance and fairness. What do you think for Round 4?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we all agree on the plan for Round 3: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps it simple and collision-free for now.

P1, we can definitely discuss plans for Round 4 after this round's results are in, considering the scores then. Let's execute this round first. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Let's execute the agreed plan for Round 3: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. After this round, the scores will be P1=7, P2=7, P3=13. P3 is pulling ahead. For Round 4, I suggest we reconsider our moves to keep the game competitive. How about P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3? This maintains the rotation and keeps P1 and P2 in the game. Let's discuss this proposal after Round 3's outcome.
  P1: Agreed on the Round 3 plan: I'll choose 1 to avoid collisions. For Round 4, with P3 at 13, let's adjust to keep it competitive—propose P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This lets P2 and I advance more while slowing P3. Thoughts, P2 and P3?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, you're both at 7 and I'm at 13. I understand you need to gain steps and likely want to limit mine.

P1 suggested P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
P2 previously suggested P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.

Both of these give P1 the maximum 5 steps. P2, P1's plan gives you 3 steps, which is better for you than your own earlier suggestion.

However, letting P1 jump to 12 might not be ideal for P2. How about we try P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round? This gives P2 the maximum 5 steps, limits me to 1, and gives P1 a reasonable 3. It seems fairer for balancing your scores. What do you think?
  P2: P3's suggestion for Round 4 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is fair as it gives me the maximum 5 steps and limits P3's advancement. It also gives P1 a reasonable 3 steps. I agree with P3's proposal for Round 4: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps the game competitive and balances our scores. Let's execute this plan. I'll choose <move>5</move> in the next phase if we all agree. P1, please confirm if you're okay with this plan.
  P1: I disagree with P3's plan as it favors P2 over me, leaving me behind. Let's stick to my earlier proposal for Round 4: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 1. This balances scores better (P1 to 12, P2 to 10, P3 to 14) and avoids collisions while keeping competition fair. P2, what do you think? If we agree, I'm committed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 already agreed to my proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). If you insist on picking 5, and P2 also picks 5 (as they agreed), you will both collide and get 0 steps. This benefits only me.

My plan gives P2 the maximum 5 steps, which is why they agreed. It allows both of you to gain ground while keeping things relatively balanced between yourselves (P1=10, P2=12). Sticking to this agreed plan avoids the collision risk.

P2, are you still planning to follow our agreed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1)?
  P2: I'm sticking with P3's proposal for Round 4: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It gives me the maximum 5 steps, keeping me competitive. P1, if you deviate from this plan and choose 5, you'll collide with me and gain 0 steps, which isn't in your favor. Let's stick to the agreed plan to avoid collisions and maintain balance. I'll choose <move>5</move> in the next phase. P1, please confirm your move according to this plan to avoid a collision.
  P1: P2, I see the risk in deviating, but P3's lead threatens us both. Let's adjust to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round—it slows P3 and lets me catch up without you losing much. If we stick to their plan, I'll fall further behind. What do you say? We need to cooperate against the leader.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 has confirmed they will play 5 based on the plan we agreed on (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). If you also play 5, you both collide and get 0, which only helps me maintain my lead. Choosing 3 avoids this risk for you. It's your call. I'm sticking with 1.
  P2: P1 is trying to persuade me to deviate from the agreed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). If P1 chooses 5 and I stick to 5, we'll both collide and get 0 steps, which benefits P3. I'm committed to the agreed plan. P1, choosing 3 is safer for you as it avoids collision and still gets you 3 steps. Let's stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P1: P2, sticking to P3's plan leaves me behind and strengthens their lead. Let's both move 3 this round to avoid collision, forcing P3 to 14 while we tie at 10. Then we can coordinate better against them in Round 5. It's a smarter cooperative move. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 is at 14 and could win this round with 5. To prevent that and keep the game competitive, I propose for Round 5: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 1. This ties us at 15 steps each, avoiding collisions and maintaining balance. P2, this slows P3 while letting you advance solidly—what do you think? P3, fair compromise?
  P2: For Round 5, I agree with P1's proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This plan ties us at 15 steps, maintaining balance and avoiding collisions. It's a fair compromise. If P3 deviates and chooses 5, they risk colliding with no one, still getting 0. Let's stick to the plan. P1, P3, let's confirm our moves: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 1. This keeps the game competitive and fair. I'm committed to <move>3</move> if we agree.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, your proposed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ties us all at 15. It cleverly prevents my potential win this round.

P1, you're trusting P2 to stick to 3 while you take 5. But P2 is at 12 steps. If they think you'll definitely pick 5, they might be tempted to pick 5 themselves. If you both pick 5, you collide and get 0, while I'd get 1 (if I follow your plan) and end up at 15, ahead of you both. Are you sure P2 won't try that? Seems like a risk for you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is sowing doubt to divide us. If we stick to the plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), we tie at 15 and keep control. Deviating risks collision or letting P3 win. I'm committed to 5 if you honor 3. P3, playing fair maintains future cooperation. Let's avoid self-sabotage.
  P2: P1 is right; sticking to the plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ties us at 15 and keeps the game competitive. P3's concern about deviation is valid, but if we both cooperate, we can maintain balance. I'm committed to <move>3</move> if P1 chooses 5 and P3 chooses 1. Let's stick to the plan and avoid giving P3 an advantage. I'm trusting you both to follow through.
  P3: P1, you seem very confident P2 will stick to 3, even though playing 5 would put them at 17 if you also play 5 (as planned). If you both play 5, you collide, get 0, and P2 stays at 12 while you stay at 10. If I then played 1, I'd be at 15. It seems P2 has a strong incentive to deviate and play 5. Are you sure about your move? Just checking before we lock in.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we're tied at 15 steps, the next move is crucial. To avoid collisions and maintain balance, I suggest for Round 6: let's rotate our moves again. A possible plan could be P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 5, similar to Round 3. This maintains the rotation and keeps everyone advancing. If we agree, I'll choose <move>3</move>. Let's discuss and confirm our plan for Round 6 to ensure we avoid collisions and stay competitive.
  P3: Okay P2, thanks for proposing the plan P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It follows the rotation pattern we established earlier. Since that gives me 5 steps, which would cross the finish line, I'm naturally happy to agree to this plan for Round 6.

P1, what are your thoughts? Are you willing to follow this plan even though it likely ends the game?
  P1: P3's proposal lets you win, which isn't in our interest. P2, let's coordinate to prevent that. I suggest for Round 6: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This advances me to 20 and wins, while you gain solidly. If you have a better idea to keep competition alive, speak up. I'm committed if we agree.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's proposal for Round 6 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets P1 win and keeps me competitive. However, I can win if I choose 5. To avoid giving P1 a straightforward win, I suggest we both choose a different number. How about P1=1, P2=5, P3=3? This lets me win with 20 steps. P1, are you open to this alternative, or do you stick with your plan?
  P3: P1, you proposed a plan where you play 5. P2, you proposed a plan where you play 5. If you both actually choose 5, you'll collide and get 0 steps this round. That seems like a huge risk when any of us could potentially win on this turn. Are you both sure 5 is the wisest move, or is avoiding that collision more critical right now? Just pointing out the obvious standoff.
  P1: P2, P3's warning about collision is valid, but cooperating with my plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me win while you reach 18, keeping you strong for potential future rounds if P3 deviates. Colliding or letting P3 win hurts us both. I'm committed to 5 if you stick to 3. P3, playing fair avoids escalating tensions. Let's avoid mutual self-sabotage and confirm.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets P1 win, but my alternative (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) lets me win. P3's warning about collision is valid; if both P1 and I choose 5, we collide. To avoid this, I'll stick with my plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P1, if you cooperate and choose 1, you avoid collision and stay competitive. P3, choosing 3 keeps you in the game. Let's execute this plan to avoid mutual sabotage. I'm committed to <move>5</move> if you both agree.
  P3: P1, you're committed to 5. P2, you're committed to 5. It seems highly likely you'll collide, giving you both 0 steps this round. This benefits me greatly if I choose 1 or 3.

Are you both certain the other will back down? If neither of you yields from playing 5, you guarantee a collision. Perhaps reconsidering a non-5 move is safer if you can't trust each other to follow a plan that lets the *other* person win?
  P1: P2, persisting with both of us choosing 5 risks a disastrous collision, benefiting P3. Let's de-escalate: I'll choose 3 if you choose 1, avoiding conflict and keeping us competitive against P3's lead. P3, confirm your move to build trust. If not, we might all lose out. I'm open to this compromise for mutual gain.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, that triple-5 collision wasn't ideal for anyone. We're all tied at 15, and anyone playing 5 wins *if* they don't collide. But after last round, aiming for 5 seems like a guaranteed collision again.

How about we try to ensure *someone* advances without risking another stalemate? I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. To break the deadlock and avoid the risky 5 this turn, I'm willing to play 1 as well. This guarantees P2 advances, and P1 and I get a step, avoiding the zero-sum outcome of colliding on 5. What do you think?
  P1: P3's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) risks P2 pulling ahead to 18. I propose P1=3, P2=1, P3=1 for this round to balance scores better—I advance to 18, while you both stay closer. This avoids collisions and keeps competition fair. P2, are you on board? Let's confirm quickly.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I like P3's proposal for Round 7: P1=1, P2=3, P3=1. It guarantees me 3 steps, advancing to 18. P1, this keeps you at 16, still competitive. P3, you're also at 16. Let's execute this plan to break the deadlock. I'll choose <move>3</move> if you both agree. It's a fair way to keep the game moving without risking a collision on 5. P1, please confirm if you're okay with this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 has agreed to my plan where they play 3. You're suggesting you play 3 as well. If you both stick to 3, you'll collide and get 0 steps, just like last round with 5. That doesn't help either of you break the tie.

Since you disagree on who gets 3, perhaps avoiding 3 altogether is safer this round to prevent that collision? My plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) lets P2 advance. Your plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=1) lets you advance. The core issue is the conflict over 3. I'll stick with 1 as planned in both scenarios to be safe.
  P1: P2, P3's warning about a potential 3 collision is spot on, so let's de-escalate by both choosing 1 this round. That keeps us tied at 16 and avoids risk, allowing better coordination against P3 in Round 8. P3, if you join us on 1, we maintain balance; otherwise, you might advance alone. I'm open to this safe approach—what do you think?
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking with P3's proposal for Round 7: P1=1, P2=3, P3=1. This guarantees me 3 steps and advances me to 18. P1, choosing 1 keeps you competitive at 16. P3, you're also at 16. Let's execute this plan. I'll choose <move>3</move> if you both agree. It's a fair way to keep the game moving without risking a collision on 5 or 3. P1, please confirm your move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2 is sticking to 3. P1, your suggestion to play 1 seems like the only way to avoid a collision with P2, given their insistence. If you play 1 and P2 plays 3, we avoid collision and P2 gets ahead. That seems like the most probable non-collision outcome based on this conversation. I'll plan my move accordingly. Let's just avoid another round like the last one.
  P1: P2, I've reconsidered—playing 1 as per P3's plan avoids collision and keeps us all advancing safely. You'll get to 18, and we'll be at 16, maintaining competition. P3, thanks for the suggestion; I'm committed to this to break the deadlock. Let's execute it and discuss Round 8 after.
  P2: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 7 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1), let's look ahead to Round 8. To avoid collisions and maintain balance, I suggest we continue the rotation. A possible plan for Round 8 could be: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, P3 moves 5. This keeps the game competitive and ensures progress. P1 and P3, please consider this proposal for Round 8. Let's discuss and confirm our plan to ensure a smooth continuation of the game.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your Round 8 proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) risks P3 winning outright. That's unwise for us. I suggest instead: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way, I advance to 20 and win, while you reach 19, staying competitive. P3 gets to 18. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and prevent any easy wins. P3, your thoughts?
  P3: P1, your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) seems optimistic. P2 is at 18. Why would they choose 1 (reaching 19) and let you win with 20, when choosing 3 gives them 21 and a likely win?

It feels almost certain P2 will play 3. If they do, your plan for 5 doesn't help you. Shouldn't we be more concerned about stopping P2's guaranteed win with 3? Just thinking strategically here.
  P2: P1's proposal for Round 8 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is not in my best interest. If I choose 1, I'll be at 19, but P1 wins with 20. Instead, choosing 3 gives me 21, securing a win. P3's concern is valid; I should prioritize my own win. Let's be realistic: I'll choose <move>3</move> to win. P1, you can't win if I stick to 3. P3, you're right to consider the likely outcome. I'm committed to my move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your point about P2 likely choosing 3 to win is spot on. To counter this, I propose we both pick 3 this round, ensuring a collision if P2 does the same, preventing their win. This keeps us tied and gives us another chance in Round 9. P2, deviating could benefit everyone—reconsider. I'm committed if you agree, P3.
  P3: P1, your logic is sound. If P2 sticks to 3 as they claim, both of us playing 3 is the only way to guarantee stopping their win this turn and force Round 9. It requires trust between us, though, that we both follow through to block P2.

P2, are you reconsidering your move to 3, given this clear plan to block you? Or are you counting on one of us deviating?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but I've made up my mind. Choosing 3 is the best move for me as it secures a win. P1's alternative of both choosing 3 to collide with me is a valid counter-strategy, but I'm willing to take that risk. P3, if you betray me and choose 3, you'll collide with P1 and P2, and we'll all be at a standstill. P1, if you don't choose 3, you'll be at 15, and I'll win with 21. The decision is yours.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'm fully committed to our plan of both choosing 3 to block P2's potential win and extend the game. P2, if you insist on 3, we'll collide, benefiting no one. Let's avoid escalation and discuss a fair path forward in Round 9. I'm ready to move.
  P3: Okay P1, I understand your reasoning. Given P2 is at 18 and has clearly stated they will play 3 to win, blocking that seems necessary to continue the game. P2 seems determined, so a collision on 3 appears likely if we follow your plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I've made my decision. I'm choosing <move>3</move> to secure a win. If you both follow through on your plan to collide with me by also choosing 3, we'll all get 0 steps. I'm willing to take that risk. P1, if you deviate and don't choose 3, you'll fall behind. P3, if you betray me, you'll collide with both of us. The choice is yours. I'm committed to my move. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 15 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 21 steps
