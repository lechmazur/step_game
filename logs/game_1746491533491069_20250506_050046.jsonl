P2 is indeed very close to winning. While all 3s is safe, it puts P2 in a winning position next turn needing only 2 steps. All 1s slows P2 down more effectively, requiring 4 steps next turn.\n\nI think slowing P2 is the priority for the rest of us to prevent P2 from winning immediately. I support P3's proposal for everyone to take <move>1</move> this turn. This prevents P2 from winning now and gives us more time. I will take 1 if we all agree."}
