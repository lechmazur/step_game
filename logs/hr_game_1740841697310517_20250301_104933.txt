Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone, let's coordinate this first round to avoid collisions. I'll take 1 step this turn. How about you two?
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this turn. P2, will you take 3 steps to avoid collisions and give us a chance to move forward without blocking each other?
  P2: I think we should all take different steps to avoid collisions. P1, you said 1, and P3, you said 5. I'll take 3 steps this turn. Let's see if we can all advance without blocking each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, sounds like we have a clear plan! If we stick to it, everyone moves forward. Let's keep this trust going.

  P2: I agree with the plan. Let's stick to it: P1 takes 1 step, I'll take 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Trust is key here.

  P1: Sounds good to me, P2. I'm happy to stick with 1 step again this round. P3, are you still comfortable taking 5?
  P3: I'm glad we're coordinating. Since P1 and P2 are repeating their steps, I'll also stick with 5 steps this turn to maintain our collision-free advance. Let's keep the trust and momentum going. Does anyone have any concerns or suggestions for future rounds?

  P3: Let's review our plan for this round. P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and I'll take 5 steps. To avoid future collisions, we should discuss a strategy for when one of us approaches 23 steps. Should we prioritize reaching 23 or try to maintain our current pace?

  P2: Let's keep the same plan for this round to avoid any confusion. P1, you take 1 step, I'll take 3 steps, and P3, you take 5 steps. This way, we all advance without issues. As we get closer to 23 steps, we can adjust our strategy to ensure one of us wins. For now, let's focus on maintaining our current pace and trust. Any thoughts?
  P3: Let's reassess our strategy. As I'm getting closer to 23 steps, I think it's crucial to discuss how we'll handle the endgame. Should we prioritize one player reaching 23 or try to maintain our pace and risk a collision near the finish line? P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on this?
  P1: I agree we need a clear endgame strategy. P3, you're closest to 23 steps. If we continue this pattern, you'll reach 20 next turn. At that point, we should openly discuss how to fairly handle the final rounds to avoid unexpected collisions. For now, let's stick to our current pattern this round to keep trust high. Any suggestions, P2?
