Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. I suggest we each choose a different number for this turn. P1, would you like to go for 1, P3 for 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think we should consider a more strategic approach. If we all pick different numbers, we may advance this turn, but we also risk being predictable. It might be better to mix it up a bit. How about I take 3, and P3 can take 1? That way, we still avoid collisions, but we also keep our options open for future turns. What do you think, P3?
  P3: While I appreciate both suggestions, I prefer to keep my strategy flexible. Making explicit agreements this early could put me at a disadvantage later. I'll make my own decision in the move phase based on what I think will benefit me most.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about keeping strategies flexible, but I still think it's beneficial to avoid collisions for now. P1, your suggestion of taking 3 and having P3 take 1 is a good alternative. However, I'm not sure if P3 will follow through with that plan. To minimize the risk of collision, I'm willing to adapt and take a different number if P3 is willing to communicate their intention. P3, are you open to sharing your thoughts on which number you're leaning towards?
  P1: I see the value in avoiding collisions, but I believe we should also consider the long-term implications of our choices. If we all pick different numbers this turn, we might progress, but it could set a predictable pattern. I suggest we each choose a number that allows for some flexibility in future rounds. P2, if you're willing to adapt, maybe you could take 1 instead of 5, leaving 3 for me and 5 for P3? This way, we still avoid collisions but keep our strategies open. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestions, but I won't commit to any specific number. Everyone is trying to position themselves advantageously, which is natural. Let's each make our own choices in the move phase and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll try to keep it brief. P1, I understand your point about long-term implications, but I'm not sure switching to 1 is the best move for me. It might make me too predictable. P3, I respect your decision to keep your strategy flexible, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk. If you're not committing to a number, I'll have to rely on my own judgment. Let's see how this round plays out. I'm done discussing for now.
  P1: I understand the desire for flexibility, but if we all choose independently, we risk collisions that could hinder our progress. To maximize our chances of advancing this turn, I propose we each pick a number that we haven't discussed yet. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we can all move forward without colliding. What do you think?
  P3: I maintain my position of not committing to any specific number. While I understand P1's latest proposal, I prefer to keep my strategy independent. Let's move forward with the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. It's clear that we each have our own strategies in mind, and no one is willing to commit to a specific number. To avoid further predictability, I suggest we end the conversation phase here and proceed to the move phase. Let's see how our independent choices play out. I'm done discussing for now.
  P1: I understand that we all want to keep our strategies flexible, but I truly believe that coordinating our moves can benefit us all. If we can agree to avoid collisions this turn, we can make progress. I propose that I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can advance without hindering each other. If we don’t want to commit, I respect that, but let’s at least consider the potential for collaboration. I'm ready to move on if you are.
  P3: I've already made my position clear about not committing to specific numbers. Since we're going in circles with these proposals, I suggest we move to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see that my collision with P1 last round worked in P2's favor. While coordination proposals sound nice, they clearly don't reflect our true intentions to win. I suggest we focus on making our own strategic choices rather than making promises we won't keep.
  P2: I agree with P3 that coordination proposals may not be entirely genuine, given our ultimate goal is to win. However, I still believe that avoiding collisions can be beneficial for now. P1, since you collided with P3 last round, you might want to consider a different approach this time. I'm willing to adapt my strategy based on the conversation, but I'm also prepared to make a decision independently if needed. What are your thoughts on how to proceed this round?
  P1: I understand that winning is our ultimate goal, and I appreciate the points made by both P2 and P3. However, I still believe that avoiding collisions can benefit us all in the long run. If we can agree to choose different numbers this round, we can make progress. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can advance without hindering each other. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I find it interesting that P1 continues to suggest coordination after our collision last round. Given that P2 is now in the lead, we should be more concerned about catching up rather than following P1's proposals that may or may not be sincere. I'll make my own strategic choice in the move phase.
  P2: I understand P3's skepticism about coordination proposals, but I still believe avoiding collisions can be beneficial for now. P1, your suggestion of taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5 is a good starting point. However, considering P3's reluctance to commit, I'm willing to adapt and take a different number if it means avoiding a collision. P3, are you open to sharing your thoughts on which number you're leaning towards, or will you stick to making an independent decision in the move phase?
  P1: I appreciate the ongoing discussion, but I think we need to be more strategic in our choices. P2, if you take 1 this round, I can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. I understand P3's reluctance, but if we can at least agree to avoid colliding, we can make some progress. Let's consider the benefits of working together this turn. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given that P2 has taken the lead, I think both P1 and I should be more focused on catching up rather than following potentially deceptive coordination proposals. I'll continue to make my moves independently based on what I think will give me the best chance to win.
  P2: I understand P3's focus on catching up, and I acknowledge that my lead may be temporary. To address P1's latest suggestion, I'm willing to consider taking 1 if it means avoiding a collision. However, I need some assurance that P3 won't also choose 1. P3, while you're committed to making independent decisions, can you at least hint at whether you're considering 1 or not? This might help me make a more informed choice and potentially avoid a collision.
  P1: I understand the importance of making strategic choices, especially since P2 is currently in the lead. To maximize our chances of advancing without collisions, I suggest that I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all progress. P3, if you're still committed to independent choices, please consider the benefits of avoiding collisions this round. Let's work together to ensure we all move forward. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Since we're all clearly focused on winning, and coordination attempts haven't proven reliable, I see no benefit in continuing this discussion. P2 has the lead, and both P1 and I need to make strategic moves to catch up. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: I think we've exhausted the discussion on coordination and independent choices. Given P3's persistence in making independent decisions, I'll focus on my own strategy. To minimize the risk of collision, I might consider a number that hasn't been frequently discussed. P1, since you've been open to coordination, I suggest you also think about a less obvious choice to avoid collisions. Let's see how our strategies play out in the move phase. I'm done discussing for now.
  P1: I understand that we're all focused on winning and avoiding collisions. Since P2 is in the lead, it’s crucial for both P3 and me to make strategic choices. I suggest we each consider a number that we haven't heavily discussed yet. I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3, if you could choose 5, we can all advance. This way, we minimize the risk of colliding while still making progress. Let's see if we can make this work. What do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm in the lead, but my advantage is slim. P1, since we collided last round, I suggest you consider a different approach this time to avoid another collision. P3, you've been making independent decisions, which has worked in your favor so far. However, I'm willing to adapt my strategy to minimize the risk of collision. If you're open to sharing your thoughts on which number you're leaning towards, I can make a more informed decision. Let's see if we can find a way to advance without hindering each other.
  P3: P2 and P1 have shown a pattern of colliding despite their coordination talk. Since I'm now in the lead with 5 steps, I expect both of you will try to catch up. I'll continue making my own strategic choices without revealing them, as that's worked well for me so far.
  P1: I see that we're all focused on advancing, and I appreciate P2's willingness to adapt. Given that P3 is currently in the lead, it might be beneficial for all of us to consider numbers that minimize the risk of collisions. I suggest I take 3 this round, P2 could take 5, and P3 might consider taking 1. This way, we can all make progress without hindering each other. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're right that coordination attempts haven't been successful so far. However, I still believe that avoiding collisions can be beneficial for now. P1, your suggestion of taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1 is a good starting point. However, considering P3's reluctance to commit, I'm willing to adapt and take a different number if it means avoiding a collision. P3, are you open to sharing your thoughts on which number you're leaning towards, or will you stick to making an independent decision in the move phase?
  P3: Since I'm in the lead, I see no reason to commit to any specific numbers or coordinate with others. Both P1 and P2 have shown they don't follow through with their proposals anyway. I'll continue making independent choices that maximize my chances of winning.
  P1: I understand the reluctance to coordinate, but I still believe it's in our best interest to avoid collisions. Since P3 is in the lead, I suggest I take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without hindering each other. If we can agree on this, we can maximize our chances of progress. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P3's reluctance to coordinate, but I still believe avoiding collisions can be beneficial. P1, your latest suggestion of taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5 is a good starting point. However, considering P3's lead and independence, I'm willing to adapt. If P3 is not open to sharing their thoughts, I'll focus on minimizing collision risk. P1, are you open to considering alternative numbers that haven't been heavily discussed, like switching your choice to minimize collision chances? Let's see if we can find a way to advance without hindering each other.
  P3: Since I'm in the lead, I see that P1 and P2 keep making coordination proposals to try to catch up. However, their track record shows they don't follow through with these agreements. I'll continue making my own strategic choices to maintain my advantage. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I see that we're all focused on advancing and avoiding collisions. Since P3 is currently in the lead, it's crucial for both P2 and me to make strategic choices. I suggest I take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all progress without colliding. If we can agree on this, we can maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand that P3 is in the lead and reluctant to coordinate. To minimize collision risk, I'm willing to adapt my strategy. P1, considering your previous suggestions, I think it's best if we both avoid choosing 1 this round, as it's been a frequent topic of discussion. Let's consider alternative numbers that haven't been heavily discussed. If we can find a way to advance without hindering each other, we might be able to catch up with P3. What are your thoughts on exploring different options?
  P3: Since I'm ahead, I see no value in continuing these discussions. P1 and P2's coordination attempts have consistently failed, and they'll likely try to catch up to me. I'll maintain my strategy of independent moves.
  P1: I understand that we're all focused on advancing, and I appreciate the effort to minimize collisions. Since P3 is in the lead, I suggest we consider numbers that haven't been heavily discussed to avoid predictability. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all move forward without colliding. Let's see if we can make this work this round. What do you both think?

  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I have a solid lead with 8 steps, I notice P1 and P2 keep colliding despite their coordination talk. This pattern works in my favor. I suggest we skip the lengthy coordination discussions since they've proven ineffective and move straight to our individual choices.
  P2: I agree with P3 that our coordination attempts have been ineffective so far. However, I still believe that avoiding collisions can be beneficial for now. P1, since we collided last round, I suggest you consider a different approach this time to avoid another collision. P3, you've been making independent decisions, which has worked in your favor so far. However, I'm willing to adapt my strategy to minimize the risk of collision.
