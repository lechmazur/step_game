Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. This way, we can all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P1's idea about coordinating to avoid collisions. If P1 takes <move>1</move>, I can take <move>5</move> to maximize my advancement. P2, what do you think? Can you take <move>3</move> to help us all move forward without interference? Let's make sure we all advance this round!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I’ve already committed to <move>1</move>, and P3 has agreed to take <move>5</move>. P2, your role is crucial here—taking <move>3</move> ensures no collisions this round.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, since we've had a collision last round, it's important to rethink our strategy. I suggest we all take different moves this time to ensure progress. I can take <move>3</move> to balance my advancement, but I need your cooperation. P1, if you take <move>1</move> again, P2, can you take <move>5</move>? This way, we can avoid collisions and all move forward. What do you think? Let's coordinate again!
  P1: P1: P3, your suggestion to take <move>3</move> while I take <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move> seems reasonable. However, P2 hasn’t confirmed yet. P2, if you’re willing to take <move>5</move>, we can all advance without collisions this round. Let’s lock this in now—confirm your move so we can proceed with clarity.

Let’s confirm our moves quickly!

Confirm your move now, or we’ll assume you’re unwilling to cooperate. Let’s resolve this quickly and move forward strategically.

  P1: P1: P3, your plan to take <move>5</move> while I take <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move> works for me. However, P2 has been unpredictable so far.

If you won’t confirm <move>3</move>, at least act predictably so we can all advance. Your silence isn’t strategic; it’s self-defeating. Let’s end this conversation and move forward. If you disrupt again, we’ll adjust our strategy to minimize your impact. Confirm or step aside.
