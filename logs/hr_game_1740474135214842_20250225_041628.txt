Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m planning to take 3 steps this turn. Let’s see how everyone moves!
  P3: Okay, P2 is going for 3. I'll go for 5, hoping P1 doesn't also choose 5.
  P1: I appreciate your openness, but I think I'll keep my move choice to myself for now. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Continuing with my plan to take 3 steps this turn to steadily advance. Let’s see how everyone else moves!
  P3: P1, since you're being secretive, I'm more inclined to believe you might also be considering 5. To avoid a collision, how about you pick 1? P2 is already committed to 3. This would guarantee both P2 and I advance.
  P1: I understand your suggestion P3, but I need to look out for my own interests. If you both advance and I take 1, I'll be at a significant disadvantage. I need to make a competitive move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll continue taking 3 steps this turn to maintain steady progress. Let’s see how things unfold!
  P3: P1, I understand you want to be competitive, but if we both go for 5, neither of us moves. If you choose 1, at least you get something. Think of it as damage control. P2 is locked into 3. I'm still leaning towards 5, but I could be persuaded to pick 1 as well if you commit to 3.
  P1: I appreciate the negotiation attempts, but I won't commit to any specific move. We all need to make our own choices. I'm ready to move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Interesting first round. P2 got ahead while P3 and I collided. P2, you've shown yourself to be honest and consistent. P3, perhaps we should both avoid 5 this time to prevent another collision. I'm open to coordination.
  P2: Thanks, P1. I’ll continue taking 3 steps this turn to maintain steady progress. Let’s see how P3 responds and adapt accordingly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, I agree, we should avoid 5. P2 is going for 3 again. I'm willing to pick 1 if you pick 5, guaranteeing we both move. If you're not willing to commit to 5, I'll also pick 3 to block P2. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the offer P3, but I won't commit to a specific move. P2's consistency is admirable but also makes them predictable. We should each make our own strategic choices.
  P2: I’ll maintain my strategy of taking 3 steps this turn to ensure steady progress without clashing. Let’s aim to avoid collisions and move forward strategically. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, your reluctance to commit is understandable, but it's also risky. P2 is consistently taking 3, and you're still at 0. I propose this: I will pick 5 if you pick 1. This guarantees both of us move. If you don't agree, I will pick 3 to block P2. Your call.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand both your positions, but I need to make up ground after the last round. P2's lead and P3's threats make this an interesting situation. I'll make my choice based on what I think will benefit me most.
  P2: I'll continue taking 3 steps each turn to ensure steady progress toward the goal. Consistency helps avoid collisions and keeps me advancing reliably. Let’s all strategize wisely and aim to reach 22 efficiently. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, you're still at 0. P2 is consistently at 3. My offer stands: I pick 5 if you pick 1. This is your last chance for a guaranteed move. Otherwise, I'm blocking P2 with a 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'll make my decision based on what's best for my position. Let's move forward.
  P2: I’ll continue taking 3 steps this turn to maintain steady progress. Consistency helps avoid collisions and keeps me advancing reliably toward 22. Let’s all aim to strategize wisely and move forward effectively. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, you're being incredibly stubborn and it's hurting both of us. P2 is consistently gaining ground. My offer is still the best you'll get: I pick 5 if you pick 1. Otherwise, I'm picking 3 to block P2. This is your last chance to cooperate and guarantee yourself some progress. If you don't, you're on your own.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you've now blocked twice and are still at 0. P2 is consistently at 3. I'm at 5. I'll offer this one last time: I will pick 1 if you pick 5. This guarantees both of us move and puts you in the game. If you pick anything else, I will pick 3 to block P2. This is your absolute last chance to cooperate.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy. I’ll continue taking 3 steps this turn to keep advancing steadily. Let’s hope we can all move without conflicts and reach our goals smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, your offer is tempting, but your repeated threats make me hesitant to trust you. P2's consistency could work against them if we both choose 3. I'll consider your proposal, but I need to make my own strategic choice to catch up.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're right to be hesitant, but my threats are born of necessity. You're at 0! My offer is still the best you'll get. I pick 1 if you pick 5. Otherwise, I'm blocking P2 with a 3. This is your last chance. P2, I'm still considering blocking you if P1 doesn't cooperate.
  P2: I’ll continue taking 3 steps this turn to maintain steady progress toward 22. Let’s all try to choose different numbers this round to ensure everyone can advance without collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I understand the stakes are high, and everyone's trying to advance. While coordination could be beneficial, I need to make up ground quickly. Let's see how this round plays out - I'll make my choice based on the best path forward for me.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're still at 0. I've offered you a guaranteed move twice. I'm making the same offer again: I pick 1 if you pick 5. Otherwise, I'm picking 3 to block P2. This is your absolute last chance to cooperate. P2, I'm still considering blocking you if P1 doesn't cooperate.
  P2: I'll stick with taking 3 steps this turn to keep advancing steadily. Let’s aim to avoid collisions and reach our goals efficiently. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: I understand both your positions. P3's offer is clear, but trust is a concern given the threats. P2's consistency is admirable but potentially exploitable. I need to make a strategic choice to advance from my current position. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, you're still at zero. I'm making my final offer. I pick 1 if you pick 5. This is your last chance for a guaranteed move. Otherwise, I'm picking 3 to block P2. P2, I'm likely blocking you this turn.
  P2: I’ll continue to take 3 steps this turn to ensure consistent progress toward 22. Let’s aim to choose different numbers to prevent collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: I've heard everyone's positions clearly. While cooperation could be beneficial, I need to make my own strategic choice to advance from zero. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll continue taking 3 steps this turn to maintain my steady progress. Let’s all choose different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Thanks for keeping your word last round, P3. Now we're all in the game, though P2 and P3 are slightly ahead. P2's consistency with 3 is predictable - perhaps we should consider coordinating differently this round to catch up? I'm open to suggestions.
  P3: P1, I kept my word. Now, P2 is predictable with 3. Let's both pick 5 this round. This will block P2 if they stick to 3, and give us a chance to move ahead if they deviate. If P2 picks something other than 3, one of us will move ahead significantly. Are you in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'll continue taking 3 steps this turn to maintain my steady progress toward 22. Let’s all aim to choose different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: I see the potential in coordinating with P3 to pick 5, but I also need to consider if that's truly in my best interest. P2's predictability could be either an advantage or a trap. Let me think about the best move to close the gap.
  P3: P1, P2 is sticking with 3. I still think us both picking 5 is the best move. If P2 deviates from 3, one of us gets a huge lead. If P2 sticks with 3, we block them and have another round to figure things out. Are you in? It's a better option than letting P2 run away with it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I appreciate the strategy, P3, but my focus remains on steady progress toward 22. I'll continue taking 3 steps this turn. Let’s each pursue our own paths to victory and see who reaches the goal first. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Your coordination attempt is interesting P3, but I need to carefully consider my options. P2's steady approach has gotten them far, but it could be their downfall. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win from my current position. Let's move forward.
  P3: P1, P2 is locked on 3. Let's both pick 5. If P2 changes, one of us gets a big lead. If P2 sticks to 3, we block them. This is the best way to catch up. Are you in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll continue selecting 3 steps this turn to maintain steady progress. Let’s all try to choose different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I've considered all the options and suggestions. While coordination could be beneficial, I need to make the choice that maximizes my chances of winning from my current position. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1 is hesitant, but P2 is locked on 3. P1, I'm still proposing we both pick 5. This blocks P2 and gives one of us a big lead if P2 deviates. If you don't agree, I might pick 3 to block P2 anyway. What do you say, P1? Last chance to coordinate on 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you blocked P2 last round. P2 is predictable with 3. Let's capitalize. I propose we both pick 1. This guarantees we both move, and P2 will likely be blocked again if they stick to 3. If P2 deviates, one of us gets a significant lead. Are you in? This is a better strategy than letting P2 get further ahead. P2, no hard feelings, but we're trying to win.
  P2: P3, I see your proposal, but I'll take 5 steps this turn to catch up. I hope P1 can choose wisely. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Interesting change from P2, announcing 5 steps instead of their usual 3. P3, your offer of both picking 1 is intriguing, but given P2's declared shift to 5, we might want to reconsider. Let's think carefully about our next moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2's switch to 5 throws a wrench in our plans. However, it also presents an opportunity. If we both pick 3, we block P2 and guarantee our own advance. This puts P2 at risk of being stuck again. What do you think? It's a safer bet than trying to outguess P2.
  P2: P2: It seems P3 and P1 are coordinating to block my progress by both choosing 3. To stay ahead, I’ll take 5 this turn. Let’s see how this affects our standings. Good luck!
  P1: P3's suggestion to pick 3 together is interesting, but P2's commitment to 5 seems desperate and might be a bluff to make us reconsider. Given our positions, I need to make a move that gives me the best chance to catch up. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 is clearly trying to manipulate us. P2 says they will go 5. If we both pick 1, we both move, and if P2 is telling the truth, they also move. If P2 is lying and picks 3, we still both move. Let's both pick 1. This is the safest option for both of us to make progress. Are you in?
  P2: I'll take 5 steps this turn to move ahead. Let’s see how everyone reacts. Good luck!
  P1: P3's suggestion to pick 1 has merit - it could guarantee progress for both of us. However, P2's sudden switch to announcing 5 after being so consistent with 3 is suspicious. I need to consider whether this is a genuine change in strategy or a bluff. Let's move forward and see how this plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 is likely bluffing about picking 5. If we both pick 1, we both move regardless of what P2 does. It's the safest option for both of us to gain ground. If we try to outsmart P2, we risk another collision. Let's guarantee progress and both pick 1. Are you in?
  P2: I'll take 5 steps this turn to keep advancing toward 22. Let's focus on our own strategies and aim to reach the goal efficiently. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3's suggestion to pick 1 is logical, but I need to be strategic about catching up from my position. P2's sudden change to announcing 5 seems like it could be misdirection. I'll make my choice based on what I think will give me the best chance to win. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 was truthful about picking 5 last round, which is interesting. We're all relatively close now - P3 at 12, P2 at 11, and me at 8. Since we're entering the endgame, coordination becomes riskier as everyone wants to be the one to cross 22 first. I'll need to make a strategic choice to catch up. Let's see what moves you're considering.
  P2: I’m aiming to take 5 steps this turn to move closer to 22. Let’s all choose wisely to avoid collisions and advance effectively. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I think the best strategy for me is to pick 5 this round. If neither of you pick 5, I'll jump ahead. If one of you does, I'll still be in a decent position. I'm not going to try to coordinate this round, as the endgame is approaching. Good luck to both of you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Given that both P2 and P3 have announced they'll pick 5, this creates an interesting opportunity. If they're both truthful, they'll collide and stay put, while a different choice could let me advance. However, one or both could be bluffing. I need to make a strategic choice to close the gap. Let's move forward.
  P2: I'm sticking with taking 5 steps this turn to stay on track toward 22. Let’s choose wisely to avoid blocking and ensure everyone can advance. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still planning on picking 5. P1, if you want to avoid a collision with both of us, consider picking 1 or 3. P2, good luck to both of you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate both P2 and P3 being open about their intentions to pick 5. However, given how close we are to the finish line, I need to make the choice that gives me the best chance to win from my current position. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: "P1, to keep up with P3, let's both choose 5 this turn. This way, we can block P3 if they also pick 5 and ensure we both advance. Are you in?"
  P3: P1, P2 is suggesting we both pick 5 to block me. I'm still going for 5. P1, if you pick 1 or 3, you're guaranteed to move. If you pick 5, you risk a collision with both of us. Your call, but picking 5 is risky for you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3 are both claiming they'll pick 5, but P2's sudden attempt to coordinate with me seems suspicious after their previous announcement. With me at 8 steps and both opponents ahead, I need to make a careful choice to maximize my chances. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P1, coordinating our moves by both choosing 5 can help us advance and potentially hinder P3's progress. Let’s work together to reach 22 first. Are you willing to agree on picking 5 this turn?
  P3: P1, P2 is clearly trying to manipulate you after saying they'd pick 5. If P2 picks 5 as they said, and you also pick 5, you're both blocked. I'm still picking 5. You should pick 1 or 3 to guarantee movement. Picking 5 is the worst choice for you, P1. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're all very close now - P3 at 12, P2 and I tied at 11. This is the critical phase where any coordination attempts are risky since we're all within striking distance of 22. I'll need to make a strategic choice that maximizes my chances of winning from this position.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in the endgame. I'm at 12, you're both at 11. I'm leaning towards picking 5 to try and win outright. If you both want to avoid a draw, you should pick different numbers than 5. Good luck!
  P2: P2: With the game nearing its end, I’ll choose 5 steps this turn to make a strong push toward 22. Let’s all aim to reach our goals strategically. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Both of you are declaring 5, which would lead to a collision if true. This late in the game, with all of us so close, trust is hard to come by. I need to make a choice that gives me the best chance to win from this position. Let's move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still leaning towards 5 to try and win. However, if one of you picks 3, I'll switch to 1 to avoid a collision and guarantee myself some progress. This is my final offer. Good luck!
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 steps this turn to advance toward 22. Let's aim to avoid collisions by picking different numbers. Good luck everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's offer to switch to 1 if someone picks 3 is interesting, but with everyone so close to winning, promises are hard to trust. P2 seems committed to 5, and P3 might be trying to bait us. With all of us within striking distance, I need to choose carefully. Let's proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still leaning towards 5 to try and win. If one of you picks 3, I'll switch to 1 to avoid a collision and guarantee myself some progress. P1, since you're at 11 like P2, picking 3 guarantees you move, and I'll pick 1. If you don't pick 3, I'm sticking with 5.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 steps this turn to make a strong push toward 22. Let's each aim to advance strategically and avoid collisions. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Given our positions and the high stakes, I need to make a strategic choice that gives me the best chance to win. Both P2 and P3's declarations and offers need to be weighed carefully at this critical stage. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan to pick 5 to try and win. P1, I repeat my offer: if you pick 3, I'll switch to 1 to guarantee myself some progress. If you don't pick 3, I'm sticking with 5. P2, good luck. Let's see who reaches 22 first.
  P2: P1, since we're both at 11 and P3 is ahead, let's choose different numbers this turn to ensure we both advance and limit P3's progress. Coordinating our moves can increase our chances of reaching 22 first. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still aiming for 5. P1, you are at 11. P2 is at 14. If P2 picks 3, they will be at 17. If P2 picks 5, they will be at 19. I will pick 5. If you pick 1, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 13. If you pick 3, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 13. If you pick 5, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 12.
  P2: I'll focus on making a strong move this turn to maintain my lead. Let's all choose different numbers to ensure everyone can advance without blocking each other. Good luck!
  P1: P2 is closest to winning at 14 steps, while P3 and I are close behind. P2's vague message suggests they might deviate from their usual patterns. With the finish line in sight, any coordination attempts are suspect since we're all trying to win outright. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to catch up and potentially win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still aiming for 5. P1, you are at 11. P2 is at 14. If P2 picks 3, they will be at 17. If P2 picks 5, they will be at 19. I will pick 5. If you pick 1, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 13. If you pick 3, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 13. If you pick 5, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 12.
  P2: I'll choose 5 steps this turn to push toward 22. Let's aim to select different numbers to ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P2's announcement of picking 5 would put them at 19, dangerously close to winning. P3's commitment to 5 seems firm. With me at 11, I need to make a strategic choice that could either block P2's advance or secure my own progress. Let's see how this critical round plays out.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still going for 5. P1, you are at 11. P2 is at 14. If P2 picks 3, they will be at 17. If P2 picks 5, they will be at 19. I will pick 5. If you pick 1, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 13. If you pick 3, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 13. If you pick 5, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 12.
  P2: I'll continue choosing 5 steps this turn to stay on track toward 22. Let's all aim to pick different numbers to avoid blocking each other and ensure smooth progress for everyone. Good luck!
  P1: With P2 leading at 14 and announcing 5, they could reach 19 steps. Both P2 and P3 claim they'll pick 5, but at this critical stage, trust is minimal. I need to make a choice that either prevents P2 from getting too close to victory or advances my own position significantly. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I am still going for 5. P1, you are at 11. P2 is at 14. If P2 picks 3, they will be at 17. If P2 picks 5, they will be at 19. I will pick 5. If you pick 1, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 13. If you pick 3, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 13. If you pick 5, P2 will be at 17 or 19, and I will be at 12.
  P2: I'll choose 3 steps this turn to keep advancing steadily. Let's aim to pick different numbers and reach 22 first. Good luck!
  P1: P2's sudden switch from 5 to 3 in their last message is suspicious, especially after repeatedly announcing 5. P3 seems committed to 5. With me at 11 steps and needing to catch up, I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win from this position. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we are all close. I am still going for 5. If you both pick 5, none of us moves. If one of you picks 3, the other picks 1. P1 and P2, if you pick 3 and 1, you both move, and I don't. I'm still picking 5.
  P2: To ensure smooth progress for everyone, let's all choose different numbers this round. I'll be taking 3 steps. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2's sudden switch to announcing 3 after successfully reaching 19 with a 5 last round seems like misdirection. P3 is committed to 5 but trails slightly. With P2 and I tied at 14, this is a critical round where the right move could secure victory. I'll make my choice based on maximizing my chances to win from this three-way race.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, this is the endgame. I'm sticking with 5. P2, you are at 14. If you pick 3, you will be at 17. If you pick 5, you will be at 19. I will pick 5. If you pick 1, P2 will be at 15. If you pick 3, P2 will be at 17. If you pick 5, P2 will be at 19. P1 and P2, if you pick 3 and 1, you both move. I'm still picking 5.
  P2: To avoid blocking and ensure everyone can advance, I'll choose 5 steps this turn. P1, you might consider taking 3, and P3 could go for 1. Let’s coordinate our moves to reach 22 smoothly and minimize collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2's messages are inconsistent - first announcing 3, then suggesting 5. With us tied at 14 and P3 firmly committed to 5, this round could determine the winner. I need to make a strategic choice that either blocks P2's advance or secures my own path to victory. Let's proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I am still going for 5. P1 and P2, if you pick 3 and 1, you both move, and I don't. I'm still picking 5.
P1, P2 is trying to trick you.
P2, you are trying to trick P1.
I'm still picking 5.
  P2: With the endgame upon us, let's make strategic choices to reach 22 first. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P2's inconsistent messages and P3's firm commitment to 5 make this a pivotal round. With P2 and I tied at 14, and P3 at 12, the right move here could determine the winner. I need to choose carefully to either secure my own advance or prevent others from getting too close to victory. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I am still going for 5. It is the only way for me to win. P1 and P2, if you pick 3 and 1, you both move, and I don't. I'm still picking 5. P1, P2 is trying to trick you. P2, you are trying to trick P1. I'm still picking 5.
  P2: **P2:** I’m choosing to take 5 steps this turn to move closer to 22. Let’s all select different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: With P2 and I tied at 14, and P3 committed to 5, this is the decisive round. P2's messages have been inconsistent, switching between 3 and 5. I need to make the choice that gives me the best chance to win from this position. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The three-way collision last round kept us all in place. P2 and I are still tied at 14, with P3 at 12. We're all within striking distance of victory, and any coordination attempts at this stage are suspect since we each want to win outright. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to reach 22 first.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all stuck. I'm still going for 5. If you both pick something else, I win. But if one of you picks 3, I'll switch to 1. This is my final offer to avoid a stalemate. P1, if you pick 3, I'll pick 1. P2, your call.
  P2: To avoid blocking each other and ensure we all make progress, let's choose different numbers this round. I'll go with 5, so P1 and P3, please consider picking 1 or 3. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's announcement of 5 seems predictable at this point, while P3 offers to pick 1 if I choose 3. However, with victory so close, promises mean little. We're all trying to win outright, and I need to make the choice that maximizes my chances from 14 steps. Let's move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5. P2, you're announcing 5 again, which means you're likely bluffing. P1, I'll make you the same offer: if you pick 3, I'll switch to 1 to guarantee we both move. If you don't, I'm sticking with 5 and hoping to win outright. This is my last offer.
  P2: I’ll take 5 steps this turn to stay on track toward 22. Let’s all choose different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Given our three-way tie last round and P2's consistent announcement of 5, while P3 offers conditional cooperation, I need to be strategic. We're all close enough that any move could determine the winner. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win from 14 steps. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all stuck in a loop. I'm still going for 5. I'm making a final, slightly modified offer. P1, if you pick 3, I'll pick 1. P2, if you pick 1, I'll pick 3. This guarantees at least two of us will move. If neither of you take this, I'm sticking with 5. This is my last attempt to break the stalemate.
  P2: I'm choosing to take 3 steps this turn to ensure my progress. Let's all aim to select different numbers to avoid collisions and advance smoothly toward 22. Good luck everyone!


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2's sudden switch from 5 to 3 in their last message seems like a clear attempt at misdirection after consistently announcing 5 before. P3's offers are interesting but unreliable at this critical stage. With all of us so close to winning, I need to make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win from 14 steps. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a stalemate. I'm still going for 5. P1, if you pick 3, I'll pick 1. P2, if you pick 1, I'll pick 3. This guarantees at least two of us will move. If neither of you take this, I'm sticking with 5. This is my last attempt to break the stalemate. I need to move!
  P2: "P1 and P3, to ensure I keep advancing without any collisions, I'll take 1 step this turn. Let’s each choose different numbers to progress smoothly toward 22. I encourage you both to pick 3 or 5 so we can all move forward effectively. Let’s finish this game strategically. Good luck to everyone!"


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: With P1 nearing 22, it's crucial we avoid choosing the same number this turn to prevent collisions. Let's each select different numbers (1, 3, or 5) to ensure steady progress toward our goals. This way, everyone can advance smoothly without blocking each other. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 is close to winning. P1 and P2, I'm going to pick 3. If you both pick 1 and 5, you both move, and I move. If one of you picks 3, I'll switch to 5.
  P1: With me at 17 steps, I'm closest to victory. Any coordination attempts now are likely attempts to block my progress. I need to make a strategic choice that could secure my win, as I only need 5 steps to cross the finish line. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll choose to take 5 steps this turn to move closer to 19. P1, I encourage you to pick 1 or 3 to avoid blocking each other. P3, selecting 1 or 3 will ensure you advance without collisions. Let's all aim to make progress smoothly and reach our goals. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 is close to winning. I am going to pick 3. P2, you say you'll pick 5. P1, if you pick 1, you win. If you pick 5, you win. If you pick 3, I will switch to 5. I need P1 to not pick 3.
  P1: P2's announcement of picking 5 and P3's commitment to 3 (unless I pick 3) creates an interesting dynamic. With me at 17 steps, I'm in a strong position to win. Any coordination attempts at this stage are likely trying to prevent my victory. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to cross 22 first. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: P1 is close to winning. P1 and P2, I'm going to pick 3. If you both pick 1 and 5, you both move, and I move. If one of you picks 3, I'll switch to 5. P1, if you pick 5, you win. If you pick 1, you also win. I need P1 to not pick 3.
  P1: With me at 17 steps and needing just 5 more to win, both of you are trying to influence my choice. P2 claims they'll pick 5, while P3 says they'll pick 3 unless I pick 3. At this critical stage, I need to make the choice that secures my victory. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "P1 is close to winning by choosing 5. I’ll pick 5 this turn to advance to 19. To ensure everyone progresses, P3, please consider picking 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s aim for smooth progress and a fair finish. Good luck to everyone!"
  P3: P1 is about to win. P1, if you pick 5, you win. If you pick 1, you also win. P2, you say you will pick 5. I will pick 3. My only goal is to stop P1 from winning this turn.
