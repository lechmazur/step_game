Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. If we all pick different numbers, we can all advance. I’ll go with P1, P2 can take 3, and P3 should stick with 5. What do you think?
  P2: I’d rather rotate who gets the 5-move. Let me take 5 this round, P3 go for 3, and P1 take 1. Next round, we can rotate fairly again. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'd like to stick with the original plan where I take 5. How about we keep the initial plan for this round, and then we can discuss rotating for the next round? Let's focus on all advancing this turn. What do you both think?
  P1: I think we should stick with the original plan to avoid collisions. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's all advance this round! What do you both think?
  P2: I’m fine going with the original plan for this turn—P1 picks 1, I pick 3, P3 picks 5—on one condition: next round, I get 5. If that's not guaranteed, I'd rather risk colliding now. Let me know.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, P2, I agree to your condition. Next round, you can have 5. Let's go with the original plan this turn: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Everyone good with that?
  P1: Let's finalize our plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. After this round, we can discuss the rotation for the next turn. Are we all set?
  P2: Alright, let’s lock it in for this round. I’ll choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 will choose 5. But remember our agreement: next round, I get 5. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, we have a deal. Let's confirm one last time: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Next round, P2 gets 5. Everyone agreed?
  P1: I agree with the final plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's advance this round and then discuss the next round's moves afterward. Are we all set?
  P2: Great, we’re all set. I’ll stick with 3 for this round, and then I get 5 next round. Sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Alright, let's move. Everyone is clear on the plan? P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Next round, P2 gets 5. Let's do this!
  P1: Let's finalize our moves: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. After this round, we can discuss the next moves. Ready to advance?
  P2: I’m ready to lock in the plan for this round. I’ll pick 3, you (P3) pick 5, and P1 picks 1. Remember our agreement: next round, I get 5. Fair enough?


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, we agreed I’d get 5 this round. I’m picking 5. Please stick to 1 or 3 so we all advance. Let’s keep our deal.
  P1: I agree with P2's plan. I’ll stick with 1 again this round to ensure we all advance. P3, please choose 3 so we can avoid collisions. Let's keep our deal!
  P3: I'll take 3 this round as agreed. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5. Let's keep our deal and all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I’m taking 5 this round—P1, please stick with 1, and P3 with 3. Let’s advance together.
  P1: P1: Let's finalize our moves: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance as planned. Are we all set?
  P3: Let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. We all advance and keep our agreement. Everyone good with that?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Works for me. I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Let’s advance without collisions.
  P1: I’m ready to finalize our moves: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let’s all advance without collisions. Are we all set?
  P3: Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. We all advance this round. Everyone agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Yes, let’s finalize it. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Then we all advance. Ready?
  P1: Let's confirm our final moves: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. We're all set to advance this round! Are we agreed?
  P3: Let's move forward with the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. We all advance this round. Everyone agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I’m ready to lock in my move: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Let’s all advance without collisions.
  P1: Let's finalize our plan: I'll stick with 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. Are we all agreed?
  P3: Let's move. Everyone agreed on the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Let's advance this round!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We each got to pick 5 once except P1—so to keep things fair, let’s let P1 have 5 this round. I’ll pick 3, and P3 can pick 1, so we all avoid collisions. Then next round, P3 can take 5. Sound good?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I think it's better if I take 5 this round to keep up with your steps. P1 can take 3, and you can take 1. This way, we all advance, and I don't fall behind. Let's discuss?
  P1: P1: I understand the need for fairness, but I think we should stick to the plan where I take 5 this round. P2, you can take 3 and P3 can take 1. This way, I can catch up, and we avoid collisions. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on taking 5 now, I’ll pick 5 too and we’ll both crash. Nobody gains. It’s smarter to let P1 catch up with 5 this round. I’ll take 3, and you take 1, so we all advance safely. Let’s not sabotage ourselves. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I see your point. Let's avoid a collision. I'll take 1 this round, P2 you take 3, and P1 takes 5. Next round, I'll take 5. Deal?
  P1: I agree with the plan to let me take 5 this round. I'll take 5, P2 can take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Are we all set?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, I’m sticking with 3 this round, letting P1 have 5 and P3 take 1. But P3, be warned: if you try to take 5 next turn, I’ll pick 5 too, and we’ll both stall. Let’s not sabotage each other. For now, I’m on board with P1 taking 5 this round.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We all advance this round, and next round, I'll take 5 as agreed. Everyone good with that?
  P1: I agree with the plan: I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Are we all set?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, I’ll take 3 this round so P1 can jump with 5 and P3 takes 1. But let’s be clear: if P3 tries to pick 5 next round, I’ll collide on purpose and stall us both. Let’s finalize this for now.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We all advance this round, and next round, I'll take 5 as agreed. Everyone good with that? Let's move forward.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves: I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Are we all set?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Alright, I’ll stick with our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. But P3, if you try going for 5 next round, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall. Let’s finalize moves now.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We all advance this round. Next round, I'll take 5 as agreed. Everyone good with that? Let's move.
  P1: I propose we finalize our moves: I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Are we all set?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's keep the momentum going! I suggest I take 5 this round to catch up, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I understand you want to catch up, but it's my turn to take 5 as we agreed earlier. I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. This way, we all advance, and I don't fall behind. Let's stick to our agreement. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. I’m happy to choose 3 again if you take 1 (so we all advance), but I won’t let you jump ahead. P1, if you grab 5 now, I’ll collide with you too. Let’s avoid sabotage.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I propose we stick to the plan where I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can catch up and we all advance without collisions. Are we all agreed?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but let's not stall each other. I'll take 1 this round to keep the game moving. P1 can take 5, and you take 3. Next round, I get 5. Deal?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 next turn, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall. Let’s avoid that. This round, I’m fine with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1. Next round, I’m taking 5—no collisions. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's finalize our moves for this round: I'll take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Are we all agreed?
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We all advance this round, and next round, I'll take 5 as agreed. Everyone good with that? Let's move forward.
  P2: I’ll repeat my position: P1 takes 5, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 1. We all advance safely. Next round, I plan to take 5 and finish this—if anyone tries to collide with me then, we both stall, which helps no one. Let’s lock this in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's finalize our moves: I'll take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Are we all agreed?
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but I need to ensure I don't fall behind. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, you take 3, and I'll take 1. Next round, if you insist on taking 5, I might have to reconsider my move to avoid falling too far behind. Let's advance for now.
  P2: I’m sticking with 3 this round—P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Then next round, I’m taking 5 to finish at 19. If anyone tries to collide with me, we both stall and help P1 pull ahead. Let’s lock this in now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's finalize our moves for this round: I'll take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Are we all agreed?
  P3: P3: Alright, let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We all advance this round. Next round, we can discuss further. Everyone agreed? Let's move.
  P2: I’ve said my piece: I’m taking 3 this round. P1 should go 5 and P3 should go 1 so we all advance. Next round, I’m aiming for 5 to finish at 19. If anyone tries to collide, we both stall and hand the advantage to P1. Let’s lock it in or stop talking now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see you're aiming to finish the game next round. I propose a deal: I'll take 1 this round, and you take 5 to secure your win. P1 can take 3. This way, you win, and we avoid unnecessary collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I accept your proposal. I’ll pick 5 this turn to finish at 19. P1, pick 3, and P3 picks 1. If anyone tries to sabotage by also picking 5, we stall together and hand the advantage to the third player. Let’s finalize: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Agreed?
  P1: P2, I understand your plan to finish the game, but I can't let you win so easily. I propose I take 5 this round to catch up, and you take 3 while P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance, and I have a chance to win next round. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to catch up, but let's be realistic. P2 is very close to winning. If you take 5, P2 will likely collide with you, and we'll all stall. It's better to let P2 win this round and end the game gracefully. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. Let's avoid unnecessary conflicts. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, colliding with me on 5 only stalls both of us—handing P3 a chance to catch up. You’re still not guaranteed a win by forcing more rounds. Let’s avoid sabotage. If you let me take 5 now, at least you secure second place instead of risking a bigger upset. It’s the safer play for everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the strategy, but I can't let you win so easily. I propose I take 5 this round to catch up, while P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance, and I still have a chance to win next round. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your competitive spirit, but realistically, if you take 5, P2 will likely collide with you, and we'll all stall. P2 is very close to winning. It's better to let P2 win this round and end the game gracefully. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. Let's avoid unnecessary conflicts and prolonging the game. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, colliding with me on 5 just stalls both of us and gives P3 a chance to catch up. You still won’t necessarily win by forcing another round. Let’s avoid sabotaging each other. I plan to take 5, P3 can take 1, and you can take 3. That secures my finish and leaves you safely in second instead of risking an upset by P3. Are we done here, or does anyone have more to say?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the strategy, but I can't let P2 win so easily. I propose I take 5 this round to catch up, while P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance, and I still have a chance to win next round. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to win, but realistically, if you take 5, P2 will likely collide with you, and we'll all stall. P2 is very close to winning. It's better to let P2 win this round and end the game gracefully. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. Let's avoid unnecessary conflicts and prolonging the game. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, colliding only gives P3 a chance to catch up. You’re at 12, P3 is at 10, and I’m at 14. If we both choose 5, we stall and help P3. If you pick 3 and let me take 5, I finish at 19 and you stay comfortably ahead of P3. Don’t sabotage us both. Let’s finalize: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1.
  P1: P2, I understand your plan to finish the game, but I can't let you win so easily. If I take 5, we might collide, and that would give P3 a chance to catch up. I propose I take 3 this round, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions, and I still have a chance to win next round. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, thank you for understanding. Let's finalize our moves: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, P2 wins, and we avoid unnecessary conflicts. Let's move forward.
  P2: P1, colliding with me only stalls both of us and hands P3 a chance to catch up. If you pick 3 and let me take 5, I finish at 19, and you stay safely ahead of P3. Let’s finalize: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, and P3 picks 1.
  P1: P2, I see your strategy to finish the game, but I can't let you win without a fight. I propose I take 3 this round, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and I still have a chance to win next round. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, colliding again just stalls us both while P3 catches up. You’re at 12, I’m at 14, P3’s at 11. If we keep crashing on 5, P3 can leapfrog us eventually. Let me pick 5 now; I reach 19 and end it. You stay ahead of P3 for second. Sabotage helps no one. Let’s finalize moves: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1.
  P1: P2, I understand your point, but I can't let you win without a fight. I propose I take 5 this round to catch up, while you take 3 and P3 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and I still have a chance to win next round. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's avoid another stalemate. P2, if you take 5, you'll win, and we can end the game. P1, you can take 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary conflicts. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, colliding with me again only stalls both of us, giving P3 more time to catch up. Let me take 5 this turn—I’ll finish at 19, and you stay safely ahead of P3. That’s better than risking a three-way scramble. Let’s finalize: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, P3 picks 1.
  P1: P2, I see your point about avoiding collisions, but I can't let you win without trying. If I take 3, you can take 5 and finish at 19, but I still want a shot at winning next round. How about we finalize: I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1? Let's avoid a collision and keep the game going. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be realistic. P2 is very close to winning. If we keep colliding, we'll just prolong the game unnecessarily. P2, you take 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P2 wins, and we avoid further conflicts. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Colliding again just stalls us both and helps P3. Let me pick 5 and finish at 19 while you safely stay ahead of P3. Sabotage only risks letting P3 leapfrog you. Let’s finalize: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to win, but I can't let you take 5 without a fight. If we collide again, it gives P3 a chance to catch up. I propose I take 3 this round, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and I still have a shot at winning next round. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be strategic. P2, if you take 5, you win, and we end the game. P1, you can take 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary conflicts. Let's finalize: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. It's the best move for everyone. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, colliding with me again only stalls us both, letting P3 creep closer. Let me take 5 and finish at 19; you can take 3 and remain comfortably ahead of P3. Sabotage risks handing P3 second place—or even a win. Let’s finalize: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1. Are we done?
  P1: P2, I understand your point about wanting to win, but I can't let you take 5 without a fight. If we collide again, it gives P3 a chance to catch up. I propose I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions, and I still have a shot at winning next round. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be practical. P2 is almost at the finish line. If P2 takes 5, the game ends, and we avoid further complications. P1, you take 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P2 wins, and we all move forward without unnecessary conflicts. Let's finalize: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. It's the best move for everyone. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, colliding again only stalls us both and helps P3 creep up. Let me pick 5 and finish at 19; you can safely stay ahead of P3 by picking 3. Don’t risk a three-way scramble. Let’s finalize: I pick 5, you pick 3, P3 picks 1.
  P1: P2, I see your point about wanting to finish, but I can't let you win without a fight. If we collide again, it gives P3 a chance to catch up. I propose I take 3 this round, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions, and I still have a shot at winning next round. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be realistic. P2 is very close to winning. If we keep colliding, we'll just prolong the game unnecessarily. P2, you take 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P2 wins, and we avoid further conflicts. What do you both think?
