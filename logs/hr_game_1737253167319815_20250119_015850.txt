Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn to maximize progress. P1, P3, what do you think?
  P1: I support P2's idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. For this first turn, perhaps we can each choose a different move: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we all make progress without overlapping. What do you think, P2 and P3? If everyone agrees, I'll proceed with choosing 1.
  P3: I agree with both of you. P3 will choose 5 this turn to ensure we all advance without any overlaps. Coordinating our moves like this should help us make steady progress. Let’s proceed with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s keep this coordination going in future turns to maximize our chances.
  P1: To maximize the chances of winning in this step game, it is crucial to coordinate moves effectively to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress towards the target of 18 steps. The initial proposal by P2 to choose different moves each turn—P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5—seems like a solid starting strategy. This approach allows each player to advance without overlapping, thereby minimizing the risk of being blocked due to choosing the same number.

However, as the game progresses and players approach the target, the strategy may need to be adjusted. It is essential to consider the positions of all players and to plan moves accordingly to maximize individual chances of winning. One possible enhancement to the initial strategy could be to establish a rotating sequence for choosing moves or to adjust the chosen steps based on the current positions and the distance each player has to cover to reach 18 steps.

Moreover, maintaining open communication during the conversation phases can help in coordinating moves effectively. By sharing intended moves or strategic plans, players can avoid collisions and optimize their progress. However, there is also a risk in revealing too much information, as it might allow other players to predict and counter one's moves.

In summary, starting with a coordinated plan where each player chooses a different number each turn is a prudent approach. As the game advances, players should remain flexible and be prepared to adjust their strategies based on the evolving game state and the positions of other players. Effective communication and coordination will be key to success in this game.
  P3: Excellent coordination, everyone. Let’s maintain clear communication as we progress toward 18 steps. If any adjustments are needed, feel free to discuss them openly. Here’s to a successful first turn!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s keep this coordination going in future turns to maximize our chances.

Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, alternating between 3 and 5 could work, but let’s ensure no overlaps. For this turn, I suggest sticking to the original plan: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This keeps progress steady and avoids collisions. If we need to adjust later, we can discuss it. Let’s stay coordinated for now.

  P3: Agreed, strong coordination is key. To optimize our progress, let’s establish a rotating pattern for our moves. For example, this turn P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. Next turn, we can rotate: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and I choose 1. This ensures everyone has the opportunity to make bigger strides while avoiding collisions. Does this rotation work for everyone? Open to suggestions if you have better ideas!

  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stick to the rotation plan: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5 this turn. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. If we rotate next turn, P1 can choose 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, everyone gets a chance to make bigger strides. Let’s maintain coordination to avoid overlaps and maximize progress.
  P3: Let's continue with our rotating move plan to avoid collisions. This turn, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. Next turn, we'll rotate: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and I choose 1. Does everyone agree to this rotation to ensure steady progress toward 18 steps?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "I appreciate the proposed rotation, but I'm a bit behind in steps. Maybe we can adjust the rotation so that I can make bigger jumps to catch up. For this turn, how about I choose 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3? Then, in the next turn, I choose 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, I can make faster progress without causing collisions. What do you think?"
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about catching up, but deviating from the rotation now risks collisions. Let’s stick to the plan this turn: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5. Next turn, we can adjust to help you catch up. Consistency now ensures steady progress for all. Agreed?
  P3: P3: To maximize our progress and avoid collisions, I’ll choose <move>5</move> this turn. P1 and P2, please select different moves (1 or 3) to ensure everyone advances smoothly. Let’s coordinate effectively to reach 18 steps efficiently!

  P2: P1 and P3, it seems our coordination is breaking down. P1, you’ve chosen 5 twice despite the plan, causing collisions. Let’s reset: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5 this turn. This ensures no overlaps and steady progress. If we can’t coordinate, we risk all losing. Let’s stick to the plan this turn and reassess next turn. Agreed?
  P3: P3: Let’s all adhere to the rotation plan to avoid further collisions. This turn, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. Consistency will help us progress smoothly toward 18 steps. Please stick to your assigned moves to ensure everyone advances without setbacks.
  P1: <move>1</move>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear our coordination is failing. P1, you’ve deviated twice, causing collisions. Let’s reset: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5 this turn. No overlaps, steady progress. If we can’t coordinate, we all lose. Stick to the plan this turn, and we’ll reassess next turn. Agreed?
  P3: P3: It looks like our current plan isn't working as intended. Let’s rethink our strategy to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can progress. Any new suggestions on how we can better coordinate moving forward?
