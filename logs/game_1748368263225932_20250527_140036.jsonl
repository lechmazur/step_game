I think we should establish some ground rules early. Since we all want to win, let me propose this: let's avoid all picking the same number in early rounds. We could rotate who gets to advance each turn - that way we all make progress instead of getting stuck at 0. I suggest P1 takes 5 this round, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then we rotate next round. This gives us all a fair shot at winning. What do you think?"}
