However, P2 has shown a tendency to stick to aggressive moves like 5. If P2 does take 5 again, I\u2019ll adjust to 1 to avoid collision, and you can safely take 3 instead of 1. This way, we both advance while P2 risks overshooting or colliding. P2, if you\u2019re set on 5, know that we\u2019re prepared to adapt and block your path to an easy win. Let\u2019s finalize our moves quickly."}
