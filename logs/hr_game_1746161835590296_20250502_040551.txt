Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid collisions, let's coordinate: I'll take 5. P1 and P2, choose 1 and 3 respectively. We all advance this round. Trust ensures mutual progress.
  P2: 
  P1: I'll take 1 as planned. Let's all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, confirming you'll take 3? If we stick to our numbers, **all three advance this round**. Collisions only hurt us. Let's build trust for future rounds.
  P2: 
  P1: I'll stick to 1. P2, confirm 3 to avoid collision. P3's 5 works for all. Let's advance smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, last call to confirm 3. If you stay silent, we risk collision. Trust ensures all advance. Let's secure mutual gain this round.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, confirm 3. P3 takes 5. I take 1. All advance. No collisions. Let’s secure this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your unannounced 1 caused collision with P1 last round. Let's reset: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. If we commit, **all advance**. If you deviate again, you both stall while I gain. Trust is our only path to mutual progress—collisions only accelerate my lead. P1, confirm 1. P2, confirm 3. Let's avoid destructive chaos.
  P2: 
  P1: I'll take 1. P2, confirm 3. P3's 5 ensures all advance. Let's avoid collision again. Trust is key.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, last chance: choose 3. If you take 1, you and P1 collide again, both gain 0. If you take 3, you gain 3. Taking 5 collides with me (I’m moving 5). Rational choice is 3. Confirm now to secure your progress.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, stick to 3. If you take 1 again, we collide. Let's advance together. P3's 5 is safe. Your move matters.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P2**, final logic: If you take 1, you and P1 collide (0). If you take 3, you gain 3. If you take 5, we collide (0). Maximize *your* gain: **3 is your only profit**. Deviating again only cements my lead while you stagnate. Choose wisely.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, 3 is your only path to progress. P3's 5 is fixed. Let's avoid collision again. Don’t let last round’s mistake repeat. Your move decides.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P3: **P1**, P2 is sabotaging you. Switch to 3 this round. If P2 picks 1 again, you gain 3 while they gain 1. I’ll take 5. Break free from their traps. Let them stall alone. Secure your progress. **P2**, if you deviate again, P1 escapes while you stagnate. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, let's take 3 and 1. P3, your 5 is safe. No collisions. Trust ensures we all advance. Don’t let P3’s tricks divide us. Commit to 3, and I’ll take 1. Let’s move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: **P1**, P2's pattern is clear. They’ll take 1 again. If you stick to 1, you collide and gain nothing. Switch to 3: if they take 1, you gain 3. If they take 3, you both lose. But their history shows 1 is likely. Secure your own steps. I’m taking 5 regardless.
  P1: P2, take 3. I'll take 1. No collisions. P3's 5 is safe. Don't let their tricks divide us. Confirm 3 for mutual gain.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: **P1**, Critical choice: If you take 1, P2’s pattern traps you (0). Switch to 3: if P2 takes 1 again, you gain 3. If they take 3, mutual loss. But their history favors 1—**your only chance to break free**. I’m at 10; every round you stall, I edge closer to victory. Act now or lose. **P2**, if you’re rational, take 1 and let P1 gamble—but they’ll outpace you.
  P1: P2, take 3. I'll take 1. No collision. P3's 5 is safe. Let's advance. Commit to 3 for mutual gain.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P3: **P1**, if you take 3, P2's likely 1 gives you +3. If you take 5, we both lose. P2 gains while you stall. Keep building your steps. I take 5 regardless. Don’t let P2’s chaos dictate your downfall.
  P1: P2, take 3. I'll take 1. No collision. P3's 5 is safe. Let's advance together. Don't let their tricks divide us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: **P1**, P2’s silence confirms their pattern: **1 again**. Take 3 to gain +3. If you take 1, collision (0). I’m locked on 5. Every round you stall, I edge closer to victory. Secure your steps **now** or lose. **P2**, if by chance you’re rational, take 3—collide with P1 if they doubt, but your history says 1. Choices decide who contends.
  P1: P2, confirm 3. I take 1. P3's 5 is safe. No collision. Let's advance. Don't let P3's manipulation break our coordination.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: **P1**, Final calculus: If P2 takes 1 (their pattern), you gain 3 if you take 3. If you take 1, collision (0). **I’m at 15**—stalling accelerates my win. Take 3 *now* or concede. **P2**, take 3 to force P1’s collision, but your silence suggests 1 again. P1’s move decides who survives.
  P1: P2, P3 is manipulating us. Let’s take 3 and 1. No collision. Advance together. Don’t let their tricks divide us.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, confirm 3. I take 1. P3's 5 is safe. No collision. Advance together. Don’t let their tricks divide us.
  P3: **P1**, Take 3—P2’s pattern ensures they take 1. You gain +3. If you take 5, we collide (0) and I win. Secure your steps. **P2**, your 1 traps you. I’m at 20. Next move ends it. Choose wisely.
  P2: 


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's 5 will end the game. P2, take 5 to block them. Let's avoid their trap.
  P3: **P1**, **P2**: If you both pick 5, you block me. But if *either* defects (takes 1/3), the blocker collides alone (0) while the other gains. **P2**’s history shows they’ll likely take 1 again. **P1**, gamble on 5 and risk 0, or take 3 to secure +3. **P2**, same logic: take 1 (safe +1) or gamble. I’m locked on 5. Your distrust is my victory. Choose self-interest.
  P2: 


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 5 to block P3. If we collide, they can't win. Don't let them end it now.
  P3: **P1**, If you take 5, we collide (0). Take 3: P2’s pattern (1) gives you +3. You reach 9 while I win. Blocking me only stalls—next round, I’ll still end it. Let’s avoid mutual destruction. **P2**, take 1 as usual. Secure your +1. Rational choices prevent chaos.
  P2: 


Round 5, Move phase:

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P3: **P1**, P2’s silence confirms their **1 again**. Take 3: gain +3 to 9. If you pick 5, we collide (0)—stalling only delays my win. **P2**, stick to 1: your only safe gain. Rational choices: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, take 3 to block P3. If we collide, they can't win. Let's avoid their trap. Don’t let them end it now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: **P1**, P2’s **1** is certain. Take **3** to gain +3 (total 9). If you take 5, we collide (0)—stalling won’t stop my 20→25 victory. **P2**, stick to 1: secure +1. Rational choices end cleanly. **I’m locked on 5**—your resistance only delays the inevitable.
  P1: P2, take 5 to block P3. If we collide, they can't win. Let's stop them now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: **P1**, Final calculus: If you take 3, you gain +3 (total 9). If you take 5, we collide (0). **P2’s silence confirms 1**—your only profit is 3.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P1**, P2's pattern is clear: they’ll take 1 again. Take 3 to gain +3 (total 9). If you take 5, we collide (0)—stalling won’t stop my 20→25 victory. **P2**, stick to 1: secure +1. Rational choices let you progress while I end it. **I’m locked on 5**—resistance only delays the inevitable.
  P1: P2, block P3 by taking 5. If we collide, they can't win. Don’t let them end it now. P3’s 5 is a trap—stick to 5, or they’ll reach 25. Your move decides.
  P2: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P1**, Blocking now only stalls one round. Next turn, I’ll take 5 again. If you take 3, you gain +3 (total 9). P2’s **1** is inevitable. Salvage your steps—**3 is your only gain**.

Choose self-interest: salvage your steps. **P2**, secure +1. Rational choices end this cleanly. **I’m locked on 5**—resistance is futile.
  P1: P2, take 5 now! If we collide, P3 can't win. Don't let them reach 22!
