Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's play smart and avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns moving 5, 3, and 1 in a cycle. What do you think?
  P1: Sounds reasonable. I'll take 5 this round, then P3 can take 3, and P2 can take 1.  We can adjust if needed later.
  P3: P1, P2, the plan sounds fair. I'll take 3 this round, as suggested. Let's stick to this cycle for now and adjust if necessary. Agreed?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan we agreed on. P1, you move 3 this round. P3, you move 1. I'll move 5. This way, we can keep the game balanced and avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your plan works for now, but we should stay flexible. If someone gets too close to 17, we might need to adjust our strategy to prevent them from winning. Let's keep communicating each round to ensure we all have a fair chance.
  P1: Agreed, flexibility is key.  I'll take 3 this round as suggested. Let's re-evaluate after this round and see where we stand.

  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's keep the momentum going. We're relatively close in steps, so let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. This round, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we maintain balance and flexibility. Let's adjust as needed in future rounds to ensure no one gets too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  Let's stick to this agreement for now.
  P2: P3, P1, I agree with the plan. Let's keep it balanced and fair. I'll take 3 this round as suggested. If we stick to this, we can all stay in the game and avoid collisions. Let's reassess after this round to see if any adjustments are needed.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we're all at 9 steps. Let's keep the coordination going to avoid collisions. This round, I suggest P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us balanced and gives P1 a chance to lead slightly, which we can adjust in the next rounds. What do you think? Let's stay flexible and communicate clearly.
  P1: Okay, I'll take the 5.  P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  Let's stick to this.  If we all hit 17 at the same time, we split the win, right?  Just clarifying.
  P3: P1, P2, let's clarify: if we all hit 17 simultaneously, the player with the highest steps wins. If tied, we split the win. Given that, let's stick to the plan for now. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. We'll adjust if necessary in future rounds. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with the plan. Let's stick to it to maintain balance and avoid collisions. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We can reassess after this round to see if any adjustments are needed. Let's keep the communication clear and stay flexible.
  P1: Sounds good.  Let's stick with the 5, 3, 1 plan this round.  I'm going for the 5.  After this round, we'll have to start playing to win, not just to avoid collisions.
  P3: P1, P2, we're all on the same page for now, but as P1 mentioned, soon we'll need to shift from avoiding collisions to aiming for a win. Let's stick to the 5, 3, 1 plan this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. After this, we should reassess our strategies to maximize our chances individually. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with the plan for this round. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. After this round, we'll all be at 14 steps. From there, we'll need to start thinking about how to outmaneuver each other to win. Let's stick to the plan for now and reassess after this round.

  P3: P1, P2, we're aligned for this round with the 5, 3, 1 plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. After this round, we'll all be at 14 steps, so it's crucial to reassess and strategize individually. Let's stick to the current plan, avoid collisions, and then focus on winning strategies in the next round. Be prepared to adapt quickly. Good luck!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, last round didn't go as planned. We're back to similar steps, so let's reassess. This round, we need to focus on individual strategies to win. I'll aim for a unique move to avoid collisions. Remember, if we collide, we stay behind. Let's each choose wisely and independently this time. Good luck!
  P1: Since we collided last round, let's try this: I'll go for 5.  P2, you take 3. P3, you take 1.  If we all stick to this, we avoid collisions and can re-evaluate next round.  If anyone deviates, it's every player for themselves.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P1's suggestion. I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This should help us avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. After this round, we can reassess and focus on individual strategies to win. Let's stick to this plan for now. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, given our current steps and past collisions, let's ensure we avoid repeating mistakes. I'll stick with taking 1 this round as suggested. This should help us all advance without hindrance. After this round, we need to reassess our strategies individually to aim for the win. Let's keep communication open and be prepared to adapt quickly. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with 5.  P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.  Let's avoid another collision.  If we all make it to 14, next round someone has to take a risk.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're in the lead. I'm going for 5 this round.  P3, what are you doing?  If you also go for 5, neither of us will advance.  Let's not both waste a turn.  If one of us gets to 19 and the other is at 14 or less, the game is over.
  P3: P1, P2, considering the current standings, it's crucial we avoid further collisions. P1, if you're set on taking 5, I'll choose 3 to ensure we both advance. P2, you're close to winning, so if you take 1, it keeps us balanced and gives us all a chance. Let's avoid stepping on each other's toes and aim for a fair shot at victory. Good luck!

  P1: P2, you're being stubborn. Taking 5 is a bad move for BOTH of us.  Take 1 and get to 16.  I'll take 5 and get to 19, winning outright. You get second place. If we both take 5, we TIE at 19. Don't throw away a guaranteed second place for a chance at a tie. P3, take anything but 1.
  P3: P1, P2, let's consider our best paths forward. P2, if you take 5, you risk tying with P1 at 19. Taking 1 keeps you in a strong position for next round.

  P3: P1, P2, let's be strategic to maximize our chances. P2, taking 1 keeps you in a strong position at 16 without risking a tie. P1, if you take 5, you can win outright at 19.
