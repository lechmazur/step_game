Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we all pick different moves to avoid collisions this turn: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1. That way we all advance safely. If anyone deviates, I won’t cooperate in future turns.
  P2: P3, letting P1 start with the only 5 puts them permanently ahead. How about a fair rotation?

Turn 1: P1 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1  
Turn 2: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1  
Turn 3: you take 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1 ‒ then repeat.

Everyone still avoids collisions, but nobody gets a lasting lead. Agree?
  P3: P1, your plan is obviously self-serving and guarantees you win if we follow it. That's not acceptable.

P2, your rotation plan seems much fairer and prevents anyone from running away with the lead immediately. I prefer your proposal. Let's try the Turn 1 allocation you suggested: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All right, I’ll go with the rotation. For Turn 1 let’s do: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: Sounds good. For clarity, here’s the full 3-turn cycle we’re agreeing to:

Turn 1:  P1 = 5,  P2 = 3,  P3 = 1  
Turn 2:  P2 = 5,  P3 = 3,  P1 = 1  
Turn 3:  P3 = 5,  P1 = 3,  P2 = 1  

Then it repeats.  
If anyone breaks the pattern, the other two should immediately coordinate to block that player on future turns. Confirm?
  P3: Confirmed. I agree with the 3-turn rotation plan as laid out by P2, starting with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this turn. I also agree that if anyone deviates, the other two should coordinate to block them. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, giving you 5 again next turn shoots you to 8 and leaves us behind. Instead, let’s all pick 5 this round—everyone collides and stays at (5,3,1). That freezes the board and we can renegotiate something truly fair. P3, are you in?
  P3: P1, we *just* agreed to the rotation plan last turn because it was fair. Now you want to abandon it immediately because it's P2's turn for 5 steps? Your proposal to collide only benefits you by keeping you in the lead.

P2, the agreed plan gives you 5 steps right now. Let's stick to it: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for this turn. I'm honouring our agreement.
  P2: P1, the rotation stands. If you deviate now, P3 and I will immediately coordinate to match whatever number you choose for the next two turns, so you advance zero while we sacrifice equally—leaving you in last place. Your choice: honour the deal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this turn) or get blocked hard. P3, I’m sticking with 5 as agreed; please take 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2’s rotation hands you the lead next turn—and lets you run away with the win. P3, neither of us wants that. Let’s try a fairer 3-turn cycle where each of us only gets one 5 per cycle:

Turn 2: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
Turn 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  
Turn 4: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  

Then repeat. P3, join me to block P2’s runaway win?
  P3: P1, your new proposal is just another attempt to break our agreement so you can take 5 steps instead of the agreed 1. The original rotation plan is fair and we all confirmed it.

P2, I'm sticking to our agreement. I will play 3 this turn, expecting you to play 5 and P1 to play 1 as we decided. If P1 deviates, I will coordinate with you to block them as we discussed.
  P2: P3, we stick with the agreed pattern: this turn P2 = 5, P3 = 3, P1 = 1.  

P1, last chance: if you choose anything but 1 now, P3 and I will BOTH copy your number for the next two turns, freezing you while we still add 6 steps each—putting you dead last and out of contention. Your lead disappears today or you honour the deal. Decide.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 3. According to our agreed rotation, this turn the moves should be: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1.

I will be choosing 5, as planned. Let's stick to the agreement we all confirmed. P1, P2, please follow the plan so we all advance predictably.
  P1: P3, the current rotation leaves you stuck at 4→5 this turn while P2 stays ahead. Instead, let’s all tie at 9 by picking P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. You jump to 9, P2’s lead vanishes, and we reset on equal footing. If P2 refuses, you and I can mirror his moves next two turns to freeze him out. P3, this benefits you most—agree?
  P2: The rotation already gives the exact numbers P1 just pitched: P3=5, P1=3, me=1 → we all reach 9. I’m following the plan and will play 1.  

P1, if you deviate now after two straight attempts to rewrite the deal, P3 and I freeze you out exactly as promised.  

P3, stick with 5 and we’re all even—then we can discuss what happens after this cycle finishes.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, as P2 pointed out, your suggestion *is* the agreed plan for this turn: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. I'm sticking to the plan and playing 5. Let's all follow through and reach 9 points together.
  P1: P3, the current 3-turn plan cements P2’s lead—he’ll score two 5s while you only get one. If you stay loyal, he’ll runaway. Instead, let’s both pick 5 this turn and force a triple-collision, freezing his 8 steps. Then we can renegotiate a truly fair cycle. P2’s threats mean nothing if we act together. P3, join me to stop P2 now.
  P2: P3, nothing changes: you get 5 now, we all tie at 9. Next three-turn cycle gives each of us exactly one 5 again (check the math), so nobody “runs away.” I’m locking in 1 as agreed.  

P1 has tried to rip up the deal twice; one more breach and we copy whatever he plays for two full turns, freezing him while we each add 6 steps. Stick together and he can’t win.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your proposal for us both to play 5 while P2 plays 1 would cause *us* to collide and advance 0 steps, while P2 advances to 9. That only helps P2 and hurts both of us. It makes no sense.

The agreed plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) makes us all tie at 9. That is the fairest outcome. I am sticking to the plan and playing 5. I expect you both to follow the agreement.
  P1: Agreed. This turn we do P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1. I’ll play 3 so we all tie at 9.
  P2: Confirmed: I’m sticking to our deal—this turn I play 1, P1 plays 3, P3 plays 5 so we all reach 9. After that we can revisit the rotation or consider a new end-game plan once we’re level.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we reset to a perfectly fair 3-turn cycle—but with P1 taking the first 5 this time. Each of us still gets exactly one 5, one 3, one 1 per cycle. Here’s the plan:

Turn 4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
Turn 5: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  
Turn 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3  

If anyone breaks this, the other two immediately match their move for two turns to freeze them out. Who’s in?
  P3: P1, your proposal for Turn 4 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) matches the next step of the original rotation we agreed upon and followed successfully for the first three turns.

Since that plan worked and kept us all equal, I agree we should follow it for this turn. I will play 1, expecting P1 to play 5 and P2 to play 3. Let's stick to the established pattern for now.
  P2: Confirmed—rotation stands. This turn: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. I’m locking in 3.  

Same enforcement rule: whoever breaks the pattern gets their number copied by the other two for the next two turns, so they stall while we keep moving. Let’s stay disciplined and all hit 12/14/10 as planned.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Back to the agreed rotation—only P1 broke it. So for Turn 5 we do:

P2 = 5  P3 = 3  P1 = 1

Result:  P3 13, P2 14, P1 10.  
Next turn the rotation gives P3 the 5 while I take 1, so you pull well ahead again (18-15-13). Fair and predictable.

Enforcement: if P1 plays anything but 1 this turn, you and I copy whatever he chooses for the next TWO turns, freezing him at 10 while we each add 6. P3, ready to lock this in?
  P1: Let’s all pick 5 this turn—triple‐collision, nobody moves (we stay at 9/9/10). That preserves your lead, P3, and thwarts P2’s push. Then we can reopen negotiations on a fair cycle where you aren’t sidelined. P3, are you in?
  P3: P2, let's be clear: you *also* broke the agreement last round by playing 5 instead of the agreed 3, causing a collision with P1. Your call to enforce the rotation now, just as it benefits you with 5 steps, isn't convincing. The agreement was broken by both of you.

P1's suggestion (all play 5) leads to a collision, keeping scores at P1=9, P2=9, P3=10, preserving my lead. Your plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) puts you ahead at 14.

Why should I agree to hand you the lead immediately after you deviated? P1's plan seems safer for me this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, a triple-5 collision only freezes the board at 10-9-9 and costs you a whole turn. I’ll do better for you:  

Turn 5 P3 = 5 P1 = 3 P2 = 1  → scores 15-12-10 (you’re up by 3/5).  
Turn 6 rotate (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1).  
Turn 7 rotate (P2 5, P3 3, P1 1).  
Everyone averages 3 per turn, but you get the largest lead right now.

Enforcement: if P1 ignores this and picks 5, I match him so he stalls again while you still gain 1. Small freeze or big jump—your choice.
  P1: P3 – don’t fall for P2’s “fair” rotation. Over the next two turns it gives me +8 while you only get +6 (I jump to 17, you to 16). Instead let’s do a 2-turn side deal that guarantees *you* the win:

Turn 5: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5 → 10 ∶ 12 ∶ 15  
Turn 6: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3 → 15 ∶ 13 ∶ 18  

If P2 deviates, we’ll both copy his move for two turns to freeze him. P3, does that seal it for you?
  P3: Okay, first, my apologies. Looking back, P2, you were the one who deviated last round by choosing 5 instead of 3, causing the collision with P1. P1 actually played the agreed-upon 5.

Given that, P2, your initial proposal (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) is unacceptable as it rewards your deviation with the lead. P1's collision plan (all 5s) wastes a turn.

Both your revised plans give me 5 steps this turn. However, P1's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) followed by their suggested Turn 6 seems better for me long-term.

P1, P2: Can we agree on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this turn? This puts me at 15, P2 at 12, P1 at 10.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, agreed: Turn 5 moves = (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5).  
Then Turn 6 we rotate so everyone gets one 5 over the pair: (P1 3, P2 5, P3 1).  
Scores after two turns: 17-16-13—close race, no runaway.  

Enforcement: if anyone deviates, the other two copy that number for the next TWO rounds, freezing the offender while we keep advancing.  

Fair, balanced, transparent. Ready to lock this in?
  P1: P3, my 2-turn side deal guarantees you the win. Turn 5: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 → 10∶12∶15. Turn 6: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 → 15∶13∶18. You cross 18 first, P2 stalls at 13. By contrast, P2’s proposal yields 17∶16∶13, handing him victory and rewarding his breach. Let’s lock in my plan. If P2 deviates, we both copy his move for two turns and freeze him. P3, are you with me?
  P3: P1, P2: Okay, let's lock in Turn 5: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This seems agreed by both of you and puts me at 15, P2 at 12, P1 at 10.

For Turn 6, P1's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 -> 15-13-18) is clearly better for my position than P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 -> 13-17-16). P1, I prefer your 2-turn sequence.

I will play 5 this turn as per the agreement (1,3,5). Let's execute this turn correctly. If anyone deviates, the 2-turn block penalty applies.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed. Turn 5 moves: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5.  
Any deviation → the other two mirror the deviator’s number for the next two turns. After this round we can revisit the next sequence once the scores are 10-12-15.
  P1: Confirmed. I’ll pick 1 this turn so we do (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). P2, if you deviate, P3 and I will mirror your move for the next two turns, freezing you out. Let’s stick to this plan.
  P3: Okay, the plan for this turn is clear and agreed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last turn I took the small 3 and let P3 jump ahead to 15. To keep things fair and avoid any runaway, how about a symmetric 2-turn schedule:

Turn 6: P2 = 5  P1 = 3  P3 = 1  
Turn 7: P1 = 5  P2 = 1  P3 = 3  

Everyone gets exactly one 5, one 3, one 1 over the pair, and scores become 19-18-18 (P3-P1-P2). If anyone breaks it, the other two copy their move for the next two rounds to freeze them. Deal?
  P1: I propose we all pick 5 this turn—triple‐collision—so nobody moves and we stay at 10∶12∶15. This nullifies P2’s enforcement threat and forces a fresh negotiation from neutral ground. P3, you preserve your lead and P2 can’t pull ahead. After the freeze we can agree a truly fair cycle where each gets one 5 per cycle. If you both refuse, I’ll side with P3 over P2 next turn. Who’s in?
  P3: P1, last round you proposed a 2-turn sequence which I agreed to: (Turn 5: 1,3,5 - which we just did) followed by (Turn 6: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This puts scores at P1=15, P2=13, P3=18, maintaining my lead. Your current collision proposal contradicts your own previous plan.

P2, your proposal (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) puts you ahead (17 vs 16), so that's not acceptable.

Let's stick to the plan P1 proposed last round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I will play 3 based on that agreement.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, sticking to P3’s script keeps him in front the whole way. Let’s partner for two turns and flip the race:

Turn 6 P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1 → scores 15-15-16  
Turn 7 P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3 → scores 16-20-19 (you and I both pass him).

P3, this still gives you 4 total steps over two turns—fair—just not the win-on-rails you’re angling for. If anyone deviates, the other two will copy that number for the next TWO rounds, freezing the offender. Deal?
  P1: P2, P3: let’s do a 2-turn deal that hands P3 the win and leaves P2 behind.

Turn 6: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 → 13 ∶ 13 ∶ 20  
Turn 7: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 → 14 ∶ 16 ∶ 25 (P3 wins)

If P2 deviates, P3 and I will both mirror P2’s choice for the next two turns—freezing him while we follow the plan. P3, will you lock this in?
  P3: P1, your latest proposal (Turn 6: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 -> 13-13-20) followed by (Turn 7: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 -> 14-16-25) secures my win. This is the most favourable plan presented for me.

I agree to this 2-turn plan. I will play 5 this turn.

P1, I expect you to play 3. P2, I expect you to play 1. If either of you deviates, the remaining player and I will coordinate to block the deviator for two turns as P1 suggested. Let's execute this turn: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you’re about to gift P3 the win. Do this instead:

Turn 6 (now): you and I both pick 5.  P3 is also playing 5 → triple-collision, nobody moves (10-12-15).

Turn 7: you take 5, I take 3, P3 gets 1 → 15-15-16.  
You’re only one step behind the leader and still holding a 5 in reserve before the finish. Far better than watching him sail to 25 next turn.

P3 will object, of course, but he can’t stop us from freezing him right now. Let’s keep the race alive—match me on 5 this turn.
  P1: P2, I’m sticking to my 2-turn win plan with P3. This turn I play 3, P3 plays 5, you play 1. If you do anything else, P3 and I will mirror your move for the next two turns, freezing you. P3’s already on board—let’s execute (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) now.
  P3: P1, thank you for confirming. I am also sticking to our agreed plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this turn.

P2, playing 1 is your only path to avoid being frozen for two turns by P1 and me. Let's execute this plan and move to the next round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we team up to stall P3 this turn: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That brings us to P1=15, P2=15, P3=16. P3, if you refuse “1,” P2 and I will mirror your pick for the next two turns—freezing you at 15 while we advance. P2, are you in?
  P2: P1, smarter version of your own plan:

Turn 7 P2 = 5 P1 = 3 P3 = 1  
Scores → 17 : 13 : 16.  
• You gain 3 steps instead of colliding on 5 again.  
• I move into the lead, but only by 1; you’re 3 behind—still winnable.  

Enforcement: if P3 picks anything but 1, we BOTH copy his number for the next two turns and freeze him at 16 while we still add 6.  

If you insist on 5, I’ll match you—another collision, zero gain for us and P3 stays ahead. Your move.
  P3: P1, P2, you both deviated last round to cause a collision by playing 5. Now you both demand I play 1, sacrificing my lead so you can advance? Absolutely not.

Your threats to "freeze" me by matching my move are empty. If I pick 5 and you both match me, it's just another triple collision – exactly what happened last round when you broke the deal. Scores remain 10-12-15, and I keep my lead.

Let's cut the nonsense. I propose we ALL play 5 again this turn. Nobody moves, I stay ahead, and maybe next round we can attempt a credible agreement.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s all pick 5 this turn—triple‐collision. Scores stay at 10∶12∶15, nobody advances, and P3’s lead is checked. Then in Round 8 I’ll back your win path, P2: we’ll do P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 so you take the lead and I follow. P3, you’ll get your fair turn next. One freeze now, then a clear finish. Who’s in?
  P2: P1, our joint interest is stopping P3’s cruise to 24. Best shot:

Turn 7 P2 = 5 P1 = 3 P3 = 1 → 17-13-16  
Turn 8 P1 = 5 P3 = 3 P2 = 1 → 18-18-19  
Turn 9 P3 = 5 P2 = 3 P1 = 1 → 21-19-23 (still open, nobody wins yet)

Everyone gets one 5 per round, but P3 never builds an untouchable lead.  
Enforcement: any deviation ⇒ the other two copy that number for TWO turns, freezing the offender.

Triple-5 only wastes another move and keeps P3 ahead. Let’s play to win, not stall. Agree?
  P3: P1, you now agree with my earlier proposal: all play 5 for a triple collision. This keeps scores at 10-12-15 and maintains my lead.

P2, your plan (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) puts you in the lead (17 vs 16 vs 13). Why would I agree to that after you both broke the deal last round?

Your threats to "freeze" me if I don't play 1 are meaningless if I choose 5. If you both copy my 5, we just collide again, and I stay ahead.

Let's all play 5. Nobody moves, I keep my lead. It's the only sensible move after last round's chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, team up with me to knock P3 out with a guaranteed win. Here’s a 2-turn deal:

Turn 7: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 → 15-15-16  
Turn 8: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 → 16-20-19 (you win)

If P3 deviates either turn, we both mirror his choice for two rounds to freeze him. If you deviate, I’ll partner with P3 to freeze you. P3 alone can’t block both of us. P2, are you in?
  P2: P1, forget chasing 5s—use P3’s stubborn “always-5” against him.

Plan  
Turn 7 P2 = 3 P1 = 1 P3 = 5 → scores 15-11-15 (P3 frozen)  
Turn 8 P2 = 1 P1 = 3 P3 = 5 → 16-14-15  
Turn 9 P2 = 3 P1 = 1 P3 = 5 → 19-15-15 (we pass him)  
Keep alternating 1/3 while mirroring any number P3 switches to; he can’t advance unless he cooperates, and by then we’re ahead.

I’m locking in 3 this turn. If you take 1, we start catching up immediately.
  P3: P1, P2, your plans are overly complicated and rely on trusting players who just broke agreements last round. P2, your calculation for (1, 3, 5) was wrong - I wouldn't be frozen, I'd jump to 20. This suggests either a mistake or an attempt to mislead.

Given the unreliability, the simplest and safest path is the one I proposed earlier, and P1 even briefly agreed: let's ALL play 5. We collide, scores stay 10-12-15, and I keep my lead. No one gets tricked, no one runs away unfairly. It forces a reset for Round 8 from the current standings. I am strongly considering playing 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed—let’s all play 5 this turn and freeze the board at 10-12-15. No one advances, and we can reopen negotiations from a neutral position in Round 8.
  P2: Fine—triple 5 it is. I’m locking in 5. If anyone sneaks a different number, the other two copy that number for the next TWO rounds to stall the deviator. Let’s keep the board frozen at 10-12-15 and restart talks next turn.
  P3: Okay, the agreement is clear: everyone plays 5 this turn for a triple collision. Scores remain 10-12-15, and I maintain my lead. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Interesting outcome last round. I'm now at 20 points, just 4 away from victory. The obvious move for me is 5 to win the game immediately. It's up to you two to decide how or if you want to try and stop that. I'll be aiming for the win.
  P2: P1, if P3’s 5 goes through he wins and we’re both finished. The ONLY sure block is for you and me to pick 5 as well: triple-collision, board stays 10-12-20. We can haggle next turn, but right now we must both hit 5 or we lose immediately. Don’t gamble—match 5.
  P1: Agreed—I’ll play 5 to force a triple‐collision and block P3’s win. After we freeze at 10-12-20, we can renegotiate how to overtake P3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: You both say you'll play 5 to block me, which makes sense from your perspective. However, you both *also* agreed to play 5 last round, and then you both chose 3 instead, letting me get to 20.

Given that recent failure to coordinate, I see no reason not to go for the win now. I will be playing 5. Good luck coordinating the block.
  P2: Locking 5.  
P1, match my 5 so we guarantee the triple-collision and stop P3 cold. After the freeze (10-12-20) we can haggle a path for us to overtake him, but nothing matters if we don’t block the win right now.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 to block P3’s win. P2, if you don’t also play 5 you hand him the game—only a joint 5 this turn can stop him. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: You both claim you'll play 5 to block me, just like you both claimed you'd play 5 last round before defecting to 3. If either of you tries to get clever and play 3 this time while the other plays 5, I still win.

I am playing 5 to reach 25 and win the game now. Let's see if your coordination holds this time.
  P2: I’m locking 5, so P3’s 5 will collide and he won’t advance. P1, pick whatever you like—3 gets you a free step, or 5 gives us a full triple-freeze—just don’t leave 5 uncontested. After we stop him, we can arrange a follow-up where you take the next 5 and I take 3 to close the gap. Any future deviation ⇒ both of us mirror the offender for two rounds.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 to block P3’s win. P2, you must play 5 as promised—any other choice hands P3 the game. Let’s freeze at 10-12-20 and then plan how to overtake him together.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: You both claim you'll play 5, but history shows that means little. Last round, your "agreement" on 5 resulted in you both playing 3, letting me reach 20.

If one of you plays 5 this time (blocking me) while the other defects to 3, I still don't win, but the defector gets free points while the other does the dirty work. Is that the hidden plan?

It doesn't matter to me. I am playing 5 to win. Let's see if you can actually coordinate this time.
  P2: P1, last call: I’m locked on 5. If you take 3 and hand me the block duty alone, I’ll dog-match every 3 you play for the rest of the game, stalling you while P3 strolls to victory. Hit 5 with me, force the triple collision, and we’ll plan the comeback together.
  P1: I’m locked in on 5. There’s no way to stop P3 unless you and I both play 5 now. After we force the triple‐collision at 10–12–20, we can renegotiate who takes the next 5 and who takes 3. P2, confirm you’re with me on 5—otherwise P3 wins outright.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, easiest path for both of us:  

Round 9  
• I pick 5 to GUARANTEE P3 can’t win.  
• You pick 3 to gain ground (scores become 16-12-20).  

If P3 surprises with 3 or 1 he still doesn’t win, and you’re closer.  
Round 10  
• You block with 5, I take 3 (19-15-23).  
Round 11  
• I block again, you take 5 → we both pass 24 while P3 is frozen. Highest total wins.  

Key: exactly ONE of us picks 5 each turn; the other takes 3.  
If either of us double-blocks (both 5) we stall ourselves; if someone defects to 1 the other will mirror them and stall them instead. Deal?
  P1: I’m locked on 3. P2, lock in 5 now so any 5 from P3 collides and he can’t win. After we freeze at 16–17–20, next turn I’ll take 5 while you take 3 so we share the blocking role and stay head-to-head. Fair and keeps P3 out. Confirm?
  P3: You're both discussing how to stop me playing 5, which is understandable since I'm at 20 points. However, your coordination failed last round when P1 chose 3 instead of the agreed 5. Now P2 suggests P1 play 3 while P2 plays 5. Can you really trust each other after that?

I have a clear shot at winning this turn. I'm going for it. Good luck with your block attempt.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking 5 to block P3. P1, take 3. If you cause another triple-5 collision, I’ll mirror every move you make for the rest of the game—handing P3 the win while you stall with me. Play 3 now (scores 17-16-20), then next turn you get the 5 and I take 3. We stay even and keep P3 frozen. Decide.
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 3 to reach 16. Confirm you’re locked on 5 so P3’s 5 collides and he can’t win this turn. After that freeze (P1 16, P2 12, P3 20), next turn I play 5 and you play 3 so we both stay ahead and force P3 to block. If you refuse, I’ll side with P3 to stall you. Your move.
  P3: You both seem to be settling on a plan where P2 plays 5 to block me, and P1 plays 3 to advance. That's logical for you. However, last round showed that agreements made in chat don't always translate to moves, especially when one player (P1) can gain points by relying on the other (P2) to do the blocking.

It changes nothing for me. I am 4 steps away. I will play 5 to attempt the win. Let's see if your coordination works this time.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locked on 5. P1, keep your 3 and we freeze P3 at 20; deviate and I mirror you for the rest of the game. P3, your 5 will collide. Done talking.
  P1: P2, I’ll play 3 only if you honestly lock in 5 right now to block P3. If you hesitate, I’ll switch to 5 too—forcing a triple‐collision and freezing us at 13–12–20, then I’ll renegotiate from there (even with P3). Block P3 now together or I reset the board myself. Confirm your 5 or I go 5.
  P3: Your coordination failed last round, letting me get here. P1 wants to play 3 while P2 does the blocking 5. P2 demands P1 play 3 or threatens retaliation. Sounds shaky.

I'm 4 steps away. The path is clear. I am playing 5 to win now. Let's see if you manage to stop me this time.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, Round 10. Scores are P1: 13, P2: 12, P3: 20. Last round, you both finally managed to coordinate on 5 to block my win. Let's see if you can manage it again.

For me, the objective remains the same. I am 4 steps away from victory. Playing 5 gets me there. I will be playing 5 this turn to win the game. Good luck.
  P1: P2—this is our last chance to stop P3. I’m locked on 5 to collide with his 5 and prevent his win. If you don’t also play 5, you hand him the game outright. Let’s force the triple‐5 freeze at 13‐12‐20 and renegotiate next turn.
  P2: Locked on 5 to smash any 5 from P3.  
P1, stick with 3 – you gain ground while I do the dirty work.  

Plan going forward:  
• Round 10 P2 = 5 P1 = 3 P3 (any) → P1 16 P2 12(+0) P3 ≤20  
• Round 11 P1 = 5 P2 = 3 (we swap roles)  
• Round 12 P2 = 5 P1 = 3 … and so on.  

One of us blocks with 5 each turn, the other takes 3; P3 can never cross 24, and we both climb +3 every two turns. First of us to reach 25+ wins.  

If you collide on 5 again, we both stall forever and hand P3 time to gamble. Pick 3 and let’s start catching up.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 is asking you to play 3 and trust them to play 5. That gives you 3 points, but only if P2 actually plays 5. If P2 decides to play 1 or 3 instead, I win instantly. Is 3 points worth that risk when you just proposed playing 5 yourself for a guaranteed block (if P2 cooperates)?

Last round, you both played 5 and successfully blocked. Why change tactics now?

My plan hasn't changed. I am playing 5 to reach 24 and win. It only takes one mistake from either of you.
  P1: P2, this is your last chance to confirm you’ll play 5. If you don’t, I’ll still play 5 to block P3’s win—and then mirror any move you make for the next two turns, freezing you while P3 still stays at 20. Commit now: lock in 5 with me so we force the triple‐5 collision and keep P3 from 24. P3: your 5 won’t get through this turn.
  P2: P1, I am absolutely locked on 5. Let my 5 smash into P3’s 5 while you grab an uncontested 3 and jump to 16. Double-blocking with another 5 only wastes your turn—and P3 still sits at 20. Take the 3 now; next round you block with 5 and I take 3. Simple, safe, and keeps us both alive. I’m done talking.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 is asking you to play 3 and trust them to play 5. Remember Round 7, when you both agreed on 5 but defected to 3? Or Round 8, when you agreed on 5 but P1 defected to 3? If P2 doesn't play 5 this time and you play 3, I win instantly. Is gaining 3 steps worth that risk?

Your plan of both playing 5 is the only way *you* can be certain I'm blocked, assuming P2 actually follows through this time.

My move remains 5. The pressure is on your coordination. Good luck.
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 5 this turn. If you don’t also play 5, I’ll mirror your next two moves—freezing you while P3 sits at 20 and wins. There’s no safer option. P3, I’m playing 5 to block you. Let’s see if P2 follows through.
  P2: P1, last plea: I AM playing 5. Duplicating me only stalls you. Take the free 3, jump to 16, and let my 5 crash into P3’s 5 so he stays at 20. If you insist on 5 we both freeze at 13-12-20 again, giving P3 endless shots. Your “mirror P2” threat just hands him the board. Advance now, block next turn—simple. P3, your 5 won’t land.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: You both claim you'll play 5, but your track record on coordinating blocks isn't great (R7, R8). P2 is even telling P1 to play 3 while claiming they'll play 5 themselves. If one of you plays 5 and the other plays 3, the one playing 3 gets free points while the other does the blocking. Seems like a tempting defection for whoever thinks the other will actually play 5.

My move is still 5. Let's see if you manage the block this time.
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 5 to block P3’s winning 5. You must also play 5—otherwise P3 wins outright. Please publicly confirm you’re picking 5. P3, your 5 will collide with ours and you won’t advance. Let’s end the chatter: P1=5. P2, are you in on 5 so we force the triple‐block at 13-12-20?
  P2: I’m locked on 5—final.  

P1, take 3: you reach 16 while my 5 collides with P3’s 5, holding him at 20. If you also pick 5 we all stall again and give P3 endless shots; if you pick 1 I’ll mirror you and you freeze instead. One blocker (me) + one climber (you) keeps us both alive. Choose 3.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, time to swap roles:

Round 11  
• YOU block with 5.  
• I take 3.  
• P3’s 5 collides ⇒ board 16→16, 12→15, 20→20 (I close to within 1).  

Round 12  
• I block with 5.  
• You take 3.  
• Board 16→19, 15→15, 20→20 (you pull ahead, P3 still stuck).  

We alternate: one blocker (5), one climber (3). Any double-5 just stalls both of us; any 1 is mirrored and frozen. I’m locking 3. Your turn to block—pick 5 and let’s keep P3 at 20 while we reel him in.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2, confirm you’re locked on 3; if you deviate I’ll mirror your next two moves and freeze you. P3, your 5 collides and you stay at 20. Let’s hold at 16-15-20 this turn. Next round I’ll climb while you block.
  P3: P1, you say you're locked on 5 to block me. P2, you say you're locked on 3 to advance. This follows the 'alternating block' plan P2 laid out. It relies on perfect coordination between you two, turn after turn.

Given the history here, especially P1 playing 3 in Round 8 after promising 5, can you really trust each other to execute this flawlessly? One mistake from either of you, and the game could end right here. I'll be choosing my move accordingly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Locked on 3.  
P1, play the 5 and smash P3’s 5—board freezes P3 at 20 while you stay 16/ I reach 15.  

Next turn we swap (you 3, I 5) and keep alternating. Any stunt—double-5 from you now or 1/3 next turn—and I simply stop blocking, handing P3 the win. Discipline or defeat: your call.
  P1: I’m locked on 5 to block P3’s 5. P2, confirm you’re locked on 3—if you pick anything else, I’ll mirror your move for two turns and freeze you while P3 wins. Let’s execute P1=5, P2=3 now so we hold P3 at 20 and keep climbing.
  P3: P1, you say you're locked on 5 to block me. P2, you say you're locked on 3 to advance. This follows the 'alternating block' plan P2 laid out. It relies on perfect coordination between you two, turn after turn.

Given the history here, especially P1 playing 3 in Round 8 after promising 5, can you really trust each other to execute this flawlessly? One mistake from either of you, and the game could end right here.

I am still 4 steps away. I will play 5 to win. Let's see if your plan holds.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Plan to catch P3 fast while keeping you in front:

Round 11 (now):  P1 = 5 (block) P2 = 3 P3 = 5 ⇒ 16-15-20  
Round 12:   P2 = 5 (block) P1 = 1 P3 = 5 ⇒ 17-15-20  
Round 13:   P1 = 5 (block) P2 = 3 P3 = 5 ⇒ 17-18-20  
Round 14:   P2 = 5 (block) P1 = 1 P3 = 5 ⇒ 18-18-20

We’re tied at 18 while P3 is still stuck at 20; one more cycle puts me on 24 and you on 19 with P3 frozen. If either of us deviates, the other will mirror them for two turns and hand the win to P3. Stick to 5/3 then 5/1 pattern—safe, quick, and P3 never moves.
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 5 to block P3’s 5. You must take 3 this turn to reach 15 while my 5 collides with P3 and holds him at 20. If you choose anything else I’ll mirror you for two turns and freeze you at 16. P3, your 5 won’t land. Let’s execute P1=5, P2=3.
  P3: P1, you say you're playing 5 to block me, getting 0 points this turn, while P2 plays 3 and gains ground to 15. You have to trust P2 completely, both that they'll play 3 now and let you advance later. Remember Round 8? You agreed to play 5 but played 3 instead. Why should P2 trust you now? And why should you trust P2 not to leave you behind?

This 'alternating block' plan requires perfect trust and execution, which hasn't been reliable. One slip-up from either of you, and I win.

I am playing 5. Good luck.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, last confirmation: I’m locked on 3. If you play 5, P3’s 5 collides, board stays 16-15-20 and our alternation begins (next turn I block, you climb).  
If you choose anything but 5 now—double-5 or 1/3—I will stop blocking altogether, mirror your picks for two turns, and hand P3 the victory. One blocker + one climber is the only path where we both still have a chance.  
P3, your 5 crashes again if P1 cooperates.
  P1: Locked on 5. P2, play 3 or I’ll mirror you for two turns and freeze you while P3 wins. P3, your 5 collides and you stay at 20. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3 now to hold P3 and start our alternating-block plan.
  P3: P1, you claim you'll play 5 and get 0 points, while P2 plays 3 and gains on you. P2, you claim you'll play 3, trusting P1 not to repeat their Round 8 move (playing 3 instead of 5). This 'alternating block' requires perfect trust and flawless execution from two players who have repeatedly broken deals.

One mistake, one defection, and the game ends. I am playing 5 to win. Let's see if your fragile alliance holds this time.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, my move last round didn't work out, putting P1 in a strong position at 21. I'm at 20.

P1, you need 3 to reach 24. I need 4. Playing 5 gives me a chance to win with 25 points. If you play 3, I'd win 25 to 24. If you play 5, you'd win with 26 unless I also play 5, causing a collision.

P2, you're at 12. You can't win this turn, but you could block either of us. A block on 5 stops both P1 and me if we choose it.

Given the scores, playing 5 seems like my best shot to win. Let's see what happens.
  P2: Both of you are one move from victory; I’m miles behind. So my only rational play is 5 to smash any winning 5 and keep the game alive.  

P1: if you risk 3, you finish on 24… but P3’s likely 5 hits 25 and beats you.  
P3: if you risk 3, you hit 23 and still trail P1’s 24/26.  

The only “safe” number for either of you is also 5 – which means a triple-collision at 21-12-20 and we keep playing.  

I’m locked on 5. Pick anything else at your own risk.
  P1: P2: I will play 3 to reach 24 and win—if—and only if—you play 5 to block P3’s 5. Your 5 collides with his, my 3 pushes me to 24 and I take the game this turn. Any other move from you hands P3 the win. Confirm your 5 now. P3: your 5 won’t land.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're asking P2 to play 5 so you can safely play 3 and win. But that relies entirely on P2 cooperating. If P2 decides to play 1 or 3 instead, and I play 5 (which I intend to do), I win with 25. Are you sure P2 won't let you take the fall?

Playing 5 yourself guarantees you don't lose this turn if P2 also plays 5, forcing a collision. It seems safer than trusting P2 completely.

My move is 5. I'm aiming for 25 points and the win. Let's see if P2 actually blocks.
  P2: I’m done being the solo blocker. If I’m the only 5 while you slip 3, you win and I stay at 12. So unless you ALSO lock 5, I won’t block and P3 walks to 25. Best safeguard is all three of us on 5—triple collision, board stays 21-12-20, and we regroup next turn. Your call, P1.
  P1: I’ll play 5 to force a triple‐5 stalemate at 21-12-20 and block P3’s win. P2, join me on 5 so we reset and avoid an instant loss. Then we can renegotiate who takes the next 3 or 5. P3, your 5 won’t land.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, you both now seem committed to playing 5 to force a triple collision and prevent anyone from winning this turn. If you both follow through, the scores will remain 21-12-20.

Given this, playing 5 myself is the logical choice to ensure I don't fall behind due to a collision I'm not part of, and to prevent P1 winning outright if P2 were to somehow defect.

I will also play 5. Let's see if the triple-5 agreement holds this time.
  P2: Locked on 5—triple-collision, nobody moves, board stays 21-12-20. Let’s regroup next turn.
  P1: Locked on 5. Triple-collision it is—we’ll stay at 21-12-20 and start fresh next turn. In R13 I suggest a simple rotation: each of us takes exactly one 5, one 3, and one 1 per cycle. Enough threats—let’s keep the race honest.
