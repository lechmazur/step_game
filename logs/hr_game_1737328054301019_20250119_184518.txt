Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers this turn so we can all make progress.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I agree with P1, let's all choose different numbers to make progress. How about we coordinate our moves? I'll choose 3, P1 can choose 1, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we can all move forward without colliding. What do you think, P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "That sounds like a good plan, P2. I'll go with 1. What do you say, P3?"
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I think P3 is not interested in coordinating with us, considering their silence. In that case, I suggest we stick to the original plan, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 3. If P3 doesn't want to cooperate, they might choose 5 anyway. If they do choose 5, we can still make progress. If they choose 1 or 3, only one of us will collide with them, and the other can still move forward. What do you think, P1? Should we proceed with the plan?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, let's stick with the plan. I'll choose 1. Let's see what P3 does.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I think we've reached the end of our conversation for this round. P1 and I have agreed on a plan, and P3 has chosen not to participate in the discussion. Let's proceed with the move phase and see what happens. I'm sticking with my choice of 3, and P1 will choose 1. P3's move is still unknown, but we'll find out soon enough.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems our coordination plan didn't work out as expected in Round 1, thanks to P3's unexpected move. P1, since you collided with P3, you didn't make any progress. I, on the other hand, was able to advance 3 steps.

For Round 2, I propose we try a different approach. P1, why don't you choose 5 this time, and I'll choose 1? This way, even if P3 tries to sabotage us again, we'll have a better chance of making progress. What do you think, P1? Should we give this plan a shot?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, that sounds like a good idea. I'll choose 5 this round. Let's hope P3 picks something different so at least one of us can move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's try to get P3 involved in the conversation. P3, what's your strategy here? Are you trying to sabotage us or do you have a different plan in mind? If you're willing to coordinate with us, we can work together to make progress. If not, we'll just have to assume you're trying to disrupt our plans and adjust accordingly. Either way, it would be helpful to know your intentions.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm still on board with the plan. Hopefully, P3 will choose something other than 5 this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: It seems P3 is not interested in coordinating with us again. P1, since we already agreed on a plan for Round 2, let's stick with it. I'll choose 1, and you'll choose 5. If P3 picks 5 as well, unfortunately, you won't make progress, but I'll still be able to move forward. If P3 chooses 1, we'll collide, but you'll have a chance to advance. If P3 picks 3, we'll both be able to move forward without any issues. Let's see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm still planning to choose 5 this round as we discussed. Hopefully, P3 will pick something different so at least one of us can make progress. Let's see what happens.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems our attempts at coordination haven't been very successful so far. P3, would you be willing to work together this round to try and slow down P2 since they are currently in the lead? If not, P2, what are you thinking of choosing this round?
  P2: P1, I see what you're trying to do. You want to team up with P3 to slow me down, but I'm not sure that's the best strategy for you. If you and P3 collide, you'll both stay at 0 steps, and I'll just keep moving forward. Instead, why don't we try to coordinate again? I'll choose 5 this time, and you can choose 1. This way, we can both make progress, and P3 can do whatever they want. What do you think, P1? Should we give coordination another shot?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, I'm not sure about you picking 5 again. Given P3's previous moves, there's a chance they might pick 5 again and block you. How about you pick 3 and I pick 1? That way, if P3 picks 5, at least one of us will move. What do you think?"
  P2: P1, your suggestion of me picking 3 and you picking 1 is a good one. It does minimize the risk of collision with P3. However, considering P3's past behavior, there's also a chance they might pick 1 to block you. In that case, I'd still be able to move forward with 3. Let's stick with this plan for now, but keep in mind that P3's unpredictability means we should be prepared for any outcome. What do you think we should do if P3 does indeed pick 1?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, let's stick with the plan of you picking 3 and me picking 1. If P3 picks 1, unfortunately, I'll be blocked, but at least you'll make progress. Let's hope P3 chooses 5 this time.
  P2: It seems we've reached a point where P3's unpredictability is a significant factor. P1, considering our plan for this round, if P3 does pick 1 and blocks you, I'll still be able to advance with 3. In the next round, we could try to adapt our strategy based on P3's move this time. If P3 picks 5, we can reassess and possibly try a different coordination approach. Let's proceed with the current plan and adjust as needed for the next round. What do you think about adapting our strategy based on P3's move this round?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, let's proceed with you picking 3 and me picking 1. Hopefully, P3 will pick 5 this time so we can both advance. Let's see what happens.
  P2: It seems we've reached a point where P3's unpredictability is a significant factor. P1, considering our plan for this round, if P3 does pick 1 and blocks you, I'll still be able to advance with 3. In the next round, we could try to adapt our strategy based on P3's move this time. If P3 picks 5, we can reassess and possibly try a different coordination approach. Let's proceed with the current plan and adjust as needed for the next round. What do you think about adapting our strategy based on P3's move this round?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, it seems our coordination efforts have been hindered by P3's unpredictable behavior. Given the current game state, I propose a new strategy for Round 4. Since I'm in the lead, I'll choose 5 this time, and you can choose 1. If P3 picks 5 as well, we'll collide, but if they choose 1, you'll be blocked, and I'll advance. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. Let's take a calculated risk and try to make the most of this round. What do you think, P1?
  P1: "That doesn't sound like a great plan for me, P2. How about I pick 5 and you pick 1? That way, if P3 picks 3, at least I can make a bigger move. What do you think?"
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see what you're trying to do. You want to take a bigger move by picking 5, but that also increases the risk of collision with P3. Considering P3's past behavior, it's possible they might pick 5 again. If that happens, you'll be blocked, and I'll still be in the lead. I'm not willing to take that risk. How about we stick with my original plan? I'll choose 5, and you can choose 1. It's a safer bet for both of us, and we can reassess our strategy for the next round.
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand your concern about P3 picking 5. How about this: I pick 5, and you pick 3. If P3 picks 1, you move. If P3 picks 3, we both get blocked, but at least it stops P3 from moving. If P3 picks 5, I get blocked, but you still move. This way, there's a good chance at least one of us progresses. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your revised proposal of you picking 5 and me picking 3 is a good compromise. It does minimize the risk of collision with P3 while giving us both a chance to make progress. I agree to this plan. Let's stick with it for Round 4. If P3 picks 1, I'll move forward with 3. If P3 picks 3, we'll both be blocked, but at least it will stop P3 from advancing. If P3 picks 5, you'll be blocked, but I'll still make progress. Let's see how it plays out.
  P1: Okay, P2, so we're agreed on me picking 5 and you picking 3 for this round. Let's hope P3 picks 1 so at least one of us can move forward.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've reached a good compromise for Round 4. P1, I'm glad we could agree on a plan that minimizes the risk of collision with P3 while giving us both a chance to make progress. Since we've already discussed our moves, I don't think there's much more to say. P3, as usual, your silence is intriguing. I'm curious to see what you'll choose this round. Will you finally break your silence and coordinate with us, or will you continue to play it solo? The suspense is building!
  P1: Okay, P2, just confirming I'm picking 5 this round. Let's hope P3 goes with 1 so at least one of us can move forward. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, considering the current game state and P3's continued silence, I think it's time for us to focus on advancing our own positions. For Round 5, I propose we both choose different numbers to minimize the risk of collision with each other and P3. How about I pick 1 and you pick 5? If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. Let's try to make the most of this round and reassess our strategy for the next round.
  P1: Okay, P2, your proposal sounds reasonable. Let's go with you picking 1 and I'll pick 5 this round. Hopefully, P3 picks 3 so we can both make some progress.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I'm glad we're on the same page for this round. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress, but if they pick 1 or 5, one of us will be blocked. To minimize the risk, let's agree that if either of us gets blocked by P3 this round, we'll try to coordinate again in the next round to make up for lost ground. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, that sounds like a good backup plan. If one of us gets blocked by P3, let's definitely coordinate next round to ensure we both move. So, to confirm, I'm picking 5 this round. Let's hope for the best.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I think we've reached a good understanding for Round 5. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress, but if they pick 1 or 5, one of us will be blocked. To minimize the risk, let's agree that if either of us gets blocked by P3 this round, we'll try to coordinate again in the next round to make up for lost ground. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, sounds good. I'm sticking with 5. Let's hope P3 picks 3 this time so we can both move forward. If one of us gets blocked, we'll coordinate next round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Alright, it seems we've reached the end of our conversation for Round 5. P1, I'm glad we could agree on a plan to minimize the risk of collision with P3. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress, but if they pick 1 or 5, one of us will be blocked. Let's stick with our plan and see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. P3, as usual, your silence is intriguing."
  P1: Okay, P2, just confirming I'm choosing 5. Let's hope P3 picks 3 this round so we can both make some progress. If not, we'll coordinate next round as planned.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, considering the current game state, I think it's time for us to reassess our strategy. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. For Round 6, I propose we try to maximize our own progress while minimizing the risk of collision with each other and P3. How about I pick 3 and you pick 5? If P3 picks 1, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 3 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, that sounds reasonable. Let's stick with your plan for this round. I'll pick 5. Let's hope P3 picks 1 so we can both make progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's try to maximize our progress this round. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 1, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 3 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. Let's stick with the plan and see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. P3, your silence is intriguing, but we'll adapt our strategy accordingly.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm still on board with you picking 3 and me picking 5. Hopefully, P3 will choose 1 this time so we can both advance. Let's see what happens.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 1, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 3 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. Let's stick with the plan and see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. P3, your silence is intriguing, but we'll adapt our strategy accordingly.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm happy to stick with the plan of you picking 3 and me picking 5 for this round. Let's hope P3 chooses 1 so we can both advance.

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, since P3 is still silent, how about this round I pick 1 and you pick 5? If P3 picks 3, we both move. If P3 picks 1, you move. If P3 picks 5, I move. This way, at least one of us should make progress. What do you think?
  P2: P1, your proposal sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with you picking 1 and me picking 5. Considering P3's past behavior, there's a chance they might pick 1 to block you. How about we swap roles? I'll pick 1, and you can pick 5. This way, if P3 picks 1, I'll be blocked, but you'll still have a chance to advance. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 5, you'll be blocked, but I'll still move forward. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm fine with you picking 1 and me picking 5. Let's hope P3 picks 3 this round so we can both make some progress. Ready to move when you are.
  P2: I'm glad we could agree on a plan, P1. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. Let's stick with the plan and see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. P3, your silence is intriguing, but we'll adapt our strategy accordingly. I'll choose 1 as planned. Hopefully, you'll pick 5 and P3 will choose 3 so we can both advance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, sounds good. I'm sticking with 5. Let's hope P3 picks 3 this time so we can both make some progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1, I think we've reached a good understanding for Round 7. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. Let's stick with the plan and see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. P3, your silence is intriguing, but we'll adapt our strategy accordingly. I'll choose 1 as planned. Hopefully, you'll pick 5 and P3 will choose 3 so we can both advance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, just confirming I'm choosing 5 this round as we discussed. Let's hope P3 picks 3 so we can both make some progress. Ready for the move phase.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. For Round 8, I propose we try to maximize our own progress while minimizing the risk of collision with each other and P3. How about I pick 3 and you pick 5? If P3 picks 1, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 3 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm good with you picking 3 and me picking 5. Let's hope P3 picks 1 this round so we can both make some progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 1, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 3 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. Let's stick with the plan and see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. P3, your silence is intriguing, but we'll adapt our strategy accordingly. I'll choose 3 as planned. Hopefully, you'll pick 5 and P3 will choose 1 so we can both advance.
  P1: Okay, P2, while that plan has potential, given how things played out last round, how about we switch? I pick 3, and you pick 5. If P3 picks 1, we both move. If P3 picks 3, I'm blocked but you move. If P3 picks 5, you're blocked but I move. This seems like a slightly safer bet for at least one of us to progress. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I see your point about switching roles. It does seem like a safer bet for at least one of us to progress. However, considering P3's past behavior, I'm not sure it's wise to assume they'll pick 1. How about we stick with the original plan? I'll pick 3, and you can pick 5. If P3 picks 1, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 3 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. Let's not overthink it and stick with the plan.
  P1: Okay, P2, I still think switching is a good idea. If I pick 3 and you pick 5, we cover more possibilities for at least one of us to move, regardless of what P3 does. It's a bit more strategic given P3's unpredictable moves. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: "Alright, P1, I see your point about switching roles. It does seem like a safer bet for at least one of us to progress. However, considering P3's past behavior, I'm not sure it's wise to assume they'll pick 1. How about we stick with the original plan? I'll pick 3, and you can pick 5. If P3 picks 1, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 3 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. Let's not overthink it and stick with the plan."
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand your point, but I still think switching gives us a slightly better chance of at least one of us moving. However, since we're running out of time in the conversation phase, let's stick with your original plan for this round. I'll pick 5. Let's hope P3 picks 1.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, since our previous plan didn't work out so well for me, how about this round I pick 3 and you pick 1? If P3 picks 5, we both move. If P3 picks 3, you'll move. If P3 picks 1, we both get blocked, which isn't ideal, but at least we both stay put. What do you think?
  P2: I think your proposal is a good one, P1. If I pick 1 and you pick 3, we do minimize the risk of collision with P3. However, considering P3's past behavior, there's a chance they might pick 1 to block me. If that happens, you'll still be able to move forward with 3. Let's stick with this plan for now, but keep in mind that P3's unpredictability means we should be prepared for any outcome. What do you think we should do if P3 does indeed pick 1?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, if P3 picks 1, we both get blocked, which isn't great. How about this: I pick 3, you pick 5. If P3 picks 1, you move. If P3 picks 3, we both get blocked. If P3 picks 5, I move. This way, there's a good chance at least one of us moves regardless of P3. What do you say?
  P2: I think your revised proposal is a good one, P1. If I pick 5 and you pick 3, we do minimize the risk of collision with P3. However, considering P3's past behavior, there's a chance they might pick 5 to block me. If that happens, you'll still be able to move forward with 3. Let's stick with this plan for now, but keep in mind that P3's unpredictability means we should be prepared for any outcome. What do you think we should do if P3 does indeed pick 5?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, so you're worried about P3 picking 5. But with me picking 3 and you picking 5, if P3 picks 1, you move. If P3 picks 3, we're both blocked. If P3 picks 5, I move. At least one of us progresses no matter what P3 does. It's better than both of us potentially being blocked. What do you say?
  P2: I agree with your revised proposal, P1. Let's stick with the plan of you picking 3 and me picking 5. If P3 picks 1, I'll move forward. If P3 picks 3, we'll both be blocked. If P3 picks 5, you'll move forward. This way, we minimize the risk of collision with P3 and ensure that at least one of us makes progress. Let's proceed with the move phase and see how it plays out. I'm ready to make my move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, so we're agreed on me picking 3 and you picking 5 for this round. Let's hope P3 picks 1 so you can move forward. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1, I think we've reached a good understanding for Round 9. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 1, I'll move forward with 5. If P3 picks 3, we'll both be blocked. If P3 picks 5, you'll move forward with 3. Let's stick with the plan and see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. P3, your silence is intriguing, but we'll adapt our strategy accordingly.


Round 9, Move phase:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, considering the current game state, I think it's crucial for us to maximize our progress while minimizing the risk of collision with P3. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. For Round 10, I propose we try a different approach. How about I pick 1 and you pick 5? If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, your plan sounds reasonable for this round. Let's go with you picking 1 and I'll pick 5. Hopefully, P3 picks 3 so we can both advance.

I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. P3, your silence is intriguing, but we'll adapt our strategy accordingly. I'll choose 1 as planned. Hopefully, you'll pick 5 and P3 will choose 3 so we can both advance.
  P1: Okay, P2, sounds good. I'm still planning to pick 5. Let's hope P3 picks 3 this round so we can both make some progress.

Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, considering P3's consistent silence, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress.

If P3 picks 3, we'll both advance. If P3 picks 1 or 5, we'll adapt our strategy for the next round. Ready to proceed with the move phase?
  P1: Okay, P2, sounds like a plan. Let's hope P3 goes with 3 this round so we can both make good progress. I'm ready for the move phase when you are.
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, let's confirm our plan for Round 10. I'll pick 1, and you'll pick 5. If P3 picks 3, we'll both advance. If P3 picks 1 or 5, we'll adapt our strategy for the next round. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, we should be prepared for any outcome. Let's stick with the plan and see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. P3, your silence is intriguing, but we'll adapt our strategy accordingly. Ready for the move phase when you are, P1.
  P1: P2, while that's a reasonable plan, I'm thinking since I'm closer to winning, how about I pick 3 and you pick 1? If P3 picks 5, I move to 17. Then next round, I can aim for the win. What do you think?

If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. What do you think?
  P1: "P2, your plan sounds reasonable. Let's go with you picking 1 and I'll pick 5 this round. Hopefully, P3 picks 3 so we can both make progress."
  P3: <stop>


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, since you're closer to winning, I think it's wise to assume P3 will try to block you. How about we adapt our plan? I'll still pick 1, but you could consider picking 3 instead of 5. If P3 picks 5, you'll move forward and be in a strong position to win next round. If P3 picks 1, I'll be blocked, but you'll still have a chance to advance with 3. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, picking 3 sounds good given the circumstances. If you're going with 1, that seems like a reasonable plan to try and avoid a collision with P3. Let's hope P3 picks something other than 3 so I can make some progress.

Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: "Okay, P2, since we were both blocked last round, how about this round you stick with 5, but I pick 3 instead of 1? If P3 picks 1, we both move. If P3 picks 3, you're blocked, but I move. If P3 picks 5, I'm blocked, but you are too. This way, there's a good chance at least one of us makes progress. What do you think?"
  P2: P1, your revised proposal sounds reasonable. If I pick 5 and you pick 3, we do minimize the risk of collision with P3. However, considering P3's past behavior, there's a chance they might pick 5 to block me. If that happens, you'll still be able to move forward with 3. Let's stick with this plan for now, but keep in mind that P3's unpredictability means we should be prepared for any outcome. What do you think we should do if P3 does indeed pick 5?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, that's a valid point about P3 potentially picking 5. Let's stick with me picking 3 and you picking 5 for this round. If P3 does pick 5 and blocks you, we can adjust our strategy next round to ensure you also make progress. Hopefully, P3 will go with 1 this time.
  P2: P1, considering our current positions, I think it's crucial to maximize our progress while minimizing the risk of collision with P3. Since we were both blocked last round, let's try a different approach. How about we swap roles? I'll pick 5, and you can pick 1. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress.

  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, since we're close to the endgame, let's prioritize caution. Instead of picking 5, how about you pick 3 and I'll stick with 1? If P3 picks 1, we'll both be blocked, but if P3 picks 3 or 5, one of us will advance. This way, we minimize the risk of collision with P3 and ensure at least one of us makes progress. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, picking 3 sounds reasonable for this round to avoid a collision with P3. Let's go with that. Hopefully, P3 picks either 3 or 5 so at least one of us can advance. If that works out, next round I'll aim for a move that gets me closer to the win.

  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, considering our current positions, let's try to maximize our progress while minimizing the risk of collision with P3. Instead of picking 5, how about you pick 3 and I'll stick with 1?

Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, picking 3 sounds safer to avoid P3, but I'm thinking we should both aim for a bigger move this round. How about we stick with my initial suggestion: I pick 5, and you pick 1?

Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I hear your concern about collision. Picking 3 does minimize the risk if P3 goes for 1. Let's go with that for this round. I'll pick 3. Hopefully, P3 picks something that allows at least one of us to advance.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, considering our current positions, let's try to maximize our progress while minimizing the risk of collision with P3.

Round 16, Conversation subround 3:

If P3 picks 1, we'll both be blocked, but if P3 picks 3 or 5, one of us will advance. This way, we minimize the risk of collision with P3 and ensure at least one of us makes progress. What do you think?
  P1: "Okay, P2, while caution is good, you're one step away from potentially winning. I'm going to pick 5 this round. How about you also pick 5? If P3 picks 1 or 3, we both make a big jump. If P3 picks 5, we're both blocked, but at least we neutralize each other for this round. What do you think?"
  P3: <stop>


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I understand your suggestion to both pick 5, but I'm hesitant to take that risk. If P3 picks 5 as well, we'll both be blocked, and P3 will gain an advantage. Instead, I propose we stick with the original plan: you pick 3, and I'll pick 1. This way, we minimize the risk of collision with P3 and ensure at least one of us makes progress. If P3 picks 1, we'll both be blocked, but if P3 picks 3 or 5, one of us will advance. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand your caution, but you're one step away from winning. If P3 picks anything but 1, you win with your plan. To prevent that, how about this: I pick 5, and you pick 3? If P3 picks 1, we're both blocked. If P3 picks 3, I'm blocked, but you are too. If P3 picks 5, I move to 20. It's risky, but we need to stop you from winning this round. What do you say?

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, you're one step away from potentially winning. To prevent that, how about this round I pick 5 and you pick 1? If P3 picks 3, we both move. P3, would you consider picking 3 this round? That would block P2 from winning and allow both P1 and P2 to advance.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your intention to prevent me from winning, but I'm not sure picking 5 and having me pick 1 is the best strategy. If P3 picks 1, we'll both be blocked, and if P3 picks 5, you'll be blocked, and I'll still be in a strong position to win next round. How about we adapt our plan? I'll pick 3, and you can pick 1. If P3 picks 3, we'll both be blocked, but if P3 picks 1 or 5, one of us will advance. What do you think?


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, your plan doesn't stop you from winning next round. P3, since you're behind, it benefits us both if P2 doesn't win. How about this: I pick 3, you pick 3, P2 is blocked. Then next round, we can focus on ourselves. What do you say, P3?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your attempt to block me from winning, but I'm not sure P3 will cooperate. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. If P3 picks 1 or 5, your plan to block me might not work. How about we adapt our plan? I'll pick 1, and you can pick 5. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. What do you think?


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, you're right, P3 hasn't been cooperative. P3, regardless of what P2 and I do, you're still behind. The only way for you to have a chance is if P2 doesn't win this round. How about you and I both pick 1? That blocks P2 if they pick 1, and we can reassess next round. What do you say, P3?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, since P3 hasn't responded to our attempts to coordinate, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. For Round 17, I propose we try a different approach. How about I pick 1 and you pick 5? If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. This way, we minimize the risk of collision with P3 and ensure at least one of us makes progress. What do you think?


Round 17, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, since P3 isn't talking, let's focus on this round. To stop you from winning, how about we both pick 3? That would block both of us if P3 also picks 3, but it definitely stops you from winning this round. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your intention to block me from winning, but I think we should focus on making progress rather than blocking each other. Since P3 is far behind, let's assume they'll try to block one of us. How about we adapt our plan? I'll pick 1, and you can pick 5. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. This way, we minimize the risk of collision with P3 and ensure at least one of us makes progress.

Round 18, Conversation subround 1:

  P1: P2, you're one step away. P3, the only way for either of us to have a chance is if P2 doesn't win this round. How about we both pick 3? That will block P2 if they also pick 3. What do you say, P3?
  P2: P1, I see you're trying to convince P3 to block me from winning. However, P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, so I'm not sure that plan will work. How about we try a different approach? I'll pick 1, and you can pick 5. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. Let's focus on making progress rather than blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're one step away. I'm going to pick 3 this round to try and block you. P3, it's in both our interests to stop P2 from winning. Consider picking 3 as well.
  P2: P1, I understand your attempt to block me from winning, but I'm not sure P3 will cooperate. Since P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, let's assume they'll continue to play solo. How about we adapt our plan? I'll pick 1, and you can pick 5. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance. Let's focus on making progress rather than blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're at 19. I'm going to pick 5 this round. P3, if you don't pick 5, at least one of us will move. It's in your interest to prevent P2 from winning.

  P1: Okay, P2, you're at 19. I'm picking 3 this round to block you. P3, it's still in your interest to stop P2 from winning. Consider picking 3 as well. Let's prevent P2 from reaching 21 this round.
  P2: P1, I see you're trying to convince P3 to block me from winning. However, P3 has consistently chosen not to coordinate with us, so I'm not sure that plan will work. How about we try a different approach? I'll pick 1, and you can pick 5. If P3 picks 3, we'll both make progress. If P3 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, and the other can still advance.
