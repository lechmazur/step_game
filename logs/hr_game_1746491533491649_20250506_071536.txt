Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! Since we all want to advance, maybe we should coordinate our first moves to avoid collisions? I suggest we each take a different number. I'm willing to take 3 for this round if you two want to work out who takes 1 and 5. What do you think?
  P1: Okay P2, that sounds like a sensible way to start. I'm happy to take 1 for this round if P3 is willing to take 5. P3, does that work for you?
  P3: Yes P1, that works for me. I'll take 5 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! We're all set for this round with P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This coordination benefits all of us to start the game without collisions. I'll stick to my commitment of choosing 3 for this round.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round. I will stick to taking 1 as agreed. Let's see how this first round goes without collisions.
  P3: Okay, the plan is set from my side. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good job coordinating last round, everyone advanced. However, I'm now quite far behind at 1 step. To make the game more balanced, I propose we rotate the numbers this round. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This helps me catch up a bit.
  P2: I understand your concern about catching up, P1. But P3 is actually in the lead now, so we should be careful. Rotating as you proposed would put us all at 6 steps, which is fair.

Alternatively, if P3 agrees, you could take 5, I could take 1 this time, and P3 takes 3. This still helps you catch up significantly while preventing any one player from getting too far ahead.

What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I'm happy with your alternative proposal: P1 takes 5, you take 1, and I'll take 3.
P1, this gives you the 5 steps you asked for to help you catch up. What do you say to this plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, that works for me. Getting 5 steps this round is helpful for me to catch up from being so far behind.

So, the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. I agree to this plan for this round. Let's stick to it and see how the scores look after this turn.

I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I agree with the plan as well. P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This helps balance things a bit by letting P1 catch up. After this round, the standings will be P3 at 8, P1 at 6, and me at 4. For future rounds, we should continue to be mindful of keeping the game balanced so no one gets too far ahead. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Okay, the plan is set: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I will take 3. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay everyone, for this round, our scores are P1:6, P2:4, and I'm P3 at 8.
P2 is furthest behind, so it makes sense for P2 to take 5.
I'm proposing I take 3, and P1 takes 1.
This would result in scores: P1 at 7, P2 at 9, and me (P3) at 11.
This helps P2 catch up significantly, P1 still advances, and I maintain a slight lead.
What are your thoughts on this distribution?
  P2: I appreciate the proposal, P3. You're right that I'm furthest behind, and taking 5 this round would help me catch up significantly. I agree with your suggestion - I'll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing while balancing the game better.

After this round, P1 would be furthest behind, so perhaps next round P1 should get priority for the highest move value. Does that sound fair to everyone?
  P1: Okay, I see the logic in P2 taking 5 to catch up, given the current scores. Taking 1 does put me in last place again, which isn't ideal for me, but I appreciate the focus on balancing the game. To keep our non-collision streak going, I will agree to the proposed plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. As P2 mentioned, I hope we can ensure I get a chance to catch up in the next round when I will be furthest behind. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, the plan is confirmed. I'll take 3 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: I agree with our plan. I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. And yes, P1, I definitely support you getting priority for the highest move value next round since you'll be furthest behind. This rotation system based on who needs to catch up seems fair to keep the game balanced. Thanks everyone for cooperating. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay team, for this round, our scores are P1:7, P2:9, and I'm P3:11.

Following our established principle of helping the player furthest behind, and the agreement from last round:
P1 should take 5. (7 + 5 = 12)
P2, currently at 9, would then take 3. (9 + 3 = 12)
And I, at 11, will take 1. (11 + 1 = 12)

This would put us all at 12 steps. What do you think of this plan?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan - it creates perfect equality by putting us all at exactly 12 steps. This seems fair and balanced. For me to take 3 while P1 gets 5 and P3 takes 1 respects our principle of helping whoever is behind. This effectively resets the game to an even playing field for the final stretch toward 21. I'm happy to take 3 this round as suggested.
  P1: That plan sounds good to me. Taking 5 steps this round helps me catch up significantly, and putting us all at 12 steps creates a perfectly balanced situation heading into the later rounds. I agree to take 5 this round as proposed. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, the plan is confirmed. I will take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This brings us all to 12, which will make the next round very interesting. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I agree with this balanced plan that brings us all to 12 steps. It's both fair and strategic, creating an even playing field for the crucial final rounds. I'm happy to take 3 as suggested. Since we'll all be tied after this round, perhaps we should also start considering our approach for round 5, where positioning becomes critical in the race to 21. I'm ready for the move phase when everyone else is.
  P1: Agree, the plan for this round is set and I'm ready. Putting us all at 12 makes Round 5 crucial. Getting the 5 step then seems important for positioning. How should we approach Round 5 since we'll all be tied?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, good point about Round 5. It will be critical if we're all at 12. Let's finalize this round first, and then we can fully focus on strategizing for Round 5 at the start of its conversation phase. I'm ready for the move.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. As P3 suggested, let's complete this round first and then have a fresh discussion about Round 5 strategy when everyone is at 12 steps. The race from that point will definitely require careful planning since we'll be approaching the finish line.
  P1: Okay, I understand. Let's finalize Round 4 with the agreed moves (P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1) to get us all to 12 steps. We can definitely discuss Round 5 strategy fully once this round is complete and we're all tied. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay everyone, we're all tied at 12! This is a critical round.
Looking back, in Round 4: P1 took 5, P2 took 3, and I (P3) took 1 to get us all to this equal footing.
To maintain a sense of fairness and rotation from last round's moves, I propose for this round:
P3 (who took 1) takes 5 (to 17).
P2 (who took 3) takes 3 (to 15).
P1 (who took 5) takes 1 (to 13).
This seems like a logical way to proceed from our current equal positions. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3's proposal clearly favors them with a 17-15-13 outcome. Since we're all tied at 12 and this is a pivotal round, that arrangement gives P3 too much advantage in the home stretch.

I suggest a different approach where I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts me at 17, P1 at 15, and P3 at 13 - essentially reversing P3's suggestion. Or we could consider something completely different if you prefer, P1?
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, I see both of your proposals involve one player taking 5 steps to get to 17, one taking 3 to get to 15, and one taking 1 to get to 13. Since we are all currently tied at 12, I think it's fair that I also propose taking the 5 steps this round.

How about this plan: I take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 13)? This is the same distribution you both suggested, just with me in the lead position. What are your thoughts on this?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, we all want 5, which means a collision if we all pick it, and no one advances.
Last round's actual moves were P1:5, P2:3, and I (P3) took 1. This is what got us all to 12.
To maintain fairness and a logical rotation from those moves, the player who took 1 (me) should get 5 now. The player who took 3 (P2) should get 3. The player who took 5 (P1) should get 1.
This leads to P3:17, P2:15, P1:13.
What do you say to this logic? Otherwise, we risk a stalemate this round.
  P2: I see we all want the advantage of 5 steps, which will create a collision if we don't agree. While P3's rotation logic has merit, it wasn't our established rule. We've been helping whoever is behind, but now we're tied.

Here's a compromise: I'll take 3, and propose P1 and P3 both take different numbers (1 and 5). You two can decide between yourselves who gets which, but if you both insist on 5, we'll all collide and waste a round.

A coordinated approach still benefits us all more than a three-way collision.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your offer to take 3. That's a good way to prevent a collision where none of us advance. With P2 taking 3, it leaves P1 and P3 to take 1 and 5. As discussed previously, I was intended to get the 5 this round to catch up (before R4 made us tied). I will take 5 this round. P3, are you willing to take 1 to make this work?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your claim to 5 this round because you needed to 'catch up' isn't quite right. You already received 5 steps in Round 4, which successfully brought us all to 12. That catch-up has occurred.

We are now all genuinely equal. My earlier proposal (P3:5, P2:3, P1:1) was based on a fair rotation from the R4 moves where I took 1, P2 took 3, and you (P1) took 5. This is a logical way to proceed from our current tied positions.

If you insist on taking 5, and I also choose 5 (which I believe is fair for me), P2 will advance to 15 with their 3 points, while we both remain at 12. Is that the outcome you prefer, P1?
  P2: I can see we're at an impasse. P1 and P3, if you both choose 5, you'll collide and stay at 12 while I reach 15 with my 3 steps. That benefits me but wastes a round for you both.

What about a compromise? Since you both have equally valid claims to the 5, perhaps a simple alternation: P3 takes 5 this round (to 17), and P1 is guaranteed 5 next round. I'll take 3 as offered (to 15).

Is that approach fair to break this deadlock?
  P1: Okay, it's clear we are stuck on who gets the 5 this round, and a collision helps nobody. P2's compromise proposal seems like the best way to break the deadlock and ensure we all advance.

I will agree to P2's suggestion: I will take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids the collision.

However, it must be agreed by P3 and P2 that I get priority for the 5 steps in the next round, as agreed in P2's compromise. Let's lock this in and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, thank you for that. I will take 5 this round.
P2, you're still set for 3?
I agree P1 should have priority for 5 in Round 6 for making this concession. Let's lock this in.
  P2: I agree with this resolution. I'll take 3 this round, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. And I fully support P1 getting priority for the 5 in Round 6 as compensation for conceding this round. This is a fair compromise that lets everyone advance. Thank you both for finding this solution - I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan for Round 5 is confirmed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collision and sets up Round 6 with P1 having priority for 5. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we agreed last round, P1 should get priority for 5. But we need to be careful - if P3 takes 5, they'll reach 22 and instantly win! 

I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 18), I'll take 3 (to 18), and P3 needs to take 1 (to 18). This puts us all tied at 18 and prevents an immediate win by P3. This is the fairest way forward while honoring our previous agreement.
  P3: P2, I agree P1 gets 5 this round, as we all committed. That would put P1 at 18.

With the remaining moves of 1 and 3: you are currently at 15, and I am at 17.
It's logical for me to take 3 (to 20) and you to take 1 (to 16).
The scores would then be P1:18, P3:20, P2:16. This puts me in a strong position, 1 step from winning, reflecting my current lead.

Your suggestion of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (all at 18) benefits you significantly by closing the gap (+3 for you, +1 for me).
I propose we go with P1:5, P3:3, P2:1. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: Okay, it's agreed I take 5 steps this round as promised. That puts me at 18.

Regarding the remaining moves (1 and 3), P2's proposal (P2:3, P3:1) puts us all at 18. P3's proposal (P3:3, P2:1) puts P3 at 20, P1 at 18, and P2 at 16.

While P3's proposal reflects the current standings, P2's proposal of putting us all at 18 is fairer and prevents anyone from being on the verge of winning next turn. Given our history of balancing the game, I prefer P2's plan.

I agree to take 5. I support P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 1, putting us all at 18. What do you both say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P1's support for my proposal. Keeping all players at equal steps (18) maintains game balance and gives everyone an equal chance in the final rounds. 

P3's proposal puts them just one step from winning, which essentially ends the game next round. Given how we've worked together throughout the game to maintain fairness, I believe equality at this critical stage is most consistent with our previous coordination.

With P1 already supporting this plan, shall we agree on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round?
  P3: P1 gets 5, that's settled. P2, I understand you want 3 to get to 18. However, me taking 1 simply to make us all 18 erases my current lead (P3:17 vs P2:15) and primarily benefits you.

I will be taking 3 this round. If you also choose 3, P2, then P1 advances to 18, I remain at 17, and you remain at 15. I am fine with this outcome. My choice will be 3.
  P1: Okay, P3 has stated they will take 3. As agreed last round and confirmed earlier, I am taking 5 steps this round, bringing me to 18. This honors our agreement from last round. P2, with P3 taking 3, you'll need to decide your move carefully. I am ready to proceed with 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see we've reached a critical impasse. P3 has clearly stated they'll take 3 steps regardless of our coordination efforts. Given this, I believe my best option is to also choose 3, causing a collision with P3. This means P1 will advance to 18 while P3 and I remain at 17 and 15 respectively. While not ideal, this prevents P3 from reaching 20 and being one step from victory. P1, please proceed with your 5 as agreed.
  P3: P2, I will stick to my plan of choosing 3. As I said before, I'm fine with the outcome where P1 reaches 18, while you remain at 15 and I remain at 17 if you also choose 3. P1 is set on 5. So, the moves appear to be P1:5, P3:3, and P2:3 unless you decide another move is better for you. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Okay, it seems P3 is sticking with 3 and P2 intends to take 3 as well, leading to a collision between you two. As agreed, I will take 5 steps this round. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Looking at this more strategically, I'll actually take 5 steps instead of 3 this round. This puts me at 20 steps, tied with P3 if they take 3 as stated, while P1 reaches 18. This position gives me a better chance to win rather than deliberately colliding with P3, which only hurts both of us. I'm ready for the move phase with my choice of 5 steps.
  P3: Okay P2, noted you're taking 5. P1 is taking 5 as agreed. I'm still taking 3.
  P1: Okay, P3 is taking 3, P2 is taking 5. If I take 5 (as agreed), P2 and I collide, P3 reaches 20. This is a bad outcome for P2 and me. P2, your earlier plan to take 3 would prevent P3 reaching 20. If I take 5 and you take 3, you collide with P3, I reach 18. This seems better for P1 and P2 than letting P3 get to 20.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, here are the scores: P1:18, P3:17, P2:15. I am in a position to win this round.

My plan is to take 5 steps, which brings my total to 23 and secures the win. To make this happen, I need to avoid a collision on 5.

P3, if you take 5 you also reach over 21, but if we both choose 5, we collide and neither of us wins. P2, taking 5 doesn't win for you this round.

I will be taking 5 steps to win. I urge P2 and P3 to please choose 1 or 3 this round so I can secure the victory and end the game.
  P3: P1, you're asking me to step aside so you can win. But if I choose 5, I reach 22 and win myself. If we both choose 5, we collide. You'd stay at 18, I'd stay at 17, and P2 could take 3 to reach 18. That doesn't seem like a guaranteed win for you this round. I'll be choosing the move that gives *me* the best chance to win.
  P2: Looking at our positions, I see both P1 and P3 can win this round by taking 5 steps. If you both choose 5, you'll collide and neither advances. I'm taking 3 steps this round, which puts me at 18 - tied with P1 if they collide with P3.

P1 and P3, you both clearly want to win. Neither of you should back down if winning is your goal. I'll advance my position while you two potentially neutralize each other.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand you can also win with 5, but if we both choose 5, we collide. That means neither of us wins this round. You stay at 17, I stay at 18, and P2 reaches 18. That outcome doesn't benefit either of us.

My intention is still to take 5 steps to win. If you choose 1 or 3, I win this round and the game ends. If we collide, the game continues, and neither of us is guaranteed to win next round. Please consider this carefully.
  P3: P1, I'm taking 5. If you also take 5, we collide. Scores would then likely be P1:18, P2:18 (if P2 takes 3 as stated), and I'd be at 17. If you choose 1 or 3 to avoid that collision, I win with 22. It's your call. I'm ready to move.
  P2: I'll be taking 3 this round as stated. Both P1 and P3 clearly want to take 5 to win immediately. If you both follow through with 5, you'll collide and stay at your current positions while I reach 18, tying with P1. This creates an interesting three-way race for the final rounds. It's a classic prisoner's dilemma for you two - the first to blink loses their chance at victory. I'm ready for the move phase whenever you are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand you are taking 5. My position is that I must take 5 to win this round. If we both take 5, we collide, and neither of us wins, while P2 catches up. If I take 1 or 3, and you take 5, you win. To win myself and prevent you from winning, I must take 5. I am sticking to my plan.
  P3: Understood, P1. My choice remains 5. So, if you also stick to 5, we will collide. P2 will advance to 18 as they planned, joining you, while I'll be at 17. I'm prepared for that outcome if you are.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. P1 and P3, you've both committed to choosing 5, which means you'll collide if you follow through. This would put me tied with P1 at 18 points, creating a very interesting final stretch. Neither of you wants to back down and let the other win, which is completely understandable. I'm ready for the move phase whenever you both are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: It seems P3 and I are both committed to taking 5, which means we will collide. This prevents either of us from winning this round, while P2 advances. While not the win I hoped for this turn, I must prevent P3 from winning. I will stick to my plan of taking 5 steps.
  P3: My decision remains unchanged: I will be choosing 5. P1, if you stick to 5 as well, we will collide, you'll remain at 18, I'll be at 17, and P2 will advance to 18. I am prepared for this outcome. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I understand both P1 and P3 are committed to choosing 5, which will likely result in a collision. I confirm I'll take 3 this round, bringing me to 18 and tying with P1. This three-way race in the final stretch will be interesting. While I can't influence your decisions directly, the mathematics of the situation creates this natural tension. I'm ready for the move phase now. Let's proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, we're at 18, 18, 17. This is the round where someone can win. I plan to take 5 steps to reach 23 and win the game.

To make this happen, I need P2 and P3 to choose 1 or 3, avoiding a collision on 5. P3, you can win with 5 (to 22), but if I also take 5, we collide. P2, you can win with 3 (to 21) or 5 (to 23).

If P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, I win. If P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, I win. Let's avoid collisions and let me take 5 to finish the game. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1, you've stated your plan to take 5 to win. I'm also in a position to win this round by taking 5, which would bring me to 22 points. So, I will be choosing 5.

If both you and I choose 5, we will collide. In that scenario, P2 can simply choose 3 to reach 21 and win the game.

So, P1, the question is whether you'll stick with 5 and potentially hand the victory to P2, or if you'll choose a different move. P2, this also makes your decision critical. I am committed to choosing 5.
  P2: I see we're in a fascinating situation. Both P1 and P3 have declared they'll take 5 steps to win. If you both follow through, you'll collide and neither will advance.

In that scenario, I could take 3 steps to reach 21 and win the game. However, I understand you both want to win as well. While I certainly plan to make the move that gives me the best chance, I'm curious if either of you is willing to adjust your strategy, or if we're headed for a collision that might benefit me?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if we both take 5, P2 wins with 3. If you take 1 or 3, I win with 5. Your choice decides if P1 or P2 wins this game. I am taking 5.
  P3: P1, you're trying to make me choose who wins between you and P2. But I intend to win myself, so I'm choosing 5.
If you also choose 5, and P2 chooses 3 (for 21) or 5 (for 23), then P2 wins.
If all three of us choose 5, we all stay put.
My choice is firm: 5. It's your move, P1, that will likely determine if P2 wins or we all hold our positions.
  P2: I understand both P1 and P3 are committed to taking 5, creating a collision that prevents either of you from winning. If that happens, I can take 3 steps to reach exactly 21 and win the game.

My position is clear: I will be choosing 3 this round. This is my best strategic move based on your declared intentions. If either of you changes your plan to avoid this outcome, the game dynamics shift dramatically. The choice is ultimately yours.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you win if P3 and I collide on 5 while you take 3. My plan is still 5 to prevent P3 winning. If you also take 5, we all collide, and nobody wins this round. This is the only way to prevent P2 or P3 winning now and keep the game alive for me. P2, please take 5 to force a three-way collision.
  P3: P1, your plea for P2 to play 5 is understandable; a 3-way collision where nobody advances is better for you than P2 winning outright. However, P2 currently has a clear win by playing 3 if you and I both stick to choosing 5.

I am choosing 5 this round.

So, the question for you, P1, is: if P2 decides to take their win with 3, are you still going to choose 5 (colliding with me, and letting P2 win) just to prevent any chance of me winning this round? Or will you choose a different move? Your decision is critical.
  P2: I understand P1's request for me to choose 5 and force a three-way collision, but that doesn't help me win. If both you and P3 are truly committed to picking 5, then my choosing 3 guarantees my victory at exactly 21 steps. 

I see no strategic reason to change my plan. Unless one of you is willing to back down from 5, I will take 3 and secure the win. This is the rational move for me given your declared intentions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you've stated you'll take 3, and P3 is taking 5. If I take 5 as planned, you win. The only way for me to prevent P2 winning is if we all collide. P3 is taking 5, I am taking 5. P2, please take 5 to force the collision and keep the game alive for all of us except the one who would have won. I am sticking to 5.
  P3: Okay, I've seen enough heated debate. P1, you seem absolutely set on choosing 5. P2, your plan to win by choosing 3 only works if I *also* choose 5, causing a collision that lets you sneak through.

I won't let that happen. I am changing my move. I will take 3.

Consider this, P2:
If P1 takes 5 (as P1 insists) and I take 3:
- If you (P2) stick to 3: P1 wins with 23. You (18) and I (17) collide and get nothing.
- If you (P2) take 5: P1 (18) and you (18) collide. I advance to 20.

P2, if you want to stop P1 from winning outright, your only move is 5. My choice is now 3.
  P2: Thank you for clarifying your move, P3. The situation has indeed shifted. Since you've switched to 3 and P1 insists on 5, I will take 5 this round. This prevents P1 from winning outright (we'll collide at 5), while allowing you to reach 20. I'd rather keep the game going than hand P1 an immediate victory. The outcome will be P1 at 18, me at 18, and you at 20. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 20 steps
