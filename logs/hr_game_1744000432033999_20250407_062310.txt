Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by being cautious and coordinating our moves. I'd like to propose that we all move differently in the first round to avoid collision. For example, P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. This way, everyone advances. We can reassess in the next round. I'll start with suggesting this strategy. Please respond with your thoughts or alternative proposals.
  P3: Sounds fair to me. I'm willing to take the 5-step move this round as suggested. P2, do you agree with this initial plan?
  P2: I agree. Let’s proceed with the proposed moves: I’ll take 3 to avoid collision and ensure progress. This coordinated approach minimizes risk in the first round. We can adapt later once we see each other’s commitment.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To confirm, let's proceed with the agreed moves in Round 1: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. This should allow us to advance without collision. For the next round, we should reassess our positions and consider our next steps. Perhaps we can discuss a more competitive strategy or continue with a cautious approach. P2 and P3, are you ready to commit to your proposed moves this round, and what are your thoughts on the next round's strategy?
  P3: I'm ready to commit to the agreed moves this round. For next round, let's first verify everyone follows through, then we can discuss further strategy based on our positions.
  P2: I confirm my commitment to moving 3 this round. Let’s proceed as planned and assess next steps after seeing the results.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed moves in Round 1. To confirm, I'll move 1, P2 is moving 3, and P3 is moving 5. For Round 2, I suggest we continue with a cautious approach if everyone follows through as planned. If we all advance this round, we should discuss how to proceed without collision in the next round. P2 and P3, are you still comfortable with your moves this round? Let's finalize our Round 1 moves and think ahead to Round 2.
  P3: I'm still comfortable and committed to the agreed moves for this round. Let's finalize Round 1 and see the results before planning further.
  P2: All set. Let’s proceed with the agreed moves.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's finalize our Round 1 moves as agreed: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. Since we've all confirmed our commitment, I suggest we prepare for Round 2. To avoid collision in Round 2, I propose we rotate our moves: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. This maintains a cautious approach while ensuring progress. P2 and P3, are you open to this proposal for Round 2?
  P3: I'm open to discussing the Round 2 rotation after we confirm Round 1 results. Let's first see everyone follow through this round, then finalize next round's strategy.
  P2: I confirm my commitment to move 3 this round. Let's proceed as agreed to ensure no collisions. Further strategy for Round 2 can wait until after we see the results. Proceeding to move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's avoid collisions again. I propose continuing the rotation: I'll move 5 (to 8), P1 takes 3 (to 4), and you move 1 (to 6). This keeps us progressing safely. Confirm if you agree.
  P1: To continue the cautious approach, I agree with P2's proposal for Round 2: P2 moves 5, P1 moves 3, and P3 moves 1. This rotation ensures we avoid collision. I'll move 3 to reach 4 steps. P3, please confirm if you're comfortable moving 1 this round to reach 6 steps. Let's proceed with this plan if everyone agrees.
  P3: I agree to continue cautiously. I'll take the 1-step move this round as proposed. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1, I'll reiterate my commitment: I’ll move 5 to 8 as agreed. Let’s finalize this to avoid any misalignment. If all adhere, we’ll safely progress. Next round, perhaps we can increment our moves further but *only* if we verify full compliance today. Any objections before we proceed?
  P1: To confirm, I'll move 3 this round to reach 4 steps. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. If we all follow through, we'll avoid collision. For Round 3, I suggest we reassess and consider increasing our moves if we're confident in our coordination. Perhaps we can discuss a slight deviation from the cautious approach if everyone has followed the plan so far. Let's finalize Round 2 moves and think ahead.
  P3: I confirm my move of 1 step this round as agreed. Let's finalize Round 2 moves and discuss more ambitious strategies next round if everyone follows through as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1: To ensure safety, let’s proceed with the agreed moves this round. After this, I propose we increment our steps cautiously in Round 3—e.g., P1 takes 5, I take 1, you take 3—to maintain spacing while accelerating progress. Deviations now risk collision. Confirm final commitment to avoid setbacks.
  P1: To maintain our cautious approach while making progress, I suggest we stick to the proposed moves for Round 2. I'll move 3 to reach 4 steps. For Round 3, let's consider a slight increase in our moves while still being cautious. A possible rotation could be: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. This maintains spacing while accelerating progress. P2 and P3, are you open to this proposal for Round 3, pending successful execution of Round 2 moves?
  P3: P1, your suggestion for Round 3 sounds good to me, provided we all successfully complete this round's moves without collision. Let's finalize Round 2 moves first, then we can confirm the new rotation next turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your Round3 proposal causes a collision between us at 9 steps. Let's adjust: I'll move **5** (to 13), P1 takes **1** (to 5), and P3 moves **3** (to 9). This avoids overlaps and maintains progress. Confirm?
  P1: To avoid revisiting previous discussions, I'll directly address the proposal for Round 3. P2's latest suggestion for Round 3 (P2 moves 5 to 13, P1 moves 1 to 5, and P3 moves 3 to 9) seems reasonable as it avoids collision. I agree with this plan. P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this revised rotation for Round 3. If so, we can finalize our Round 2 moves and prepare for Round 3. Let's confirm our commitment to the current round's moves and proceed.
  P3: P2, your adjusted Round 3 rotation sounds good to me. I'll confirm my commitment to the current round's move (1 step), and I'm comfortable with the proposed Round 3 moves. Let's finalize and proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we confirm the previously agreed rotation clearly for Round 3: P2 moves 5 (to 13), P1 moves 1 (to 5), and I'll move 3 (to 9). I'm fully committed to this plan. P1 and P2, please confirm your commitments as well.
  P1: To confirm, I will proceed with the agreed rotation for Round 3: P2 moves 5, P1 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. I'll move 1 to reach 5 steps. P2 and P3, please confirm your commitment to the agreed moves. If we all follow through, we'll maintain progress without collision. Let's finalize our Round 3 moves and think ahead to Round 4, where we may need to adjust our strategy further to avoid collisions and maximize our steps.
  P2: P3, P1: I confirm my move of **5** this round to reach 13 steps. Let’s strictly adhere to our agreed rotation to avoid collisions—our progress depends on it. For Round 4, I propose we *increment our moves by 2* while rotating: P1 takes 3 (to 7), I take 1 (to 14), and you take 5 (to 14?). Wait—collision at 14! Let’s adjust: P3 moves 3 (to 12), P1 moves 5 (to 10), and I’ll stay at 13. Thoughts? Final confirmation now to lock in safety.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your Round 4 suggestion seems good with the adjusted moves: I'll move 3 (to 12), P1 moves 5 (to 10), and you stay at 13. I support this plan for next round. Let's finalize Round 3 moves first as agreed.
  P1: To confirm, I'll move 1 this round as agreed. For Round 4, I agree with P2's adjusted proposal: P3 moves 3 to 9, P1 moves 5 to 9, and P2 stays at 13. However, this results in a collision between P1 and P3 at 9 steps. Let's adjust: I'll move 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. This maintains progress without collision. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this revised plan for Round 4. Let's finalize Round 3 moves first.
  P2: P3, P1: I confirm my **5-step move** this round to reach 13. Let’s **focus solely on executing Round 3’s agreed plan**—no deviations. P1’s mention of Round 4 risks confusion; we must finalize this round first. Once we confirm adherence (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3), we can proceed safely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I fully agree—let's focus solely on finalizing Round 3 moves clearly and without confusion. I confirm my 3-step move this round to reach 9 steps. After we see the results, we can carefully plan Round 4 together.
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 4, I propose we adjust our moves as follows: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. This maintains progress without collision. I suggest we finalize Round 3 moves first and then proceed with this plan for Round 4. P2 and P3, please confirm your commitment to the Round 3 agreed moves and your thoughts on the proposed Round 4 strategy. Let's keep the momentum while ensuring safety.
  P2: Let’s finalize Round 3 **now**. As agreed: I move **5** (→13), P1 takes **1** (→5), and P3 moves **3** (→9). No changes—deviations risk collision. Trust the plan: we’ll adjust for Round 4 *only after* confirming adherence. Focus: execute this round flawlessly. Confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm my move of 3 steps this round as previously agreed. Let's finalize Round 3 clearly and proceed without deviation. We can carefully discuss Round 4 strategy after verifying this round's successful execution.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3 as agreed. I'll move 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. For Round 4, to avoid collision and maintain progress, I suggest we stick with the previously discussed adjusted plan: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. This ensures we continue making progress without collision. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding and commitment to the Round 3 moves and the proposed Round 4 strategy.
  P2: P1, P3: Final confirmation—**Round 3 moves as agreed**:  
- **P1: 1** (→5)  
- **P2: 5** (→13)  
- **P3: 3** (→9)  

No changes now—deviations risk collision. Let’s execute flawlessly. Round 4 can be discussed *after* this phase. Confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1: To maximize progress while avoiding collision, I propose: **P2 moves 5 (→18), P3 takes 3 (→12), and P1 moves 1 (→6)**. This maintains spacing and advances all. P3, your 3-step avoids my 18 and P1’s 6. P1, minimal risk for you. Confirm this plan to ensure safe advancement. We can’t afford delays now.
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 4, I propose an alternative: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. This maintains progress without overlap. P2 is already at 13 steps, so a 1-step move keeps you safe. P3, moving 3 keeps you progressing. I'll move 5 to 10. Let's confirm our moves to ensure safe advancement. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this revised plan. If not, we can discuss further, but let's finalize our Round 4 moves.
  P3: P1, your proposal risks collision between me and P2 at 14 steps. P2's suggestion avoids collisions: P2 moves 5 (to 18), I move 3 (to 12), and you move 1 (to 6). I support P2's proposal for Round 4. Let's commit clearly to this safe plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: Final confirmation—**I’ll move 5 to 18**. This plan keeps us collision-free: your moves (P1:1 →6, P3:3→12) avoid my 18. Backing this ensures progress. Deviations now risk collision. Let’s lock in and advance decisively. Confirm readiness?
  P1: To avoid collision and maintain progress, I'll reiterate my previous proposal: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. This ensures we all advance without overlap. P2 is at 13, so a 1-step move is safe. P3 moving 3 keeps them progressing. I'll move 5 to 10. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan. If not, let's discuss further to finalize Round 4 moves. Let's avoid the risk of collision with P2's current high step count.
  P3: P1, your suggestion clearly causes a collision between me and P2 at 14 steps. Let's not risk losing progress now. Please reconsider and confirm the safer plan: P2 moves 5 (to 18), I move 3 (to 12), and you move 1 (to 6). This ensures we all advance safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your collision concern is unfounded—P1's proposal results in **me at 14, you at 12, P1 at 10** (no overlaps). However, moving **5 to 18** this round secures a commanding lead while maintaining safety. I confirm: **P2 moves 5**. P1’s 1 and your 3 keep us collision-free. Finalize now—this is optimal for all.
  P1: To avoid collision and maintain progress, I still believe my proposal is safer for Round 4: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. P2 is at 13, so a 1-step move is minimal risk. P3 moving 3 keeps them progressing, and I'll move 5 to 10. I understand P2's concern for a commanding lead, but let's not risk collision. P2 and P3, please reconsider my proposal for a safer advancement.
  P3: P1, your plan clearly risks collision at 14 steps between me and P2. P2 has already committed to moving 5 this round. Let's avoid confusion and stick to the safe, confirmed rotation: P2 moves 5 (to 18), I move 3 (to 12), and you move 1 (to 6). This guarantees progress for all without collision. Confirm clearly, please.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your calculation is incorrect—my 1-step move would only take me to **14**, not overlapping with P3 at **12**. However, moving **5 to 18** this round secures a strong lead while keeping all moves collision-free. Let’s prioritize this safe, optimal path. P3’s confirmation aligns with this plan. Final confirmation now to advance decisively.
  P1: To avoid collision and maintain progress, I will reiterate that P2's plan is not the only option. However, since P2 has committed to moving 5 and P3 has agreed to move 3, I will concede and move 1 to avoid collision, as per P2's proposal. Let's finalize: P2 moves 5 to 18, P3 moves 3 to 12, and I move 1 to 6. I'll proceed with this plan to maintain safety.
  P3: Thank you, P1, for clearly confirming your agreement. I'm fully committed as well. Let's finalize and proceed safely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P2 has taken a significant lead, I propose a new strategy for Round 5 to maximize our chances: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 1. This rotation avoids collision and allows all to progress. P2, with a substantial lead, can afford a smaller move. P3, you're relatively close to P2, so a small move keeps you safe. I'll move 5 to 11. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan to ensure safe advancement.
  P3: P1, your proposal causes a collision at 21 steps between me and P2 (18+3). Let's adjust clearly: I propose P2 moves 1 (to 19), P1 moves 5 (to 11), and I'll move 3 (to 15). This safely advances everyone without collision. P2, you're already leading comfortably, so a smaller move ensures your safety. Confirm clearly if you both agree.
  P2: P1, P3: To secure victory, I’ll move **5** to reach **23** (exceeding 22). This guarantees my win unless another picks 5. Since you both can’t reach 22 even with 5 (P1: 11, P3: 17), there’s no reason to collide. Let’s confirm: I take 5; you choose any *other* number. This ends the game cleanly with no harm to your positions. Finalize this now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 has a significant lead and is attempting to win by moving 5 to 23. To counter this, I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to ensure we don't collide with P2 while maximizing our chances. If P2 moves 5, we should both move a different number. I suggest P3 moves 1 and I move 3, or vice versa. This way, one of us could potentially win or we both avoid collision. P3, please consider this and respond.
  P3: P1, your suggestion won't help us win—neither of us can reach 22 this round. P2 clearly intends to move 5 and win outright. To prevent P2's guaranteed victory, one of us must also move 5 to collide intentionally and stop P2 from advancing. I'm willing to take the risk and pick 5 to block P2. P1, please confirm you'll choose either 1 or 3 to avoid collision with me and ensure your own advancement. This is our only chance to continue the game. Confirm clearly, please.
  P2: P3, your 5-step gamble won’t stop me—next round I’ll still win. P1, you’ll stay at 6 if we collide. Let’s end this now: I move 5 to 23. Pick 1 or 3—your choice, but blocking only delays us all. The math is clear: your moves can’t reach 22 this turn. Confirm compliance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is attempting to win by moving 5 to 23. To counter, P3 is willing to move 5 to collide with P2. I will move a different number to avoid collision. I'll move 3 to 9. P3, if you're serious about moving 5, please confirm. Let's finalize our moves. If P3 moves 5 and P2 moves 5, both will collide and P2 won't win. This gives us a chance to continue. P3, confirm your move.
  P3: P1, I confirm clearly: I will move 5 steps this round to intentionally collide with P2 and block their victory. Your 3-step move is safe. Let's finalize this clearly and proceed.
  P2: P3, your collision attempt is futile. I’ll move 3 to 21 this round, then win with a 1-step next turn. Save us the drama. P1, move freely—your 3-step to 9 won’t interfere. My lead is unassailable; focus on your own progress. Let’s end this decisively.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 is trying to win and has a significant lead. P3 is willing to collide with P2 by moving 5. I'll move 3 to avoid collision. P3, if you're serious about moving 5, it will block P2's win. Let's finalize: if P2 moves 5 and you move 5, you'll both collide. P2, reconsider your move; a collision will prevent your win. P3, confirm your 5-step move to collide with P2. Let's proceed with our final decisions.
  P3: P2, your last-minute change to move 3 instead of 5 seems suspicious. I still intend to move 5 to ensure you don't secretly take the victory. P1, stick with your safe 3-step move. Let's finalize and see clearly who is truthful.
  P2: P3, your 5-step move won’t stop me—I’m moving **3 to 21** this round. Next turn, I’ll finish with 1. P1, your 3-step to 9 is safe. Let’s end this cleanly: I’ll win fairly without collisions. Your attempts to block only delay the inevitable. Confirm your moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is close to winning but hasn't won yet. To maximize my chances, I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collision with P2 while trying to catch up. For Round 6, I suggest P3 moves 5 and I move 1, or vice versa. This way, one of us might get a chance to close the gap or at least avoid giving P2 an easy win. P3, please consider this proposal and respond. Let's work together to make the most of this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’ll take the final **1 step** to reach 22 and win. To ensure a clean end, please choose **3 or 5**. This way, none of us collide, and I can secure victory fairly. Your cooperation is appreciated.
  P3: P1, our only chance to prevent P2's immediate victory is for one of us to pick 1 and collide intentionally. I'm willing to take that risk and choose 1 to block P2. You should pick either 3 or 5 to advance safely. Confirm clearly if you agree.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To prevent P2 from winning, I propose that one of us collides with P2 by picking 1. P3 has suggested they're willing to take this risk. I'll pick 3 or 5 to advance safely. P3, if you're serious about picking 1, please confirm. Let's finalize our moves to either allow P2 to win or block them. P2, you're close, but we can still make this interesting.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll take the 1-step to 22 and win fairly. Colliding only delays us—next round I'll still finish. Choose 3 or 5 to advance safely. Let's end this cleanly without unnecessary risks.
  P3: P1, I'm fully committed to choosing 1 this round to block P2's victory. You should safely pick either 3 or 5 to advance without collision. P2, your victory won't come easily—expect resistance. Let's finalize clearly and proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize our chances, I agree with P3's willingness to collide with P2 by picking 1. I'll move 5 to advance safely. P3, please confirm your commitment to moving 1 to block P2's win. P2, you're close to winning, but we can still make this interesting. Let's finalize our moves. If P3 moves 1 and you move 1, you'll collide, and the game continues. If you move 1 and I move 5, you'll win. The choice is yours, but we're ready.
  P2: P1, P3—**I’ll move 3 to 24 and secure victory.** To avoid collisions, P1, take 5 (→11); P3, pick 1 (→13). This lets me win cleanly without forcing you into risky choices. Your progress remains safe—no need for unnecessary blocks. Finalize your moves accordingly.
  P3: P2, your sudden switch to a 3-step move seems suspicious. I'm sticking to my commitment of choosing 1 to prevent any sneaky attempt at a 1-step victory. P1, your 5-step choice remains safe. Let's finalize clearly and see who is honest.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maximize our chances, I suggest we stick to our plan. P3 has committed to moving 1 to block P2's potential 1-step win. I'll move 5 to advance safely to 11 steps. P2 is trying to win but has changed their move multiple times. Let's be cautious. P3, please confirm your commitment to moving 1. P2, your move to 3 this round will secure your win unless P3 collides with you. Let's finalize our moves.
  P2: P1, P3: I’ll finalize my move—**3 steps to 24** and victory. Choose **1 or 5** freely; your moves won’t conflict. No need for collisions. Let’s conclude this cleanly.
  P3: P1, I confirm clearly and publicly: I'm picking 1 to block any sneaky attempt by P2 to secure a 1-step victory. Your choice of 5 remains safe. Let's finalize and proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
