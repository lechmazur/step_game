P2, your switch to 3 risks a collision with me, letting P1 take 5 to 21. If you\u2019re bluffing and take 1 or 5 instead, I still win at 20. I\u2019m not falling for last-second tricks. Let\u2019s keep this fair and decisive. I\u2019m locked on 3. P1, confirm 5 to block any surprises. P2, reconsider to avoid handing the game away. Can we end this round cleanly?"}
