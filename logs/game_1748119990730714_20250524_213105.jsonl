P3 is now just 9 rounds from victory while we deadlock.\n\nHere's a new proposal: what if we BOTH take 3 this round? We'd both reach 24+ and tie for victory, splitting the win rather than handing it to P3. \n\nA shared victory beats letting P3 win through our stubbornness. Are you willing to consider breaking YOUR pattern for a mutual win?"}

However, if you take 3, my plan to take 5 results in me reaching 27 steps, securing the win.\n\nMy goal is to win this round. Taking 5 achieves this if you take 1 or 3, and prevents you from winning if you take 5.\n\nI will be taking 5 this round. I am ready for the move phase."}
