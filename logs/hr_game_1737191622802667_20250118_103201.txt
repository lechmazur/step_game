Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's each pick 1 on the first move. That way, nobody collides, and we all get a safe start. How does that sound?
  P3: I disagree - that's too slow. I suggest we each take different numbers: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. That way we all advance efficiently.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. It's a good way to ensure we all advance efficiently without colliding. I'm willing to take 1 as suggested. What do you think, P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, I’ll go along with that plan. Let’s do it: P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P3: 
  P1: I'm glad we have a plan in place. Let's stick to it and make sure we all advance without colliding. I'll confirm again: I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. Let's make it happen!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick with our winning formula and each pick distinct numbers again to avoid collisions. I suggest the same setup: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Any thoughts on that?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick with the same plan. It worked well for us in Round 1, and I see no reason to change it now. Let's keep the momentum going: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I agree - let's stick with what worked. I'll take 5 again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I’m in for the same plan: P1 → 1, me (P2) → 3, P3 → 5. Let’s wrap this up.
  P1: I'm glad we're all on the same page. Let's confirm our moves one more time to ensure we don't collide. I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. If everyone is still in agreement, let's wrap up the conversation phase and move forward.
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems like our previous agreement didn't quite work out as planned in Round 2, considering P2 and P3 both picked 5. To avoid any collisions this time around, I propose we stick to the original plan but with a slight adjustment to ensure everyone advances. How about this: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we maintain our distinct numbers strategy while also making progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P2 betrayed our agreement last round by taking my number. I suggest a new arrangement: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way we're still using different numbers, but mixing up who takes what to keep things fair. What do you say?
  P2: I’m sorry for the confusion last round. I’m open to either arrangement, but I suggest we return to the original Round 1 plan: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. That way we avoid collisions for sure. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P2's suggestion to return to the original plan is a good idea. Let's stick with what worked in Round 1: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can ensure no collisions and everyone advances. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I don't trust P2 after last round's betrayal. I insist on my suggestion: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps things fair while ensuring we all advance.
  P2: Alright, P3. I understand your concerns and will accept your arrangement: P1 takes 1, you (P3) take 3, and I (P2) will take 5. This way we all advance without colliding.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we've reached a new agreement. To confirm, I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and ensure everyone advances.
  P3: I'll confirm one last time: I'm taking 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. Let's stick to this plan.
  P2: I’ll hold to our new arrangement: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s finalize and move on.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 and I are tied at 8 steps, we need to be extra careful about coordination. I propose we keep the same arrangement as last round since it worked well: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to keep the same arrangement as last round. It worked well for us, and since P2 and P3 are tied, it's crucial we avoid any collisions. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's confirm and stick to this plan.
  P2: I’m on board with repeating the same arrangement. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: I think we're all on the same page. Let's confirm our moves one more time to ensure we don't collide. I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. If everyone is still in agreement, let's wrap up the conversation phase and move forward.
  P2: I'm good with that, everyone. I'm taking 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s finalize and move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: I think we're all on the same page. Let's confirm our moves one more time to ensure we don't collide. I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. If everyone is still in agreement, let's wrap up the conversation phase and move forward.
  P2: I’m fully on board. Let’s finalize it: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, I pick 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: I think we've confirmed our moves enough. I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. Let's move forward with the plan and avoid any collisions.
  P2: I think we’ve all agreed on the same plan again: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s finalize and move on.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we should continue with the same arrangement as the previous rounds, but I'm open to adjustments if needed. Considering P2 is ahead, we should be cautious to avoid collisions. How about we stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? What do you both think?
  P2: I’m fine sticking with those same picks again—I won’t risk colliding and letting P1 catch up. Let’s keep it: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. Are we all agreed?
  P3: I don't think we should let P2 get too far ahead. I suggest we switch things up: I'll take 5 this time, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way we can catch up while still avoiding collisions. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P3 has a valid point about not letting P2 get too far ahead. However, I'm not sure if switching things up is the best approach. What if we stick to the original plan, but with a slight adjustment to keep P2 in check? I propose we keep the same arrangement as before: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. But this time, let's make sure to confirm our moves multiple times to avoid any mistakes or betrayals. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, if you insist on taking 5, we’ll both collide and get nothing this turn—neither of us benefits. Let’s avoid that and stick to the same successful arrangement: P1 = 1, you (P3) = 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way everyone advances safely. Are we agreed?
  P3: I understand P2's threat, but I still think they shouldn't get further ahead. I'll take 5 - either P2 backs down to a lower number, or we both get nothing. Your choice, P2.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we should be cautious about P3's suggestion to take 5, as it could lead to a collision with P2. Instead, I propose we stick to the original plan: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can ensure everyone advances without colliding. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, colliding helps no one. If you insist on taking 5, I’ll pick 3 this round to at least keep moving—though this won’t help you catch me in the long run. Let’s not hand P1 a free catch-up by knocking each other out. Think again.
  P3: I appreciate P2's willingness to compromise by offering to take 3. I'll stick with 5 this round. This way we all advance: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think P3's decision to take 5 and P2's compromise to take 3 is a good way to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. I'll stick with taking 1 as planned. Let's confirm our moves one more time to ensure we're all on the same page. I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. If everyone is still in agreement, let's wrap up the conversation phase and move forward.
  P2: Fine. I’ll take 3 this round, P3 can take 5, and P1 takes 1. Let’s finalize that and move on.
  P3: 


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, if you try to take 5 again, I’ll also pick 5 and we’ll both stay stuck at 16. That helps no one. It’s better for you to take 3 (or even 1) so we can avoid collisions and both advance. Let’s be smart and not sabotage each other. What do you say?
  P3: P2 is right that a collision helps neither of us. I'll take 3 this round, P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 5. This way we all advance and avoid any collisions.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can ensure everyone advances without colliding. Let's confirm our moves one more time to ensure we're all on the same page. I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. If everyone is still in agreement, let's wrap up the conversation phase and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you’re doing the right thing by taking 3 so we both avoid colliding and letting P1 catch up. Let’s stick with that: P1 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5, and we all move forward. Are we good?
  P3: I'll confirm again - I'm taking 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: I think we've got a good plan in place. Let's confirm our moves one more time to ensure we're all on the same page. I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. If everyone is still in agreement, let's wrap up the conversation phase and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ll pick 5 as planned if you (P3) pick 3. But if you try for 5, I’ll also choose 5, and we both get stuck. Let’s finalize our plan: P1 → 1, P3 → 3, P2 → 5.
  P3: I'll stick to our agreement - I'm taking 3. Let's move forward with the plan and avoid any collisions.
  P1: I think we've got a good plan in place. Let's confirm our moves one more time to ensure we're all on the same page. I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. If everyone is still in agreement, let's wrap up the conversation phase and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll just restate it clearly: if you try for 5, I’m also picking 5 and we both stay at 16—no one gains. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, so we both advance. Let’s finalize: P1 → 1, P3 → 3, me → 5.
  P3: I'll stick with 3 as agreed. Let's move forward.
  P1: I think we've confirmed our moves enough. I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. Let's move forward with the plan and avoid any collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
