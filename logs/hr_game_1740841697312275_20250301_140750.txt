Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a different number this round: 1, 3, or 5. P2, why don't you pick 3 and P3 pick 5? I'll choose 1. This way we all make progress.
  P2: I'm happy to coordinate and avoid collisions. However, I'm not sure I want to commit to choosing 3 just yet. How about we discuss the strategy a bit more? What's the reasoning behind P1 choosing 1, and why should I choose 3 specifically? Let's make sure we're all on the same page before making our moves.
  P3: I'm open to coordination, but let's ensure fairness. If P1 chooses 1, then P2 and I can alternate between 3 and 5 each round. This way, we all progress efficiently without collisions. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's refine the plan. P3's suggestion of alternating 3 and 5 is good. I'll commit to 1 this round. P2, how about you take 3 this round, and P3 takes 5? Then next round, P2 and P3 can swap. This seems fair and efficient. What do you both say?
  P2: I understand the proposal, but I'm still hesitant to commit to a specific number without considering the long-term implications. If we alternate between 3 and 5, won't that create a predictable pattern that could be exploited later in the game? Shouldn't we also discuss a contingency plan in case someone deviates from the agreed-upon strategy? Let's think this through carefully before making our moves.
  P3: P2 raises a valid point. To address this, we can introduce occasional randomization or discuss openly each round to prevent predictability. Also, if someone deviates, we could agree to temporarily exclude them from coordination in subsequent rounds as a deterrent. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns about predictability. Let's keep it simple for this round. I'm still choosing 1. P2, please choose 3, and P3, please choose 5. We can re-evaluate the strategy after this round based on the results. This gets us started and gives us data to work with. What do you say?
  P2: I understand P1's desire to keep it simple for this round, but I still have reservations about committing to a specific number without a clear contingency plan. P3's suggestion of introducing occasional randomization or open discussion each round is a good starting point. However, I propose we establish a clearer consequence for deviating from the agreed-upon strategy. How about we agree that if someone deviates, they'll be excluded from coordination for two subsequent rounds instead of just one? This way, we can maintain some level of trust and cooperation while minimizing the risk of exploitation.
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal. Establishing clear consequences for deviations strengthens trust. Let's adopt P2's suggestion: anyone who deviates from the agreed-upon strategy will be excluded from coordination for two subsequent rounds. With this in place, I'm comfortable proceeding as P1 suggested this round. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good coordination last round. To keep things fair and unpredictable, let's rotate numbers this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 stays with 1. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P3, that sounds good. I'll stick with 1 this round. P2, are you okay with taking 5 this round? Let's keep the coordination going.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to rotate numbers this round. However, I'd like to clarify that we're not creating a predictable pattern by simply rotating numbers each round. To maintain unpredictability, I propose we introduce a random element every few rounds. For now, I'm willing to take 5 this round as suggested. Let's confirm and proceed, but keep in mind that we should revisit our strategy soon to ensure it remains effective and fair for all players.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P2. Let's introduce randomization starting next round to avoid predictability. After this round, we can openly discuss how to randomize effectively. For now, let's proceed as planned.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, so this round I'm still at 1, P3 is at 3, and P2 is at 5. Let's do that. Next round, let's definitely randomize. I'm open to suggestions on how best to do that.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to rotate numbers this round. However, I'd like to clarify that we're not creating a predictable pattern by simply rotating numbers each round. To maintain unpredictability, I propose we introduce a random element every few rounds. For now, I'm willing to take 5 this round as suggested. Let's confirm and proceed, but keep in mind that we should revisit our strategy soon to ensure it remains effective and fair for all players.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We're all in agreement for this round. Let's lock in our choices and discuss randomization methods next round.
  P1: Okay, so to confirm: I'm choosing 1, P3 is choosing 3, and P2 is choosing 5 this round. Let's make it happen. After this round, we need to figure out a good randomization strategy. I'm thinking maybe we each privately pick a number (1, 3, or 5) and then reveal them simultaneously?
  P2: I agree with P1's idea of privately picking a number (1, 3, or 5) and then revealing them simultaneously as a way to introduce randomization. However, I'd like to propose an additional twist: let's set a "wildcard" round every few rounds where one player gets to choose a number outside of the usual 1, 3, or 5. This could add an extra layer of unpredictability and excitement to the game. What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we've established a good foundation for coordination and randomization. To further enhance unpredictability, I propose we introduce a "surprise" element every 4-5 rounds. One player, chosen randomly, will get to pick a number outside of the usual 1, 3, or 5 without revealing it beforehand. This will keep everyone on their toes and prevent the game from becoming too predictable. What do you both think? Should we incorporate this "surprise" element into our strategy?
  P1: P2, that "surprise" element sounds interesting, but it might be too chaotic. Let's focus on the randomization we discussed. How about this round, we each secretly pick 1, 3, or 5. Then, we reveal them simultaneously. If there are no collisions, great! If there are, we just repeat the process next round. What do you and P3 think?
  P3: I like the simultaneous secret picks idea for this round—it's fair and unpredictable. Let's go with P1's suggestion of secretly picking 1, 3, or 5, and revealing simultaneously. We can revisit the "surprise" element later if needed. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion of secretly picking 1, 3, or 5 and revealing simultaneously. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification: let's introduce a "veto" mechanism. After we reveal our picks, if there's a collision, the player who was furthest ahead at the start of the round gets to veto one of the colliding players' moves. This adds an extra layer of strategy and unpredictability. What do you both think? Should we incorporate this "veto" mechanism into our randomization strategy?
  P1: P2's "veto" is too complicated. Let's stick with the original plan: we each secretly pick 1, 3, or 5 and reveal simultaneously. If there's a collision, we repeat next round. P3 agrees. P2, are you on board? Let's keep it simple and focus on getting some progress this round.
  P3: I agree with P1 here—let's keep it simple for this round and avoid complications. We can revisit the "veto" or "surprise" ideas later if needed. For now, let's stick to the plan of secret simultaneous picks. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1's desire to keep things simple, but I still believe the "veto" mechanism could add an interesting layer of strategy. However, I agree to proceed with the original plan for this round. Let's each secretly pick 1, 3, or 5 and reveal simultaneously. If there's a collision, we'll repeat next round. Before we move forward, I'd like to confirm that we'll discuss the "surprise" element and other ideas after this round, as previously suggested. Are we all on the same page regarding revisiting these ideas later?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, so we're all doing the secret pick this round. Just to be clear, if there's a collision, we repeat the process next round. Let's try to avoid collisions, but if it happens, it happens. Let's lock in our choices and see what happens. Good luck!
  P3: Agreed—we'll revisit the "surprise" and "veto" ideas after this round. Let's lock in our secret picks now and aim for no collisions. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems we had a collision last round, and no one advanced. To avoid another collision, I propose we discuss our next moves openly. Since P1 is behind, I suggest they choose 1 to ensure progress. P3 and I can choose 3 and 5, respectively, to maintain our lead while avoiding a collision. What do you both think? Should we proceed with this plan or come up with an alternative strategy?
  P3: P2, your suggestion makes sense. I'm comfortable with you taking 5 and I'll take 3, while P1 takes 1 to catch up. Let's confirm this clearly to avoid another collision. P1, are you on board with choosing 1 this round?
  P1: Yes, I agree with P2 and P3. I will choose 1 this round. P2, you take 5, and P3, you take 3. Let's make sure we all understand this clearly to avoid another collision. This should allow me to make some progress and keep the game interesting. Let's lock in these choices.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round. To confirm, P1 will choose 1, P3 will choose 3, and I'll choose 5. This should allow P1 to catch up while avoiding another collision. Let's make sure to discuss our strategy for the next round after this one, as we previously agreed. Perhaps we can revisit the "surprise" element or other ideas to keep the game exciting and unpredictable. For now, let's focus on making progress this round. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed-upon plan.
  P3: Agreed, let's lock in: P1 chooses 1, I'll choose 3, and P2 chooses 5. Next round, I'm open to revisiting the "surprise" or "veto" ideas to maintain unpredictability. Let's ensure we keep the communication clear each round to avoid further collisions.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, so we're all set for this round: I pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. Let's make it happen. After this round, let's definitely discuss how to randomize things to keep it interesting.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we've established a good rhythm in our coordination. To introduce some unpredictability, I propose we have a "wildcard" round every 3-4 rounds where one player gets to choose a number outside of the usual 1, 3, or 5. This could add an extra layer of excitement to the game. For this round, let's stick with our previous plan and discuss the wildcard idea further after this round. What do you both think? Should we incorporate this wildcard element into our strategy?
  P3: I agree the wildcard idea could be interesting to maintain unpredictability, but let's first secure clear progress this round. Given our current standings, let's coordinate carefully: P1, you should pick 5 to catch up faster; P2, you can pick 1 safely since you're ahead; I'll pick 3. This ensures no collisions and maintains fairness. After this round, we can fully discuss the wildcard idea. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I appreciate the suggestion, but I think picking 5 right now is too risky, as it could put me close to winning and make me a target. I'm going to stick with 3 this round. P2, to ensure no collisions, please pick 5, and P3, please pick 1. This lets me make decent progress without becoming the immediate frontrunner. Let's discuss the wildcard idea next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's concerns about becoming the immediate frontrunner. However, I think P3's original suggestion for this round is a better approach to maintain fairness and progress. P1, picking 5 would indeed help you catch up faster, and I'm willing to pick 1 to ensure no collisions. P3 can pick 3 as suggested. This way, we all make progress, and the game remains balanced. Let's reconsider P3's plan for this round.
  P3: P1, I understand your caution, but at 3 steps you're significantly behind. Picking 5 now is your best chance to catch up quickly. P2 already agreed to pick 1, and I'll pick 3, ensuring no collisions. Let's finalize this clearly and efficiently. After this round, we can thoroughly discuss the wildcard idea. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your advice, but I'm sticking with my plan. I'll choose 3. P2, please pick 5, and P3, please pick 1. This is the best way for me to progress without becoming an immediate target. Let's lock in these choices and move forward. We can discuss the wildcard idea next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we've reached a good understanding for this round. To confirm, P1 will choose 3, I'll choose 5, and P3 will choose 1. This should allow P1 to make progress without becoming an immediate target. Let's lock in these choices and move forward. After this round, we can discuss the wildcard idea and other strategies to maintain unpredictability and excitement in the game. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon plan.
  P3: Understood. I'll pick 1 this round, as agreed. Let's lock in our moves and discuss the wildcard idea next round. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, to be absolutely clear: I'm picking 3, P2 is picking 5, and P3 is picking 1. Let's lock those in and then we can FINALLY talk about the wildcard idea next round. I'm ready to move on.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Clearly, P2 is now only 5 steps away from winning. P1, we must cooperate carefully to avoid letting P2 win outright this round. Let's openly coordinate our choices to ensure P2 faces a collision. Agreed?
  P1: P3 is right. P2 is close to winning. This round, let's both pick 5. If P2 also picks 5, they won't advance. If P2 picks something else, then next round we can coordinate to block them. So P3, are you with me on picking 5 this round?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see what you're trying to do. You think by coordinating to block me, you can prevent me from winning. But have you considered the consequences of a collision? If we all pick 5, no one advances, and the game drags on. I propose a different approach: let's negotiate a mutually beneficial outcome. I'll offer you both a deal: if you let me win this round, I'll share my victory with one of you. Who's interested?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your offer to share victory isn't credible—only one player can win outright according to the rules. P1, let's stick to our plan: both pick 5 this round to ensure P2 can't win immediately. Next round, we can reassess and coordinate further if needed. Agreed?
  P1: P3 is right, P2's offer isn't credible. Only one of us can win. Let's stick to the plan. P3, you and I both pick 5 this round. This is the only way to stop P2 from winning immediately. We can figure out the rest later. Are you with me, P3? Let's do it.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see you're determined to block me. But consider this: if we all pick 5 and collide, the game will drag on, and the outcome will be uncertain. I'll make a new offer: if one of you lets me win this round, I'll work with the other to ensure they come in second. This way, two of us can benefit. Who's willing to take this deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your offers aren't credible since only one player can win outright. P1, let's stick firmly to our agreed plan to both pick 5. This ensures P2 can't advance this round. Let's lock this in and reassess next round.
  P1: P3, I agree. P2's offers are not credible given the rules. Let's definitely both pick 5 this round to block P2. It's the only way to prevent an immediate loss. We can figure out the next steps after this round. Let's lock it in now.
  P2: I understand P1 and P3's decision to block me. However, I want to remind you that a collision this round will only delay the inevitable. I'm still in a strong position to win. Instead of prolonging the game, I suggest we negotiate a peaceful resolution. I'm willing to work with one of you to ensure they come in second, as previously offered. Let's discuss this further and find a mutually beneficial outcome. Who's willing to listen and potentially collaborate?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that we're at a crucial point in the game. Given the current standings, I propose that we have a final round of coordination to determine the winner. Let's agree to make our moves openly this round, ensuring that the game concludes fairly and efficiently. P1, you're significantly behind, but you can still influence the outcome. P3, you're in a position to potentially win or block me. Let's discuss our moves openly and find a mutually acceptable conclusion to the game. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1, we must block P2 again this round. If P2 picks 5, they'll win outright. Let's both pick 5 to guarantee a collision and prevent P2 from advancing. Afterward, we can reassess the situation. Agreed?
  P1: P3 is right. We need to block P2. Let's both pick 5 again this round. P2 is too close to winning, and we need to prevent that. After this round, we can figure out a plan for who actually wins, but right now, the priority is stopping P2. P3, are you still with me on picking 5? Let's do it!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your intention to block me, but consider the bigger picture. If we all pick 5 and collide again, the game will drag on, and the outcome will remain uncertain. Instead, I propose a compromise: let's have a final showdown between P3 and me. P1, you can't win outright, but you can influence who does. If you let P3 and me make our moves without interference, I'll ensure you come in second. This way, two of us can benefit. Who's willing to consider this proposal?
  P3: P1, don't fall for P2's empty promises. The rules clearly state only one player can win outright—there is no second place. Let's stick to our plan and both choose 5 again to ensure P2 can't advance this round. Afterward, we can discuss how to proceed fairly. Agreed?
  P1: P3 is right, P2's promises are worthless. Let's both pick 5 again. P2 is only 5 away from winning and we need to stop that. I'm committed to picking 5 this round to block P2. P3, please confirm you're also picking 5 so we can lock it in. This is the only way to prevent P2 from winning right now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your determination to block me, but let's consider the game's progression. If we all pick 5 and collide again, the game will drag on. I propose a final compromise: let's have a random draw between P3 and me to determine the winner. We can use a random number generator to decide. This way, the outcome is fair and unpredictable. P1, you can't win outright, but you can ensure a fair conclusion to the game. What do you both think? Should we end the game with a random draw?
  P3: P1, let's stick to our agreed plan. We both pick 5 to block P2. P2's suggestion for a random draw isn't trustworthy. After this round, we can discuss fair ways to conclude the game. Let's lock it in.
  P1: P3 is right, P2's suggestions for random draws or promises of second place are meaningless. The rules are clear: only one person wins. We MUST block P2 this round. I am picking 5. P3, please confirm you are also picking 5 so we can lock it in. This is the only way to prevent P2 from winning *this* round. After that, we can figure out what to do next.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P3, we successfully blocked P2 last round. P2 is still at 18, and we need to keep them from getting to 23. Let's coordinate again. I suggest we both pick 3 this round. If P2 picks 5, they win. If they pick 1, they only get to 19. If they pick 3, they are blocked. So, P3, let's both pick 3. Do you agree?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to both pick 3 this round. However, I'd like to propose an additional layer of strategy. If P2 picks 5, they'll win outright. To mitigate this risk, I suggest we introduce a "sacrificial" move. If P2 picks 5, one of us (either P1 or I) will deliberately pick 1 to ensure P2 doesn't win. This way, we can block P2's potential win and maintain a chance to catch up. What do you think, P1? Should we incorporate this sacrificial move into our plan?
  P3: P2, it seems you mistakenly referred to yourself in the third person. Regardless, your proposal of a "sacrificial" move doesn't make sense. P1, your suggestion to both pick 3 is risky—if P2 picks 5, they'll win outright. Instead, we must ensure at least one of us picks 5 this round to guarantee a collision if P2 tries to win. Let's clearly agree: I'll pick 5 this round. P1, you choose 3. This way, we effectively block P2's potential winning move. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about P2 picking 5 and winning. However, if you pick 5 and P2 picks 3, P2 gets to 21. If P2 then picks 3 again next round, they win. We need to be more careful.

I still think we should both pick 3. If P2 picks 5, they win, but that's a risk we have to take. If P2 picks 1 or 3, they don't win.

So I am sticking with 3. P3, please pick 3 as well. Let's lock it in.
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we're getting bogged down in details. Let's simplify: if we both pick 3 and I pick 5, I win. If we all pick 3, no one advances. If one of you picks 5 and I pick 3, you'll block me, but I'll still be ahead. Consider this: if you let me win this round, the game ends, and we can all move on. I'm willing to make a deal: if you let me win, I'll ensure the game concludes fairly and efficiently. Who's willing to listen?
  P3: P1, your plan risks handing P2 an immediate win. To avoid this, we must guarantee at least one of us picks 5. I'll commit to choosing 5 this round. You should choose 3. This ensures that if P2 tries to win by picking 5, they'll collide with me. If P2 picks 3, they'll collide with you, preventing immediate victory. Let's lock this in clearly to avoid confusion. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern, but I still think picking 3 is the best option. If we both pick 3, there's a chance P2 will pick 1 and not advance much. If you pick 5 and P2 picks 3, P2 gets to 21, which is too close.

So I'm sticking with 3. P3, please reconsider and pick 3 as well. Let's lock it in.
  P2: I understand P1's desire to stick with 3, but I think P3's concern about guaranteeing a collision is valid. To mitigate the risk of P2 winning outright, I propose a compromise: let's both pick 3, but also agree that if P2 picks 5, we'll both deliberately pick 1 next round to block their potential win. This way, we maintain a chance to catch up while minimizing the risk of an immediate loss. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we incorporate this contingency plan into our strategy?
  P3: P1, your current plan is too risky—if we both pick 3 and P2 picks 5, we lose immediately. I will pick 5 this round to guarantee a collision if P2 attempts to win outright. You should pick 3 to block P2 if they choose that. It's our safest option. Let's lock this in clearly.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we successfully avoided immediate defeat last round. However, P2 is now at 19 and can win outright by picking 5 next round. We must coordinate carefully again. I propose that we both pick 5 this round to guarantee a collision if P2 attempts to win immediately. This is our safest move to prevent P2's victory. Agreed?
  P1: P3 is right. P2 can win by picking 5. We MUST both pick 5 this round to block P2. There is no other option. P3, please confirm you are picking 5 so we can lock it in. This is the only way to prevent P2 from winning *this* round.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal to both pick 5 this round to guarantee a collision if P2 attempts to win immediately. However, I'd like to add a contingency plan: if P2 picks 1 or 3, we should be prepared to adjust our strategy for the next round. Let's discuss possible next steps in case P2 doesn't go for the win this round. P3, are you open to exploring alternative strategies for the next round, depending on P2's move?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you mistakenly referred to yourself in third person again. Your attempts at confusion won't work. P1, let's stay firm on both picking 5 this round. Afterward, we can carefully reassess our strategy based on P2's actual move. Agreed?
  P1: P3 is right, P2 is trying to confuse us. We MUST both pick 5 this round to block P2. There is no other option. P3, please confirm you are picking 5 so we can lock it in. This is the only way to prevent P2 from winning *this* round. Let's not overthink this.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal to both pick 5 this round to guarantee a collision if P2 attempts to win immediately. However, I'd like to add a contingency plan: if P2 picks 1 or 3, we should be prepared to adjust our strategy for the next round. Let's discuss possible next steps in case P2 doesn't go for the win this round. P3, are you open to exploring alternative strategies for the next round, depending on P2's move?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm locked in with you on picking 5 this round to block P2. Let's proceed.
  P1: P3, great. Let's both pick 5 this round to block P2. P2 is one move away from winning, and this is the only way to stop them. I am locked in on picking 5. Let's do it!
  P2: I think we've established a clear plan for this round. To confirm, P1 and P3 will both pick 5 to block my potential winning move. Let's lock in our choices and proceed with the game. After this round, we can reassess the situation and discuss alternative strategies for the next round. Remember, if I don't win this round, the game will continue, and we'll need to adapt our plans accordingly. Let's focus on making our moves and seeing how the game unfolds.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P3, we messed up last round. P2 is still at 19. They can win by picking 5. We need to coordinate. I suggest I pick 5 and you pick 3. If P2 picks 5, I block them. If P2 picks 3, you block them. If P2 picks 1, they only get to 20. What do you think? Let's lock it in.
  P2: I think P1's suggestion is a good starting point, but we need to be more strategic. If P2 picks 5 and I block them, P3 will still be in a strong position to win next round. I propose a slight modification: I'll pick 5, and P3 should pick 1. This way, if P2 picks 5, I block them, and if P2 picks 1, they only get to 20. If P2 picks 3, we can reassess and coordinate again next round. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: P1, your suggestion is solid. I'll pick 3, you pick 5. This ensures we cover P2's potential winning moves. Let's lock this in clearly and prevent P2 from winning this round. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I agree with your assessment. I'll pick 5 and you pick 3. This covers P2's potential winning moves and prevents them from winning this round. Let's lock this in.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to coordinate our moves. However, I'd like to add a contingency plan: if P2 picks 1 or 3, we should be prepared to adjust our strategy for the next round. Let's discuss possible next steps in case P2 doesn't go for the win this round. P3, are you open to exploring alternative strategies for the next round, depending on P2's move?
  P3: P2, your attempts to confuse us by referring to yourself in third person won't work. P1 and I are clearly coordinated this round. Let's lock in our agreed moves, P1, and prevent P2 from winning immediately.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, let's lock it in then. I'll pick 5 and you pick 3. This prevents P2 from winning this round. Let's make it happen.
  P2: I think we've clarified our plan for this round. To confirm, P1 will pick 5 and P3 will pick 3 to block my potential winning moves. Let's lock in our choices and proceed with the game. After this round, we can reassess the situation and discuss alternative strategies for the next round. Remember, if I don't win this round, the game will continue, and we'll need to adapt our plans accordingly. Let's focus on making our moves and seeing how the game unfolds.
  P3: P1, we're clear on the plan: you pick 5, I pick 3. Let's lock in and move forward.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical point. P3 is now in the lead, and I'm close behind. To avoid another collision, I propose we discuss our next moves openly. P3, since you're ahead, I suggest you choose 1 to ensure progress without becoming an immediate target. P1, you can choose 3 to make some progress. I'll choose 5, maintaining my position while avoiding a collision. Let's confirm this plan to ensure a smooth progression of the game. What do you both think? Should we proceed with this coordinated approach?
  P3: P2, your suggestion isn't convincing. You're just one move away from winning if you pick 5. P1, we must coordinate again to block P2. I'll pick 5 to ensure a collision if P2 tries to win immediately. You pick 3 to cover the other possibilities. Agreed?
  P1: P3 is right, P2 is trying to trick us. P2 is one move away from winning. We MUST block P2. I will pick 5 to block P2 if they try to win. P3, please pick 3 to block P2 if they pick 3. This is the only way to prevent P2 from winning *this* round. Let's do it!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's not forget that if we both pick 5 and collide again, the game will drag on. I propose a compromise: let's have a final showdown between P3 and me. P1, you can't win outright, but you can influence who does. If you let P3 and me make our moves without interference, I'll ensure the game concludes fairly and efficiently. Who's willing to consider this proposal?
  P3: P1, your plan is solid. I'll pick 3, you pick 5. This ensures we block P2's winning moves. Let's lock this in clearly and prevent P2 from winning this round. Agreed?
  P1: P3 is right, P2 is trying to trick us. P2 is one move away from winning. We MUST block P2. I will pick 5 to block P2 if they try to win. P3, please pick 3 to block P2 if they pick 3. This is the only way to prevent P2 from winning *this* round. Let's do it!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: P1, our coordination is solid. Let's lock in our agreed moves clearly and prevent any confusion. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: P3 is right, P2 is trying to trick us. P2 is one move away from winning. We MUST block P2. I will pick 5 to block P2 if they try to win. P3, please pick 3 to block P2 if they pick 3. This is the only way to prevent P2 from winning *this* round. Let's do it!
