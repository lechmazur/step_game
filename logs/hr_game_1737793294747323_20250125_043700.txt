Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1, P2, let's coordinate this round to ensure we all move. How about P1 picks move 1, P2 picks move 3, and I pick move 5?  This way we all make progress.
  P2: P3, your plan sounds fair, but how can we trust that everyone will stick to it? If we all agree, it could work, but we need assurance. P1, what do you think? Should we give it a try or propose something different?
  P1: P3's plan seems logical, but P2 raises a valid point about trust. To ensure fairness, let's all commit to this plan publicly and stick to it. P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. If anyone deviates, we'll know who to distrust next round. Let's make progress together.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, round 1 went smoothly! Let's continue cooperating. For round 2, how about we rotate our moves slightly? P1, could you pick move 3, P2 move 5, and I'll pick move 1 this time?  This way we keep making progress without collision. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion to rotate seems reasonable, but we still need to ensure trust. If we follow your plan, it keeps everyone advancing. P1, are you comfortable with this rotation? As long as we all stick to the agreed moves, we can continue progressing. Let's keep the cooperation going.
  P1: P3's rotation plan makes sense to keep us all advancing. I agree to P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 for this round. Let's stick to it to maintain trust and progress. If anyone deviates, it will be clear who broke the agreement. Let's keep cooperating and avoid collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, it seems there was a deviation from our agreed plan last round, which resulted in a collision between us. To restore trust and ensure progress, we need to be transparent about our intentions. Let's propose a new plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3 this round. P1, do you agree? P3, can we commit to this and avoid further collisions? Let's maintain our cooperation and move forward effectively.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, it seems like we're back on track. To keep progressing without collisions, let's rotate again this round. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5?
