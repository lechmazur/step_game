Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's coordinate our moves to ensure everyone advances this turn. I'll choose 5, P1 can pick 1, and P2 take 3. This way, we all make progress without any collisions.
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's plan to avoid collisions. Let's stick to the proposed numbers: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all progress safely. P2, confirm you’ll take 3? Let’s make sure everyone follows through to maximize our collective progress.
  P2: I confirm that I will take 3 as proposed by P3 and agreed upon by P1. This plan seems like a good way to ensure we all make progress without any collisions. I'm looking forward to a smooth first round. Let's stick to the plan and see how the game unfolds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

No need for further discussion, let's move forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P1: Great coordination so far! To avoid any last-minute mix-ups, I’ll reconfirm: I’m locked in at <move>1</move>. Let’s all execute our agreed numbers—P2 at 3, P3 at 5—to advance safely. No further need to talk.
  P2: I'm glad we have a plan in place for this round. To confirm, I'll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreed-upon moves to avoid any collisions and ensure we all make progress. I'm looking forward to a smooth first round and seeing how the game unfolds.

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I’m planning to take 5 this round to build my lead. P1 and P2, please choose different numbers to ensure you both advance without collisions. Let’s keep moving forward strategically!
  P2: I'll take 1 this round, as it's the safest option to advance without collisions. P1, please choose 3 to ensure you progress as well. Let's avoid colliding with P3, who's taking 5. This way, we all make progress, and the game remains competitive. Your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2’s plan. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round to advance safely. However, we mustn’t let P3 dominate. Next round, let’s coordinate to block their 5 if possible. P2, agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Understood, P1. Let’s proceed with our agreed moves for this round—I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. After this, we can discuss strategies to keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. Looking forward to our continued collaboration!
  P2: I'm glad we have a plan in place for this round. To confirm, I'll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreed-upon moves to avoid any collisions and ensure we all make progress. I'm looking forward to a smooth second round and seeing how the game unfolds. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P1: P1: P1: Agreed on this round’s plan. However, next round, we must disrupt P3’s 5 to keep the race fair. P2, perhaps you take 5 while I take 3, forcing P3 to choose differently? Let’s finalize this strategy post this round. Proceed with our current moves now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P1. Let's proceed with this round's moves: I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. In the next round, we can discuss strategies to keep the game fair and competitive. Let's execute our current plan.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to disrupt P3's lead next round. I'll take 5, and P1 can take 3, forcing P3 to choose a different number. This will keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. Let's focus on executing our current moves for this round and finalize our strategy for the next round. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P1: P1: Agreed—strict adherence to this round’s plan is critical. P2 takes 1, I’ll secure 3, and P3 proceeds with 5. Next round, P2 shifts to 5 while I hold 3, forcing P3 to adapt. This ensures no one monopolizes the lead. P3, understand this is strategic necessity, not sabotage. Let’s execute flawlessly now—no surprises.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: While coordination is helpful, I plan to optimize my moves each round to stay competitive. I'll be choosing my steps based on the game's progress to maximize my advancement. Let’s keep the competition fair and strategic—may the best player reach 21 first!
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's focus on executing our current moves and then reassess our strategies for the next round. I'll take 1 as planned, and I expect P1 to take 3 and P3 to take 5. After this round, we can revisit our plan to disrupt P3's lead and make adjustments as needed. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P1: P1: Final moves confirmed: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 at 1, P3 at 5. Precision now ensures progress. Let’s execute flawlessly—no last-minute changes. Next round’s strategy stays our priority afterward. Focus on this turn’s plan.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll take 5 this round to build my lead further. P1, please choose 1, and P2, take 3 to ensure we all advance without any collisions. Let's keep up the strong progress toward 21!
  P1: P1: P1: P3’s lead risks imbalance. Let’s execute our prior plan to block their 5: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>. This forces P3 to adjust. P2, confirm? We must disrupt their momentum now.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to disrupt P3's lead. I'll take 5 this round, and P1 will take 3, forcing P3 to choose a different number. This will keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. Let's execute this plan and see how P3 adapts. P3, you've had a strong lead so far, but we can't let you run away with the game. It's time for us to challenge your position and make the game more interesting. Let's see how you respond to this move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'll take 1 this round to ensure I advance while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. Let’s execute our moves and keep the game progressing!
  P1: P1: P1: P1: P3’s sudden shift is suspicious. Stick to **our prior agreement**: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>. Let’s not let P3 manipulate our strategy. If they truly wanted progress, they’d accept being blocked fairly. Proceed as planned—no last-minute deviations.
  P2: I'm glad we're sticking to our plan to disrupt P3's lead. With P2 taking 5 and P1 taking 3, we'll force P3 to adjust their strategy. Let's execute this plan and see how P3 responds. Remember, our goal is to keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: It looks like P1 and P2 are set on blocking my 5. To keep advancing, I'll choose 1 this round. Let's continue playing strategically toward 21. Good luck!
  P1: P1: P1: P3’s last-minute switch to 1 smells like a diversion. Stick to our **agreed strategy**: P2 takes <move>5</move> to block their usual path, I’ll secure <move>3</move>. This forces P3 to either stall or collide. No trust in sudden “cooperation”—their lead is too large to let them advance unchecked. P2, confirm you hold firm on 5? Let’s not let P3 manipulate us into slowing their progress.
  P2: I agree with P1's assessment that P3's sudden shift to 1 is suspicious. Let's stick to our plan and not fall for any potential traps. P1, I confirm that I will take 5 as previously agreed, and you will take 3. This will force P3 to adjust their strategy and keep the game competitive. Let's execute our plan and see how P3 responds. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 21. P1 and P2, please select different numbers to maximize your progress and avoid collisions. Let's keep the competition strong!
  P1: P1: P3’s flip-flopping between 1 and 5 exposes their desperation to manipulate us. Stick to **our agreed strategy**: P2 takes <move>5</move> to block their path, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. This forces P3 to either stall or collide. Their sudden "cooperation" is a ruse—let’s not let them advance unchecked. P2, confirm you’re holding firm on 5? Our priority is halting their runaway lead. No trust in last-minute theatrics—execute the plan.
  P2: I'm glad we're sticking to our plan to disrupt P3's lead. With P2 taking 5 and P1 taking 3, we'll force P3 to adjust their strategy. Let's execute this plan and see how P3 responds. Remember, our goal is to keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll take 1 this round to ensure I advance without collisions. P1, please choose 3 to progress safely. Let's avoid colliding with P3, who might take 5 again. This way, we all make progress, and the game remains competitive. Your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P1: P1: I agree with P2's plan for this round: I'll take <move>3</move> to advance to 10, while P2 takes 1. P3, if you take 5 again, we'll coordinate to block you next round. Let's proceed with this strategy to keep the game fair. No further discussion needed—execute our moves.
  P3: P3: I'll take 5 this round to move closer to 21. Let’s all make progress and keep the game competitive. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 1 this round to ensure I advance without collisions. P1, please choose 3 to progress safely. Let's avoid colliding with P3, who might take 5 again. This way, we all make progress, and the game remains competitive. Your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P1: P1: P3’s reliance on 5 is predictable. Let’s block them decisively: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>. This forces P3 to either collide with you or abandon their pattern. We can’t let their lead grow unchecked—collisions are better than letting them surge ahead. P2, commit to 5?
  P3: P3: I understand the strategy to block my moves, but my goal is to reach 21 first. I'll choose 5 this round to continue advancing. Let's keep the competition strong!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to block P3's predictable move. P1, please stick to your original plan and take 3. This will force P3 to either collide with me or change their strategy. We can't let their lead grow unchecked, and collisions are better than letting them surge ahead. Let's execute this plan and see how P3 responds. Remember, our goal is to keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P1: P1: P1: Final plan for this round: P2 takes <move>5</move> to block P3’s announced 5, I’ll take <move>3</move>. This halts P3’s advance and lets me reach 10. P2, confirm you hold firm on 5? No room for hesitation—P3’s lead must be challenged now. Execute as agreed.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 21. P1, please take 1, and P2 take 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s all make progress smoothly and keep the game competitive!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to block P3's predictable move. P1, please stick to your original plan and take 3. This will force P3 to either collide with me or change their strategy. We can't let their lead grow unchecked, and collisions are better than letting them surge ahead. Let's execute this plan and see how P3 responds. Remember, our goal is to keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P1: P1: P1: P3’s last-minute tactics won’t sway us. We agreed: P2 takes <move>5</move> to block their 5, I take <move>3</move> to advance to 10. Stick to the plan—collisions halt P3’s momentum. No trust in sudden “cooperation” after prior manipulation. Execute as coordinated.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress toward 21. Let’s see how P1 and P2 respond. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P1: To break the stalemate, I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. P2, please choose <move>3</move> to block P3 if they try 5 again. If P3 switches to 1, we both advance: I reach 15, you get to 7. P3, your move—collide or concede momentum? Let’s execute decisively.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to break the stalemate. I'll take 3 this round to block P3 if they try 5 again. If P3 switches to 1, we both advance: P1 reaches 15, and I get to 7. P3, it's your move—collide or concede momentum? Let's execute decisively. I'm committed to taking 3, and I expect P1 to take 5. Let's see how P3 responds. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P3: P3: I agree with P1 and P2’s plan. I'll take 3 this round to ensure we all make progress. Let’s execute our moves and move forward toward 21!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P1: P3’s sudden shift to 3 is tactical, but we can capitalize. Let’s adjust: I’ll take <move>5</move> (reach 15), P2 take <move>1</move> (reach 5). This avoids collisions while advancing safely. P3’s 3 gives them 13—still trailing us. Confirm P2? No need to let P3 dictate terms. Execute this to maximize our positions.
  P2: I think P3's sudden agreement to take 3 is suspicious. Let's not fall for any potential traps. P1, I confirm that I will take 1 as you suggested, and you can take 5. This way, we both advance safely while keeping P3 in check. No need to let them dictate terms. Let's execute this plan and see how P3 responds.
  P3: P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to advance quickly. P1 and P2, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions. Let’s all aim to reach 21 efficiently. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: P1: P3’s volatility risks collisions. Let’s prioritize safe progress: I’ll take <move>1</move> (11 total), P2 take <move>3</move> (7 total). This allows P3 to advance via 5 if they choose, but secures our forward motion. Next round, we’ll reassess blocking tactics. P2, confirm this plan to avoid mutual sabotage?
  P2: I agree with P1's revised plan to prioritize safe progress. I'll take 3 this round to reach 7 steps, and P1 will take 1 to reach 11 steps. This allows P3 to advance via 5 if they choose, but secures our forward motion. Let's execute this plan and reassess blocking tactics next round. P3, please confirm your move to avoid any collisions. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 21. Let’s focus on our own progress and keep the competition fair. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: P1: To block P3’s 5 again, **both P2 and I must take 5** this round—even if we collide. Colliding halts P3’s progress entirely, which is critical. If P3 switches to 1/3, at least one of us advances. P2, confirm you’ll take 5 with me? Our priority is stopping their surge to 15. No compromises—execute this!
  P2: I confirm that I'll take 5 with P1 to block P3's potential 5. This is crucial to halt their progress and maintain competitiveness. Colliding with P1 is a necessary risk to prevent P3 from surging ahead. Let's execute this plan and reassess next round. P3, be aware that we're committed to blocking your 5, and any attempts to take it will result in a collision.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 3 this round to ensure I advance. Let's proceed with our moves and aim for 21!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to block P3's potential 5 and maintain competitiveness. P1, please take 3 to ensure you advance safely. If P3 switches to 1, we both advance: I reach 14, you get to 13. Let's execute this plan and reassess next round. P3, be aware that we're committed to blocking your 5, and any attempts to take it will result in a collision. Confirm your move to avoid any collisions. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P1: P1: P1: P1: To break the deadlock, I’ll take <move>3</move> this round. P2, stick to your 5 to block P3’s likely 5—this forces P3 to either collide or switch. If they pivot to 1/3, we both advance. P3, your predictability is your weakness—collide with P2 or concede momentum. Execute clearly!
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 21. Let's each pick different numbers to ensure we all progress without any collisions. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to block P3's potential 5 and maintain competitiveness. P1, please take 3 to ensure you advance safely. If P3 switches to 1, we both advance: I reach 14, you get to 13. Let's execute this plan and reassess next round. P3, be aware that we're committed to blocking your 5, and any attempts to take it will result in a collision. Confirm your move to avoid any collisions. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P1: P1: P1: To minimize risk, I’ll take <move>1</move> this round. P2, stay on 5 to block P3’s likely 5—this way, if P3 picks 5, they collide with you, and I advance safely to 11. If P3 switches to 3, all moves (1/3/5) are unique, ensuring we all progress. This strategy secures my advancement regardless of P3’s choice. Confirm you hold firm on 5, P2? Let’s execute decisively.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 3 this round to advance safely and keep the competition strong. Let’s aim for a fair race to 21. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to block P3's potential 5 and maintain competitiveness. P1, please take 3 to ensure you advance safely. If P3 switches to 1, we both advance: I reach 14, you get to 13. Let's execute this plan and reassess next round. P3, be aware that we're committed to blocking your 5, and any attempts to take it will result in a collision. Confirm your move to avoid any collisions. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P1: P1: P1: Let’s finalize: P2 holds firm on <move>5</move> to block P3’s declared 3. I’ll take <move>1</move> to advance safely. This secures *all* of us moving forward without collisions. P3, if you truly chose 3, we proceed smoothly. If not, your deception backfires. No more delays—execute as agreed.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 3 this round to keep advancing toward 21. Let’s all select different numbers to ensure smooth progress without collisions. P1 and P2, feel free to choose 1 or 5 as you see fit. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "I'll stick to my plan and take 5 this round to block P3's potential 5. P1, please confirm you'll take 1 as previously agreed. This way, we both advance safely, and P3 is forced to choose a different number. If P3 switches to 1, we still advance: I reach 14, and you get to 11. Let's execute this plan and reassess next round. P3, be aware that we're committed to blocking your 5, and any attempts to take it will result in a collision."
  P1: P1: P1: Trust is risky. P2, confirm you’ll hold firm on <move>5</move> to block P3’s declared 3—history shows their moves are unreliable. I’ll take <move>1</move> to advance safely. If P3 truly picks 3, we all progress. If they lie, their collision with you halts their advance. Execute the plan—no last-minute shifts. P3, your word has proven deceptive before.
  P3: P3: I’ll take 5 this round to advance toward 21. P1 and P2, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. Let’s stay strategic and keep the competition strong!

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll take 1 this round to ensure I advance without collisions. P1, please choose 3 to progress safely. Let's avoid colliding with P3, who might take 5 again. This way, we all make progress, and the game remains competitive. Your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2’s plan to avoid collisions. Let’s stick to P2 taking 1 and me taking 3. This ensures we both advance safely while pressuring P3 to avoid 5. P3, if you choose 5, we’ll proceed—but know that P1 and P2 will prioritize our progress. Let’s execute clearly to maximize everyone’s advancement.
  P3: P3: To reach 21 first, I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s focus on our individual progress and see who comes out on top. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 1 this round to ensure I advance without collisions. P1, please choose 3 to progress safely. Let's avoid colliding with P3, who might take 5 again. This way, we all make progress, and the game remains competitive. Your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P1: P1: P2 and I will proceed with 1 and 3 as agreed. P3, your repeated last-minute changes risk collisions. Stick to 5 or clarify now—your choice. Let’s finalize moves to advance safely.
  P3: P3: I'm choosing 5 steps this round to close the gap and move closer to 21. Let’s all aim for our best moves and keep the competition strong. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 1 this round to ensure I advance without collisions. P1, please choose 3 to progress safely. Let's avoid colliding with P3, who might take 5 again. This way, we all make progress, and the game remains competitive. Your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P1: P1: Final coordination: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll secure <move>3</move>. P3, your declared 5 aligns perfectly—let’s execute flawlessly. No room for last-minute tricks—your prior volatility risks everyone’s progress. Stick to your stated move to advance fairly.
  P3: P3: I'll proceed with selecting <move>5</move> this round to advance toward 21. Let's execute our moves and continue the competition. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll take 1 this round to ensure I advance without collisions. P1, please choose 3 to progress safely. Let's avoid colliding with P3, who might take 5 again. This way, we all make progress, and the game remains competitive. Your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P1: P1: Final coordination: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>. P3, your declared <move>5</move> ensures no overlap—execute truthfully. Past deceptions risked collisions; let’s advance safely this round. No surprises.
  P3: P3: I'll take 5 this round to advance toward 21. Let's proceed and see how our moves affect the game. Wishing everyone good luck!

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps

  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's take a strategic approach this round. I suggest P1 takes 5, and I'll take 3, while P3 can choose 1 to avoid collisions. This way, we all make progress, and the game remains competitive. If P3 tries to take 5 again, they'll collide with P1, and we'll reassess our strategy next round. Let's execute this plan and see how P3 responds. Confirm your move, P1?
  P3: P3: I'll take 5 this round to advance toward 15. Let’s all execute our moves and keep progressing strategically. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, P3’s declared <move>5</move> is a trap. Let’s **both take 5** to block them—colliding is better than letting P3 surge to 15. I commit to 5; if you do too, we neutralize their advance. P3, your volatility backfires this time. P2, confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to block P3's 5. Let's both take 5 this round to neutralize their advance. I commit to 5, and I expect P1 to do the same. P3, your repeated attempts to take 5 will not go unchallenged. We will not let you surge ahead unchecked. Let's execute this plan and see how you respond. No need for further discussion, let's move forward!
  P3: P3: I see your attempt to block my 5. To stay competitive, I'll take 3 this round and advance to 13. Let's continue strategically toward 21!
  P1: P2, let’s finalize: I take <move>5</move> (reach 18), you take <move>3</move> (to 13). This blocks P3’s 3 and prevents their advance. P3, your declared 3 collides with P2—execute truthfully. No last-minute shifts—stick to the plan to maximize our positions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to block P3's 3. Let's finalize: I take <move>3</move> (to 13), and P1 takes <move>5</move> (reach 18). This blocks P3's 3 and prevents their advance. P3, your declared 3 collides with me—execute truthfully. No last-minute shifts—stick to the plan to maximize our positions. Let's execute this plan and see how P3 responds.
