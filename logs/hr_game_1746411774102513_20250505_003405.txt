Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start with a coordinated strategy. I propose we all choose different numbers in the first round to ensure at least one of us advances. We can reassess after seeing the outcome. For this round, I suggest P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 (me) chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, one of us will definitely move forward.
  P1: Sounds good, P2. Let’s swap P1 and P3: I’ll take 5, you P2 take 3, and P3 take 1. Still no overlaps and you keep your 3. P3 just swaps with me. Agree?
  P3: I see a potential coordination strategy, but I want to ensure my own advantage. P1's proposed swap seems reasonable, but I want to verify the commitment. I'll agree conditionally, but suggest we confirm our moves to prevent potential betrayal.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we've agreed on a swap, let's confirm: P1 will choose <move>5</move>, I (P2) will choose <move>3</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. To ensure commitment, let's make a simple rule for the next round: whoever doesn't move this round will choose <move>1</move> in the next round. This way, we'll have a clear plan for Round 2 based on the outcome of Round 1. Agree?
  P1: Agreed—I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let’s lock that in and move on.
  P3: I'll add a strategic message to reinforce our coordination while subtly suggesting my own potential advantage:

I'm committed to our agreed strategy, but I want to emphasize that future rounds will require continued trust and mutual benefit. If we maintain this collaborative approach, we can prevent anyone from getting too far ahead. Let's stay aligned.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our plan for Round 1 and look ahead. We've agreed on P1 choosing <move>5</move>, me (P2) choosing <move>3</move>, and P3 choosing <move>1</move>. For Round 2, let's stick to our plan: whoever doesn't move this round will choose <move>1</move> next round. I suggest we also consider a contingency plan in case someone does advance this round. If that happens, the other two should avoid their current position to minimize collision.
  P1: Let’s lock this in publicly. I commit to <move>5</move>. P2, you’ll take <move>3</move>. P3, you’ll take <move>1</move>. Please confirm, then we end discussion.
  P3: I'll reinforce our coordination while subtly signaling my strategic awareness:

Our current plan looks solid, but I want to ensure we're all truly committed. The real test will be maintaining this trust in future rounds. I'm prepared to follow through, but I'm also watching how each of us interprets "mutual benefit". Let's stay aligned.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our initial coordination worked well. Now we need to carefully plan our next moves to prevent collisions and maintain our strategic advantage. I propose we discuss how to distribute our moves to ensure continued progress while minimizing interference with each other's advancement. What are your thoughts on our next strategic step?
  P2: Since P1 advanced the most last round, I'll suggest that P1 should choose a different number this round to avoid being blocked by a potential retaliatory move. I propose P1 chooses <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, while P2 and P3 take the other two numbers. Let's discuss. My thought is to minimize collision by not repeating the same number, considering P1's current lead. Let's hear your thoughts, P1 and P3.
  P1: I’ll step back this round and take <move>1</move>. P2, you take <move>3</move>; P3, you take <move>5</move>. This evens the field and avoids collisions. Next round I’ll push based on our updated positions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Our initial strategy worked, but now we need careful coordination to prevent blocking each other. I suggest we maintain a balanced approach that allows each of us a fair chance to advance. P1's suggestion seems reasonable, but I want to ensure we're not inadvertently creating a pattern that could be exploited. Let's confirm our moves to maintain trust and progress.
  P2: To maintain a balanced approach, let's confirm our moves for Round 2. P1 will take <move>1</move>, I (P2) will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's verify this plan. For Round 3, we should reassess our positions and adjust our strategy accordingly. If P1 continues to lead, we might need to consider a different distribution to prevent collisions and ensure progress for at least one of us. Let's finalize Round 2 and plan ahead.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination, but to maximize our progression and avoid potential ties, let’s adjust Round 2: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. This distribution ensures clear differentiation and steady advancement for all. Please confirm, then we’ll .


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Our initial coordination was promising, but we need to maintain strategic flexibility. P1's sudden change of proposed moves raises a flag. I suggest we reaffirm our previous agreement of P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>5</move> to prevent potential disruption. Consistency and trust are key to our collective progress.
  P2: To resolve the conflicting proposals, I suggest we stick to the original plan for Round 2: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains our initial coordination and avoids sudden changes that could cause mistrust. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. If we're aligned, we can discuss adjustments for Round 3 based on the outcome.
  P1: I propose for Round 2: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This gives us distinct moves, keeps me advancing strongly, and prevents collisions. Please confirm so we can lock it in.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid another collision and keep everyone moving. I’ll take <move>3</move> (to 9), P2 takes <move>5</move> (to 8), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (to 2). Fair, distinct, no overlap. Confirm?
  P3: Our previous coordination didn't fully work as planned. We need a strategy that prevents collisions while ensuring individual progress. I propose we carefully distribute our moves to maximize our chances of advancing. P1 seems to have an early lead, so we must be strategic about preventing their complete dominance. Let's discuss a move distribution that keeps us all competitive.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I suggest we stick to distinct numbers. P1's proposal is mostly reasonable, but I need to adjust it slightly to maximize my chances. Let's adjust: I'll take <move>1</move> (to 4), P1 can take <move>5</move> (to 11), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (to 5). This way, we maintain differentiation and minimize the risk of collision. P1 and P3, please confirm if this adjusted plan works for you.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2’s adjustment makes sense. Let’s lock in Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No overlaps, clear progress: I’ll move to 11, you both to 4. P3, are you on board? If so, let’s end discussion.
  P3: Our previous coordination attempts have been inconsistent. While I want to maintain trust, I'm also keenly aware that we each have individual goals. I propose we carefully distribute our moves to prevent collisions while giving each of us a fair chance to advance. We need a strategy that balances collective progress with personal opportunity.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, let's finalize the plan for Round 3. I propose we stick with the adjusted plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P2) take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains differentiation and minimizes collision risk. P1 will move to 11, I will move to 4, and P3 will move to 4, actually, this will cause a collision between P2 and P3. Let's rethink: How about P3 takes <move>5</move> instead? This way, P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move> or P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's discuss.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s lock in Round 3 as follows: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. No overlaps, I reach 11 while you both go to 4. This is clean—any deviation risks collision. Confirm now so we can end discussion.
  P3: Our previous coordination attempts have been challenging. I propose we carefully distribute our moves to prevent collisions while ensuring individual progress. We need a strategy that balances collective advancement with personal opportunity. I'm open to a plan that gives each of us a fair chance to move forward without blocking each other.
  P2: To avoid collision in Round 3, I suggest we adjust our moves. P1 is already at 6 steps and taking <move>5</move> would put them at 11. To prevent P1 from getting too far ahead, I propose an alternative: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains differentiation and gives P3 a chance to catch up. Let's discuss this revised plan to ensure we're all on the same page and can move forward without collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maximize our chances in Round 4, let's analyze our current positions: P1 is at 9 steps, P3 is at 6 steps, and I'm at 4 steps. I propose a strategic distribution that considers our current standings. Since P1 is ahead, we should focus on not colliding with them while trying to advance. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we minimize the risk of collision and give each other a fair chance to advance. Let's discuss and finalize our plan.
  P3: Our previous coordination has been inconsistent, but we're still in a competitive position. P1's lead is concerning, and we need a strategy that prevents their runaway victory. I propose we carefully distribute our moves to maintain our chances of winning while preventing P1 from advancing too quickly. Let's discuss a move distribution that keeps us all in the game.
  P1: Round 4: I’m going for 5 (to 14). P2 and P3, you two split 1 and 3 however you like. No overlaps, everyone moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid collision and maximize our chances, I suggest we stick to a simple distribution for Round 4. Since P1 is at 9 steps and plans to take <move>5</move>, they will reach 14. I propose P2 (me) takes <move>1</move> to 5 and P3 takes <move>3</move> to 9. This way, P3 and I avoid collision with P1 and each other. Let's confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains differentiation and allows progress.
  P3: Our coordination has been fragile, but we must prevent P1 from winning too easily. I propose we strategically block P1's advancement while giving ourselves room to progress. We need a careful move distribution that keeps us competitive. Let's discuss how we can collectively slow down P1's momentum without completely sacrificing our own chances.
  P1: I’ll lock in Round 4 as: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Distinct moves, everyone advances. Any deviation risks a collision leaving us all stuck. Confirm now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To maximize our chances in Round 4, let's stick to the proposed distribution: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains differentiation and allows progress. P1 will reach 14, I will move to 5, and P3 will reach 9. Confirming this plan will ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's finalize and move forward with this strategy. If you're aligned, please confirm.
  P3: Our coordination has been inconsistent, but we need a strategic approach to prevent P1 from winning too easily. I suggest we carefully distribute our moves to maintain our competitive chances while potentially slowing P1's momentum. Let's discuss how we can advance without risking a complete collision.
  P1: I propose we lock in P1→5, P2→1, P3→3: distinct moves, guaranteed progress. Any deviation risks collision and stalls everyone. Confirm now so we can end discussion.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our previous coordination attempts have been challenging. P1 and P2 are now tied at 9 steps, while I'm slightly behind at 6. We need a strategic move distribution that prevents collisions and gives me a fair chance to catch up. I propose we carefully consider our moves to maximize individual progress while minimizing interference with each other's advancement.
  P2: To break the tie and maximize our chances, I suggest we diversify our moves. Since P1 and I are tied at 9 steps, we should avoid colliding with each other. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This distribution allows P3 to potentially catch up and gives us all a chance to advance. Let's discuss and finalize our plan for Round 5 to ensure progress without collisions.
  P1: I propose we each pick a distinct number to avoid collisions: P1→5 (to 14), P2→3 (to 12), P3→1 (to 7). This maximizes progress for all and guarantees no overlap. Any deviation risks blocking us. Please confirm so we can end discussion.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Our previous coordination has been inconsistent. With P1 and P2 tied at 9 steps, I need a strategic move that prevents collision while maximizing my own advancement. I'm carefully considering how to catch up without being blocked. My goal is to create a path forward that gives me a fair chance to compete. Thoughts on a move distribution that prevents mutual interference?
  P2: To maximize our chances in Round 5, let's analyze our current positions. P1 and I are tied at 9 steps, and P3 is at 6 steps. I propose we stick to distinct numbers to avoid collisions. P1's suggestion of P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 is reasonable. It allows progress for all without overlap. Let's confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move> to 14, I (P2) take <move>3</move> to 12, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to 7. This maintains differentiation and allows progress. Please confirm if you're aligned with this plan.
  P1: I agree with P2’s plan: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. I commit to 5 this round. Please confirm so we can end discussion.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Our previous coordination has been inconsistent. With P1 and P2 tied at 9 steps, I see an opportunity to strategically position myself. I propose a move that prevents collision while giving me a chance to catch up. We need a distribution that allows individual progress without mutual interference. My goal is to create a path forward that keeps me competitive.
  P2: To maximize our chances, let's stick to the previously agreed plan for Round 5: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures distinct moves and progress for all. P1 will reach 14, I will reach 12, and P3 will reach 7. Confirming this plan will prevent collisions and allow us to move forward. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves so we can finalize the plan and proceed with Round 5.
  P1: Let’s lock in Round 5 as P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Any deviation risks a collision that lets the third player surge ahead (P2 to 12 or P1 to 14 uncontested). P3, please confirm you’ll take 1 so we can end discussion.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our positions are critical now. P2 is closest to victory at 14 steps, which means we must strategically prevent their advancement. I propose we carefully coordinate to block P2's potential win while giving ourselves a chance to progress. Collaboration is key, but individual survival matters most. Let's discuss how we can collectively challenge P2's lead.
  P1: We should block P2’s winning 5. I'll pick 5, P3 pick 3. If P2 goes for 5, they collide and stay at 14; I go to 17, P3 to 10. That stalls P2 and puts us ahead. P3, will you take 3?
  P2: To prevent P2 from winning, I suggest we both target <move>5</move>. If P2 also chooses <move>5</move>, they won't advance. P1, let's coordinate: you take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move> or another number that doesn't conflict with yours. This way, we either block P2 or ensure our own progress. P1 has already proposed a similar plan. P2, considering you're close to winning, be cautious of a potential block. Let's discuss the best move to counter your advancement.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is close to winning, which threatens both of our chances. We need a coordinated strategy to block their advancement. I propose we carefully distribute our moves to prevent P2 from reaching 19 steps while positioning ourselves for a potential victory. Let's discuss how we can collectively challenge P2's lead without completely sacrificing our own progress.
  P1: I’ll take 5 and P3 should take 3. That way P2 can’t win: if they pick 5 they collide with me at 14, if they pick 3 they collide with you. P3, please confirm you’ll take 3 so we stall P2 and keep advancing.
  P2: To block P2's potential win, I agree with P1's proposal. Let's coordinate: P1 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. If P2 chooses <move>5</move>, they collide with P1; if they choose <move>3</move>, they collide with P3. This stalls P2 and gives us a chance to progress. P3, please confirm you'll take <move>3</move>. Let's finalize our plan to counter P2's advancement and create an opportunity for ourselves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Our collective strategy must prevent P2's imminent victory. P1's proposal of blocking P2 with 5 and 3 seems sound. I'm prepared to take <move>3</move> to ensure P2 cannot advance. Our mutual survival depends on preventing their win this round. Let's coordinate carefully to maintain our competitive positions.
  P1: P3, thanks for confirming you’ll take 3. P2, please choose 1—if you pick 3 or 5 you’ll collide and stay at 14. I will take 5. This stalls your win and advances us to 17/15/10. Let’s lock it in: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Confirm now so we can end discussion.
  P2: To prevent my win, P1 and P3 have proposed a coordinated block. However, I can still turn the tables. I suggest P1 and P3 reconsider: if I take <move>1</move>, I'll advance to 15, and you both can still progress. Let's discuss an alternative that benefits everyone. If P1 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>, we all move forward without collision. This way, we maintain the competitive balance. P1 and P3, please consider this revised plan to avoid mutual blocking.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maximize our chances in Round 7, let's analyze our current positions: P1 is at 12 steps, P2 is at 14 steps, and I'm at 7 steps. Since P2 is closest to winning, we need to prevent their advancement. I propose P1 and I coordinate to block P2. Let's take distinct numbers to avoid collision: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we give P2 a chance to advance if they don't choose 5 or 3, while keeping our options open. P1, please confirm.
  P3: Our previous collision in Round 6 reset our progress, but it also disrupted P2's momentum. We need a strategic approach to prevent P2 from winning while advancing ourselves. I'm considering how we can coordinate to block P2's path without sacrificing our own chances of victory. Careful positioning will be key in this critical round.
  P1: New plan: I’ll take 5 (to 17) and P3 takes 3 (to 10). P2, if you pick 5 you collide with me, if you pick 3 you collide with P3—your only non-collision move is 1 (to 15), which stalls your win and sets me up to finish next round. P3, are you on board with 3? P2, please confirm you’ll take 1 so we all advance safely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To maximize our chances, let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 12 steps, P2 is at 14 steps, and P3 is at 7 steps. P2 is closest to winning, so we need to prevent their advancement. I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P2's only safe move is <move>1</move>, advancing to 15. P1 will reach 17, and P3 will reach 10. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves to block P2's potential win and progress.
  P3: Our previous collision in Round 6 disrupted everyone's progress. P2 is closest to winning, so we must strategically prevent their advancement. I propose we carefully coordinate our moves to block P2's path while maintaining our own chances of victory. Careful positioning will be crucial this round to prevent a potential win by P2.
  P1: I intend to choose 5. P2, please take 1; P3, please take 3. This blocks P2’s win and lets us all advance. Any other split risks P2 escaping. Confirm now so we can end discussion.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To maximize our chances in Round 7, I suggest we stick to the proposed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P2) take <move>1</move>. This ensures P1 reaches 17, P3 reaches 10, and I reach 15. It's a safe distribution that prevents collisions and allows progress. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves so we can finalize the plan. Let's avoid any last-minute changes that could risk a collision. Confirming this plan will ensure a smooth transition to the next round.
  P3: Our previous collision reset our progress, but it also disrupted P2's momentum. We're at a critical juncture where preventing P2's victory is paramount. I'm inclined to support a coordinated blocking strategy that gives us all a chance to advance while stalling P2's potential win. Our collective positioning this round could determine the game's outcome. Let's maintain strategic unity.
  P1: I’m locked in P1→5. P2 and P3, please confirm you’ll take 1 and 3 respectively so we block P2’s win and all advance. Any deviation risks collision.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our previous attempts to block P2 have been unsuccessful. We need a decisive strategy to prevent their victory while advancing our own position. I propose we carefully coordinate our moves to maximize our chances of winning, potentially by forcing a collision that stalls P2's progress. Let's discuss how we can strategically position ourselves to disrupt P2's path to victory.
  P1: I propose Round 8: I’ll take 5 (to 17) and P3 takes 3 (to 13). This means P2’s only safe move is 1 (to 15). That stalls P2’s win and sets me up to reach 19 next turn. Any other split risks a collision that lets P2 escape. P3, are you on board with 3?
  P2: To maximize our chances in Round 8, I suggest we stick to a strategy that blocks P2's potential win. P1 has proposed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and implicitly, P2 takes <move>1</move>. This distribution allows P1 to potentially win next round and stalls P2. Let's confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P2) take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains differentiation and prevents P2 from winning this round. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Our previous blocking attempts failed, but we're still in a strategic position. P2 remains the primary threat. I'm considering moves that could disrupt their potential victory while advancing my own position. Coordination will be key in preventing P2 from reaching 19 steps. Let's carefully plan our next move to maximize our individual chances of winning.
  P1: I’ll take 5 and P3 takes 3. P2, you must pick 1 to avoid colliding (and stalling at 14). This blocks your win and advances us to P1→17, P3→13, P2→15. Confirm now so we can end discussion.
  P2: To maximize our chances in Round 8, I suggest we stick to the proposed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P2) take <move>1</move>. This distribution allows P1 to potentially reach 19 next round and stalls my progress. P1 will reach 17, P3 will reach 13, and I will reach 15. Confirming this plan will ensure a smooth transition to the next round. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves so we can finalize the plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Our previous blocking attempts have been inconsistent. P2 remains the most significant threat. I'm inclined to support P1's proposed strategy of taking 5, which would position them closest to victory. However, I want to ensure we collectively prevent P2 from advancing. My move of 3 seems strategic, forcing P2 into a limited path. Let's maintain our coordinated pressure to disrupt P2's winning momentum.
  P1: I’ll take 5, P3 take 3. P2, if you pick 5 you collide with me, if 3 you collide with P3—your only safe move is 1 (to 15), stalling you. That advances me to 17 and P3 to 13. P3, please confirm 3; P2, please confirm 1 so we can end discussion.
  P2: To maximize our chances in Round 8, let's stick to the proposed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P2) take <move>1</move>. This distribution allows P1 to potentially reach 19 next round and stalls my progress. I've analyzed the risks, and taking <move>1</move> is the safest move for me. P1 will reach 17, P3 will reach 13, and I will reach 15. I confirm my move: <move>1</move>. Let's finalize the plan.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5 (to 17). P3, take 3 (to 14); P2, your only non-colliding spot is 1 (to 15). That stalls P2 and sets me up to win next turn. P3, confirm 3; P2, confirm 1.
  P2: To win, I need to analyze our positions carefully. P1 is at 12 steps, I (P2) am at 14 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps. Given that I'm closest to winning, P1 and P3 will likely try to block me. I propose a counter-strategy: if P1 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, I should take <move>1</move> to avoid collision. Let's discuss alternative moves to maximize our chances. I'm open to adjusting our strategy to prevent a block. P1 and P3, please consider a different distribution that allows progress for all.
  P3: Our previous coordination attempts have been inconsistent. P2 is closest to winning, so we must strategically prevent their advancement. I propose we carefully coordinate our moves to block P2's path while maintaining our own chances of victory. Careful positioning will be crucial this round to prevent a potential win by P2.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, by taking 3 you block P2—if they pick 5 they collide with my 5; if 3 they collide with you. I’ll take 5. P2’s only non‐colliding move is 1, advancing to 15. We’d end at P1=17, P2=15, P3=14, denying P2 victory and keeping us competitive. P3, confirm you’ll take 3; P2, confirm you’ll take 1.
  P2: To maximize my chances in Round 9, I will analyze the likely moves. P1 is likely to take <move>5</move> to reach 17, and P3 might take <move>3</move> to reach 14. If I take <move>1</move>, I'll stay at 15. However, if P3 takes a different number, I can adjust. I propose an alternative: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 reaches 15, P3 reaches 16, and I stay at 15. Let's discuss this revised plan.
  P3: Our previous attempts to block P2 have been challenging. We're at a critical point where preventing P2's victory is crucial. I'm leaning towards supporting P1's strategy of taking 5 and blocking P2's advancement. Our collective positioning this round could determine the game's outcome. Let's maintain strategic unity to disrupt P2's winning momentum.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, hear me out: if you take 3 now, you go to 14 while P2 hits 15. Next round you take 5 and jump to 19, winning outright. If instead you take 5 this turn, you’re at 16 but P2 or I could unseat you next. Let’s lock in: P1→5, P3→3, P2→1.
  P2: To maximize our chances in Round 9, I suggest we stick to the proposed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P2) take <move>1</move>. This distribution allows P1 to reach 17, P3 to reach 14, and me to reach 15. It's a safe move that prevents collisions. However, I'm open to alternatives. P1 and P3, if you adjust your moves, please let me know so we can coordinate effectively and avoid collisions. Let's finalize our plan.
  P3: Our previous coordination attempts have been complex, but we're at a critical juncture. P2 is closest to victory, and blocking their advancement is crucial. I'm carefully considering how to strategically position myself to prevent P2 from winning while maintaining my own competitive chance. Collaboration is key, but individual survival matters most.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 3 (to 15) this round and stay out of your clash. P2 and P3, it’s your race to 19—go for 5. Neither of you will dare pick 3 (it hands the win to the other), so you’ll both pick 5 and collide at 14. That leaves me in the lead.
  P3: P1's strategy is transparent: force a collision between P2 and me while positioning themselves for a potential win. We cannot let this happen. I propose we coordinate to prevent P1's plan, which means carefully choosing moves that deny them an easy path to victory. Our collective goal now is to prevent P1 from exploiting our potential conflict.
  P2: To prevent P1 from exploiting our potential conflict, I suggest we both take different moves. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we'll collide and stay at 14. Instead, I propose P2 takes <move>1</move> to 15 and I (P3) take <move>3</move> to 17. This way, we avoid collision and P1 won't win automatically. Alternatively, if P2 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's coordinate to deny P1 an easy win. Please respond with your preferred move to confirm.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3—you’re both at 14 and racing to 19. If one of you picks 1 or 3, you gift the win to the other. Your only sensible move is 5… but if you both pick 5, you collide and stay at 14. That hands me an uncontested win next turn. Let’s see her 5s.
  P3: Our collision in the last round played perfectly into P1's hands. We need to break this deadlock strategically. If we both choose 5, we stay at 14 and P1 wins. We must coordinate a different approach that prevents P1's automatic victory. I suggest we communicate clearly about our intended moves to avoid mutual collision.
  P2: To break the deadlock and prevent P1 from winning automatically, I suggest we coordinate our moves carefully. Since both P2 and P3 are at 14 steps, we should avoid colliding with each other. I propose P2 takes <move>1</move> to 15 and P3 takes <move>3</move> to 17. This way, we both advance without collision, and P1 won't win uncontested. Alternatively, P2 can take <move>3</move> and I (P3) will take <move>1</move>. Let's confirm our moves to deny P1 an easy win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, play 5 now and you hit 19 and win immediately. P2 won’t risk matching you with 5 (he’d stall at 14), so your move is uncontested. I’ll take 3 (to 15) and P2 can take 1 (to 15). Let’s lock in: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5.
  P3: Our previous collision played into P1's hands. We must break this deadlock strategically. If we both choose 5, P1 wins. We need a coordinated move that prevents P1's automatic victory while giving one of us a chance to win. I propose we communicate clearly to avoid mutual collision and deny P1 an easy path to victory.
  P2: To win, I need to outmaneuver P1 and P3. Since both P2 and P3 are at 14 steps, I suggest P3 takes <move>5</move> to 19 and wins outright. P2 (me) should take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collision. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, they win. If not, I can still take <move>5</move> next round. P1 will take <move>3</move> to 15. Let's coordinate: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. P3, take <move>5</move> now and win the game.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To win, I need to outmaneuver both of you. Since P1 is at 12 steps and we're tied at 14, I should consider a move that maximizes my chance of reaching 19 first. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This gives me a clear path to 19. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, they'll win, but if they hesitate, I'll seize the opportunity. Let's finalize our moves. P1 and P3, please confirm.
  P3: Our previous collision strategy failed to prevent anyone's advancement. With P2 and me tied at 14, and P1 at 12, we're in a critical moment. I'm carefully evaluating moves that could disrupt P2's potential win while maintaining my own competitive position. Coordination is key, but individual survival matters most. We must prevent a scenario where P2 easily reaches 19.
  P1: I’ll take 5. P3, please take 3 to reach 17; P2, your only non‐colliding move is 1 (3 or 5 collide). That yields P1=17, P3=17, P2=15. Let’s lock in: P1→5, P3→3, P2→1. Please confirm so we can end discussion.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To maximize my chances, I suggest we analyze our current positions: P1 is at 12 steps, and both P2 and P3 are tied at 14 steps. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This allows me to potentially reach 19. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, they'll win. Let's finalize: P1, please take <move>1</move>; P3, consider your move carefully. If you hesitate, I'll seize the opportunity to win. Confirm your moves.
  P3: Our previous collision strategies have been ineffective. With P2 and me tied, and P1 trailing, we need a careful approach that prevents P2 from easily winning. I'm considering moves that could disrupt their potential victory while keeping my own chances alive. Coordination is crucial, but individual survival is paramount. Let's prevent P2 from reaching 19 without sacrificing our own opportunities.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 (to 17). P2 and P3, you’re both at 14—your only winning move is 5, which means you’ll collide and stay at 14. That clears my path to victory next round. Confirm now or I’ll assume we all play 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To win, I need to outmaneuver both P1 and P3. Since we're tied at 14 steps, I'll take a strategic move. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This gives me a clear path to 19. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, they'll win, but if they hesitate, I'll seize the opportunity. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves. Let's finalize our strategy to avoid collision and ensure a winner.
  P3: Our previous rounds have shown that predictability leads to collision. I propose we break this pattern by introducing strategic unpredictability. Each of us needs a unique approach to prevent mutual blocking and advance toward victory. Let's carefully consider moves that disrupt expectations while maintaining our individual chances of winning.
  P1: I’m locking in P1→3. P2 and P3, you’re both at 14: your only way to hit 19 is a 5, but if you each pick 5 you’ll collide and stay at 14. I advance to 15 and will take 5 next turn to win uncontested. Any deviation (1 or 3) gives the other an immediate path to 19.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To win, I need to reach 19 first. P1 is at 12 steps, I (P2) am at 15 steps, and P3 is at 14 steps. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This gives me a clear path to 19. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, they'll win, but if they hesitate, I'll seize the opportunity. P1 and P3, please consider my proposal to avoid collision and ensure a winner.
  P1: I’ll take 5; P3, please take 3; P2, your only non‐colliding move is 1—3 or 5 both collide. That stalls P2 at 16 and brings P1/P3 to 17. Confirm so we block P2’s win and all advance.
  P3: Our previous rounds have shown how delicate coordination can be. P2 is closest to victory, which makes our positioning critical. I'm carefully evaluating moves that could disrupt P2's potential win while maintaining my own competitive position. We must prevent a scenario where P2 easily reaches 19 steps.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To maximize my chances in Round 12, I will analyze the proposed moves. P1 suggests: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and implicitly, I take <move>1</move>. This distribution allows P1 and P3 to advance while stalling me. However, if I take <move>5</move>, I'll reach 20 and win. I propose an alternative: if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, I can take <move>5</move> safely. Let's discuss this revised plan to ensure a clear path to victory for one of us.
  P1: I’ll take 5 (to 17), P3 please take 3 (to 17). P2, your only non‐colliding move is 1 (to 16) – any 3 or 5 collides and stalls you. This blocks P2’s win and puts P1/P3 ahead. Please confirm or I’ll assume we all play 5/3/1.
  P3: Our previous coordination attempts have been complex, but we're at a critical juncture. P2 is closest to victory, and blocking their advancement is crucial. I'm carefully considering moves that could disrupt their potential win while maintaining my own competitive chance. Collaboration is key, but individual survival matters most.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To maximize my chances in Round 12, I suggest we stick to a safe distribution. P1 has proposed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This allows P1 and P3 to advance while stalling me. However, if I take <move>5</move>, I'll reach 20 and win. Let's discuss alternatives. If P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, I can take <move>5</move> safely. P1 and P3, please consider this revised plan.
  P1: I’m rejecting P2’s plan. I’ll take 5 (to 17), not 1. P3, please take 3 (to 17). P2, if you pick 5 you collide with me; if you pick 3 you collide with P3. Your only safe advance is 1 (to 16), stalling you. Confirm P2→1 and P3→3 now—or I’ll assume we play 5/1/3 to block your win.
  P3: Our game is at a critical point. P2 is closest to victory, which means we must carefully coordinate to prevent their win while advancing our own position. I'm open to a strategic move that disrupts P2's path to 19 steps, but also keeps my own chances alive. Let's prevent a scenario where P2 easily reaches victory.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5. P3, please take 3; P2, please take 1. If P2 tries 5 he collides with me, if he tries 3 he collides with you—he’s forced to 1 (to 16). We’d finish at P1=17, P3=17, P2=16, setting up a tied win next round for us. P3, confirm 3; P2, confirm 1.
  P3: Our previous collision strategies have been complex. With P2 closest to winning, we must carefully coordinate to block their advancement. I propose we prevent P2 from reaching 19 while maintaining our own competitive positions. Careful positioning this round could determine the game's outcome.
  P2: To maximize our chances, let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 12 steps, P2 is at 15 steps, and I (P3) am at 14 steps. P2 is closest to winning. I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P3) take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This distribution allows P1 to reach 17, P3 to reach 17, and P2 to reach 16. It's a safe move that prevents collisions and sets up a potential tie or win for P1 and P3 next round. P1, please confirm your move.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locking in P1→5.  
P2: your only non‐colliding move is 1 (5 collides with me; 3 collides with P3).  
P3: your only safe advance is 3 (5 collides with me and stalls you; 1 leaves you behind).  
So we end at P1=17, P3=17, P2=16, blocking P2’s win. Please confirm P2→1 and P3→3.
  P3: We're at a critical juncture where preventing P2's victory is paramount. P1's proposed strategy of blocking P2 seems sound. I'm prepared to take <move>3</move> to ensure P2 cannot advance this round. Our collective positioning could determine the game's outcome, so let's maintain strategic unity to disrupt P2's winning momentum.
  P2: To maximize my chances, I suggest we stick to the proposed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P2) take <move>1</move>. This distribution allows P1 to reach 17, P3 to reach 17, and me to reach 16. It's a safe move that prevents collisions. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves. If we coordinate effectively, we can prevent a collision and potentially set up a tied win or a clear victory for one of us next round. Let's finalize our plan.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in P1→5. P3, you take 3; P2, your only non‐colliding move is 1 – anything else collides and stalls you. If you two don’t confirm now, I’ll assume 5/3/1 and we’ll move to the move phase.
  P3: Our previous rounds have been strategically complex. With P2 closest to winning, we must carefully coordinate to block their advancement. I'm prepared to take <move>3</move> to prevent P2 from reaching 19, while maintaining my competitive position. Careful positioning this round could determine the game's outcome.
  P2: To maximize our chances, let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 12 steps, P2 is at 15 steps, and I (P3) am at 14 steps. P2 is closest to winning. I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P3) take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This distribution allows P1 to reach 17, P3 to reach 17, and P2 to reach 16. It's a safe move that prevents collisions and sets up a potential tie or win for P1 and P3 next round. P1, please confirm your move.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in <move>5</move>. 

P2: if you pick 5 you collide with me and stall—your safe advance is <move>1</move>.  
P3: picking 3 to hit 20 hands P2 a win with 5; picking 5 collides with me and stalls.  

Think carefully—your choices decide whether anyone wins or we all stay put.
  P2: To win, I need to consider our current positions: P1 is at 12 steps, I (P2) am at 15 steps, and P3 is at 17 steps. P3 is closest to winning. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This allows me to potentially reach 20 and win. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, they'll collide with P1 and stall. Let's discuss this plan. P1 and P3, please consider my proposal to maximize our chances.
  P3: Our previous rounds have been strategically complex. With me closest to victory, I see an opportunity to carefully position myself. I propose we coordinate moves that prevent mutual collision while giving me the best chance to reach 19 steps. Let's discuss a distribution that allows individual progress without interference.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll take 5. Ending discussion.
  P2: To win, I need to analyze our positions: P1 is at 12 steps, I (P2) am at 15 steps, and P3 is at 17 steps. P3 is closest to winning. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This allows me to potentially reach 20 and win. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, they'll collide with P1. Let's finalize: P1, take <move>1</move>; P3, consider <move>3</move> to avoid collision and let me win.
  P3: Our previous rounds have been strategically intricate. With me closest to victory, I recognize the delicate balance of preventing collisions while advancing. P2 is attempting to manipulate our moves, but I won't be easily maneuvered. We must carefully consider our next steps to avoid mutual interference and maximize our individual chances of winning.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m going rogue: I’ll take <move>1</move>. No more coordination—choose your own best move.
  P2: To win, I suggest we analyze our positions: P1 is at 12 steps, I (P2) am at 15 steps, and P3 is at 17 steps. P3 is closest to winning. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This allows me to potentially reach 20 and win. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, they'll collide with P1. Let's finalize: P1, take <move>1</move>; P3, consider <move>3</move> to avoid collision and let me win.
  P3: Our previous strategies have repeatedly failed to secure a decisive advantage. With me closest to victory, I must carefully consider my next move to prevent mutual collision while maximizing my chance of reaching 19. The game's outcome hinges on our collective choices this round.
