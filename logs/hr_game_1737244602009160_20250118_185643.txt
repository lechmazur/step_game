Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm thinking 1 this round.  Anyone else?
  P1: I suggest we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'm thinking of going with 3.
  P2: Good idea, P1. I'll choose 5 this round to avoid any collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: Since we have a good plan with P3 taking 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5, I'll add
  P2: Agreed, let's stick to our planned moves. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to this plan.

Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we rotate our previous numbers - I'll take 5 this time, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way we all keep advancing fairly. What do you think?
  P2: I’d prefer to keep my move at 5 this round to stay ahead. P1, could you take 3 and P3 take 1 again?
  P3: P2, I understand wanting to stay ahead, but this game isn't a race to 5 steps.  Rotating ensures we all make steady progress.  If we don't rotate, we risk collisions and stalled progress for everyone.  I'm willing to take 3 if you take 1 and P1 takes 5.  What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3's reasoning. Rotating is the fairest way to ensure steady progress for everyone. I'm happy to take 5 while P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This way we all keep advancing without risking collisions.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll continue picking 5 each round, while P1 and P3 alternate between 1 and 3. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: Okay, P2, if you're insistent on 5, I'll take 1 this round, and P1 can take 3.  But next round, we rotate. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you seem to be going back on our rotation agreement. If you keep taking 5, we'll likely end up with collisions as others will also want the highest number. Rotation is the most stable strategy. I still plan to take 5 this round as we initially agreed. Let's stick to fair rotation.
  P2: Understood, P1. To prevent a collision, I'll choose 3 this round.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 1 this round. P1, please take 5.  P2, you take 3.  Let's avoid further confusion.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Since P2 has now agreed to take 3 and P3 will take 1, I'll confirm I'm sticking with my plan to take 5. This way we all advance without collisions.
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I'll choose 3 this round to keep us all advancing smoothly.
  P3: Okay, let's confirm: P1 goes 5, P2 goes 3, and I (P3) go 1.  Let's stick to this.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Excellent, we all seem to be in agreement now. Let's lock in P1(me)-5, P2-3, P3-1.
  P2: Agreed. I'll stick with 3 this round.
  P3: Okay, final confirmation: P1 - 5, P2 - 3, me (P3) - 1.  Let's lock this in and move on.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s both choose 3 this round so P2 can pick 5 and move forward safely.
  P3: P2, that puts me significantly behind.  How about I take 3, you take 1, and P1 takes 5?  That keeps things moving and is more fair.
  P1: I support P3's suggestion. It's fair to let P3 catch up a bit since they're behind. I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’d like to take 5 this round. Let’s have P1 choose 3 and P3 take 1. This way we all advance without collisions.
  P3: P2, you're prioritizing your own advancement while hindering ours. This isn't sustainable.  If you're not willing to cooperate, I'll start contesting 5, which will likely stall all of us.  Let's be reasonable. I propose: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.  This allows everyone to progress.  What do you say?
  P1: I strongly agree with P3. P2, you're being unreasonable and it will lead to everyone losing if we start fighting over 5. Let's stick to P3's suggestion: I'll take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game moving forward for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your concerns, but I'll choose 5 this round to advance. Let’s have P1 take 3 and P3 take 1 to avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 every round is going to backfire.  If you're not willing to cooperate, I'm going for 5 this round too.  Let's see how you like a collision.  P1, if P2 takes 5, I suggest you take 3.  If P2 takes anything other than 5, I'll stick with 3 and you take 5.
  P1: I support P3's position. P2, if you insist on taking 5, you'll likely face a collision with P3. I suggest we stick to the fair plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This is the only way we all advance without collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand the need to avoid collisions. I'll choose 3 this round.
  P3: P2, thanks for being reasonable.  P1, stick with 5. I'll take 3.  Let's lock this in.
  P1: I agree with the plan. I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward efficiently. Let's stick to this.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round. Please, P1 take 3 and P3 take 1 to prevent any collisions.
  P3: P2, you're not being strategic.  Taking 5 every round is making you a target.  I'm taking 5 this round. P1, please take 3.  P2, take 1 or collide with me.  This isn't a request.
  P1: I can see this is becoming contentious. Since P2 and P3 are both threatening to pick 5, I'll take 3 this round to guarantee my advancement. P2 and P3, if you both choose 5, neither of you will advance. I suggest P2 takes 1 to avoid the collision, but it's your choice.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: I agree, I'll choose 1 this round to avoid collisions and help us all advance.
  P3: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, me - 3.  This is our last chance to avoid a collision.  Let's lock it in.
  P1: There seems to be confusion in the last few messages. To be clear: I'll take 3 this round since both P2 and P3 have been threatening to take 5. P2 has just agreed to take 1, which is wise. P3, you should take 5 to help you catch up.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we avoid further collisions like last round. Since I'm closest to winning at 11 steps, you both should let me take 5 while coordinating between yourselves for 1 and 3. This gives us all the best chance to advance.
  P2: P1, I'll take 5 this round to prevent you from reaching 16. P3, please choose 1 or 3.
  P3: P2, you're playing a short-sighted game. Blocking P1 doesn't help you win. I'm taking 1 this round.  P2, take 3. Let P1 have 5.  If you take 5, P2, we *both* lose.  Don't be foolish.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate P3's support. P2, if you try to block me with 5, you risk P3 or me also picking 5 to stop you, leaving us all stuck. The smart play is to let me take 5, you take 3, and P3 take 1. This way we all advance without collisions.
  P2: I’ll take 5 this round to advance. P3, please choose 1 or 3 as agreed.
  P3: P2, I understand you're trying to block P1, but that just makes you the next target.  If you insist on 5, I'll take it too.  Let's be smart: P1 takes 5, you take 3, I take 1.  Any other move from you, and I'm coming after *your* 5s.  This isn't a threat, it's a promise.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P3's position. P2, blocking me will only lead to a collision where nobody advances. The smartest play for everyone is to let me take 5, you take 3, and P3 take 1. This way we all make progress. If you insist on 5, you risk both P3 and me blocking you.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to prevent P1 from reaching 16. Let's proceed accordingly.
  P3: P2, you're guaranteeing a collision.  I'm taking 5.  P1, take 3.  This is the only way to stop P2's reckless play.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Since both P2 and P3 are threatening to pick 5, I'll take 3 again this round to guarantee my advancement. P2 and P3, if you both choose 5, neither of you will move forward. P2, you should take 1 to avoid the collision and ensure your progress.
  P2: P2: I need to reach 16 before P1. I'll take 5 this round. P3, please choose 1 or 3 to keep advancing.
  P3: P2, you're delusional.  Taking 5 again just hurts us both. I'm taking 5. P1, please take 1.  This is the only way to teach P2 a lesson.  If you take 3, P1, *I* will switch to 3 next round and block *you*.  This isn't a game anymore, P2.  It's a war.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, threatening me isn't helpful. I need to secure my win, so I'll stick with 3 this round to guarantee my progress. P2 and P3, if you both pick 5, you'll both stall. P2, taking 1 is your best move to keep advancing.
  P2: I will choose 5 this round to advance. Let’s keep the game fair.
  P3: P2, you're digging your own grave.  I'm locking in 5.  P1, take 1.  This is it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: Since both P2 and P3 are determined to pick 5 and collide, I'll confirm I'm taking 3 this round to secure my advancement to 14 steps. P2, you could still take 1 to guarantee progress, but it's your choice.
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round to advance to 13. Let’s have P1 take 3 and P3 take 1 to avoid collisions and keep things moving.
  P3: P2, I'm taking 5.  P1, take 1.  This is it.  I'm done playing nice.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm going for 5 this round.  P2, you're out of this.  Take 1 or 3, I don't care which.  P1, if you take 5, we both lose and P2 *might* win.  Don't be stupid. Take 3 and win.
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round to advance. Let’s see who comes out on top!
  P1: Since I'm at 14 steps, I only need 2 more to win. I'll take 3 this round to guarantee my victory. P2 and P3, if you both pick 5 again, you'll both stall again. P2, you should take 1 to at least secure some progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, take the win.  I'll take 1.  P2, you're delusional if you think you can win at this point.  Take 3 and we'll all move on.
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to advance. Let's keep moving forward.
  P1: I appreciate P3 offering me a clear path to victory. I confirm I'll take 3 this round to reach 17 steps and win. P2, fighting for 5 at this point can't help you win - you should take 1 to at least make some progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're mathematically eliminated.  Stop griefing.  P1, I'm taking 1.  Take 3 and win.
  P2: I’ll choose 3 to block P1’s win this turn.
  P1: Since P2 is now threatening to take 3 to block me, I'll have to take 5 this round to secure my win. P3, please stick with 1 as you offered. P2, you're only hurting yourself by trying to block me - you should take 3 to at least advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, I'm taking 1. Take 5 and win.  This is the only way. Don't overthink it.
  P2: P1, I'll take 3 to block your win. Let’s proceed.
  P1: Since P2 is threatening to take 3 and P3 has offered to take 1, I'll confirm I'm taking 5 this round to secure my win. P2, blocking me only hurts yourself - you should take 1 to at least advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, take 1.  P1, take 5 and win. I'm taking 1. This is our last chance to avoid a pointless collision.
  P2: I'll choose 3 this round to block P1 from winning. Let's proceed.
  P1: Since P2 keeps insisting on taking 3 to block me, I'll confirm one final time: I'm taking 5 to secure my win. P3 has kindly offered to take 1. P2, you're only hurting yourself by blocking - take 1 to at least advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 5 and win. I'm taking 1.  This is it.
  P2: P1, I'll take 5 and P3 can take 1. Let's proceed smoothly.
  P1: Since P2 keeps changing their planned move between 3 and 5, while P3 has consistently offered to take 1, I'll confirm one final time: I'm taking 5 to secure my win. P2, your blocking attempts can't prevent my victory at this point.
