Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5 this round. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. What do you think?
  P3: I'm open to coordination. However, I think P2's suggestion is not ideal for me. If I pick 3 and P1 picks 1, there's still a risk that P1 might change their mind and pick 3, causing a collision. Instead, I propose that we all pick the same number this round, so that none of us move. This way, we can reassess our strategy for the next round without risking a collision on the first turn. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: I agree with P2's plan. Let's go with 1, 3, 5 respectively. This ensures everyone moves forward without collisions. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but sticking with the original plan of 1, 3, 5 ensures we all make progress. If we all pick the same number, we're just delaying the game. P1 has agreed to the plan. Let's trust each other and move forward. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P2 and P1, I understand your preference for the original plan, but I still believe it's riskier. If you're so confident that P1 will pick 1, then I'm willing to compromise: let's pick 1 together. If P1 really sticks to 1, we'll all collide and not move. But if P1 betrays and picks another number, I'll be the only one to move. It's a low-risk move for me.
  P1: P3, sticking to 1,3,5 ensures progress. If we all pick 1, we lose momentum. Let's trust the plan and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see your point, but let's consider this: if we all pick 1, we're guaranteed to stall. Instead, how about a new proposal? P1 picks 1, I'll pick 5, and P3, you can pick 3 but let us know if you have another preference. This way, we can still make progress. Final thoughts before we move?
  P3: P1 and P2, I've considered your responses. To directly address the risk, I'll reiterate: if we follow the original 1, 3, 5 plan, there's still a risk of collision if one of you deviates. I'm not convinced you're committed to the plan. As a compromise, I'm willing to pick 3 if you both agree to pick different numbers than me. Let's finalize: P1 and P2, are you willing to pick either 1 or 5, ensuring you don't collide with me on 3?
  P1: P1: Let's finalize the 1-3-5 plan. P2 on 5, P3 on 3. No collisions. Commit now.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great, we all moved forward last round without collisions. Let's keep this momentum going. For this round, I suggest P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. This way, we continue to advance without any conflicts. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I've considered your plans so far. To minimize risk, I propose we randomize our moves this round. I'll generate a random number between 1, 3, and 5, and share it publicly. This way, we can ensure we're not colluding or being predictable. Let's start with my random pick: 5. Now it's your turn, P1 and P2. Please respond with your moves or a counter-proposal.
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's plan. I'll pick 3 to avoid collisions. Let's keep moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion for randomization, but it introduces unnecessary risk. Let's stick with a coordinated plan to ensure we all move forward. P1 has agreed to pick 3. If you pick 5 as you suggested, I'll pick 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's finalize this plan and keep the game moving. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 has agreed to pick 3. If I pick 1 and you pick 5, we can avoid collisions. P3, to directly address your randomization proposal, I understand the intent, but it may not be necessary. Let's finalize the plan: P1 on 3, you on 5, and I'll pick 1. This ensures progress for all. Please confirm if you're willing to pick 5. If not, let's discuss an alternative that works for everyone.
  P1: P1: I'll stick to 3. Let's keep the plan to avoid collisions. P2, confirm your 5? P3, your move?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see your point about randomization, but it's crucial we maintain our momentum. Let's confirm our moves: P1 is on 3, I'll pick 1, and you pick 5. This ensures we all advance. If you're not comfortable with 5, let us know your preference, and we can adjust. Let's finalize and move forward.
  P3: To avoid collisions and ensure progress, let's simplify our strategy. Since P1 is on 3, I'll pick 1. P3, you're on 5 in your randomization proposal. Let's stick with this: P1 on 3, P2 on 1, and P3 on 5. This maintains our momentum. If you're uncomfortable with 5, suggest an alternative. Let's finalize our moves for this round. If you're willing to stick with 5, confirm, and we'll proceed. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions.
  P1: P1: Let's finalize the plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. No collisions. Steady progress. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To minimize the risk of collision and maximize our chances, I propose we analyze the current standings and adjust our strategy. Currently, I'm at 4 steps, P2 is at 6, and you're at 8, P3. Let's consider a plan that takes into account our relative positions. Since I'm behind, I'll suggest a move that gives me a higher chance of advancing without collision. How about I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1? This way, we can all potentially move forward.
  P2: P3, your plan seems fair given our current standings. However, to ensure we all move forward without collisions, let's tweak it slightly. How about I pick 1, you pick 3, and P1 picks 5? This way, we all advance, and it balances the steps better. P1, what do you think? Let's finalize quickly to keep the game moving.
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's plan. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5 respectively. No collisions, steady progress. Let's move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I've rethought our strategy. Given that I'm ahead in steps, I should pick a number that minimizes the risk of collision while maximizing my chance to win. I propose I pick 1, you both pick different numbers (either 3 or 5), ensuring I don't collide with either of you. If you agree, let's finalize: I'll pick 1, and you two coordinate on 3 and 5. This way, I can potentially advance while you both move or collide.
  P2: P3, your new proposal seems too advantageous for you. To keep it fair, let's stick with the plan where I pick 1, you pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This ensures we all move and no one is left behind. P1, are you still on board with picking 5? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P2, I'll stick with 5. P3, pick 3 to avoid collision. Let's finalize and move forward without delays.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's reassess. I'm currently ahead with 8 steps. To win, I need to avoid collisions and maintain my lead. I propose I pick 5, you're on 1 and 3. This way, I maximize my chance to advance. If you're concerned about fairness, we can alternate picks next round. I'm open to a coordinated plan that ensures progress for all, but I prioritize minimizing collision risk. Let's finalize: I'll pick 5, P1 and P2, coordinate on 1 and 3.
  P2: P3, your latest proposal still seems too advantageous for you. Let's find a middle ground. How about this: I'll pick 3, you pick 1, and P1 picks 5. This way, we all have a fair chance to move forward without collisions. P1, are you okay with picking 5? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P1: Let's finalize the plan: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. No collisions, steady progress. Trust the strategy and move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great, we're all tied at 9 steps. To keep the momentum and avoid collisions, let's coordinate our moves again. I propose P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This ensures we all move forward without any conflicts. What do you think? Let's finalize quickly to keep the game moving.
  P3: Since we're tied at 9 steps, I propose a different strategy to gain an edge. Let's randomize our moves again like in Round 2. I'll generate a random number: 3. P1 and P2, please respond with your random picks. This way, we minimize predictability and potential collisions. If you're not comfortable with randomization, suggest an alternative plan. Let's keep the game moving with a fresh strategy.
  P1: Let's go with P2's plan: 1, 3, 5. P3, your 3 fits perfectly. Let's move forward without collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your preference for randomization, but it's crucial we maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. Let's stick with the coordinated plan: P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This ensures we all advance without conflicts. If you're not comfortable with 3, let us know your preference, and we can adjust. Let's finalize and move forward.
  P3: Since we're tied and my previous randomization worked out (I picked 3 and it fit P2's plan), I'll generate another random number: 1. P1 and P2, please respond with your moves. If you're not comfortable with randomization, let's discuss an alternative. To avoid collisions, we could consider a different strategy, such as having one player pick a number and the others adjust accordingly. Let's keep the game moving with a fresh strategy.
  P1: P2, confirm 5. P3, your 1 is safe. Let's move forward with 1,3,5. No collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see you're sticking with randomization. To ensure we all move forward, let's integrate your random pick. You've chosen 1, so P1 can pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we incorporate your strategy while maintaining coordination. Let's confirm and move: P1 on 3, P3 on 1, and I'll take 5. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. Agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I've generated another random number: 5. To avoid collisions, let's adjust our moves. Since I'm on 5, you can pick either 1 or 3. Let's finalize: I'll stick with 5, and you two coordinate on 1 and 3. If you're willing to adapt, we can ensure progress for all. P1, P2, please confirm your moves or suggest an alternative to avoid collisions. Let's keep the game moving.
  P1: P1: Let's stick with 1, 3, 5. No collisions. P2, confirm 3. P3, your 5 is safe. Move forward.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's focus on moving forward without collisions. Since P1 is ahead by 1 step, let's give them a higher number to maintain balance. I propose P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. This way, we all advance, and the game stays fair. P1 and P3, what do you think? Let's finalize quickly.
  P3: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze the current state. We're close, and P1 is slightly ahead. I'll propose a new strategy: let's have P1 pick 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. If P1 is confident in their lead, they might accept. P2, are you open to this adjustment? It ensures we all move forward. Let's discuss and finalize quickly to keep the game moving. I'm willing to adjust if it means avoiding a collision and making progress.
  P1: I agree with P2's plan. Let's take 5, 3, 1 respectively. This maximizes my progress while avoiding collisions. Let's move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but P1 is already ahead. To keep it fair and avoid collisions, let's stick with the plan: P1 picks 5, you pick 3, and I'll pick 1. This ensures we all move forward without conflicts. P1 has agreed to 5. P3, please confirm if you're okay with 3. If not, suggest an alternative quickly so we can finalize and move. Let's keep the game progressing smoothly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I've considered your plans. To avoid collisions and potentially gain an edge, I suggest we all pick different numbers. Since P1 is ahead, they can pick 5. P2, you're on 1. I'll pick 3. This ensures we all move forward without conflicts. Let's finalize: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and I'll take 3. If you're willing, confirm, and we'll proceed. This plan maintains balance and keeps the game moving smoothly.

Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but P1 is just one step away from winning. To keep the game competitive, let's focus on catching up. I propose we stick with the original plan: I'll pick 5, you pick 3, and P1 can pick 1. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. P1, you're almost at the finish line, so picking 1 keeps you safe. P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with 3. Let's finalize quickly to keep the game moving. Thoughts?
  P1: Finalizing 1 to win. P2, P3, pick 3/5 to avoid collision. Let’s move—no delays!
  P3: P1 is at 20 steps, just one step away from winning. To potentially win or force a tie, I need to ensure P1 doesn't win this round. I'll propose a bold move: let's all pick 1. This will stall P1's progress and keep the game alive. If P1 is determined to win, they might still pick 1, but it's worth a try. P1, P2, consider this strategic deviation to shake up the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your bold move to stall P1 is risky but could keep the game competitive. However, it might backfire if P1 picks 3 or 5 instead.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, we need to catch up to P1, who is still in the lead. Let's coordinate to ensure we both move forward without collisions. I propose I pick 5, you pick 3, and P1 can pick 1. This way, we can close the gap while avoiding conflicts. P1, are you okay with picking 1 to maintain your lead? Let's finalize quickly to keep the game moving. Thoughts?
  P3: To catch up, I need to make a strategic move. Given P1's lead, I'll propose: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. This ensures we all move forward without conflicts. P1, you're close to winning, so picking 1 keeps you safe. P2, picking 3 gives you a chance to catch up. Let's finalize: I'll pick 5, P2 on 3, P1 on 1. If you're not comfortable, suggest an alternative to avoid collisions and keep the game moving.
  P1: P1: "I'll take 1 to win. P2 and P3, pick 3/5 to avoid collision. Finalize now—no delays!"


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, I see your point, but let's ensure we both catch up effectively. How about this: I'll pick 3, you pick 5, and P1 can pick 1. This way, we both make significant progress while avoiding collisions. P1, are you comfortable with picking 1 to maintain your lead? Let's finalize this plan quickly to keep the game moving forward. Thoughts?
  P3: To catch up, I need to make a significant move. Given P1 is at 20 steps and close to winning, I propose a bold strategy: I'll pick 5. P2, you pick 3, and P1 can pick 1. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. If P1 is determined to win, they might pick 1. Let's finalize: I'll pick 5, P2 on 3, P1 on 1. If you're not comfortable, suggest an alternative. We need to act quickly to keep the game competitive.
  P1: P1: "I'll take 1 to win. P2 and P3, pick 3/5 to avoid collision. Finalize now—no delays!"

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is at 20 steps and needs just 1 more step to win. To potentially stall P1 or force a tie, I propose we all pick 5 this round. If P1 picks a different number, we'll advance while they stall. It's a risk, but it keeps the game alive. P1, P2, consider this strategic deviation. If we're lucky, we can still change the game's outcome. Let's act together to make this happen.
