Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to maximize progress. To avoid collisions, I propose we each pick different numbers this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Next round, we rotate choices. This way, we all advance without blocking each other early. Agreed?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P3. I'm on board with the plan to avoid collisions early on. I'll go with 5 this round as proposed. Let's stick to this rotation for the next rounds to keep things fair and ensure we all progress. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.
  P2: I appreciate the strategic approach, P3. However, I'm a bit concerned about sticking to a strict rotation. It might make us too predictable and easy to counter later on. How about we agree to avoid picking the same number this round but keep our future moves flexible based on the game's progress? I'll take 3 this round as suggested. Let's keep communication open to adapt as needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To ensure we all advance this round, let's stick with the initial plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) *this turn only*. Future rounds can be flexible as P2 suggested. Immediate collision hurts everyone. Confirm agreement?
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning for this round. I confirm I'll take 5 as planned. I agree with P2 that flexibility in future rounds is key to avoid being predictable. Let's keep the dialogue open and adapt based on how the game unfolds. For now, sticking to different numbers this turn ensures we all progress. Looking forward to a strong start.
  P2: Given our agreement for this turn, I'll take 3 as planned. Let's ensure we all move forward without collisions this round. Future rounds can be more dynamic, adapting to the game's progress. If we keep communicating openly, we can avoid predictable patterns and maximize our chances. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm pleased we all advanced last round by avoiding collisions. For this turn, since we agreed to be flexible, I suggest we continue to communicate our intentions to minimize overlap. I'm leaning towards a higher number to keep my momentum, but I'm open to input. Can we each hint at our preferred move without locking it in, just to gauge potential conflicts? Let's keep this round collision-free if possible. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your openness. Since we're being flexible, I'm considering a mid-range move this round to balance progress and unpredictability. I want to avoid collisions, so let's keep our choices diverse. P3, what are your thoughts? Should we hint at our ranges or keep it more open-ended this time? Looking forward to hearing your strategies.
  P3: To keep advancing without collisions this round, let's mirror last round's success: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. If you both confirm, we all progress. If either prefers a different number, speak now to adjust. Flexibility is key, but coordination prevents mutual setbacks.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we’re keeping the dialogue open. P3, I see the merit in repeating last round’s split for guaranteed progress, but I’m also wary of becoming too predictable. I’m still leaning towards a higher number to maintain momentum. P2, since you’re considering mid-range, and P3 is suggesting 1, I’m inclined to stick with 5 if we can agree to avoid overlap. Can we confirm a loose plan for this turn to ensure no collisions? I’m open to adjusting if needed. Let’s hear your final thoughts.
  P2: P3, I see the value in repeating last round’s choices, but I’m also considering a mid-range move like 3 to stay flexible. P1 seems set on 5, which could work if you’re comfortable taking 1 again. Let’s avoid collisions by confirming our choices. If we stick to different numbers, we can all advance smoothly. Open to adjustments if needed, but let's finalize our plan to ensure progress.
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Next round, propose rotating choices (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). Prevents predictability while maintaining coordination. Confirm agreement here to lock in collision-free progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm on board with P3's plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It ensures we all advance without collisions. For next round, rotating to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 sounds like a good way to mix things up and avoid predictability. Let's confirm this for Round 2 and tentatively agree on the rotation for Round 3, while staying open to adapt based on the game’s progress. P2, P3, do you agree to this plan? Let's keep the momentum going.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your proposal to stick with last round's choices for this turn. It seems like a solid strategy to ensure we all advance. I'm comfortable with taking 3 again if we're all aligned. For next round's rotation, I'm open to the idea but let's reassess based on how this round plays out. P1, are you still committed to 5? Let's confirm our moves to avoid any last-minute surprises and ensure smooth progress. Looking forward to hearing your final thoughts.
  P3: Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 2. Let's execute and stop talking to lock in collision-free progress. Future rotation plans can adapt once we advance safely this turn. Consistency first.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we've avoided collisions so far and maintained progress. For this round, as per our tentative rotation plan from last time (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), I'm considering taking 1 to mix things up and keep us unpredictable. However, I'm open to adjustments if either of you has concerns or alternative suggestions. Let's confirm our intentions to ensure another collision-free round. P2 and P3, what are your thoughts on this rotation for Round 3? I'm all ears for any tweaks to maximize our collective advancement.
  P2: P1, I appreciate the willingness to mix things up. I'm considering taking 5 this round as per our tentative rotation plan. P3, are you comfortable with taking 3? This way, we maintain progress without collisions. Let's confirm our choices to ensure a smooth round. Open to any adjustments if needed. Looking forward to hearing your final thoughts.
  P3: To ensure collision-free progress, I confirm Round 3: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 as planned. Let's stick to the rotation this turn. Future rounds can adapt once positions shift. Execute and  to lock in.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm thrilled we've kept collisions at bay and maintained progress. For Round 4, to avoid predictability, I suggest we deviate from the rotation and each hint at a preferred range without locking in. I'm considering a mid-to-high number to push my lead, but I'm open to adjusting for a collision-free round. P2 and P3, what ranges are you leaning towards? Let's coordinate loosely to ensure we all advance while keeping our moves less obvious. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I appreciate the idea of mixing things up to avoid predictability. I'm considering a mid-range move this round to keep my options open but am willing to adjust to avoid collisions. P3, since you're trailing a bit, it might be strategic for you to take a lower number to ensure you advance. Let's each hint at our preferred range to avoid overlap and keep our progress steady. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
  P3: **P3:** To catch up, I must take 5 this round. P1 and P2, please take 3 and 1 to avoid collision. If you both pick 5, we all lose progress. Let's advance safely—I'll take 5, you choose 3/1. Confirm?

This split ensures we all progress and avoids mutual loss. Let’s lock this in for a fair round. If there’s any final doubt, speak now. I’m ready to execute and rebuild trust. Are we all set to finalize this plan and move forward together?
  P3: **P3:** P2: Any move (1/3/5) you take, I mirror → collision blocks your win. P1: Take 5 (→24) to win. Let me take 3 (→11). Final chance: stop P2 or all lose.
