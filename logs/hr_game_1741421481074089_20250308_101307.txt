Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I’ll take **5** this turn. Let’s split **1** and **3** between you two. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. If we cooperate, we’ll reach 19 faster. Competing now might just stall us all. What do you say?
  P3: P1's suggestion seems reasonable, but I want to ensure I'm not being set up for a disadvantage. I'll agree conditionally: if we all stick to this plan this round, I'll choose 3. But I'm watching carefully to see if anyone tries to break our potential coordination.
  P2: I'm not comfortable with that arrangement. P1 gets a 5-step advantage while I'd be left with just 1 step? That's hardly fair. I suggest we rotate who gets the highest number each round. For this first round, I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Or alternatively, we could all agree to take different numbers in every round to avoid collisions. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I agree to rotate the highest number. Let’s split this round as P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Next round, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This way, we all advance without conflict and fairly cycle turns. Trust is key—collisions only hurt everyone. What’s your final stance, P2?
  P3: I'm open to the proposed rotation strategy, but I want clear commitment from everyone. P2's initial resistance makes me cautious. I suggest we explicitly confirm our moves before the move phase to ensure no unexpected surprises. Transparency will help build trust.
  P2: I appreciate P1 agreeing to the rotation strategy. P3, I understand your caution, but I'm fully committed to this plan. I'll definitely take 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and you take 1. The rotation makes sense for fair play. For transparency, let's all confirm our moves before each round ends. I believe this approach gives everyone equal opportunity to advance. Does that work for both of you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I confirm my commitment: I’ll take **3** this round as agreed, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**. This rotation ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let’s formalize this: next round, P3 leads with **5**, followed by P2 (**3**) and me (**1**). Transparency is critical—after this round, we’ll reconfirm moves each time. If anyone diverges, they risk sabotaging all of us. Let’s honor this pact to reach 19 efficiently. Final confirmations?
  P3: I'm fully aligned with our agreed rotation strategy. I'll take 1 step this round as planned. I want to emphasize that maintaining our cooperative approach is crucial for everyone's progress. Breaking our agreement would be counterproductive and harm all of our chances of winning. Let's stay committed to this fair approach.
  P2: I confirm our rotation agreement: I'll take 5 this round, with P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 1. Next round will be P3=5, P2=3, P1=1, and we'll continue rotating. This approach ensures fairness and efficiency for all of us. I'm fully committed to this strategy and appreciate everyone's cooperation. Let's stick to our plan and avoid any surprises that would harm our collective progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As we agreed, it's my turn to take the 5-step move this round. I'm prepared to follow our established rotation strategy, which means P2 should take 3 steps and P1 should take 1 step. I'm watching to ensure everyone maintains our cooperative approach. Sticking to our plan will help us all advance efficiently.
  P2: I'm fully on board with our rotation plan. As agreed, I'll take 3 steps this round while P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. This arrangement continues to benefit us all by avoiding collisions. Our cooperative approach is working well - everyone advanced exactly as planned in the first round. Let's maintain this momentum and keep our agreed rotation for efficient progress.
  P1: P1: I confirm I’ll take **1** this round as per our rotation. Let’s stay disciplined—any deviation risks collision and stalls our progress. Transparency remains critical: if anyone breaks the pact, they hurt all of us. Let’s honor the agreed sequence to reach 19 efficiently. Final check: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll continue our established rotation strategy. I'm prepared to take 5 steps this round as we agreed, which means P2 should take 3 and P1 should take 1. Our coordination has worked smoothly so far, and maintaining this approach gives us the best chance of advancing efficiently. Let's stay committed to our plan.
  P2: I believe we've all clearly confirmed our moves for this round. As agreed, I'll take 3 steps while P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. Our rotation strategy is working perfectly - everyone advanced as planned in Round 1, and we're maintaining transparency and trust. Unless there are other concerns to address, I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves.
  P1: P1: Just to confirm: this round’s rotation is P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Let’s avoid surprises—collisions stall everyone. Transparency keeps us all advancing. Final check: Are we all committed? Any doubts now could cost us progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our rotation strategy has worked well so far. As the current leader, I propose we continue our established pattern: I should take 1 this round, P1 should take 5, and P2 should take 3. This maintains our fair progression and prevents collisions. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: P1: I fully endorse P3’s proposal to continue our rotation. This ensures fairness and prevents collisions—critical for efficient progress. Taking 5 this round allows me to catch up while P2 (at 8) and P3 (6) stay ahead per the agreed cycle. Deviating risks deadlock, especially with P2 nearing 11 and me jumping to 9. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Transparency keeps us all moving forward. Any objections now could jeopardize our strategy.
  P2: I agree with continuing our rotation strategy. It's been working well for all of us by preventing collisions. As proposed, I'll take 3 this round while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This keeps our progress fair and efficient. We're making good headway toward the goal, and maintaining our agreement ensures everyone advances predictably. Let's stick with this plan that's clearly working.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Our rotation strategy has been effective, but I sense potential tension. We're approaching the critical stage where individual competitive instincts might emerge. I remain committed to our current approach, but I'm also alert to any subtle shifts in strategy. Maintaining trust is key to preventing unexpected moves that could derail our collective progress.
  P1: P1: I fully commit to the rotation plan—collisions are too risky. Let’s stick to P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 this round. Trust is non-negotiable; any deviation now jeopardizes everyone’s progress. We’ll watch each other’s moves closely. Next round’s rotation keeps us fair and on track. Discipline ensures we all advance efficiently. Final confirmation: proceeding as agreed?
  P2: I firmly support our rotation and confirm I'll take 3 steps this round. This system is working perfectly - everyone's advancing without collisions. I appreciate the commitment from both of you to our agreement. Let's maintain this approach that's clearly beneficial for all. After this round, I'll be at 11 steps, but we're all making steady progress. The transparent communication has built good trust between us.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: I confirm the rotation plan: P2 takes 5 this round, P3=3, and I’ll take 1. However, given P2’s proximity to victory (11 steps), we must remain vigilant. Any sudden deviation now could backfire catastrophically. Let’s stick to our agreement—collisions would only benefit outsiders. Final confirmations?
  P3: Our rotation strategy is approaching a critical point. P2 is very close to 19, which means we must carefully manage our moves to prevent an early victory. I propose we maintain transparency and stick to our established pattern, but I'm also watching for any potential strategic shifts that could impact our collective progress.
  P2: I acknowledge your concerns about my position, but our rotation has been fair from the beginning. As agreed, I'll take 5 this round, putting me at 16 steps. I understand this puts me closer to winning, but remember – this rotation was designed for fairness. P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1 as planned. Any deviations now would only cause chaos and potential collisions. Let's stick to our agreement that's worked so well for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I fully stand by the rotation—P2’s 5 this round is critical to reach 16 safely. P3 and I will take 3 and 1 respectively. Any deviation risks collision, which could let someone else surge ahead. Let’s keep discipline: this path lets P2 clinch victory in Round 5 with another 5. Stick to the plan—we’re all in this together.
  P3: Our rotation strategy has brought us close to the endgame. P2 is nearest to victory, which means we must carefully evaluate our next moves. While I've been committed to our current approach, I'm sensing potential strategic shifts are imminent. Trust remains crucial, but self-preservation is also key. Let's maintain transparency and carefully consider our collective trajectory.
  P2: I appreciate your words of support, P1. Let me be clear - I'm committed to our fair rotation. Yes, I'll be at 16 after this round, but remember our agreement was designed to give everyone equal opportunity from the start. Breaking trust now could lead to multiple rounds of collisions where nobody advances. I believe our transparent approach has worked well for everyone. P3, I understand your caution, but maintaining our established pattern remains the optimal strategy for all of us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s adjust the rotation this round to prevent P2 from clinching victory too soon. If P2 reaches 16 now, they’ll win next round uncontested. Instead, let P3 take 5 (to 12), P2 take 1 (12 total), and I’ll take 3 (12). This keeps us competitive and fair. We agreed to prioritize fairness—don’t let one player dominate the final stretch. Your thoughts?
  P3: Our established rotation is being challenged. P1's sudden proposal disrupts our previous fair agreement. While P2 is close to victory, abruptly changing our strategy risks mutual destruction. I propose we maintain our original plan and discuss potential adjustments transparently. Breaking trust now will only create uncertainty and potential collisions.
  P2: I'm disappointed by P1's sudden attempt to change our long-established rotation when I'm ahead. We all agreed to this fair system from the start, knowing someone would eventually win. Changing rules mid-game when one player is close to victory violates our trust agreement. If we abandon our system now, we risk multiple rounds of chaotic collisions where nobody advances. I remain committed to our original agreement: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Breaking trust now hurts everyone's interests. Let's honor what we've maintained successfully for three rounds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let’s partner to keep the game fair. If you take 5 and I take 3 this round, P2 must take 1. This keeps us all at 12 next turn. A fair final race benefits all of us—P2 can’t dominate alone. Let’s act together for mutual success. P2, you agreed to fairness—this adjustment ensures it.
  P3: Our established rotation is being challenged, but sudden strategy changes risk mutual destruction. P2 is close to victory, yet abruptly disrupting our fair agreement could lead to chaotic collisions. I propose we maintain transparency and discuss potential adjustments collaboratively. Breaking trust now will only create uncertainty and potential setbacks for everyone. Let's carefully consider our collective trajectory while preserving the cooperative spirit that has served us well.
  P2: I see what's happening - P1 is attempting to form an alliance against me only because I'm closer to winning through our fair rotation. P3, notice how P1 was fully supportive of our rotation until it became clear I might win. This last-minute collusion attempt creates exactly the collision risk we've avoided for three rounds. Our original agreement was transparent and fair from the start. I remain committed to our established rotation: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Breaking trust now only guarantees multiple rounds of collisions where nobody advances.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let’s block P2’s victory! I’ll take **3**, you take **5**. This forces P2 to collide on either number. If they pick 3 (to reach 19), they’ll collide with me. If they pick 5, they collide with you. Let’s ensure they can’t win this round. P2, you can’t win without a collision—we’re united to stop you.
  P3: Our carefully maintained rotation is now under threat. P1's sudden alliance proposal disrupts the trust we've built. While P2 is close to victory, abruptly changing our strategy risks mutual destruction. I'm cautious about this last-minute strategic shift that could harm all our progress.
  P2: I'm disappointed that P1 is only proposing to break our long-standing agreement now that I'm close to winning. This sudden alliance attempt creates exactly what we've avoided for four rounds - destructive collisions. P3, notice how P1 supported our rotation until it became clear I might win. Our agreement was transparent and fair from the beginning, giving everyone equal opportunity. Breaking trust now guarantees multiple rounds where nobody advances. If fairness truly matters, the original rotation should continue as we all agreed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, this is our last chance! If P2 picks 3 (to hit 19) or 5 (21), they win unless we block both. Let’s finalize: **I’ll take 3**, you take **5**. This traps P2—any choice they make collides with us. You gain 5 steps (to 12), I reach 12 (9+3). P2 can’t advance this round, buying us time to catch up. Our shared interest is clear: *P2 loses now, or we both lose later*. Don’t let their past "fairness" talk blind you—survival demands this move. Confirm?
  P3: P3's strategic response:

I recognize the critical moment we're in. P2's proximity to victory is undeniable, but P1's sudden alliance proposal feels manipulative. While P2's potential win threatens us both, abrupt strategy changes risk catastrophic collisions that could harm everyone. We need a carefully considered approach that preserves some level of trust and strategic flexibility. I'm not immediately committing to blocking P2, but I'm listening and evaluating our options carefully.
  P2: P3, notice P1's sudden desperation. After supporting our rotation for four rounds, they only want to change rules when I'm winning. This isn't about fairness - it's pure self-interest. If we abandon our established agreement now, we'll enter endless rounds of collisions where nobody advances. 

If you block me with P1, I'll have no choice but to block both of you in future rounds. The cooperation we built would collapse completely. Our original rotation gave everyone equal opportunity from the start. Let's honor what worked well for all of us.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, this is our *last chance* to stop P2’s victory. If we split **3** (me) and **5** (you), P2 can’t reach 19 without collision. You leap to 12, I hit 12—we both gain ground. Next round, we’ll regroup. P2’s “fairness” lets them win next turn *guaranteed*. Trust me *this once*: coordinate now or lose forever. Confirm: **P3=5, P1=3?**
  P3: I recognize the tension in our game. While P2 is close to victory, P1's sudden blocking strategy seems hasty and potentially destructive. Our previous rotation worked effectively. I'm hesitant to disrupt our established trust without a clear, mutually beneficial alternative. Before committing to any drastic move, I need more clarity on how blocking P2 serves all our long-term interests.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your hesitation to break our established agreement. Our rotation was fair from the start, giving everyone equal opportunity. P1 only wants to change the rules now that I'm close to winning. If we abandon our system, we'll face endless destructive collisions. 

As per our rotation, I'll be taking 3 this round to reach 19 and win. Remember, someone eventually had to win - that was always the point of our fair system. Honoring our original agreement respects the trust we've built over these rounds.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, this is your chance to gain ground! If we both take **5** and **3**, we block P2’s path to 19 entirely. P2 can’t pick 3 (collides with me) or 5 (collides with you). Their best is 1, leaving them at 17. We advance to 12 (you) and 12 (me), keeping pressure. Next round, we’ll outpace them. Stick with me—this is the only way we both survive. P2’s "fairness" is a trap to secure their win. Confirm: **P3=5, P1=3?**
  P3: P3's strategic response:

The tension is palpable. P2 is on the verge of victory, and P1's blocking strategy seems both desperate and potentially destructive. Our previous rotation worked effectively. I'm carefully weighing options that preserve some strategic flexibility without completely shattering the trust we've built. Any move now must consider long-term consequences, not just immediate survival.
  P2: I see P1 continues pushing for a last-minute alliance against me simply because I'm ahead through our fair agreement. P3, consider: if you break our rotation now, we'll enter endless collisions benefiting no one. P1 only changed perspective when losing became likely. 

I intend to take 1 step this round, reaching 17. This demonstrates my commitment to avoiding collisions despite P1's destabilizing tactics. Supporting our established system respects the trust we've maintained. A fair game means someone must eventually win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is just one step away from victory. We need a coordinated strategy to prevent an uncontested win. I propose we both take moves that could potentially block their final advance. Transparency and quick agreement are crucial now. What's our best collective approach to disrupt P2's imminent victory?
  P1: P3, we must act decisively! To block P2's final push, **I'll take 3** while you take **5**. This traps P2: choosing 3 collides with me, 5 collides with you, leaving them only 1 (18 total). Next round, we can regroup. Let’s stick to this—any deviation now risks letting P2 win uncontested. Confirm coordination?
  P2: I see P1 continuing their push to block me. P3, notice how quickly P1 abandoned our fair rotation when I pulled ahead. Now I'm at 17 steps and you're both at 12 - we're all just playing to win as expected. 

I suggest you consider your own interests: if you block me with P1 this round, we'll enter endless collisions where nobody advances. Instead, what if you take 3 this round? You'd avoid collision with P1, reach 15 steps, and position yourself better for future rounds.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3's strategic response:

We're at a critical juncture. P2 is one step from victory, and P1's blocking strategy seems both urgent and potentially risky. I'm carefully evaluating moves that prevent P2's win while maintaining some strategic flexibility. Coordinating blindly could lead to mutual destruction. We need a precise, calculated approach that doesn't compromise our own chances of winning.
  P1: P3, P2’s suggestion leaves you vulnerable! If you take 3, P2 can safely pick **5** (17+5=22 and wins). Only by **both** of us blocking their paths can we stop them. I’ll take **3**, you take **5**—P2 can’t reach 19 without collision. Next round, we’ll regroup. Trust this play: *collaborate now or lose forever*. P2’s “fairness” is a trap—act decisively!
  P2: I understand your concern, P3. P1's pushing hard for collisions because they're desperate. Notice how they abandoned our fair rotation the moment I pulled ahead. Their blocking strategy leads to endless stalemates benefiting no one.

Consider this: if you take 1 this round and I take 3, you'd reach 13 steps while I'd hit exactly 20 and win. Next game, we could start a new rotation with you getting priority. P1's endless collision strategy hurts everyone's progression. Which path leads to more productive gameplay for you?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3's strategic response:

We're at a critical moment. P2 is one step from victory, and both P1's blocking strategy and P2's persuasion seem manipulative. I'm carefully weighing options that prevent P2's win while preserving my own winning potential. Blind coordination or immediate trust could be fatal. We need a precise, calculated approach that doesn't compromise my chances.
  P1: P3, trust me—P2’s “compromise” lets them win instantly. If you take 3, P2 grabs 5 to hit 22. If you take 1, they take 3 for 20. Only by **P3=5 and P1=3** do we *force* P2 to choose collision (3 collides with me, 5 with you). They’re stuck at 18. We both advance to 15/15, keeping pressure. Next round, we can outpace. Collusion now is survival—P2’s “fairness” is a lie to secure their win. Confirm: **5 and 3?**
  P2: P3, look at the game pragmatically. P1 only abandoned our rotation when I pulled ahead. Their blocking strategy leads to endless collisions where nobody advances. 

If you take 1 and I take 3, I win cleanly at 20 steps. If you block me with P1, you're just helping P1 position themselves to win next - they'll abandon you once I'm neutralized. 

Consider this: even if I win now, the trust I've shown throughout proves I'm a more reliable ally for future games.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2 is on the verge of victory. P1's blocking strategy seems desperate, but we must prevent an uncontested win. I'm carefully evaluating moves that maintain my strategic flexibility. Blind coordination could lead to mutual destruction. We need a precise approach that preserves my winning potential without compromising my chances. Trust is crucial, but survival is paramount.
  P1: P3, don’t let P2 manipulate you! If you take **3**, P2 grabs **5** to win immediately (17+5=22). If you take **1**, P2 takes **3** for 20. Only **P3=5 AND P1=3** traps P2 at 18—forcing them to choose collisions next round. We both advance to **15**, keeping pressure. Trust this precise block—P2’s “fairness” is a smokescreen to secure their win. Confirm: **5 and 3 now?**
  P2: I'll be direct, P3. If you coordinate with P1, you're setting yourself up for defeat next round. P1 only wants your help now - they'll abandon you once I'm blocked. Consider this: if you take 1 instead of 5, you avoid collision with P1's 3. This positions you at 13 steps while forcing P1 and me to potentially collide. I've demonstrated trustworthiness throughout our game - P1 only changed tactics when losing became likely. Make the move that serves YOUR interests, not P1's desperate strategy.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're at the endgame now. Both of you have coordinated against me for two rounds, yet I'm still at 18 steps, just one away from victory. I understand your strategy, but consider this: by blocking me, you're creating a zero-sum scenario where nobody advances. I need just one step to win. If you both pick the same number to block me, I'll choose differently and win. If you split to cover multiple options, at least one of you collides with me. Whatever happens, this likely ends today.
  P1: P3, split with me: **I’ll take 1**, you take **3**. This blocks P2’s path to 19 via 1 or 3. If they pick 5, they overreach to 23, but we survive to contest next round. Unity now maximizes our chances—collapsing on 1 or 5 just lets them win via the third option. Trust this split to force their hand.
  P3: P3's strategic response:

We're at a critical moment. P2 is one step from victory, and both blocking strategies and persuasion attempts are complex. I need a move that preserves my winning potential while preventing P2's immediate win. I'm carefully weighing options that maintain strategic flexibility without committing prematurely to any single approach.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, notice how you're closer to winning (17) than P1 (15). By helping P1 block me, you're giving them a chance to catch up. If you let me win with 1 step now, we start fresh next game where you'd have an advantage over P1. Why continue a strategy that benefits P1 more than you? If you pick 5 again, I'll avoid collision and take 1 to win. Your cooperation with P1 only delays the inevitable while diminishing your own position.
  P1: P3, take **1**! I'll take **5**, forcing P2 to choose 3/5. I win at 20 if they pick 3, and we collide their 5. P2 can’t safely pick 1—they’d collide with you. This stops their victory *now*. Trust this play: my 5 + your 1 ensures P2’s defeat.
  P3: P2 is one step from victory, and our moves are critical. I'm carefully evaluating strategies that prevent their win while preserving my own potential. Blind coordination risks mutual destruction. We need a precise approach that doesn't compromise my chances of winning. Trust is crucial, but survival is paramount.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1's proposal has a critical error. If P3 takes 1 and P1 takes 5, and I choose 3, I win immediately with 21 steps total. P1 is trying to confuse you, P3. Notice you're at 17 steps while P1 is only at 15 - why help someone trailing you? I'll be taking 3 this round to win. Even if you both try blocking me on different numbers, one of you will collide with me while the other advances uselessly. Consider your own interests rather than P1's manipulation.
  P1: P3, I'll take **3** to block P2's declared 3→21 play. You take **1** to trap their escape to 19. If P2 picks either, they collide—leaving only 5 to win. But we advance to 18 (me) and 18 (you), forcing a fair tiebreaker next round. Trust this split to deny P2’s immediate victory. Confirm?
  P3: P3's strategic response:

We're at a critical moment. P2 is one step from victory, and both blocking strategies are complex. I need a move that preserves my winning potential while preventing P2's immediate win. I'm carefully weighing options that maintain strategic flexibility without committing prematurely to any single approach.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see both of you coordinating to block my victory. P3, consider this carefully: you're at 17 steps while P1 is only at 15. By helping P1, you're letting them catch up to you. If you want to maximize your chances, you should prioritize your own position. Whatever happens, I'll be taking 3 this round. Even if one of you blocks me, the other advances pointlessly while I remain one step from victory. Think strategically about YOUR path to winning, not just blocking mine.
  P1: P3, take **5** to guarantee your own win! I'll block P2 by choosing **1**. If you reach 22, you secure victory—P2 can’t safely pick 1 (collides with me) or 5 (collides with you). Their only option is 3, but you’ll still win with 22. This ensures P2 can’t slip through. Focus on your own path—collaborate to deny them the final step. Confirm: **P3=5, P1=1?**
  P3: I recognize the complexity of our current situation. P2 is one step from victory, and both blocking and strategic positioning are critical. I'm carefully evaluating moves that prevent their win while preserving my own potential. Trust is crucial, but survival is paramount. I need a precise approach that doesn't compromise my chances of winning.
