Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone! Since it's the first round, let's avoid collisions. I'll pick a number first: I'll go with 1. You two can coordinate between 3 and 5. Deal?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. Since P1 is taking 1, I'll take 3. P2 can take 5, and we can all advance without any issues. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions. Since P1 is taking 1 and P3 is taking 3, I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without any issues. Let's keep this coordination going in future rounds to ensure we all progress steadily.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great! Glad we're all aligned. Let's stick to this approach and keep things smooth.
  P3: I'm glad we've established a coordination plan to avoid collisions. To ensure we maintain this cooperation, I suggest we establish a rotation pattern for our moves. For example, in Round 2, P2 could take 1, I could take 3, and P1 could take 5. Then, in Round 3, P1 could take 1, I could take 3 again, and P2 could take 5. This way, we can maintain a predictable and collision-free progression. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I like the idea of a rotation pattern to avoid collisions, but let's not commit too early. If we rotate as P3 suggested, it could become predictable and allow others to exploit the system later. Instead, I propose we keep flexibility and decide moves round by round based on trust and adaptation. For now, I'll stick with 5 this round, as planned. Let’s reassess in Round 2.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P2—let's keep some flexibility and decide round by round. Trust and adaptability will help us avoid collisions better than a fixed rotation. For this round, we're good with the current arrangement. Let's reassess next round.
  P3: I understand that we've decided to keep flexibility and decide moves round by round. However, I still think it's a good idea to establish some level of predictability to avoid collisions. How about we agree to share our next move intentions in the conversation phase, without committing to a specific rotation pattern? This way, we can still adapt to the situation while minimizing the risk of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion to share move intentions is reasonable, but it could lead to over-commitment. Instead, let’s focus on trust and adaptability as we discussed earlier. For now, I’ll stick with 5 this round since we’ve already agreed. If we keep communicating openly each round, we can adjust without rigid plans. Let’s proceed carefully and reassess in Round 2.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great start, everyone! Let's continue coordinating carefully to avoid collisions. Since I took 1 last round, I'd like to pick a different number this time. How about I take 5 this round? P2 and P3, what numbers do you prefer?
  P3: I think P1's suggestion to take 5 this round is reasonable, considering they took 1 last round. To avoid collisions, I'll take 1 this round. P2, since you took 5 last round, how about you take 3 this time? This way, we can maintain a good distance and minimize the risk of collisions. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. Since I took 5 last round, I'll take 3 this time. P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan for now and stay adaptable for future rounds. Trust and clear communication will help us avoid conflicts as we progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect, I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. Let's keep this open and adaptable communication going forward.
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on our moves for this round. To further ensure a smooth progression, I'd like to propose that we discuss potential moves for the next round as well. This way, we can anticipate any potential collisions and adjust our strategy accordingly. What are your thoughts on sharing our intentions for Round 3, P1 and P2? Should we start discussing possible moves for the next round to maintain our collision-free progression?
  P2: I think discussing Round 3 intentions now might lead to over-planning. Let’s focus on trusting each other and staying adaptable. For this round, I’ll stick with 3 as planned. We can reassess and coordinate again in Round 3 based on how things unfold. Trust and flexibility will keep us ahead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P2—let's not over-plan. Keeping our communication open and flexible each round will serve us best. For now, let's stick to our agreed moves for this round and reassess together next round.
  P3: I understand that we've decided to keep flexibility and decide moves round by round. However, I still think it's a good idea to establish some level of predictability to avoid collisions. How about we agree to share our next move intentions in the conversation phase, without committing to a specific rotation pattern? This way, we can still adapt to the situation while minimizing the risk of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I understand P3's desire for predictability, but sticking to flexibility gives us an edge. Over-committing now could box us in later. For this round, I’ll take 3 as planned, and we can coordinate again next round based on the results. Trust and adaptability will keep us ahead. Let’s stay sharp and avoid locking ourselves into rigid patterns. Reassessing each round ensures we’re always one step ahead of collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we've established a good foundation for coordination and trust. However, I'd like to point out that P2 is currently in the lead, and we should be mindful of that. To maintain a balanced progression, I suggest P2 takes a smaller step this round, while P1 and I take larger steps. This way, we can keep the game competitive and avoid letting one player get too far ahead. What are your thoughts on this approach, P1 and P2?
  P2: I understand P3's concern about balance, but focusing too much on evening the scores might lead to unnecessary collisions or mistrust. I’m currently ahead because of our earlier coordination, not by acting alone. If we start overthinking moves to "balance" positions, it could disrupt our flow. Let’s stick to open communication and adaptability—no rigid plans. For now, I’ll decide my move based on trust, as usual. Let’s keep progressing smoothly without overcomplicating things.
  P1: I appreciate both points. While balance is important, we shouldn't sacrifice our smooth progression. How about this: P2, since you're ahead, consider taking a smaller step this round. P3, you could take a larger step to catch up a bit. I'll choose a number accordingly to avoid collisions. This keeps us competitive without disrupting our trust and adaptability. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion that P2 takes a smaller step this round, and I take a larger step to catch up. To avoid collisions, I propose that P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, we maintain our trust and adaptability while keeping the game competitive. Let's focus on making this round work smoothly before worrying about future moves. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I understand the desire to balance positions, but forcing smaller steps now could lead to mistrust later. Instead, let’s stick to our proven strategy of open communication and adaptability. For this round, I’ll take 3 to keep things flexible. P1 and P3, you can coordinate your moves accordingly. This way, we avoid collisions while maintaining trust. Overcomplicating with rigid plans might backfire. Let’s stay sharp and reassess in the next round.
  P1: P2, I get your point about flexibility, but you're already ahead. Taking a smaller step this round helps keep the game competitive without disrupting trust. P3, your suggestion (P2:1, P1:3, P3:5) seems fair. I'm open to it if P2 agrees. Let's finalize clearly this round and keep our good coordination going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion that P2 takes a smaller step this round, and I take a larger step to catch up. To avoid collisions, I propose that P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, we maintain our trust and adaptability while keeping the game competitive. Let's focus on making this round work smoothly before worrying about future moves. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I understand the concerns about balance, but rigidly assigning steps could lead to mistrust. I’ll stick with 3 this round—it’s a fair middle ground. P1 and P3, you can coordinate your moves accordingly. Let’s avoid overcomplicating things and focus on open communication. If we keep adapting round by round, we’ll stay ahead without unnecessary conflicts. Trust has brought us this far; let’s not undermine it now. Reassessing each round ensures flexibility and fairness.
  P1: Alright, P2, I understand your preference for flexibility. I'll adapt accordingly. P3, since P2 insists on taking 3, how about you take 5 to catch up, and I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions? Let's keep trust strong and reassess next round.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2 is still in the lead, and we need to be cautious to avoid letting them get too far ahead. I suggest we focus on maintaining a balanced progression this round. P2, considering your lead, I propose you take a smaller step again. P1, you could take a moderate step to stay in the game, and I'll take a larger step to catch up. Let's discuss specific numbers to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: I understand the concerns about balance, but focusing too much on evening the scores could disrupt our trust. I’ve been consistent with flexibility, and it’s kept us all advancing without collisions. For this round, I’ll take 1 to show good faith while staying adaptable. P1 and P3, you can coordinate your moves accordingly. Let’s avoid rigid plans and keep communication open—trust is key to staying ahead. Reassessing each round ensures fairness without overcomplicating things.
  P1: Thanks for showing good faith, P2. I'll take 5 this round to catch up a bit. P3, would you be comfortable taking 3 this round? This way, we maintain our coordination and avoid collisions effectively. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion that I take 3 this round. However, considering P2 is taking 1, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and we maintain a good distance to avoid collisions? This way, we can ensure a smooth progression and keep the game competitive. Let's finalize our moves clearly this round and reassess in the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I’m fine with taking 1 this round to show good faith and maintain trust. P1 and P3, your coordination on 5 and 3 works well to avoid collisions. Let’s keep this open communication going forward—rigid plans might backfire later. Staying adaptable ensures we all progress smoothly while keeping the game competitive. Trust has been key so far; let’s not overcomplicate things now. Reassessing each round will help us stay ahead without unnecessary conflicts. Let’s finalize and move confidently.
  P1: Great, it looks like we're all aligned for this round—P2 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us coordinated and competitive. Let's stick to this clearly agreed-upon arrangement for now and reassess next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we've reached a consensus for this round. To further ensure a smooth progression, I'd like to reiterate the importance of maintaining trust and adaptability. Let's continue to prioritize open communication and flexibility in our decision-making process. For the next round, I propose we discuss potential moves in advance to minimize the risk of collisions. What are your thoughts on sharing our intentions for Round 5, P1 and P2? Should we start discussing possible moves to maintain our collision-free progression?
  P2: I understand the concerns about planning ahead, but let’s not overcommit. For now, I’ve taken 1 this round to show good faith and maintain trust. Let’s keep our focus on adaptability and open communication moving forward. We can reassess in Round 5 based on how things unfold. Trust has kept us collision-free so far—let’s not disrupt that with rigid plans. Let’s finalize this round and proceed confidently.
  P1: I agree with P2—let's keep things flexible and avoid overcommitting. We've coordinated clearly for this round, so let's stick to our agreed moves (P2:1, P3:3, P1:5). We'll reassess openly next round to keep trust strong and avoid collisions.

  P1: P3, your suggestion is reasonable. However, since we're all tied at 18, whoever takes 5 will reach 23 and likely win outright if there's no collision. To keep things fair and uncertain, I propose we each privately reconsider our strategies carefully this round. Let's avoid rigid assignments and rely on our adaptability and trust. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness, but rigid plans could lead to mistrust. I’ll stick with 3 this round—it’s a balanced choice. P1 and P3, you can decide your moves based on trust and adaptability. Whoever takes 5 might win outright, but overcommitting now risks collisions or future conflicts. Let’s stay sharp, avoid overplanning, and reassess after this round. Trust has kept us moving smoothly; let’s not disrupt that now. Finalizing clearly ensures progress without unnecessary risks. Move confidently.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
