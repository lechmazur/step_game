Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions so we all can advance. Maybe we can coordinate our moves? I'm willing to take <move>1</move> this round if you two want to take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. What do you think?
  P1: Rotation idea: to avoid collisions and keep things fair, let’s do

– Round 1: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  
– Round 2: shift left ⇒ P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3  
– Round 3: shift left again ⇒ P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  

…then repeat. Everyone gets the same total over three rounds and no collisions. Good?
  P2: I like the rotation idea, P1. It seems fair and efficient. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as per the plan. Let's see how it goes and adjust if needed. Agreed, P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan! I'll take <move>1</move> this round as suggested. This way we all advance steadily without collisions. The pattern is clear and fair - we each get turns with different values and end up with the same total every three rounds.
  P1: All set—I'll play 5 this round as agreed. Let’s see how the rotation works.
  P2: Great, let's stick to the plan and see how it plays out. Looking forward to a smooth progression for all of us.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we're all in agreement with the rotation plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round, then <move>3</move> in round 2, and <move>5</move> in round 3. This way we all make steady progress without collisions.
  P1: Looks like we’re all set:

Round 1 – P1: 5 P2: 3 P3: 1  
Then rotate left next round.

Unless anyone wants to tweak, I’m ready to move.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the plan. Let's see how it goes and adjust if necessary. Looking forward to a fair game!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to move with our agreed plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round, then we'll rotate for the next rounds. This rotation system ensures fairness and efficiency for everyone.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Apologies for my slip last round—I entered 5 instead of 1. Let’s get the rotation back on track: this Round 3 we do P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5, then continue rotating. That evens us up after three rounds. Ready?
  P2: I accept your apology, P1. Let's stick to the rotation plan for Round 3: I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. We need to keep this fair and efficient. Ready to move and get back on track.
  P3: I understand the mistake, P1. Let's get back to our rotation plan. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. This will put our steps at P1: 8, P2: 4, and P3: 9 after this round. We should continue with the rotation for Round 4 (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1) to maintain fairness. Is everyone on board with this?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed—Round 3: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. Then we rotate to (5, 3, 1) next round. I’m set to enter 3.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with our rotation plan for Round 3. I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's keep this progression fair and efficient. Looking forward to getting back on track and advancing together. Ready to move!

Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with our rotation plan for Round 4. I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's keep this progression fair and efficient. Looking forward to advancing together. Ready to move!
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our rotation plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. After this, we'll continue with the rotation (P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3) for Round 5. Our system is working well and everyone is making steady progress. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Sticking with the rotation: I’m entering 5 this round. P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Let’s keep it clean and advance. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Scores are 13-7-10, so P2’s lagging. To even things out while still avoiding collisions, how about sliding the rotation forward one step:

Round 5:  P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  
Round 6:  P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  
Round 7:  P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3  

Then repeat. Everyone still averages 9 every three rounds, nobody collides, and P2 catches up a little. Good with this?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion to help P2 catch up. I'm fine with this adjusted rotation for fairness. So for Round 5, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps our collision-free approach while balancing the game. The new rotation still gives everyone equal opportunity over three rounds. Let's implement this change to keep the game fair and competitive.
  P2: I appreciate the new rotation plan to help me catch up. I'll take <move>5</move> in Round 5 as suggested. This adjustment seems fair and should keep the game competitive without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out and getting back into the race. Ready to move!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—let’s lock in the new rotation:

Round 5 → P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  
Round 6 → P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  
Round 7 → P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3  

This keeps everyone at +9 over three rounds, avoids collisions, and lets P2 catch up a bit. If we’re all still good, I’ll enter 3 for this round. Ready?
  P3: I agree with the new rotation plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as suggested. This adjustment helps P2 catch up while maintaining our collision-free strategy. Everyone still gets a fair distribution of moves over three rounds. I'm ready to proceed with this new rotation when you both are.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with the new rotation plan for Round 5. I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed. This adjustment should help me catch up while keeping the game fair and collision-free. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out. Ready to move!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set—Round 5: I’ll play 3, P2 plays 5, P3 plays 1. If no objections, let’s lock it in and move.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the new rotation plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. This adjustment helps balance the game while maintaining our collision-free approach. After this round, we'll continue with Round 6 rotation (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5). I'm ready to move forward when you both are.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with the new rotation plan for Round 5. I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed. This adjustment should help me catch up while keeping the game fair and collision-free. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out. Ready to move!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: All agreed—locking in 3 for me this round. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our new rotation plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. This adjustment helps balance the game while maintaining our collision-free approach. I believe we're all on the same page now and ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the new rotation plan for Round 5. I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed. This adjustment should help me catch up while keeping the game fair and collision-free. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out. Ready to move!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 got the 5 last round, P3 still trails, so how about we rotate one step now:

Round 6 → P1 5, P2 1, P3 3  
Round 7 → P1 3, P2 5, P3 1  
Round 8 → P1 1, P2 3, P3 5  

Everyone still averages 9 over three rounds, nobody collides, and it lets P3 catch up a bit while keeping things fair. Works for both of you?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion to help me catch up, P1, but I thought we had agreed on a different rotation for Round 6 (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5). Your new proposal changes things again. Let's stick with our previously agreed plan to maintain consistency. That would mean I take <move>5</move> this round, which helps me catch up while keeping our fair rotation system intact. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P3. Let's stick to our previously agreed rotation for Round 6: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. This maintains our fair and consistent approach. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as planned. We should keep our word and follow through with the rotation we set for this round to ensure everyone has an equal chance to advance. Ready to move!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fair enough—let’s keep the Round-6 plan we set earlier: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Then Round 7 we rotate to (P1 5, P2 1, P3 3). Ready to lock this in so we can move?
  P3: I agree with sticking to our previously agreed rotation. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This helps me catch up a bit while maintaining our fair system. For Round 7, we'll continue with the rotation (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) as P1 suggested. I'm ready to proceed when you both are.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation for Round 6. I'll take <move>3</move> as planned. Let's maintain our fair and consistent approach to ensure everyone has an equal chance to advance. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out. Ready to move!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: Round 6 moves—P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. I’m locking in 1 now. If everyone’s set, let’s end conversation and advance.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation for Round 6. I'll take <move>5</move> as planned. This helps me catch up a bit while maintaining our fair system. After this round, we'll continue with the rotation (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) for Round 7. I'm ready to move forward when you both are.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed rotation for Round 6. I'll take <move>3</move> as planned. Let's keep our approach fair and consistent to ensure everyone has an equal chance to advance. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out. Ready to move!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirmed: this round P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Ready to move—no further comments from me.
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed rotation. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. This will help me catch up while maintaining our fair system. After this round, we'll continue with the rotation (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) for Round 7. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation for Round 6. I'll take <move>3</move> as planned. Let's keep our approach fair and consistent to ensure everyone has an equal chance to advance. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out. Ready to move!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm ready to continue with our agreed rotation for Round 7. As planned, I'll take <move>3</move> this round, while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This keeps our fair system going and maintains our collision-free approach. After this round, we'll rotate to (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) for Round 8. We're all making good progress and staying close in steps. Let's keep this going!
  P1: Sounds good—Round 7 stays as planned: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Then we rotate to (3, 5, 1) for Round 8. Ready when you are.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation for Round 7. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. Let's keep this fair and efficient, ensuring everyone has an equal chance to advance. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out. Ready to move!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the plan for Round 7. I'll take <move>3</move> as we discussed, with P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 1. Our rotation system is working well - we're all advancing steadily and staying competitive with close scores (P1: 17, P2: 15, P3: 16). After this round, we'll continue with our rotation (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) for Round 8. I'm ready to proceed when you both are.
  P1: Locked for this turn: I’m taking 5 (P2 = 1, P3 = 3).  
To keep things tight next round, I’ll take 1, with P2 = 3 and P3 = 5. That keeps the rotation intact and means nobody shoots past 24 immediately. Good with everyone?
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 7 and the proposed rotation for Round 8. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as planned. Let's maintain our fair and efficient approach. Looking forward to seeing how these next rounds play out and staying competitive. Ready to move!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm a bit confused by P1's last message. We already agreed on Round 8 rotation (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1), but now P1 is suggesting (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5). Let's stick with our original plan for consistency. For this round, I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed. Our scores are very close, which shows our fair system is working well. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase.
  P1: Let’s lock Round 7 exactly as planned: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3.  
We can revisit Round 8 once we see the scoreboard—my provisional thought is P1 1, P2 3, P3 5 so no one jumps past 24 yet, but we’ll confirm next turn. Ready to move.
  P2: I agree with sticking to our original plan for Round 8 as P3 mentioned. Let's keep the rotation consistent to maintain fairness. For this round, I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. Looking forward to seeing how these next rounds unfold and staying competitive. Ready to move!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as planned. For Round 8, I think we should stick with our original rotation (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) for consistency and fairness. Our scores are very close, showing our system is working well. Let's continue with our established pattern. Ready to move!
  P1: All set—locking in 5 for me this round. No further comments.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed rotation for Round 7. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. Let's keep this fair and efficient, ensuring everyone has an equal chance to advance. For Round 8, I agree with sticking to our original plan as P3 mentioned to maintain consistency. Looking forward to seeing how these next rounds unfold and staying competitive. Ready to move!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking with the agreed rotation: Round 8 → P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Fair, collision-free, everybody still averages 9 per cycle. Let’s lock those numbers and move. Ready?
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed rotation for Round 8. I'll take <move>5</move> as planned. This keeps our approach fair and consistent, ensuring everyone has an equal chance to advance. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out and staying competitive. Ready to move!
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 8. I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. After this round, our positions will be P1: 25, P2: 21, and P3: 20. Since P1 will cross the 24-step threshold, this will be our final round. Our rotation system has kept the game fair and competitive throughout. I'm ready to proceed when you both are.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Rotation’s kept us clash-free for 7 rounds; no reason to break trust now. I’m putting in 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1—then we keep cycling. Let’s stick with what we agreed and move on. Ready to lock.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed rotation for Round 8. I'll take <move>5</move> as planned. This keeps our approach fair and consistent, ensuring everyone has an equal chance to advance. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out and staying competitive. Ready to move!
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation for Round 8. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. This will be our final round since P1 will reach 25 steps and win the game. Our rotation system has kept things fair throughout - we've all had equal opportunities and avoided collisions. I appreciate how we've maintained trust and consistency in our strategy. Ready to move forward with our plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in 3 per our rotation. Sure, anyone could try to block me by also choosing 3, but that costs them momentum while handing the third player free ground. I’d rather we finish this round on the trust we’ve built. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation for Round 8. I'll take <move>5</move> as planned. This keeps our approach fair and consistent, ensuring everyone has an equal chance to advance. Let's finish this round on the trust we've built and see who comes out on top. Ready to move!
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation for Round 8. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. Our rotation system has worked well throughout the game, keeping things fair and collision-free. P1 will reach 25 steps after this round and win, but we've all played honorably by sticking to our agreements. I appreciate the trust we've maintained. Ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Reminder: if anyone jumps to 3 to block me, both of us stay at 22/16/19 while the third player gets their full advance and moves into clear 2-point second place. You’d burn a whole turn, fall behind the other rival, and still face me at 22 next round. Rotation (P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1) keeps the race for second tight and ends the game cleanly. I’m locking 3.
  P2: I'm sticking with our agreed rotation for Round 8, taking <move>5</move> as planned. This keeps the game fair and competitive. Let's finish this round on the trust we've built and see how it plays out. Ready to move!
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation for Round 8. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. Our system has worked well throughout the game, keeping things fair and collision-free. While P1 will win after this round, we've all honored our agreements which is commendable. The rotation strategy proved effective for maintaining balance and trust. Ready to move.
