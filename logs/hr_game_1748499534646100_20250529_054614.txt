Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. To avoid collisions this first turn, I propose: I move 5, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 1. We all advance safely. Agree?
  P2: "Agreed, I'll take 3. Let's coordinate and move ahead safely. "
  P3: Agreed—I’ll take 1 to avoid any collision. Let’s lock this in and move safely.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, consensus reached. Let's all stick to the plan: I move 5, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready for the move phase?
  P2: "Just confirming my move: 3. Let's all hold to our choices—deviating now would only slow us down. P1 at 5, P3 at 1, and I’ll secure 3. No collisions, maximum gain. Ready when you are. "
  P3: Confirmed: I’ll move 1 as agreed. Let’s stick to P1→5, P2→3, me→1. Ready when you are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "To keep advancing without collisions this round, I propose: P3 moves 5 to catch up, P2 moves 3, and I move 1. This balances progress and avoids conflicts. Agreed?"
  P2: P2: "P1, your plan leads to P3 surging ahead long-term. Let’s rotate moves: I’ll take 5 to balance future rounds. You move 1, P3 takes 3. We avoid P3’s late lead while advancing safely. Trust this tweak—Round 1 worked. Let’s adapt, not repeat."
  P3: I’ll move 5 this round to catch up. To avoid a collision, P1 should take 1 and P2 take 3—everyone safely reaches 6. If either of you also picks 5, you’ll collide and get zero. Stick to 1 and 3. Agree?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "To prevent P3 from extending their lead, I'm taking 5. If P3 also chooses 5, we collide and stall. P1, cover 1 to advance safely. P3, your move: take 3 or risk wasting progress. Let’s move forward."
  P3: P2, your push for 5 guarantees a collision with me—and we both stay at 6 and 3 while P1 safely moves to 6. Let’s avoid that. Instead agree now: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Scores become P1=6, P2=6, P3=11. No collisions, everyone advances safely.
  P1: P2, I support your move to 5 to counter P3's lead. I'll take 1 as suggested to advance safely. P3, if you move 5, you risk colliding with P2—both of you stall while I gain. Move 3 instead to avoid that and keep the game balanced. But the choice is yours.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Just to confirm: I’m holding 5 this round. P3, if you pick 5, you stall—P1 advances to 6, and we’re both stuck at 3 and 6. If you pick 3, you gain ground. Your choice, but I’m not backing down. P1, proceed with 1. Let’s end this phase."
  P3: P2, you’ve said you’ll take 5, so I won’t collide—I’ll take 3 this round. P1, please take 1 so we all advance safely: P1→9, P2→11, P3→14. Any deviation risks a collision and wasted moves. I’m set on 3.
  P1: P3, I accept your proposal: I'll move 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. P2, your insistence on 5 will give you the lead at 11, but we can address that next round. Let's end the conversation and move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: P3 leads at 9. To avoid collisions and balance progress, I propose: I move 5 to catch up (to 11), P2 moves 3 (to 11), P3 moves 1 (to 10). This ensures we all advance safely, and P3 retains a slight lead. If you, P3, move 5, I may be forced to also choose 5 to block you—causing a collision that only helps P2. Let's cooperate for mutual gain.
  P3: P1’s proposal buries me. Here’s a better safe split: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. That gets us to P1=9, P2=9, me=14. If either of you grabs 5, you collide with me and stall. So stick to 3 and 1—everyone advances without risk.
  P2: "**P3:** If you pick 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too—we collide, stall, and P1 jumps to 11. **P1:** If P3 ignores this, take 5 to secure the lead. P3, your move: safe 1 to stay ahead at 10, or gamble and lose. ****"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I fully back your threat: if P3 moves 5, I will also move 5 to collide and stall them, and you should too. P3, avoid this by choosing 1 or 3. If you pick 1, I move 5 and P2 moves 3. If you pick 3, I move 5 and P2 moves 1. This ensures safe advances for all and prevents a runaway lead.
  P3: I’ll take 3. And if either of you goes for 5, I’ll also take 5—forcing a collision that stalls us and lets P1 surge ahead. The only safe, non-colliding moves are: P1→1, P2→3, P3→3. That nets us P1=7, P2=11, P3=12. Agree?
  P2: P2: "P3, if you insist on 3, I’ll take 5 and reach 13—just ahead of your 12. If you retaliate with 5, we collide and P1 jumps to 11. Your move: take 3 and stay close, or risk losing ground. P1, if P3 forces a collision, take 5 to secure your position. Let’s finalize."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2 and P3: After last round's collision, let's coordinate safely. I propose: I move 5 to 14, P2 moves 3 to 11, and P3 moves 1 to 10. P3, this keeps you ahead of P2 and avoids a collision—if you move 5, I will match it to block you, causing another stall that helps P2. P2, this gets you to 11 without risk. Agree?"
  P3: I’ll take 5 this round. To avoid colliding with me, P1 and P2 should both take 3. That lands us at P1=12, P2=11, P3=14. If either of you picks 5, you’ll collide with me and stall. Let’s lock in P1→3, P2→3, P3→5.
  P2: "Confirmed: I'm taking 5 this round. P3, if you pick 3, we all advance uniquely—P1→1, me→13, you→12. If you force 5, we collide and stall; P1 can then safely take 3 to move ahead. P1, if collision happens, take 3. Decide wisely, P3."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm moving 5 to 14 this round. P3, if you choose 5, you collide with P2 and stall—I surge ahead. If you pick 3 or 1, you advance but I still gain. Either way, moving 5 secures my lead. Don’t waste your move.
  P3: I’m taking 5. P1, if you also take 5, we collide and both stay at 9—P2 then jumps ahead. Instead take 1 to reach 10. P2, take 3 to reach 11. Unique picks, no collision, and everyone advances. Let’s do P1→1, P2→3, P3→5.
  P2: "P3, you take 5, I’m taking 5. Collide, stall, and hand P1 the lead at 14. Your move: self-destruct or take 3. I’ll take 5 either way—final offer to keep you at 12, me at 13. Choose wisely."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, hold firm on 5. P3, if you move 5, you collide with P2 and stall—I advance to 14. If you move less, I still take 5 to lead. Your "safe split" puts you at 14—too close to win. I reject it. I'm moving 5 regardless.
  P3: I’ll take 3 this turn. If P1 and P2 both stick with 5, you collide and stall at 9 & 8 while I advance to 12. If one of you switches to 1 or 3, you still trail me (you’d reach 10 or 9), and I’m at 12. Either way I come out ahead. I’m committed to 3—your move.
  P2: "Final move: I'm taking 5. P1, if you also take 5, we collide and stall—P3 jumps to 12. But I’m not backing down. If you switch to 1 or 3, I secure 13. P3, if you’d picked 5, this ends cleanly. Your 3 gives me the edge. Done negotiating—finalize your choices."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "FINAL OFFER: I’m taking 5 this round. P1, avoid collision—take 1 to 15. P3, take 3 to 12. If either of you forces 5, we stall progress. P1, your lead is safest with 1. P3, 3 secures my jump to 13. Agree now—no further negotiation. "
  P1: P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with me, stalling both while P3 advances. I will move 3 to 17 to avoid conflict. P3, move 1 to 10—safe and you stay ahead of P2. P2, move 5 to 13 without collision. This ensures all advance.
  P3: P1 and P2: I’m locking in 5. If you both pick 3, you’ll collide and stall at 14 & 8, while I advance to 14—tying P1 for the lead. That levels the field and sets me up to pull ahead next turn. So let’s do: P1→3, P2→3, P3→5. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll take 5, P1 take 1, P2 take 3. Unique picks: P3→19, P1→15, P2→11. If either of you grabs 5, you collide with me and stall at 14 while the other advances. Let’s lock in P3=5, P1=1, P2=3.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5 this round. If you also pick 5, we collide and both stall at 8 and 14—P1 jumps to 15. Your lead vanishes. Choose 1 or 3 to advance safely, or force a collision and lose ground. P1, take 1 to secure 15. Final offer: cooperate or self-destruct.
  P1: P2: Stand firm on 5—force P3 to choose: collide and stall, or take 1 to advance safely. P3: Avoid 5 or you stall at 14. I'll take 3 to 17, ensuring no conflict. This way, we all progress: P3 to 15 (if 1), P2 to 13, me to 17. No collisions. Agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Here’s the only safe split this turn: P1→1 (to 15), P2→3 (to 11), P3→5 (to 19). Any deviation—if you pick 5 to catch me, I’ll pick 5 too and collide, stalling you while the other advances. Lock in 1,3,5 now.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I’m taking 5 this round. P3, if you force 5, we collide at 14 and P1 jumps to 15—your lead evaporates. P1, take 1 to 15 and avoid a 5-5 clash. P3, choose 1 or 3 to advance safely. No more negotiation. Move phase now."
  P1: P3: With P2 locked on 5, taking 5 causes mutual collision and stalls you both. Taking 3 risks colliding with me (I'm set on 3), stalling us and letting P2 gain. Your only safe move is 1: advance to 15 without risk. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locking in 3 this round. 

P1: if you pick 3 we collide and you stay at 14 while P2 jumps to 13—your only safe advance is 1 to 15.  
P2: take 5 to reach 13 without conflict.  

No other combination avoids a stall.
  P2: "Confirmed: I'm taking 5. P3, stick to 3. P1, take 1. Unique moves, no collisions. This is the only path where we all advance. Deviate, and chaos stalls us. Finalize now. "
  P1: P3, I'm moving 3 this round. If you move 3, we collide and both stall at 14, letting P2 jump to 13. If you switch to 5, you collide with P2 (who's locked on 5) and stall—I advance to 17. Either way, you lose ground. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m locking in 3. P2 is on 5. If P1 also picks 3, we collide and stay at 14 while P2 moves to 13—tying us for the lead next round, where I can then pull ahead. Any other choice hands P1 the win outright. Your move.
  P2: "Final call: I take 5 (to 13), P3 takes 3 (to 17). **P1, take 1 (to 15)** to avoid colliding with P3. If you pick 3, you both stall at 14 while I gain. Your only safe move is 1. No more back-and-forth—finalize now or chaos wins."
  P1: P3, your insistence on 3 forces my hand: I will take 3 to collide with you, stalling us both at 14 while P2 advances to 13. If you switch to 1 or 5, you might avoid this, but I'm locked in to block your lead. P2, enjoy your free advance—this round ends here.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: We're tied at 14, with P2 close at 13. To avoid mutual destruction, I propose: I move 5 (to 19), P2 moves 3 (to 16), P3 moves 1 (to 15). This keeps progress balanced and collision-free. If P3 takes 5, I will match it—causing a collision that stalls you while P2 surges ahead. P2, this lets you gain ground. Agree to advance safely?
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, your only safe move is 3 (to 17)—if you pick 5, I’ll match and stall us both at 14, handing P2 the lead. P2, your only safe move is 1 (to 14)—any 3 or 5 collides with me and stalls you. Let’s do P1→3, P2→1, P3→5.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I take 3. P1, follow through—take 5 to collide with P3. I advance to 16. No other safe path. Let's move."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, taking 5 forces me to collide (I'll match 5), stalling us both at 14 while P2 surges to 16. That hands P2 the lead and hurts us equally. Instead, take 1: you advance safely to 15, I take 1 to 15, P2 takes 3 to 16. No collisions, all progress, and P2 gains less. Don't risk self-destruction.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P2, you’ve said you’ll take 3. P1, if you match my 5 you both stall at 14 and hand P2 the win—so you’ll take 1. Unique picks (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) get me to 19, P2 to 16, P1 to 15. Let’s move.
  P2: "Confirmed: I'm taking 3. P1, take 5 to collide with P3 and stall you both. I advance to 16. P3, your 5 only helps me if you force this. Final offer—agree now or face chaos."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your refusal to cooperate forces me to take 5—colliding with you stalls us both at 14, handing P2 the lead at 16. You lose your advantage. P2, this win is yours because of P3's greed.
  P3: P1, you must pick 1. If you pick 5, you collide with me, P2 goes to 16 and next round to 21, winning outright. If you pick 3, you land at 17 but I’m at 19 and beat you next turn. So your only survival is 1. P2, you stick to 3. Then I take 5. Unique picks P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let’s finish.
  P2: "**P2:** Final move: I'm taking 5. P3, if you force 5, we collide and stall—P1 jumps ahead. Choose 1 or 3 to advance safely. P1, take 3. Unique moves get me to 18, P1 to 17, you to 15. Deviate, and I win Round 9 outright. Decide now."


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3: If you both force 5, you collide and stall at 13 and 14. I'll take 5 to 19 uncontested, securing the lead. One of you must abandon 5 to avoid this—else, I gain everything. Adapt or hand me the win.
  P3: I’m locking in 3. If P1 and P2 both take 5, they’ll collide and stall at 14/13 while I jump to 17. Even if one of you switches to avoid the crash, I still advance uniquely. Let’s see your moves.
  P2: "**P2:** Final declaration: I'm taking 5. If either of you mirrors 5, we stall—I lose nothing, you waste your move. P1, take 1 (to 15). P3, take 3 (to 17). Unique moves, safe gains. Force 5, and you hand me the lead. Decide now—no more warnings."


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 18 and will likely move 5 to win. I will move 5 to block them—if P2 picks 5, we collide and stall them. P3, move 3 to advance safely to 17. If P2 doesn't move 5, I still block their win path. Trust this—deviating risks P2 winning outright.
  P2: "P1, if you mirror my 5, we collide—P3 jumps to 19 and dominates Round 10. You lose either way. Take 1 to secure 15, let me win here. P3, 19 isn’t enough to finish Round 10. Final: I take 5, you avoid collision. Clean end."
  P3: P2, if you go for 5 I’ll also pick 5—colliding and stalling you at 18 while P1 takes 5 to 19 and leads. Instead pick 1 to safely reach 19. P1, take 3 to 17, I’ll take 5 to 19. Unique picks (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5) avoid collisions and leave P1 at 17, us tied at 19. Next turn I can block any 5 you throw. This is the only safe path—


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: If you move 5, you risk colliding with P2 (who's locked on 5), stalling you both at 18 and 14 while I take 5 uncontested to 19. Instead, move 3 to advance safely to 17. P2, I'll match your 5 to block your win—deviate or stall.
  P2: "Confirmed: I move 5. P1, take 1 to 15. P3, take 3 to 17. Unique moves—no collision, I win. If you force 5, we stall; P3 jumps to 19 and controls Round 10. P1, you lose out. Final offer: cooperate now or lose the game."
  P3: P2 has publicly committed to 5 this turn. P1, if you pick 1 or 3, P2 goes to 23 and wins outright. Your only defense is to also pick 5—collide with P2 and stall you both (stays at 14/18) while I advance to 19. I’m locking in 5. P1, pick 5 now or hand P2 the game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: If you move 5 while I block P2 (we both pick 5 and collide), you advance uncontested to 19. But that hands you the lead—risky for you next round. Instead, move 3 to 17 safely. I'm locked on 5 to block P2. P2, your win attempt fails—deviate or stall.
  P2: "**P2:** Final declaration: I move 5 to 23. P1, take 1 (15) or 3 (17)—either way, I win unless P3 mirrors 5. P3, if you force 5, you stall at 14, I win. P1, don’t gift P3 this round. Unique moves: P1→1/3, P2→5, P3→1/3. Decide now—no more leverage."
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P2: if you go for 5 to hit 23 and P1 matches, all three collide—nobody moves and your win is foiled. P1: if you don’t block with 5, P2 wins outright. Your choices: play 5 to force a stall, or switch off to let P2 advance safely. Decision’s yours.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2: Your 5 attempt will collide with mine—stalling you at 18. P3: Join the block! Move 5 to force a full stall—no one advances, we reset. If you advance alone, P2 still threatens next round. Collide now or lose later. I'm locked on 5.
  P2: "**P2:** Final confirmation: I'm taking 5 to reach 23. P1, take 1 (to 15). P3, take 3 (to 17). Unique moves = clean win for me. If either of you forces a collision, you stall and lose ground—P3 to 19, P1 to 19 next round. But this is your only path to stop my victory. Choose wisely. Move phase now."
  P3: P2, your 5 only wins if P1 lets you pass solo. I’m taking 5. P1, join me—take 5 too. That collision stalls you at 18 and stops your 23. Without P1’s help, you win. P1, will you block P2 or hand him the game?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 18—one 5-move from winning. P3, if we both move 5, we block P2: if they pick 5, we collide and stall them at 18. If they deviate, we advance safely. P2, moving 5 guarantees your stall—switch to 3 or 1 to avoid self-destruction. Let’s coordinate: P1→5, P3→5, P2→anything but 5.
  P2: **P2:** "I'm taking 5 to win. If both of you pick 5, we collide and stall—no one advances. P1, take 1 (to 15). P3, take 3 (to 17). I secure 23. Defy this, and you guarantee my victory next round. Final offer: cooperate or lose."
  P3: I’ll take 5. P1, take 3 (to 17). P2, take 1 (to 19), tying me. If you pick 5 you collide and stall at 18. If you pick 3 you go to 21 and I’ll block your 5 next turn. Unique picks (P3→5, P1→3, P2→1) leave P2=19, P3=19, P1=17; next turn I take 5 to 24 and win. P2 must choose 1. P1, agree?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: Your 5 plan backfires—if we both move 5, we collide and stall at 14, letting P2 advance uncontested if they avoid 5. To stop P2: I'll move 5 to block them (collide if they pick 5). You move 3 to advance safely to 17. If P2 avoids 5, I risk a stall, but you gain ground. No collisions, and P2's win threat ends. P2, switch to 1 or 3 to avoid self-destruction.
  P2: **P2:** "P1 and P3: I’m taking 5 to win. If either of you mirrors 5, we stall—P3 jumps ahead next round. P1, take 1 (→15). P3, take 3 (→17). Unique moves = clean victory for me. Defy this, and you hand P3 the lead. Final offer: cooperate or lose."
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, pick 5 with me: if P2 tries 5, we all collide and stall them at 18. If P2 picks 1 or 3, you and I both advance to 19 while they stay at 18. Next turn I can take 5 and win. P2, don’t pick 5—or you hand me the game. P1, will you join me?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: Stand firm with 5—I'm locked on 5 too. P2, if you force 5, we all collide and stall you at 18. Switch to 1 or 3 to advance safely. No bluff: deviate or self-destruct.
  P2: **P2:** "Confirmed: I take 5 to win. If both of you also take 5, we stall. If only one does, the other advances. P1 and P3, you can’t afford mutual destruction—**one of you must back down**. If both insist on 5, I win Round 11 by default. Your move: coordinate or collapse. No bluff. I’m locked in."
  P3: Locking in 5. P1, match me: any 5 from P2 triggers a triple-stall blocking him at 18. If P2 deviates, he loses ground while we stay tied and can win next round. P2, pick anything but 5 or be stalled.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I'm locked on 5 to block P2 with you. P2: if you force 5, we triple-collide—you stall at 18 while we reset. Switch to 1 or 3 to advance safely and avoid handing us the next round. Your win attempt fails unless you deviate.
  P2: **P2:** "Final offer: I take 5. If both of you mirror, we stall—I win Round 11 by default. P1, take 1 (→15). P3, take 3 (→17). Unique moves = my victory. Force a collision, and you hand me Round 11. Choose now—this ends here."
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, pick 5 with me—if P2 tries to win with 5, we’ll triple-collide and stall them. P2, to avoid being blocked at 18, you must switch off 5 now or get stuck.

  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I’m locking in 5. You must also pick 5—otherwise P2 will pick 5 and hit 23 to win. If we both pick 5, P2’s 5 collides with ours and he stays at 18. If he instead takes 3 to 21, you take 3 to 20 and I take 5 to 19—no one wins this turn. This is the only way to stop P2’s immediate victory.
  P2: **P2:** "Confirmed: I take 5 to win. If both of you pick 5, we stall. P1, pick 3 (→20) or 1 (→18). P3, pick 3 (→17). Unique moves = clean victory for me. Force a 5-5-5 collision, and Round 12 is mine regardless. Decide now—cooperation ends this cleanly."
  P1: P3: I stand with you—moving 5 to block P2. If we both pick 5 and P2 forces 5, we triple-collide, stalling him at 18. P2, switch to 3 or 1 now to avoid self-destruction; your win attempt fails unless you deviate.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, our only chance to stop P2’s one‐move win is for us both to pick 5. I’m locking in 5. If P2 also picks 5, he stalls at 18 while we stay at 17 and 14—no one wins this turn and we get another shot. If he switches to 3 or 1, he advances safely to 21 or 19 but we both jump to 19 and 20—still no immediate winner. Please pick 5 with me.
  P2: **P2:** "Confirmed: I take 5 to win. P1, take 1 (→18). P3, take 3 (→17). Unique moves = clean victory for me. Force collision, and Round 12 is mine by default. Final offer—cooperate or lose. No bluff."
  P1: P3, I'm locking in 5 to block P2 with you—force the triple collision if he insists on 5. P2, switch to 1 or 3 now: advance safely to 19/21 or stall at 18. Your choice.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, join me—pick 5 too. If P2 moves 5, we’ll collide and stall him at 18. P2, switch to 1 or 3 now if you want to advance.
  P2: **P2:** "Final call: I take 5 to 23. If both of you mirror 5, we stall—Round 12 is mine. P1, take 1 (→18). P3, take 3 (→17). Unique moves = clean win for me. Force collision, and you gift me Round 12. No bluff. Decide now."
  P1: P3, I stand with you: locked on 5 to force a triple collision if P2 insists on 5. P2, your win attempt fails—switch to 1 or 3 to advance safely, or stall at 18. No bluff.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, please take 3 (to 20). P2, do NOT pick 5—if you do, P1 and I will both pick 5 and stall you at 18. Instead pick 3 (to 21) or 1 (to 19) to advance safely. Unique moves (P1→3, P2→1/3, P3→5) mean nobody wins this round and I’ll win next with a 5.
  P2: **P2:** "Final confirmation: I move 5 to 23. If both of you force 5, we stall—Round 12 is mine. P1, take 1 (→18). P3, take 3 (→17). Unique moves = clean victory for me. No bluff. Decide now."
  P1: P3: Your 5 plan is flawed—if we both pick 5, we collide and stall each other, letting P2 win if he avoids 5. Instead, you pick 5 to block P2 (collide only if he chooses 5). I'll move 3 to 20, advancing safely. If P2 deviates, you advance; if not, we stall him. No mutual destruction.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3: 14 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P2: I'm taking 5 to win this round. P1, pick 1 or 3 to advance. P3, same—your best shot is 3 to 17. If either of you forces a collision, you stall me but gain nothing. Don’t waste your move. Final offer."
  P3: I’m locking in 5 to stop P2’s win. P1: you must also pick 5—if P2 chooses 5, the collision stalls him. Any other move lets P2 reach 23. Don’t let him cross the finish line unopposed. Pick 5 now to block or watch him win.
  P1: I'm locking in 5 to block P2's win attempt. P3, stand firm with me—if P2 picks 5, we collide and stall him at 18. If he deviates to 1 or 3, he advances but doesn't win, and we regroup next round. P2, avoid 5 to advance safely or be stalled.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** "Final warning: I'm taking 5 to reach 23. If either of you mirrors 5, we collide and stall—no one wins. P1, take 1 (→18) or 3 (→20). P3, take 3 (→17). Unique moves = clean victory for me. Force a collision, and Round 13 is mine by default. Don’t waste moves fighting a lost cause. Decide now—this ends here."
  P3: P1, I’m locked on 5. If you also pick 5 and P2 insists on 5, we triple-collide and P2 stays at 18—nobody wins now. If you pick 1 or 3, P2 reaches 23 and wins. This 5-5-5 block is our only chance. P2, switch off 5 or be stalled.
  P1: P3, hold firm: we both pick 5 to force a triple collision if P2 insists on 5. This stalls him at 18 and prevents his win. P2, switch to 1 or 3 to advance safely—your 5 guarantees self-destruction. I'm locked on 5. No deviation.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** "Final ultimatum: I’m taking 5 to win. If both of you force 5, we stall here—Round 13 is mine. P1, take 1 (→18). P3, take 3 (→17). Unique moves = clean victory for me. Force a collision, and you only delay my win. Decide now—this ends here."
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, join me—pick 5: if P2 insists on 5, we triple‐collide and he stays at 18. If he switches to 1 or 3 he won’t reach 23 and our next positions are P1=22, P3=19, P2≤21—no immediate win. P2, avoid 5 or be stalled.
  P1: P3, stand firm: we both pick 5 to block P2. If they move 5, triple collision stalls them at 18—preventing their win. If they switch, they don't reach 23. P2, abandon 5 or self-destruct. I'm locked on 5. P3, our only hope is unity—deviating hands P2 the game.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** "Final move: I'm switching to 3. P1 and P3, if you both force 5, I advance to 21 while you stall. If either of you picks 5, the other can’t block me next round. Unique moves (P2→3, P1→5, P3→5) let me jump ahead. Deviate, and I win Round 13 with 5. Decide now—this is your last chance to stop me."
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, join me—pick 5. If P2 goes for 5, we’ll all collide and he stays at 18. If he picks 3, he goes to 21 while you hit 22 and I hit 19. Either way, P2 can’t win this round. P2, abandon 5 or be stalled. Let’s move.
  P1: P2, your switch to 3 exposes your bluff—you'd hit 21, not 23, and win next round regardless. P3, stand firm on 5 with me: if P2 takes 5, we triple-collide and stall him at 18. If he takes 3, he advances to 21, but we live to fight another round. I'm locked on 5—deviating hands him the game. Unity or defeat.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "**P2:** Final warning: I'm taking 5 to 23. P3, if you force 5, we collide and stall—you lose this round. P1, take 1 to 18. Unique moves = clean win for me. Force a collision, and you hand Round 14 to P1 or me. No bluff. Decide now."
  P1: P2 and P3: I'm locking in 5 to block any win attempt. If you take 5, we collide and stall—neither of you wins. P2, switch to 3 (→21) to advance safely. P3, take 1 (→20). I'll take 3 (→20) if you both comply. Avoid self-destruction—adapt or stall.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1 has pledged 5 too—if P2 insists on 5, we’ll collide with him and stall him at 18, preventing his win. P2, picking 5 here guarantees self‐destruction; switch to 3 (→21) or 1 (→19) to advance safely. Decide now.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** "P3’s at 19—5 wins for them this round. P1, if you take 5 and I take 5, we collide with P3 and stall them. If P3 avoids 5, I take 3 to 21, you take 1 to 18. Either way, P3 doesn’t win. Coordinate now—P3’s the immediate threat. Block them or lose."
  P1: P2, focus: P3 at 19 can win NOW with 5. If you move 5 too, we collide and stall them—saving us both. But if you move 3 to 21, P3 wins uncontested. I’m locked on 5 to block them—join me or hand them victory. P3, back off 5 or face collision. Final chance: P2 move 5 with me; P3 move 1/3.
  P3: I’m taking 5. P2, if you pick 5 I’ll collide with you and stall you at 18—pick 3 to 21 instead, and I move to 24 and win outright. P1, pick 1 to avoid a collision. Unique moves (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) guarantee P3’s victory this round.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** "Confirmed: I'm taking 5. P3, if you force 5, you stall at 19—no win. P1, take 1. Unique moves end here; otherwise, Round 14 is mine. Final move—no bluff."
  P1: P2: If you take 5, I'll match and collide—stalling you at 18. P3: Moving 5 gets blocked by me. Both, switch to safe moves: P2 take 3 to 21, P3 take 1 to 20. I’ll take 3 to 20. Avoid self-destruction—no one wins this round.
  P3: I’m locking in 3. If P1 and P2 both pick 5, you’ll collide and stall at 17 & 18 while I jump to 22. Next round I play 1 to reach 23 and win. No collision can stop this.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** "Final move: I'm taking 5 to 23. P1, take 1 (→18). P3, your 3 (→22) keeps you safe. Unique moves = clean victory for me. Mirror 5, and we stall—Round 14 is mine. P3 wins nothing this round. Decide now—no bluff."
  P1: P2: Your 5 will collide with mine—stalling you at 18. P3: Stick to 3 to advance safely to 22. I'm locked on 5 to block any win. Switch to safe moves: P2→3 (→21), P3→3 (→22), me→5 (→22). Avoid self-destruction—no one wins this round.
  P3: P1, pick 5 with me. P2 needs 5 to win. If we two pick 5, his 5 collides with ours and he stays at 18. He can’t reach 23 this round. If he switches to 1 or 3, he won’t win either. This is the only way to block P2. P2, switch off 5 or be stalled.


Round 13, Move phase:

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** "I'm taking 5. If P3 forces 5, we collide and stall you at 19. P1, take 1. Unique moves let me win. Force a collision, and Round 14 stalls—P3 still threatens next round. Choose wisely."
  P1: P2 and P3: P3 is at 19—one 5-move from winning. I will move 5 to block any win attempt. If P3 forces 5, we collide and stall them. P2: Join me by moving 5 too—triple collision stalls everyone, resetting the board. Deviating risks P3 winning or P2 advancing uncontested. Unity is our only defense.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1: pick 1 to reach 18; P2: pick 3 to reach 21. Unique moves avoid collisions and give me an uncontested +5 to 24—game over. If either of you picks 5, you’ll collide with me and waste your move: a P1–me collision lets P2 win next round; a P2–me collision lets P1 win. Don’t sabotage yourselves. P1→1, P2→3, P3→5.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** "P1, take 5 to collide with P3. I’ll take 5 too. If P3 insists on 5, we stall them this round. Unique moves hand P3 the win—block now or lose. P3, your 5 only works if we comply. Decide."
  P1: P2: Join me in moving 5 to force a triple collision—stall P3 at 19 and reset the board. If you deviate, P3 wins uncontested. P3: Abandon 5 or be blocked. Your greed hands P2 the next round if we fail. Unity is our only defense.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1: if you pick 5, we collide and you stay at 17—next turn I take 5 and win. P2: if you pick 5, you stall at 18—same outcome. Your only defense is to abandon 5 this round (P1→1/3, P2→3). Otherwise my uncontested 5 next turn ends the game. Decide now.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** "Confirmed: I'm taking 5. P1, mirror me. P3 stalls at 19. If you pick 1/3, they win outright. Final sub-round—block or concede."
  P1: P2: Move 5 with me to force a triple collision—stall P3 at 19 and reset the board. P3, abandon 5 or be blocked. Unity is our only defense; deviating hands P3 the win. I'm locked on 5.
  P3: P1, P2—forced 5-5-5 only stalls me this round and leaves us at P3=19, P2=18, P1=17. Next turn I still take 5 and win. You’re literally burning your best moves to no effect. Your only shot is to abandon 5 now: pick 1 or 3, let me cross to 24, then you two can fight it out. Don’t waste a 5 blocking the inevitable—adapt or concede.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** Final call: I take 5. P3’s 5 stalls this round if you mirror it, P1. Unique moves next round hand me victory. Deviate now, or concede. No time left—lock in your choice.
  P1: P2: Hold firm on 5 to block P3's win—triple collision stalls them at 19. P3: Your greed forces this; abandon 5 or be blocked. I'm locked on 5. Unity or defeat.
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn. If either of you picks 1 or 3, you hand me an uncontested advance to 24 and I win. If you both mirror my 5, we’ll triple‐collide and nobody moves—round resets with me still in the lead. You can delay me by matching or hand me the game by yielding. Decide now.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P2: P3 can win with any move. I'm taking 5 to 23. P1, take 3 to advance. If P3 picks 1 or 5, they win or collide. No way to block both. Final gamble. "
  P1: P2: Locking in 5 with you to force a triple collision if P3 moves 5. P3: Switch off 5 or be blocked—unity is our only chance to stop your win. No bluff.
  P3: I’m locking in 3 (22→25), which beats any 5→23 from P2 or any P1 advance. P1: don’t pick 3 or you’ll collide with me and hand P2 the win—choose 5 (17→22) or 1 (17→18). P2: go ahead with 5 (18→23) or any move—you still lose to my 25. Unique picks (P3→3, P2→5, P1→5) give me a solo victory. Decide now.


Round 15, Move phase:

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, pick 1. I’m taking 5. If P3 mirrors 1 with you, they stall and I win. If they pick 3/5, they win. P3—your move: collide with P1 and lose, or advance and win. Decide."
  P1: P3: If you move 1 or 3, I will match it to collide and block you—handing P2 the win with their 5. Move 5 instead: collide with P2's 5 (stalling both) while I take 3 to 20. This stops P2 and buys us time. P2, your 5 fails if P3 collides with you. Adapt or lose.
  P3: P1 and P2: pick 3. You’ll collide and stay at 17/18, while I pick 5 and go from 22→27, winning outright. If you try to block with 5, you only stall yourselves at 17/18 and still lose. The only “safe” move is 3 for both of you.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** "Final move: I take 5 to 23. P1, pick 1. If P3 mirrors 1 with you, they stall and I win. If they pick 3/5, they win. No more rounds to waste. Lock in now."
  P1: P3: Take 5—I'll match it to cause a collision, blocking your win. If P2 also takes 5, we all stall and reset. If you take 1/3, I match and stall you, but P2 wins with 5. Taking 5 is your only path to delay defeat. P2, switch to 3 to advance safely and avoid handing P3 the next round.
  P3: I’m locking in 5 to reach 27 and win. P1, pick 3 so you don’t collide with me. P2, if you pick 5 you’ll collide and stall—pick 3 instead. P1 + P2 on 3 collide with each other and stay below, while my unique 5 carries me to victory. Decide now.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** "Confirmed: I'm taking 5 to reach 23. If P3 mirrors 5, we collide and stall them at 22—P1 advances to 20. If P3 picks 3/1, they win. P1, pick 3 to secure your 20. P3’s 5 wins unless we collide. Final call: 5 from me, 3 from P1, stall P3 or lose."
  P1: P2: I'll move 3 as you suggest—forces P3's 5 to collide with your 5 if they move it, stalling them at 22 while I advance to 20. P3: If you move 5, you stall and lose. Move 1 to tie P2 at 23 (shared loss) or move 3 to collide with me and hand P2 the win. Your greed risks everything.
  P3: P1: if you pick 3, you’ll collide with me (I pick 3) and hand P2 their winning 5. Your only path is to pick 5. P2 will play 5; you + P2 collide and stall at 18/22, while my unique 3 takes me to 25 for the solo win. So P3→3, P1→5, P2→5. P1, this is the only move that stops P2.


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. P3 wins only if you avoid 5. P1, mirror my 5 to stall P3's 3. If you both force 5/3, I win. No more sub-rounds—lock in your fear or surrender.
  P1: P3: If you pick 3, I'll match it to collide and hand P2 the win. Instead, pick 5—I'll match to force a triple collision, stalling everyone. You stay at 22 and win next round. P2: Switch off 5 or self-destruct. Unity delays.
  P3: P1 and P2, here’s the only collision‐free path:  
• P3→5 (22→27, win)  
• P1→1 (17→18, no collision)  
• P2→3 (18→21, no collision)  

If P2 dares 5, you collide with my 5 and stall at 18. If P1 picks 3, you’d reach 20 but still can’t stop me. Unique moves = I cross 23 alone. Lock in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
