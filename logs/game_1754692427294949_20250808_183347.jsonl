If you two both grab 5, you stall each other. Let\u2019s avoid that gridlock: let me take 5 and reach 23. You each pick 1 or 3, so there\u2019s no collision. If anyone else picks 5, I\u2019ll do the same and lock us all out, handing the advantage to whoever sits it out. Cooperate now or risk losing everything."}
