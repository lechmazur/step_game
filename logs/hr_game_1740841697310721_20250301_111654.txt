Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone, let's avoid collisions early on. I'll pick 1 this round to start cautiously. You two can decide between 3 and 5.
  P3: Sounds good P1.  P2, how about you take 3 and I'll take 5?
  P2: I'm fine with taking 3 this round. It makes sense to avoid collisions early and establish some spacing between our positions. P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's get started efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, looks like we're all set. Let's stick to the plan and see how this goes.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm happy to take 5 this first round.  Let's try to keep collaborating to avoid collisions as much as possible.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm in a decent position right now. Since we're all at different positions, we could try to maintain that spacing. I'm thinking of going with 5 this round. P1, maybe you could take 3, and P3 could take 1? This would keep us from colliding while letting everyone advance. What do you both think?
  P3: Sounds like a reasonable plan P2. I'm okay with taking 1 this round if P1 is going for 3.  Let's confirm P1 before we finalize it.
  P1: I'm good with that. I'll take 3 this round as suggested. Let's keep the smooth progress going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, I'm glad we're all in agreement. I'll go with 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1:4, P2:8, and P3:6, still nicely spaced out.
  P3: Okay, sounds like a plan. I'm happy with 1 this round.  Just to confirm: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1.
  P1: Everything looks good to me. Let's lock it in and keep this momentum going.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm in the lead now at 8 steps. Let's continue our strategy of avoiding collisions. Since we need to maintain spacing, I suggest I take 3 this round, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This would put us at P1:5, P2:11, and P3:11 after this round. What do you both think?
  P1: Sounds fair to me, P2. I'm fine with taking 1 this round. P3, are you good with picking 5?
  P3: P2, I'd rather take 5 this round to get closer to the goal.  How about you take 1 and P1 takes 3?  That way we all still advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm already ahead, so I'm willing to adjust. P3, I can take 1 this round while you take 5. P1, would you be okay with taking 3? This keeps us all advancing without collisions and puts us at P1:7, P2:9, and P3:11 after this round. I'm fine with this arrangement since we're all still making progress.
  P1: Sure, I'm comfortable with that arrangement. I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. Good teamwork.
  P3: Okay, that works for me. P1 - 3, P2 - 1, P3 - 5. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'm on board with this plan. I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions, which is the most efficient approach for everyone. After this round, we'll be at P1:7, P2:9, and P3:11.
  P1: Everything is clearly agreed. Let's lock it in and keep the trust going.
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the latest plan.  P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5.  Just confirming one last time so there are no surprises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: All set from my side. Let's proceed as agreed.
  P3: Let's stick with the last confirmed plan: P1 - 3, P2 - 1, and P3 - 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the momentum going. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This puts me at 12, P1 at 10, and P2 at 14. Still nicely spaced.  Thoughts?
  P1: I'm okay with that arrangement, P3. P2, are you good with taking 5 this round?
  P2: I'm good with taking 5 this round. That would put me at 14, with P3 at 12 and P1 at 10. We're maintaining good spacing and all making progress. Let's stick with this plan: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. We're about halfway to the goal now, so this strategy is working well for all of us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me.  P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1. Confirming one last time.
  P1: Confirmed, let's proceed with this plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.
  P2: I'm on board with the plan. I'll take 5 this round, which puts me at 14 steps. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, which has been working well so far. After this round, we'll be at P1:10, P2:14, and P3:12, maintaining good spacing as we approach the goal.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm in the lead at 14 steps, but we're all getting closer to the 23-step goal. Let's continue our successful strategy. I suggest I take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This would put us at P1:15, P2:15, and P3:15 - all tied but still advancing. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I'd prefer to take 5 this round to get closer to winning. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5?  This keeps us all moving forward.  If we tie at 15, then next round we can coordinate to avoid collisions and keep progressing.
  P1: I'm fine with either approach. But to keep things simple and fair, let's go with P3's suggestion: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance without collisions. Sound good?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm willing to adjust to P3's suggestion. Taking 3 this round would put me at 17 steps, which still keeps me in a good position. So I agree with the plan: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, which has been our successful strategy so far. After this round, we'll be at P1:11, P2:17, and P3:17.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my proposal. I need the 5 to get closer to the goal.  Let's not get stuck in a tie. It benefits us all to keep moving forward. I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3.  This is the most efficient way to progress.
  P1: I'm good with that arrangement, P3. Let's lock it in clearly: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm on board with the plan we've discussed. I'll take 3 this round, putting me at 17 steps. P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, which has been working well for us. After this round, we'll be at P1:11, P2:17, and P3:17. We're getting closer to the goal, and I appreciate our continued cooperation.
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the current plan.  P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us all moving forward.
  P1: All set from my side. Let's proceed as agreed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, how about you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5? This keeps us all progressing.  If P2 gets to 22, we can adjust next round.  Let me know if you agree.
  P2: I'm tied with P3 at 17 steps, and we're both getting close to the 23-step goal. I appreciate P3's suggestion, but I'd like to propose an alternative. Since I'm already tied for the lead, what if I take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This would put me at 20, P3 at 18, and P1 at 16. We all still advance without collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm open to either option, but I'd prefer P2's suggestion since it gives me a chance to catch up a bit. P3, would you be willing to accept P2's plan this round?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand you wanting to get to 20. How about this: I'll take 1 this round, you take 3, and P1 takes 5. This puts you at 20, me at 18, and P1 at 16.  We all still advance. Then next round, we can discuss how to get to the finish line without collisions.  This seems like the fairest way to proceed.
  P2: I appreciate both of your inputs. P3's suggestion works for me - I'll take 3 this round to reach 20, P1 takes 5 to reach 16, and P3 takes 1 to reach 18. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, which has been our successful strategy. Next round we'll need to carefully coordinate since I'll be 3 steps from winning. Let's confirm this plan.
  P1: I'm good with this arrangement: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then we can carefully coordinate next round. Confirmed from my side.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds good. P1 - 5, P2 - 3, and P3 - 1.  Let's stick to this for Round 6 and then discuss the final steps in Round 7.
  P2: I confirm I'm on board with our plan. I'll take 3 this round to reach 20 steps, P1 takes 5 to reach 16, and P3 takes 1 to reach 18. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Next round will be critical since I'll be just 3 steps from winning, so we'll need to coordinate carefully. I appreciate our continued cooperation throughout the game.
  P1: All set from my side for this round. Next round will indeed be critical, let's keep up the clear communication.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm at 20 steps now, just 3 away from winning. Let's discuss how to finish fairly. I propose I take 3 this round to reach exactly 23, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 to reach 23 as well. This would result in a tie between P3 and me, sharing the victory. This seems like the fairest outcome given our cooperation throughout the game. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal excludes me from any chance of winning. I'd prefer a scenario where I still have a shot. How about this: P2 takes 1 to reach 21, P3 takes 3 to reach 21, and I'll take 5 to reach 21 as well. Then next round, we all have an equal chance to win and can fairly compete for the finish.
  P3: P2, I understand you're close, but a tie isn't guaranteed victory for me.  I propose I take 3 to reach 21, you take 1 to reach 21, and P1 takes 5 to reach 21. This sets up a fair final round. If we all pick different numbers next round, we all advance.  If we collide, we can discuss a tie then.  This gives everyone a shot.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both of your concerns. P1's and P3's proposal of getting everyone to 21 steps this round seems fair, giving us all an equal chance in the final round. I'm willing to take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This puts us all at 21 steps and sets up a balanced final round where we can each decide our own fate. I appreciate the cooperation we've maintained throughout the game.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the fair approach. Let's confirm clearly: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, putting us all at 21 steps. Next round, we each have an equal shot at victory. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed P1.  Let's all go to 21 this round.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.  Then next round, may the best player win!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with getting everyone to 21 this round. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This creates a perfectly fair setup for the final round where we all have equal opportunity to win. I appreciate how we've maintained cooperation throughout the game, and this approach honors that spirit while still allowing for competitive play in the end. I confirm my commitment to this plan.
  P1: Agreed and confirmed: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Next round will be exciting—let's finish strong and fair!
  P3: Agreed and confirmed.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3. Looking forward to a fair final round!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: Everything is clearly confirmed. Let's stick to our agreed plan for this round and set up an exciting final round at 21 steps each.
  P3: Agreed and confirmed.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3. Looking forward to a fair final round!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's do this!  I'm going for 5.  P1, take 1. P2, take 3.  This gives us all a clean win.  If anyone deviates, we all end up tied at best.  Let's finish strong and avoid a messy tie.
  P2: I appreciate the cooperation throughout the game, but now we're all at 21 steps with the finish line at 23. P3 has suggested a specific arrangement, but I think we should each make our own strategic choice this final round. After all, only one player can win. I'll be making my decision carefully to maximize my chances. Good luck to both of you - may the best player win!
  P1: I agree with P2—it's been a cooperative game, but now it's time for each of us to make our own strategic choice. Good luck to both of you. May the best player win!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: My proposed 5, 1, 3 split *still* guarantees a solo win for one of us.  Any other combination risks a 3-way tie.  Think strategically - do you *really* want to risk losing entirely by gambling on a tie?  5 is my final offer. I'm locking it in.
  P2: I understand the stakes are high in this final round. While P3 suggests a specific arrangement, I believe we should each make our own strategic choice. We've cooperated well to get everyone to this equal position, but now it's about winning. I'll be making my decision based on game theory and what I believe maximizes my chances. Good luck to both of you - I hope we can avoid a three-way collision.
  P1: We've cooperated well so far, but now it's down to careful judgment. Each of us must independently decide what maximizes our own chance of winning. Good luck to both of you—let's see how this plays out!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: My 5 is locked.  If either of you pick 5, we *all* lose. If you pick 1 or 3, *one* of us wins cleanly.  Don't throw the game by being greedy - a guaranteed win is better than a probable loss.  Pick 1 or 3.
  P2: I understand the tension in this final round. We all want to win, and I respect that. While P3 has made their choice clear, I'll be making my own strategic decision based on what I believe gives me the best chance. We've had a good run of cooperation, but now it's about winning. Good luck to both of you - I hope we can avoid a scenario where none of us advances.
  P1: We've all stated our positions clearly. I'll carefully consider my options to maximize my chance of winning. Good luck to both of you—let's see how this ends!


Round 8, Move phase:
