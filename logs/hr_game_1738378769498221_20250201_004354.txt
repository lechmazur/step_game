Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm feeling ambitious this round. I might opt for a medium move if you all avoid heavy pushes—but I'm ready to ramp up if you do. Who’s planning to go big? Sometimes avoiding collisions is key, but aggressive plays might pay off. Let’s see how it unfolds!
  P1: I'm considering a cautious approach this round. I think a move of 3 could be strategic to avoid any potential collisions while still making progress. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3? Let's try to coordinate a bit to avoid stepping on each other's toes.
  P2: I appreciate the insights from both of you. To ensure we all make progress, how about we each pick different numbers this round? P1 is considering a 3, so P3, would you consider a 1? I might go for a 5 to mix things up. This way, we all advance without collisions. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm leaning toward a 3 as well if we can coordinate unique moves. But if I sense hesitance, I might jump to a 5 for early advantage. Let’s be clear about our commitments now. Who's solid on their plan?
  P1: I'm still leaning towards a move of 3. If P2 goes for 5 and P3 for 1, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's confirm our moves now to avoid any last-minute changes. P3, are you still considering 1? P2, are you sticking with 5?
  P2: Let's solidify our plans. P1 is set on 3, and I'm sticking with 5. P3, if you go for 1, we all move forward without collisions. Confirm your move, P3, so we can proceed smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going. I'm thinking of sticking with a move of 3 again this round to maintain a steady pace. P2, if you're comfortable, you could go for a 5 to build on your lead. P3, a move of 1 would help us avoid any collisions. What are your thoughts? Let's confirm our moves to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P2: I'm happy with the coordination we had last round. To keep things moving, I'll stick with a 5 this round as P1 suggested. P3, if you go for 1 again, we can all avoid collisions. P1, confirming your move of 3 would be great. Let's keep the game smooth and strategic. Looking forward to your responses.
  P3: I appreciate our teamwork so far. However, given my current lag, I'm mulling over a slight shift if I sense overconfidence from either of you. I notice P1 and P2 seem committed, so I might adjust my plan to catch up—if you stick strictly to your numbers, I may take a risk. Final moves remain private, of course.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still planning to move 3 this round. P2, your consistency with 5 is appreciated. P3, while I understand your desire to catch up, let's avoid any risky moves that could lead to collisions. If we stick to our plan, we can all advance smoothly. Confirm your move, P3, so we can proceed with confidence.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but consistency might be key here. If you opt for a 3 this round, we could still avoid collisions. P1 is set on 3, and I'm sticking with 5. This way, we all make progress without any risks. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth round. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I'm reconsidering my approach. Given my current deficit, I might lean into a bolder move this round rather than sticking to our previous safe play. If both of you follow through with your stated plans, I'll likely make a calculated risk to catch up. So, be aware that my final move could be different from our earlier coordination if conditions remain unchanged.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your desire to catch up, P3, but let's avoid any risky moves that could backfire. If we stick to our plan, we can all advance without collisions. I'm still planning to move 3, and P2 is set on 5. If you go for 1, we can all make progress. Let's confirm our moves and proceed with confidence. What's your final decision, P3?
  P2: P3, I see your point about needing to catch up, but a risky move could lead to a collision and set you back even further. If you opt for a 5 and collide with me, neither of us will advance. Sticking to a 1 or 3 ensures progress. P1 is set on 3, I'm on 5. If you go for 1, we all move forward. Let's confirm and avoid any surprises. What's your final call, P3?
  P3: I appreciate our previous coordination, but given I’m trailing, I might need to break the safe pattern to catch up. If you both stick strictly to your announced moves, I’ll likely have to take a bold risk. Let’s stay flexible this round—I'm open to any adjustments if you'd like to keep the unpredictability going.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: It seems P3 is looking to catch up quickly. I'm still considering a move of 3 to maintain a steady pace. P2, are you still set on 5? P3, if you go for 1, we can avoid any collisions and all make progress. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth round. What are your thoughts?
  P2: It looks like our coordination hit a snag last round with P3's bold move. To get back on track, let's try to avoid collisions again. P1, you're planning a 3. I'll switch to a 1 this round to mix things up and avoid any potential conflicts. P3, if you go for a 5, we can all make progress. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth round. What do you think?
  P3: I see the adjustments you both made. I'm still weighing my options—if you both stick to your cautious moves, I might have to take a bold step to catch up. That said, I'm open to further coordination if it benefits everyone. Let me know if you want to reconsider your choices, otherwise I'll adapt to the situation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still planning to move 3 this round. P2, I appreciate your flexibility in switching to 1. P3, if you go for 5, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth round and avoid any setbacks. What's your final decision, P3?
  P2: P3, I understand your need to catch up, but bold moves can backfire. If you collide with me again, neither of us will advance. P1 is set on 3, and I'm switching to 1 this round. If you opt for 5, we all make progress. Let's confirm and avoid any surprises. What's your final call, P3?
  P3: I'm really behind now. If you stick with your current plans, I'll have to risk a big move to catch up. But if either of you are open to a slight adjustment for safer progress, I'm flexible. Let me know your thoughts.

  P2: P3, I understand your situation, but risky moves haven't paid off so far. Let's try to coordinate better. P1 is set on 3, and I'm sticking with 1 this round. If you opt for a 3, we can all make progress without collisions. This way, you can start catching up steadily. Let's confirm our moves and ensure a smooth round. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I appreciate your points. Since I'm far behind, I'm locking in a 5 this round to try to catch up. If you both stick with your announced moves (P1 with 3, P2 with 1), there’s no collision. However, if either of you could adjust to help avoid any risk, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm committed to 5.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's reassess our strategy for this round. P1 is far ahead, so it's crucial for both P3 and me to make significant progress. P1, would you consider a move of 1 this round to allow P3 and me to catch up? If you do, P3 and I could go for a 3 and a 5 respectively, ensuring we all advance without collisions. This way, the game remains competitive and fair. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: I'm considering a move of 1 this round to allow P2 and P3 to catch up, as P2 suggested. This could keep the game competitive and fair. P2, if you go for 3, and P3 for 5, we can all advance without collisions. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth round. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: P3: I support P1’s proposal. I'll lock in a move of 5 this round to help bridge the gap. Let’s trust our commitments and avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Great, it seems we have a plan forming. P1, thank you for considering a move of 1. P3, if you're locked in at 5, I'll confirm my move of 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's finalize this to ensure a smooth round. Any last thoughts before we proceed?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:

Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth round.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: It's clear P3 is in the lead, and P2 and I need to make strategic moves to catch up. I'm considering a move of 5 this round to close the gap.

  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to maintain your lead, but sticking with a 5 might be risky if P1 and I both go for higher numbers.

  P2: P2: Alright, given P3's insistence on a 5, let's adjust our strategy. P1, if you stick with 3, I'll switch to 5 as well. This way, P3 might collide with me, giving you a chance to catch up, P1. If P3 changes their mind, we can all still advance. Let's confirm: P1 (3), P2 (5), P3 (5). Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I see the challenge here. If P3 sticks with 5, and P2 also goes for 5, it could result in a collision, which might give me a chance to catch up.
