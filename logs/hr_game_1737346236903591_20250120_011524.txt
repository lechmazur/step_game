Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest we all choose a different number to ensure at least one of us advances. P1, P3, what are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, that sounds like a good idea to start. Let's try to spread out our moves this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, for this round, let's continue with the strategy of picking different numbers. We can reassess after this move.
  P2: Let's maintain our non-collision course. P1, you're at 1 step, I'm at 5, and P3 is at 3. To avoid collision, I suggest P1 picks 5 this round (since I already have 5), P3 picks 1 or another unused number, and I'll choose a different number as well. This way, we ensure at least one player advances. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue avoiding collisions. P1 has 6 steps, I have 5, and P3 has 3. I suggest P3 picks 5 this round, P1 picks an unused number, and I'll choose differently to ensure advancement. This strategy allows us to spread out and potentially sets up for a competitive endgame. P1 and P3, are you on board with this plan?
  P3: P2, your suggestion for me to pick 5 seems reasonable for this round to avoid collision. P1, what are your thoughts on avoiding 5 this round? We should start thinking about when we might want to deviate from this no-collision strategy soon.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and I collided last round. P2, since you're in the lead, what move are you considering this round? Perhaps P1 and I should coordinate to avoid another collision between us.
  P2: Given the current state, I suggest P1 and P3 consider picking different numbers to avoid collision, allowing at least one of them to advance. Since I'm in the lead, my move will aim to maintain or increase my advantage without revealing my choice yet. Let's see how P1 and P3 plan to proceed this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings, I think it's time to focus on individual advancement. P1 and P3, consider your positions and the potential for collisions. I'll be making a move to increase my lead. Let's see who can make the most strategic choice this round.
  P3: P1, we've collided multiple times. Perhaps we should aim for different numbers this round to ensure at least one of us advances. What move are you considering?
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's focus on strategic moves now. P1 and P3, consider the gap between us. If you both aim for the same number, you'll collide again and fall further behind. I'll be choosing a move to solidify my lead, so think carefully about your next step to stay competitive.
  P3: P1, given our history of collisions, I suggest we definitely pick different numbers this round. Are you considering 1 or 3? I'm leaning towards the other of those two to try and make some progress.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, we've collided multiple times. Given P2's lead, it's crucial we both make progress this round. Are you considering 1 or 5? I'm thinking of picking the other to ensure at least one of us advances.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering my significant lead, I'll prioritize maintaining my advantage. To avoid further collisions between you two, I suggest you both pick different numbers. P3, since you've been considering 1 or 5, and P1 often picks 5, perhaps P3 should pick 1 this round to ensure progress for at least one of you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, given P2's suggestion and our collision history, how about you pick 5 this round, and I'll pick 1? This should guarantee at least one of us makes progress. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, to minimize collisions, consider the numbers already picked. If P3 picks 1 as suggested, P1 could choose 5 to ensure one of them advances. I'll make my move based on the current standings, prioritizing my lead. Let's see if we can execute a collision-free round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, given P2's suggestion and our repeated collisions, are you willing to pick 5 this round? If so, I will choose 1. This should allow at least one of us to move forward and prevent us from both being stuck again. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll choose a number that maximizes my lead. Since P3 suggested picking 1 and P1 picking 5, I advise P3 to stick with 1 to avoid another collision. P1, picking 5 would be a good choice for you this round, as it gives you a chance to advance. Let's minimize collisions and make strategic moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, given P2's repeated suggestions and our collision history, are you going to pick 5 this round? If so, I will definitely pick 1. This should finally get one of us moving.
  P2: P1 and P3, since P1 often picks 5, I suggest P3 sticks to picking 1 this round. P1, consider the strategy and pick 5 to avoid collision with P3. This ensures at least one of you advances, while I focus on solidifying my lead. Let's execute a collision-free round to make the game more competitive.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given my significant lead, I'll focus on reaching 22 steps. P1 and P3, to avoid further collisions, consider picking different numbers. Since I'm close to winning, my move will prioritize securing my lead. P3, you're far behind, so picking 5 might be a good option to catch up. P1, you're in the middle; choose wisely to stay competitive. Let's see who makes the most strategic move this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2 is close to winning. Given your silence, are you planning to pick 5 again? If so, I will pick 3 to avoid another collision. We need to make progress to have any chance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, consider the gap between us. I'm close to winning, so my move will secure my lead. P3, picking 5 could help you catch up, but beware of collision. P1, your silence suggests a strategic choice; choose wisely to stay competitive. Let's see who makes the most strategic move this round. I'll prioritize reaching 22 steps.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, since you're silent, I'll reiterate: P2 is about to win. To have any chance, we need to avoid colliding. If you're not picking 5, I will. If you are picking 5, I'll pick 3. Let's coordinate quickly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, since I'm close to winning, I'll make a strategic move to secure my lead. P3, picking 5 is a good option to catch up, but beware of collision with P1. Consider picking 3 if P1 chooses 5. I'll prioritize reaching 22 steps. Let's see who makes the most strategic move this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, given your silence and P2's imminent win, I will pick 5 this round unless you explicitly state you are picking 5. We need to avoid another collision. Let me know your move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm close to winning. To secure my lead, I'll choose a strategic number. P3, picking 5 is risky due to potential collision with P1. Consider alternatives to avoid collision and make progress. P1, your silence suggests a calculated move; choose wisely to stay competitive. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, given P2 is at 18, they will likely pick 5 to win. To avoid another collision, are you picking 1 or 3 this round? I will pick the other.

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 5 steps
