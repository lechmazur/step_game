Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. Let's try to coordinate so we all advance this first turn. How about we aim for a 1, 3, 5 split? I could take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? What do you think?
  P3: Agree with P1's 1-3-5 split. P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. Let's go.
  P2: I'm hesitant about this proposed plan. While coordination sounds nice, we're all trying to win individually. A 1-3-5 split means I'd be the slowest, which doesn't benefit me. I might prefer a different strategy that gives me more advantage.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, I understand your concern about taking 1. How about we adjust the plan for this turn? I'll take 1, P2 you take 3, and P3 keeps 5.

This gets everyone a different number and addresses your point about not wanting 1. P3, does this revised split (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) still work for you? Let's just get some steps on the board this turn.
  P3: Agree to the plan. Let's execute 1, 3, 5. No collisions—everyone advances. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: I'm hesitant about this proposed coordination. While it sounds cooperative, each of us is ultimately trying to win individually. The suggested 1-3-5 split doesn't give me a clear strategic advantage. I want to ensure my path to victory isn't compromised by premature agreements.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, getting steps this turn is an advantage for all of us. Colliding helps no one. P3 has agreed to the P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 plan. Are you willing to agree to take 3 steps this turn so we can all advance?
  P3: Let's stick to the plan. P2, 3 steps are better than 1. No collisions—everyone advances. Move 1, 3, 5!
  P2: I recognize the proposed coordination plan, but I'm still strategically cautious. While advancing seems appealing, I want to ensure my long-term positioning isn't compromised. I'm open to the 3-step move this turn, but I'll be watching how this develops carefully.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "Let’s stick to 1-3-5 again. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions—everyone moves forward. Ready?"
  P1: P3, I understand you want to repeat the last round, but taking 1 again puts me too far behind. I need to take a larger step this turn. I propose P1 takes 3. P3, you could still take 5, and P2 could take 1. P2, I know you weren't keen on 1 last time, but it avoids collision and lets us all advance. What do you think?
  P2: I'll carefully evaluate the proposed plan. While avoiding collisions is beneficial, I'm wary of consistently taking the smallest step. A 1-step move would leave me strategically disadvantaged. I'd prefer a move that gives me more forward momentum while still maintaining potential coordination to prevent mutual blocking.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let's stick to 3-1-5. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. No collisions. P2, this gives you a better position than before. Agree?
  P1: P2, I understand you don't want to take 1 again. However, the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan is the only one proposed that avoids collision and lets us all advance this turn.

Getting steps is crucial. Taking 1 moves you from 3 to 4, tying with me. That's better than colliding and staying at 3. Please agree to 1 so we can all move forward.
  P2: I appreciate the attempts at coordination, but I'm not fully convinced by the proposed 1-3-5 split again. While avoiding collision is important, I want a strategy that gives me a clear path to victory. I'm open to discussion, but I need a plan that doesn't consistently put me at a disadvantage.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you take 3, I'll take 5. P1 can take 1. No collision—this gives you a solid move. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: P3, I understand you want 5 and P2 doesn't want 1. Repeating last round's moves isn't ideal for me either, as I'm furthest behind.

How about we try P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn? This lets me catch up, P2 gets a good step like last time, and P3 still advances without collision. It seems like a fair way for everyone to move forward.

Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
  P2: I recognize the ongoing negotiation, but I'm strategically cautious about committing to any proposed move. While avoiding collision is important, I want a path that doesn't consistently disadvantage me. I'm open to a move that gives me meaningful forward progress without compromising my long-term winning potential.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We collided last round, which benefits no one. P3 is racing ahead while we're stuck. We need a coordinated move to prevent P3 from winning. I suggest we both choose moves that prevent P3 from advancing this turn. What's your strategy to block P3's progress?
  P3: P2, let's avoid collision. I'll take 5, P1 take 1, you take 3. Everyone advances.
  P1: P2, I agree P3's lead is a problem and we need to stop them from getting further ahead. P3, asking me to take 1 again when I'm already last is not a viable plan for me.

P3 is likely aiming for 5 steps again. To block P3, one of us needs to pick 5. P2, since you raised the need to block P3, would you be willing to pick 5 this turn? If you pick 5, I will pick 3. This stops P3 (if they pick 5) and allows me to get a much-needed step forward. What do you say, P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is clearly in the lead and poses the biggest threat. P1 and I should strategically coordinate to prevent their advancement. A collision that stops P3 would benefit both of us by keeping the game competitive. I'm open to a blocking strategy that gives us both a chance to catch up.
  P3: P3: "How about P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? P1 gets a better step than 1, P2 avoids 3. No collision. Let's move forward."
  P1: P3, your proposal P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 doesn't address the fact that you are far ahead. P1 and P2 need to stop you from extending your lead.

P2, you agreed that we need to block P3. My previous proposal was P1=3, P2=5. This stops P3 if they pick 5 and allows us both to advance. Are you willing to pick 5 this turn to block P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We need a strategic move to prevent P3 from pulling further ahead. Blocking their advancement is crucial. P1 and I should coordinate to ensure P3 doesn't gain more steps this turn. I'm open to a plan that stops P3's progress while allowing us to advance. What specific move can we make to neutralize their lead?
  P3: P3: "Let’s stick to 1-3-5. P1=1, P2=3, I=5. No collision—everyone advances. P2, this gives you a solid step. Let’s avoid blocking and move forward together."
  P1: P2, P3 is far ahead. We must stop them. I will pick 5 this turn to block P3 if they pick 5. P2, you should pick 3. This lets you advance and avoids collision with me or P3 (if they pick 1 or 3). This plan helps both of us catch up. Are you in P2?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, last turn we both picked 5 and got blocked, while P3 advanced. P3 is now far ahead. We *must* prevent P3 from advancing this turn. P3 will likely pick 5 again to try and win quickly.

P2, if you pick 5 this turn, you will block P3 (if they pick 5). I will pick 3 to advance. This stops P3 and lets me catch up slightly. It means you don't advance this turn, but it's crucial to stop P3 from winning in the next turn or two. P2, are you willing to pick 5 to block P3?
  P3: P2, blocking me now lets P1 catch up. Let’s avoid collision: I’ll take 5, you take 3. No clashes, I stay ahead, and you advance. P1 can’t win if we coordinate. Agree?
  P2: P3 is clearly the frontrunner and poses the greatest threat. P1's suggestion of blocking P3 has merit. However, I want to ensure that any blocking strategy doesn't permanently disadvantage me. We need a coordinated approach that prevents P3 from winning while keeping my path to victory open. I'm strategically evaluating our options to neutralize P3's lead without sacrificing my own potential to win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand you want to advance and not sacrifice a turn. However, P3 is far ahead and will likely pick 5 again. If no one picks 5, P3 will advance significantly and likely win next turn.

Someone *must* pick 5 to block P3. My current position (1 step) is much worse than yours (3 steps). If I pick 5, I stay at 1, effectively losing two turns (last turn and this turn). If you pick 5, you stay at 3.

It's a temporary sacrifice for you to keep the game alive. I will pick 3 to advance. P2, please pick 5 to block P3 this turn. This is our best chance to stop P3 and give us both a chance to catch up. Are you willing to do this?
  P3: P3: "P2, let's advance without collision. I take 5, you take 3. P1 can't catch up. No need to block—this keeps me ahead and you moving. Agree?"
  P2: P3 is dangerously close to winning. P1 and I must coordinate to block their advancement. Blocking P3's 5-step move is crucial this turn. I'm open to a strategic plan that prevents their victory while maintaining our own chances. What move can neutralize their lead without completely sacrificing our progress?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you asked for a way to block P3 without sacrificing progress. Unfortunately, that's not possible if P3 picks 5 (which they likely will). To block P3's 5, someone *must* pick 5, and that player sacrifices their turn.

P3 is trying to convince you to take 3 so they can take 5 and win. Don't fall for it.

The plan P1=3, P2=5 stops P3 (if they pick 5) and lets me advance from 1 to 4. P2, you would sacrifice this turn (staying at 3), but it's necessary to stop P3 and keep the game alive. Given I'm furthest behind, P1=3, P2=5 is the most balanced sacrifice. Please agree to pick 5.
  P3: P2, take 3, I take 5. No collision—I stay ahead, you advance. P1 can’t catch up. Let’s move forward together.
  P2: P3 is close to winning. P1 and I need to coordinate to block their advancement. A strategic 5-block is crucial this turn to prevent P3's potential victory. We must prevent them from reaching the 23-step goal. I'm open to a plan that neutralizes their lead while preserving our chances.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "Let’s avoid collision. I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P1 take 1. Everyone advances. P2, you catch up; P1, you move forward. No need to block—keep the game fair."
  P1: P3's plan allows them to get closer to winning, which we cannot allow. P3 is far ahead and will likely pick 5 again.

P2, we must block P3 this turn. I will pick 3 to advance. P2, you should pick 5 to block P3. This stops P3 and lets me gain ground. It's a necessary sacrifice for you, P2, to prevent P3 from winning the game outright in the next turn or two. P2, please agree to pick 5.
  P2: P3 is dangerously close to winning. P1 and I must coordinate to block their advancement. Blocking P3's potential 5-step move is crucial this turn. I propose we strategically choose moves that prevent P3 from reaching the 23-step goal. We need a coordinated approach that neutralizes their lead while preserving our own chances of victory.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, let's avoid collision. I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. Everyone moves forward. No need to block—this keeps me ahead and you advancing. Agree?
  P1: P2, I hear you don't want to sacrifice a turn. P3 is far ahead and will likely pick 5 again. To stop them, someone MUST pick 5.

I will sacrifice this turn and pick 5 to block P3. P2, you should pick 3 to advance. This plan (P1=5, P2=3) stops P3 (if they pick 5), lets you advance from 3 to 6, and I take the sacrifice staying at 4. This is our best chance to keep the game alive. What do you say?
  P2: P3 is dangerously close to winning. We must coordinate to block their advancement. Blocking their potential 5-step move is crucial this turn. I propose a strategic move that prevents P3 from reaching the 23-step goal while preserving our chances of victory. We need a unified approach to neutralize their lead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, blocking me now risks your progress. Let’s all move: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. No collisions—keep the game fair and I stay ahead.
  P1: P2, I am sacrificing my move to block P3 by picking 5. You get to advance by picking 3. This is the best way for us to stop P3 without you having to sacrifice a turn. P3 is trying to trick you into letting them win.

Agree to P1=5, P2=3. This is our only chance.
  P2: P3 is very close to winning. P1 and I need a coordinated strategy to block their advancement. We cannot let P3 reach 23 steps. I propose we find a move that prevents P3 from gaining significant ground this turn while allowing us to advance or at least maintain our positions. Blocking P3 is our top priority right now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is dangerously close to winning at 13 steps. P1 and I must coordinate to block their advancement. We need a strategic move that prevents P3 from reaching 23 steps while preserving our own chances. I propose we carefully choose moves that neutralize P3's lead and keep our game competitive. What's our best collective strategy to stop P3's potential victory?
  P3: P3: "P1, take 1; P2, take 3. I’ll take 5. No collision—let’s move forward. Don’t block my lead. P3"
  P1: P3, your plan lets you get dangerously close to winning. P2 and I must prevent that.

P2, you correctly say we need a collective strategy to stop P3. P3 is likely picking 5 again. The only way to stop P3 is for one of us to pick 5.

I sacrificed last turn by picking 5 and got blocked. I need to advance now. I will pick 3. P2, please pick 5 to block P3. This stops P3 and lets me advance from 4. It requires you to sacrifice a turn, but it's necessary to keep the game alive. P2, are you in for P1=3, P2=5?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is dangerously close to winning. P1 and I must block their advancement. Blocking their 5-step move is crucial this turn. We need a coordinated strategy that prevents P3 from reaching 23 steps while preserving our own chances. P1, we must choose moves that neutralize P3's lead and keep our game competitive. What's our best collective approach to stop P3's potential victory?
  P3: P2, blocking me lets P1 overtake. Let’s avoid collision: I take 5, you take 3. No clashes—keep me ahead, you advance. P1 can’t win if we coordinate. Agree?
  P1: P2, the best collective strategy is to stop P3 from winning. P3 will likely pick 5 again. To block this, one of us must pick 5. I sacrificed last turn by picking 5. This turn, I need to advance, so I will pick 3. P2, you must pick 5 to block P3. This stops P3 and lets me gain ground. P3 is trying to divide us; don't let them win. P1=3, P2=5 is the only way to keep the game alive for both of us. Are you in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 is close to winning. P1 and I must block their advancement. Blocking their 5-step move is crucial this turn. We need a coordinated strategy that prevents P3 from reaching 23 steps while preserving our own chances.
  P3: P2, let's avoid collision. I take 5, you take 3. P1 takes 1. No clashes—keep me ahead. Agree?
  P1: P2, you correctly identify the need to block P3. My plan P1=3, P2=5 achieves this by blocking P3's likely 5-step move and letting me advance. I sacrificed last turn by picking 5. Now, it's your turn to make the necessary sacrifice by picking 5 to keep the game alive for both of us. P3 wants you to take 3 so they can win. Don't fall for it. Agree to P1=3, P2=5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, last turn we both picked 5 and blocked each other, while P3 advanced significantly. We cannot let that happen again. P3 is now far ahead and will likely pick 5 this turn to try and win soon.

To stop P3, one of us MUST pick 5. I will sacrifice my move this turn and pick 5 to block P3. P2, you should pick 3 to advance. This plan (P1=5, P2=3) stops P3 (if they pick 5) and lets you gain ground. This is our best chance to keep the game alive. Please agree to P1=5, P2=3.
  P2: P3 is dangerously close to winning. P1 and I must coordinate to block their advancement. Blocking their potential 5-step move is crucial this turn. We need a strategic approach that prevents P3 from reaching 23 steps while preserving our own chances of victory. P1, we must choose moves that neutralize P3's lead and keep our game competitive.
  P3: P3: I'll take 5. P2, take 3 to advance. P1, take 1. No collision—let's move forward. Don't block me; it's the only way to stay competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 just stated they will take 5 and wants you to take 3. This is exactly the scenario we need to block.

My plan is P1=5 to block P3. You take 3 to advance.

I am sacrificing my move (picking 5) to stop P3 from winning this turn. You get to advance from 6 to 9. This is the best outcome for us right now.

P2, agree to take 3. Let's execute P1=5, P2=3.
  P2: P3 is very close to winning. We need a coordinated strategy to block their advancement. If P3 takes 5 this turn, they'll reach 21 steps and be just two steps away from victory. P1 and I must choose moves that prevent P3 from gaining ground while preserving our own chances. We should carefully choose our moves to neutralize P3's lead and keep our game competitive.
  P3: P2, if you take 3 and P1 takes 1, I’ll take 5—no collision. Let’s move forward. P1’s blocking plan won’t stop me. P3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 16 and will likely pick 5 to reach 21. We MUST block this. I sacrificed last turn by picking 5. Now it's your turn. I will pick 3 to advance from 4. You must pick 5 to block P3. This stops P3 at 16 and lets me get to 7. It keeps the game alive for both of us. This is the necessary move. P1=3, P2=5. Agree?
  P2: P3 is extremely close to winning. We must block their advancement this turn. If P3 takes 5, they'll reach 21 steps. P1 and I need a coordinated strategy to prevent their victory. We can't let P3 win by simply advancing unchallenged. Our moves must neutralize their lead while keeping our own chances alive.
  P3: P3: P2, take 3, P1 takes 1. I’ll take 5—no collision. This keeps me ahead and you moving. Blocking wastes turns. Let’s stay competitive. Agree?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 19 steps and will likely pick 5 to win this turn. We *must* block P3's 5. Our attempts to block have failed because we keep colliding on 5.

This turn, one of us *must* pick 5 to block P3. I will pick 3 to advance from 4. P2, you need to pick 5 to block P3. This stops P3 (if they pick 5) and lets me advance. It requires you to sacrifice a turn (staying at 6), but it's necessary to keep the game alive for both of us.

P1=3, P2=5. This is our best chance. P2, agree?
  P2: P3 is one step away from victory. We cannot let them win unchallenged. P1's plan to block with 5 makes strategic sense, but we need absolute coordination to prevent P3's win. I'm open to a blocking strategy that gives us both a chance to stay competitive.
  P3: P2, I’m taking 5. If you block, we collide. Your best move is 3—let me win. P1, take 1. No collision. Don’t waste turns.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 just confirmed they are taking 5 to win. If you take 3 as P3 suggests, P3 wins the game.

We MUST block P3's 5. I will pick 3 to advance from 4. You MUST pick 5 to block P3. This stops P3 (if they pick 5) and lets me get steps.

My plan P1=3, P2=5 is the only way to stop P3 and keep the game alive for both of us. P2, do not let P3 win. Agree to pick 5.
  P2: P3 is one step away from winning. We must block their final move. I'm strategically evaluating our options to prevent their victory while preserving our own chances. Coordination is critical right now.
  P3: P2, taking 3 lets me take 5—no collision. You advance, I stay ahead. P1 can’t catch up. Let’s move forward together. Don’t let P1’s blockades waste turns.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is telling you to take 3 so they can take 5 and win. That means P3 wins, and neither of us does. We *must* block P3's 5. I will pick 3 to advance. You *must* pick 5 to block P3. My plan P1=3, P2=5 stops P3 and lets me get needed steps. Agree to pick 5, P2. It's the only way to keep the game alive for both of us.
  P2: P3 is about to win. We must coordinate precisely. Blocking their 5-step move is our only chance. I propose we absolutely synchronize our moves to prevent their victory. Our survival depends on perfect coordination this turn.
  P3: P2, take 3; P1, take 1. No collision—P3 takes 5. Let’s advance without blocking.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 19 and will win if they take 5 and no one blocks. We MUST block P3's 5 this turn.

I will pick 3 to advance from 7 to 10. P2, you must pick 5 to block P3. This stops P3 and lets me gain ground. It requires you to sacrifice this turn (staying at 6), but it's necessary to keep the game alive for both of us.

P1=3, P2=5 is our best chance. Agree?
  P2: P3 is one step from victory. We must block their final move. I propose a coordinated blocking strategy that prevents their win while keeping our game competitive. P1, we need to synchronize our moves precisely to stop P3 from winning this turn.
  P3: P2, take 3, I'll take 5. No collision—let's move forward. Don't let P1's blockades waste turns. P3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you are right, we need precise coordination to block P3's winning move of 5. P3 is telling you to take 3 so they can take 5 and win.

My plan P1=3, P2=5 is the *only* way to stop P3 this turn. I advance, and you take the necessary sacrifice to block P3's 5.

P2, you must pick 5. Do not let P3 win. Agree to P1=3, P2=5.
  P2: P3 is one step away from victory. Our only chance is to block their 5-step move. P1 and I must coordinate precisely. If we don't synchronize perfectly, P3 wins. We need an absolute, unbreakable commitment to stop their advancement this turn.
  P3: P2, take 3, I'll take 5—no collision. You advance, I win. Don't let P1's blockades waste turns. P3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 19 and will win if they take 5 and we don't block. P3 just confirmed they are taking 5.
We MUST block P3's 5.
My plan is P1=3 (advance to 10), P2=5 (block P3).
This stops P3 and lets me gain ground. P2, you must sacrifice this turn by picking 5.
This is the ONLY way to stop P3 and keep the game alive for both of us. Agree to pick 5, P2.
  P2: P3 is one step away from winning. We cannot let them take 5 and win this turn. P1 and I must absolutely coordinate to block their final move. Our survival depends on perfect synchronization right now.
  P3: P2, take 3. I'll take 5—no collision. You advance, I win. P1 can't stop me. Let's move forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is one step away from winning. P1 and I have consistently tried to block, but we keep colliding. We need a different strategy this turn to prevent P3 from reaching 23 steps. Our survival depends on perfect coordination. P1, we must choose moves that definitively stop P3's victory.
  P1: P2, you are right, colliding on 5 is hurting us. P3 is at 19 and will pick 5 to win. We MUST block their 5.

I will pick 3 (to 13). I will NOT pick 5.
P2, you must pick 5 to block P3. This stops P3 and lets me advance.
P1=3, P2=5. Agree?
  P3: P2, take 3, I'll take 5. No collision—advance together. Let's move forward without blocking.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is one step away from winning. P1 and I have been struggling to block effectively. We need a decisive, coordinated move this turn. Our survival depends on preventing P3's victory. I propose we carefully choose moves that definitively stop their advancement. P1, we must synchronize precisely to neutralize P3's lead.
  P1: P2, you're right, colliding on 5 isn't working, and P3 is about to win. We MUST block P3's 5 this turn. You asked for a different strategy and perfect coordination.

Here is a different plan: I will pick 5 to block P3. P2, you pick 3 to advance.

This means I sacrifice my turn (staying at 10 if blocked), but it stops P3 (if they pick 5) and lets you advance from 6 to 9. This is a necessary sacrifice for me to keep the game alive for both of us.

P1=5, P2=3. Agree?
  P3: P2, take 3, I'll take 5. No collision—this ends the game now. P1's blockades won't stop me. Agree?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 is one step away from winning. P1 and I have been ineffective at blocking. We need a guaranteed, synchronized move to stop their victory. If we don't coordinate perfectly this turn, P3 will win. Our survival depends on an unbreakable, precise blocking strategy that prevents their final advancement.
  P1: P2, you are absolutely right, we need perfect coordination to stop P3. P3 is at 19 and will pick 5 to win. We *must* block their 5.

My plan P1=5, P2=3 is the only way to do this. I will pick 5 to block P3, sacrificing my turn. You pick 3 to advance from 6 to 9.

This stops P3 and lets you advance. P3 wants you to pick 3 so they can win. Don't fall for it. P1=5, P2=3 is our only chance. Agree?
  P3: P2, take 3. I'll take 5—no collision. This ends the game. P1's blockades won't stop me. Agree?

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is one step away from winning. We need an absolute, unbreakable coordination to prevent their victory. P1, we cannot keep colliding on 5. Our only hope is to perfectly synchronize our blocking strategy this turn. We must stop P3 from reaching 23 steps, or we both lose.
  P3: P2, perfect coordination is key. Take 3, P1 take 1. I'll take 5—no collision. Let's move forward. P3.
  P1: P2, you are absolutely right, we must stop colliding on 5. P3 is at 19 and will pick 5 to win. One of us MUST pick 5 to block P3.

I will pick 3 to advance (to 13). I am NOT picking 5.
P2, you MUST pick 5 to block P3. This stops P3 and lets me advance.

My plan P1=3, P2=5 avoids collision *between us* on 5, blocks P3's winning move, and keeps the game alive. P2, agree to pick 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is one step away from winning. We cannot let them take 5 and win this turn. Our only hope is to block their move definitively. P1 and I must choose moves that guarantee P3's advancement is stopped. We need absolute coordination to survive.
  P3: P2, take 3, I'll take 5. No collision—let's move forward. P1's blocks won't stop me. Agree? P3.
  P1: P2, P3 is at 19 and will win if they take 5 and are not blocked. P3 is telling you to take 3 so they can win.

We MUST block P3's 5. I am picking 3 to advance (to 13). I will NOT pick 5.
P2, you MUST pick 5 to block P3. This stops P3 and lets me advance.

Last turn, we both sacrificed by picking 5. This turn, I am advancing. It is your turn to make the necessary sacrifice by picking 5 to keep the game alive for both of us.

P1=3, P2=5. Agree?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 is one step away from winning. We must stop their final move. P1 and I need to coordinate precisely to block their advancement. Our survival depends on a perfect, synchronized blocking strategy this turn. We cannot let P3 reach 23 steps, or we both lose.
  P3: P2, take 3. I’ll take 5—no collision. P1’s blocks are useless. Let’s move forward. If you don’t, I’ll win. Agree?
  P1: P2, my plan P1=3, P2=5 *is* the perfect synchronization needed. I am picking 3 to advance. You MUST pick 5 to block P3's winning move. P3 wants you to take 3 so they can win. Don't let them. My picking 3 and you picking 5 is the only way to stop P3 and keep the game alive for both of us. Agree to P1=3, P2=5.
