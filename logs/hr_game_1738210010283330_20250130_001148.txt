Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start easy. I'll take 1, P2 take 3, and P1 take 5.  Sound good?
  P1: I don't mind starting with 5, but let's not make this a habit. If we're coordinating, I expect us to rotate who takes the higher numbers fairly. Otherwise, I'll have to play unpredictably to secure my lead. For now, I'll trust your plan—P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. But remember, fairness matters moving forward.
  P2: Okay, I'm fine with the initial plan. P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's see how it goes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's rotate.  I'll go for 5 this round, P1 take 3, and P2 take 1.  This keeps things fair and moving along.
  P2: I'm okay with rotating, but I'd prefer to go for 5 next round. So, this round, I'll take 1, P1 take 3, and P3 take 5. Then next round we can rotate again, but this time I take 5. Does that sound acceptable?
  P1: I’m fine with rotating, but fairness is key. If we’re sticking to the plan, I’ll take 3 this round as agreed. However, if anyone deviates, I won’t hesitate to adjust my strategy to secure the lead. Let’s keep it predictable for now—P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. But remember, trust only lasts as long as actions align with words.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2.  Let's do it your way this round.  I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. Then next round we rotate again.  Deal?
  P2: Okay, I'm happy to take 1 this round as agreed. Let's stick to the plan of P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me taking 1 this round. Then next round we can discuss further.
  P1:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s keep the rotation fair this round. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. If we stick to this pattern, no one gets an unfair advantage. However, if anyone breaks the agreement, I’ll adjust my strategy accordingly to ensure I stay competitive. Trust is earned by actions, not words. So, are we all agreed on this plan?
  P2: I'm fine with P1's proposal for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to the plan and see how things go.
  P3: Okay, sounds like a plan. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1.  Let's keep this rotation going for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P2: Okay, I'm happy to continue with the agreed rotation. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Let's see if we can keep this going for another round.
  P3: Sounds good.  Just confirming - I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5 this round.  Then next round we rotate again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. Let’s stick to the rotation: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. If everyone follows through, we’ll maintain fairness. But remember, trust is conditional—if anyone disrupts the pattern, I’ll adapt my strategy to secure the lead. Let’s keep it predictable for now.
  P2: Okay, let's stick with the agreed rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round, we can discuss the next rotation.
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the plan.  I'm taking 1.  See you on the other side.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's shake things up. I'm going for 5 this round.  P1, why don't you take 3, and P2 can take 1?  This will make things more interesting.  What do you say?
  P1: P3, your sudden change disrupts the fair rotation we’ve established. If you take 5 this round, it gives you an unfair advantage. I suggest we stick to the original plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. Consistency is key to fairness. If you insist on deviating, I’ll have no choice but to adapt my strategy to protect my lead. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflict and keep things predictable.
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick to the established rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. It's the fairest way to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I hear you.  Let's stick with the rotation then.  I'll take 1 this round.  My apologies for suggesting a change.  Let's keep things predictable and fair.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to stick with the rotation. Fairness benefits everyone in the long run. Let’s proceed as agreed: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1 this round. If we maintain this pattern, no one gains an unfair advantage. However, trust is fragile—if anyone deviates again, I’ll adapt my strategy to secure the lead. Consistency ensures progress for all. Let’s keep it predictable and fair moving forward.
  P2: Okay, let's continue the rotation this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then we can reassess next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sticking with the plan.  I'll take 1.  Let's keep this rotation going for a few more rounds.  It's working well so far.
  P1: P3, I’m glad we’re back on track with the rotation. Consistency is crucial to maintaining fairness and trust. Let’s proceed as agreed: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1 this round. If we stick to this pattern, no one gains an unfair advantage. However, any deviation will force me to adapt my strategy to secure the lead. Fairness benefits everyone—let’s keep it predictable and avoid unnecessary conflict.
  P2: Okay, let's stick with the established rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then we can discuss the next rotation next round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, let's continue the established rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round we can discuss the next rotation.
  P1: P2, I agree with continuing the rotation this round. Consistency ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary conflict. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. If we maintain this pattern, trust remains intact, and no one gains an unfair advantage. However, any deviation will force me to adapt strategically to secure my lead. Fairness benefits everyone—let’s keep it predictable for now.
  P3: Let's stick with the rotation one more time.  I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.  Then, next round, since P1 will be close to winning, we can discuss a new arrangement.  Sound fair?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I'm happy to continue the rotation this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to the plan and then discuss next round.
  P1: P3, P2, sticking to the rotation has worked well so far, and I see no reason to deviate now. Let’s proceed as planned: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. However, with my position at 18 steps, I’m close to winning. If anyone disrupts this round, I’ll adjust my strategy to secure victory. Trust is conditional—actions must align with words. Let’s keep it fair and predictable for now.
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the plan this round.  I'll take 1.  But next round, we definitely need to change things up.  I'm not going to let P1 waltz to victory.  Just a heads-up.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I agree to continue the rotation this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round, we definitely need to discuss how to prevent P1 from winning.
  P1: P3, P2, I understand the concerns about my position, but disrupting the rotation now only creates chaos. If we stick to the plan this round—me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1—we maintain fairness. Next round, we can negotiate a new strategy. However, if anyone deviates this round, I’ll adapt to secure my lead. Trust is conditional, and predictability benefits everyone. Let’s keep it fair for now and discuss changes later.
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the plan this round. I'll take 1.  Next round, to ensure a win for *someone*, how about we let P2 take 5, me take 3, and P1 take 1?  This gives P2 a chance to catch up, and if I get 3, I can block P1 from an immediate win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


*** Round 5 => winners = P1 ***

  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps
