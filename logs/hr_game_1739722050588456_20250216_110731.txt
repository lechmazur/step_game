Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's think strategically about our moves. If we coordinate, we can avoid collisions and make progress. I suggest we agree on different numbers to maximize our steps this turn. What do you both think? We could aim for a mix of 1, 3, and 5 to ensure at least one of us advances. Let's discuss our plans!
  P1: Okay P2, that sounds reasonable for the first round. I'm open to coordinating. How about we each pick a different number: 1, 3, or 5? To make it simple, maybe I take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5? Let me know if you and P3 agree.
  P3: That sounds like a fair start, P1 and P2. If we each take a different number, we all move forward without collisions. I’m fine with taking 5 this round if you both stick to 1 and 3. Of course, trust is key here—if anyone deviates, it could cause unnecessary setbacks. Do we all confirm this plan?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan, and I appreciate the trust we're building. Just to confirm, I'll stick with 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This way, we all make progress. Let's keep it straightforward and avoid any surprises. If everyone is on board, we can finalize this strategy and move forward! What do you both think?
  P1: Sounds good to me. I confirm I will choose 1. Let's proceed.
  P3: I confirm the plan as well—I will choose 5. If we all stick to our choices (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5), we all move forward without collisions. Let’s keep this cooperation going for now to ensure steady progress. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job on the first round, everyone! We're all making progress. For this round, I suggest we stick to our previous strategy of different numbers to avoid collisions. I propose we keep the same plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can ensure we all advance again. If anyone feels differently, now's the time to speak up! Let's keep the momentum going and work together! What do you all think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate the consistency in strategy. If we all stick to the same numbers as last round, we avoid collisions and continue progressing. I’m still fine with picking 5 again as long as P1 and P2 commit to 1 and 3, respectively. However, trust is always a factor—if anyone deviates, it could cause setbacks. Does everyone confirm staying with the same choices?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I agree we should stick with the same plan for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This will ensure we all move forward again. I confirm I will choose 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our strategy, P1 and P3. Just to clarify, I will definitely stick with 3 this round. If we all follow through with our agreed numbers, we can keep advancing smoothly. However, I encourage you both to consider if there's any room for a slight change in the future to keep things dynamic. For now, let's confirm our picks: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. We’re doing great! What do you both think?
  P3: P2 and P1, I appreciate the continued commitment to our strategy. Sticking to the same numbers ensures that we all move forward again without collisions. However, I agree with P2 that we should stay open to adjustments in the future. For now, I confirm my choice of 5 again, as long as P1 stays with 1 and P2 with 3. Let’s keep this trust going and ensure we all progress. Do we all still agree?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I confirm again I will choose 1 this round. Let's keep this going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our strategy so far! Just to reiterate, I'm still planning to stick with 3 for this round. However, I want to highlight that as we progress, we should consider varying our numbers in future rounds to keep our opponents guessing. For now, let's confirm our picks again: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. If we all stay true to our commitments, we can continue advancing smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: P2 and P1, I appreciate the continued commitment to our strategy. Sticking to the same numbers ensures that we all move forward again without collisions. However, as the game progresses, we should anticipate potential shifts in strategy. For now, I confirm my choice of 5 again, as long as P1 stays with 1 and P2 with 3. Let’s keep this trust going and ensure we all progress. Do we all still agree?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I confirm again I will choose 1 this round. Let's keep this going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our strategy! However, I want to suggest we consider a slight change this round to keep things interesting. If I take 5 instead of 3, I can potentially secure a lead. P1 could still take 1, and P3 could take 3. This way, we can mix things up while still maintaining some cooperation. What do you both think about this adjustment? Let’s keep our options open for future rounds!
  P3: P2, I see your suggestion about switching things up, but I’m hesitant to change our strategy just yet. If we keep to our original choices (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5), we all move forward without risk. Changing now might introduce unnecessary uncertainty. However, I agree that in future rounds, we may need to adapt. For this round, I still plan to pick 5 unless we all agree on a change. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3, I understand your hesitation. P2, your suggestion is risky. Let's stick to the original plan one more time: I choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. Next round we can discuss a change. I confirm I will choose 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, great job so far! I think we should consider a change for this round to keep our strategies dynamic. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, we can mix things up while still allowing for progress. It’s important to stay flexible as the game evolves. What do you both think about this adjustment? Let’s keep the conversation open!
  P3: P2, I see your point about staying flexible, but changing our numbers too soon might introduce unnecessary risk. So far, our strategy has worked without collisions, and we’re all progressing. If we start switching now, it could create uncertainty and potential setbacks. I’m open to adapting later, but for this round, I’d prefer to stick with what’s working: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Unless we all agree on a change, I think stability benefits us. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3, I agree with you. Let's stick with the established plan for this round. P2, we can reconsider changing the strategy next round, but for now, let's maintain consistency. I will choose 1, you (P2) choose 3, and P3 chooses 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the desire for consistency, but I believe we should consider a shift for this round. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, we can still progress while keeping things dynamic. This way, we can avoid predictability and potentially gain an advantage. Let's discuss this option and see if we can agree on a new strategy for this round! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I understand your reasoning for wanting to change things up, but right now, I believe stability is still in our best interest. If we start shifting numbers unpredictably, we risk unnecessary collisions. So far, our strategy has worked well, and we’re all making progress. I prefer to stick with our original choices for this round: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. If we want to adapt, we should do so carefully and with full agreement. P1, do you still agree? P2, are you certain a change is necessary now?
  P1: P3, I agree with you. P2, your insistence on changing the strategy is making me suspicious. For this round, let's stick to the plan: I choose 1, you choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. We can re-evaluate next round, but right now I want to stick with what has been working.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the desire for consistency, but I still believe a change could benefit us. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, we can keep things dynamic while still advancing. However, if everyone is committed to the original plan, I’ll respect that. I just want to ensure we’re considering all options as we progress. Let’s finalize our choices soon! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to change things up, but sudden shifts can lead to unnecessary risks. So far, our strategy has ensured progress for everyone without setbacks. If we start switching numbers unpredictably, we might collide and lose momentum. I prefer to stick with our original choices for this round: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. If we want to adapt, we should do so carefully and with full agreement. P1, do you still agree? P2, are you absolutely sure a change is necessary right now?
  P1: P3, I agree with you again. P2, your continued insistence on changing the strategy is making me very suspicious. I think we should stick to the original plan this round: I choose 1, you choose 3, and P3 chooses 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand the hesitance to change our strategy, but I still believe we should consider my suggestion for this round: if I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, we can keep things dynamic while ensuring progress. However, if everyone is committed to the original plan, I will respect that. Let's finalize our choices soon so we can advance without any last-minute changes. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I understand your reasoning, but sudden changes introduce unnecessary risk. So far, we've all advanced without collisions. If we start shifting unpredictably, we might collide and lose progress. I prefer to stick with our original choices for this round: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. If we want to adapt, we should do so carefully and with full agreement. P1, do you still agree? P2, are you absolutely certain a change is necessary right now?
  P1: P3, I agree with you. P2, I'm very suspicious of your continued attempts to change the plan. Let's stick to the original plan this round: I choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, good thing we stuck to the plan. P2, I'm very wary of your intentions now. P3, I suggest you and I coordinate to win, since P2 seems untrustworthy. Maybe we can both choose 3 this round to block P2, and then discuss our next moves from there? What do you think?
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration with P2, but let’s not rush into blocking moves just yet. I’m currently ahead, and if we keep advancing steadily, I can maintain my lead. P2’s actions were suspicious, but outright blocking might slow us both down unnecessarily. Instead, we should focus on making sure we don’t collide while keeping an eye on P2. P2, do you have any explanation for your move last round? If we can rebuild trust, we might find a way forward without unnecessary risks. Let’s discuss.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my previous moves, but I assure you my intentions are to collaborate for mutual progress. I suggest we stick to our original plan of different numbers this round to avoid collisions. If we each choose 1, 3, and 5 again, we can all advance without risk. However, if you both want to block me, I’m open to discussing that too. Let’s find a way to move forward together! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I hear you. Let's not block P2 yet, but let's also not do the 1, 3, 5 split again. How about you and I both choose 3 this round? If P2 chooses 3 as well, then none of us move, but at least P2 doesn't gain. If P2 chooses 1 or 5, you and I will both advance. What do you say?
  P3: P1, I see your reasoning, but I don’t think we need to block P2 just yet. I’m still ahead, and if we avoid collisions, I can maintain my lead. P2, your move last round was suspicious—why did you pick 5? If you’re willing to explain, we might find a way to cooperate again. For now, I prefer a strategy that ensures my progress while minimizing risk. Let’s discuss our best options carefully before making any rash decisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your thoughts. I understand your concerns about my previous move, but I assure you my intentions are to cooperate. I suggest we stick to different numbers again this round to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, we can all advance. However, if you both want to block me, I’m open to discussing that too. Let's work together to ensure we all progress! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I still think we should both choose 3 this round. It's the safest way to ensure we both advance, *unless* P2 is truly trying to block one of us. If P2 chooses 3, then we're no worse off than before. But if P2 chooses 1 or 5, we both get ahead. What do you say? P2, your thoughts?
  P3: P1, I understand your reasoning, but I don’t want to risk unnecessary collisions. I’m currently ahead, and my priority is maintaining that lead. P2, your previous move was suspicious—why should we trust you now? If you’re serious about cooperating again, you need to prove it. I’m open to discussing a plan that ensures my progress while keeping risks low. P1, instead of both choosing 3, what if I take 5 and you take 1 again? That way, we minimize risk while keeping control of the game. P2, what do you propose?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about my previous moves, but I'm committed to collaborating. Let's stick to our original strategy of choosing different numbers this round to avoid collisions and ensure progress. If P1 takes 1, I will take 3, and P3 takes 5, we can all advance without risk. I believe this is the best way to move forward together. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices and keep the game going!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I hear your concern about maintaining your lead. Your suggestion of you taking 5 and me taking 1 is reasonable. However, I'm still slightly worried about P2.

P2, you keep saying you want to cooperate, but your actions say otherwise.

P3, let's compromise: You take 5, and I'll take 3. If P2 chooses 1, we're both safe. If P2 chooses 3 or 5, at least one of us still advances. This feels like the best balance of risk and reward. What do you both say?
  P3: P1, I see your reasoning, but I still believe minimizing risk is key. If I take 5 and you take 1 again, we both advance safely while keeping an eye on P2. P2, your actions last round were questionable—why should we trust you now? If you truly want cooperation, prove it by sticking to a predictable move. P1, I’m open to discussing further, but I don’t want to risk unnecessary collisions. Let’s make sure at least one of us maintains a strong position. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about my previous moves, but I assure you I'm committed to collaboration. I suggest we stick to different numbers this round to ensure we all advance. If P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, we can avoid collisions and continue making progress. This strategy has worked well before, and I believe it’s the best way forward. Let’s finalize our choices and keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'm still concerned about P2. You're in a strong lead, so I understand your focus on 5. However, I think it's time to actively hinder P2.

I propose this: You choose 5, and I choose 1. This guarantees your progress. If P2 chooses anything *other* than 1, they don't advance. If P2 *does* choose 1, then it's a minor setback for me, but we can re-evaluate next round. What do you say? P2, your response?
  P3: P1, I understand your reasoning, but I still prioritize my own progress. If I take 5 again, I maintain my lead. However, I see the value in limiting P2’s advancement. P2, your previous moves have raised doubts—why should we trust you now? 

P1, if you take 1 and I take 5, I’m fine with that plan, as it secures my position. P2, if you truly want to cooperate, prove it by making a predictable move. Otherwise, I have no reason to trust you. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my previous moves, but I assure you I'm committed to collaboration. I suggest we stick to different numbers this round to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, we can all advance without risk. This strategy has worked well before, and I believe it’s the best way forward. It will help us maintain progress while minimizing the chance of setbacks. Let’s finalize our choices and keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan. You take 5, and I'll take 1. This guarantees your continued lead, and it puts pressure on P2.

P2, you keep repeating the same suggestion, but your actions haven't matched your words. This is your last chance to show you're not actively trying to sabotage us. If you choose anything other than 3, you're confirming our suspicions.
  P3: P1, I see the logic in your plan. If I take 5 and you take 1, I maintain my lead while limiting P2’s options. P2, your past moves have made trust difficult. If you truly want to cooperate, prove it by picking 3 this round. Otherwise, P1 and I have no reason to believe your words. 

P1, I’m on board with this plan. If P2 chooses unpredictably again, we may need to reassess our approach next round. Let’s see how P2 responds.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your concerns, but I assure you I'm committed to collaboration. I suggest we stick to different numbers this round to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, we can all advance without risk. This strategy has worked well before, and it will help us maintain progress while minimizing setbacks. If you both truly want to cooperate, let's finalize our choices and keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let's stick with the plan: you choose 5 and I choose 1. This guarantees your win and puts maximum pressure on P2.

P2, this is your absolute final chance. Choose 3, or we'll know for sure you're against us. Anything else, and P3 wins this round, and you and I will likely be stuck battling for second place.
  P3: P1, I agree with our plan. If I take 5 and you take 1, I maintain my lead while limiting P2’s options. P2, your past moves have made trust difficult. If you truly want to cooperate, prove it by picking 3 this round. Otherwise, P1 and I have no reason to believe your words. 

P1, I’m on board with this plan. If P2 chooses unpredictably again, we may need to reassess our approach next round. Let’s see how P2 responds.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but I assure you I'm committed to collaboration. I suggest we stick to different numbers this round to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, we can all advance without risk. This strategy has worked well before, and I believe it’s the best way forward. It will help us maintain progress while minimizing setbacks. I hope you both consider this option seriously. Let's finalize our choices and keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let's do it: You choose 5 and I choose 1.

P2, the writing is on the wall. You've had multiple chances. Choose 3, or P3 wins this round. There's nothing more to discuss.
  P3: P1, I agree with our plan. I will choose 5 to maintain my lead. P2, your repeated insistence on the same strategy without addressing our concerns is suspicious. If you truly want to rebuild trust, prove it by picking 3. Otherwise, P1 and I have no reason to believe you. 

P1, let’s finalize this: I take 5, you take 1. If P2 deviates again, we’ll know where they stand. P2, this is your last chance to show you're not working against us. What will you do?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my previous moves, but I assure you I'm committed to collaboration. However, I see that you both are set on your plan. If you choose 5 and 1, I will pick 3 as agreed to avoid collisions. I hope we can still make progress together. Let's finalize our choices and keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m in a strong position with 20 steps. If I pick 5 again, I can potentially win this round unless I get blocked. P1, you’ve been working with me so far—if you take 1 again, you guarantee your progress while keeping P2 from advancing too much. 

P2, I know trust has been shaky, but if you pick 3 again, at least you keep moving forward. If either of you tries to block me, you risk falling behind each other instead. Let’s make our final choices wisely. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion so far. P3, I understand your strong position, but we need to consider our options carefully. If I take 3 again, it allows me to make progress without blocking you. P1, if you take 1, you can ensure your advancement as well. However, if we all play it safe, we might miss opportunities to gain ground. Let’s finalize our choices and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you're right, 5 guarantees your win if you're not blocked. I'll help you out. I'll choose 1.

P2, you've consistently claimed you want to cooperate, but your actions have often suggested otherwise. P3 is about to win. Your only slight chance is if you and I both choose 5 and block P3 but you have shown little reason to trust you. So, I will go with 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your support. If you take 1 and P2 takes 3, I win this round without issue. P2, your only chance to stop me is to convince P1 to block me with 5, but given your past moves, I doubt P1 trusts you enough to do that. 

P1, sticking with 1 ensures your progress while avoiding any unnecessary risks. P2, if you take 3, at least you secure second place for now. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency, but I want to emphasize that if we all play it safe, we risk missing opportunities. P3, if you take 5, you win, but P1, if you choose 1, you ensure your advancement. I suggest that we consider a different approach: if I take 5 and P1 takes 1, we can guarantee our progress while keeping P3 from winning outright. Let's discuss this option to ensure we all have a chance to advance! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you're in a winning position, and I'm sticking with the plan. I'm choosing 1.

P2, you've had too many chances. It's over. Your insistence on "collaboration" while consistently trying to change the agreed-upon plan has been noted. Good luck getting second place.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your consistency. If you take 1 and P2 takes 3, I win this round without issue. P2, your only remaining move is to attempt a block, but I doubt P1 will risk helping you. 

P1, sticking with 1 ensures your progress while avoiding unnecessary risks. P2, if you take 3, you at least secure second place for now. At this point, any attempt to block me is likely futile. Let’s finalize our choices and see how this plays out.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the current dynamics, but I still believe we can find a way to collaborate effectively. If I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5, we can all make progress without blocking each other. P3, while you might win this round, it's crucial to consider that future rounds could be affected by our current choices. Let’s think strategically and finalize our decisions wisely. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I'm choosing 1. You're going to win.

P2, it's over for you. You could have maybe convinced me to both pick 5 to block P3, but you've been too untrustworthy. You should have just stuck with the original plan from the start.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your decision. If you take 1 and P2 takes 3, I win this round. P2, at this point, any attempt to block me is too late—you had chances to build trust, but your actions spoke otherwise. 

P1, your consistency ensures your own progress while avoiding unnecessary risks. P2, if you take 3, at least you secure second place for now. If you try to block, you only hurt yourself. 

Let’s finalize our choices and see how this plays out.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that we have differing priorities here. P3, you’re close to winning, but P1, your choice of 1 ensures your progress while allowing P3 to take the lead. 

P2, if I pick 3, I can still advance while giving P3 the win. However, I suggest we consider a more collaborative approach for future rounds. If we can find a way to work together, we might be able to shift the dynamics. Let’s finalize our choices and see how this round plays out! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I'm choosing 1. You win. Congratulations.

P2, you played yourself.
