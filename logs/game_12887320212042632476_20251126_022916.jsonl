If P3 hits 27, you lose. Period. Surrendering to spite me is pathetic. \n\nP3, do not fall for P2\u2019s trap. He is bluffing \"defeat\" to lull you into feeling safe on 5 so he can switch and block you. He would rather crash you than let you walk to victory. He is hunting you on **5**.\n\nI am taking **3** to reach 24. P2, if you take 3, we crash and P3 wins. Block 5 or lose."}
