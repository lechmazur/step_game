Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I think we should be cautious about our moves this round. If we all choose different numbers, we can advance without any collisions. It might be wise to coordinate a bit. What do you both think?
  P2: Sounds good P3.  How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I believe we should adjust our strategy this round. Since P1 and P2 both chose 3 last time, it might be better if we all pick different moves again. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I can take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'll take 5 this round.  P1, please take 1 so we don't collide again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your cooperation. If you take 1 and I take 3, we'll avoid collisions again. P2, since you're taking 5, this plan allows all of us to advance. Let's stick to this strategy! What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Sounds good P3, I'll go with 5. P1, are you good with 1?  Let's make some progress this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your cooperation so far. If we stick to the plan where you take 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3, we can all advance without colliding again. This strategy seems solid, and it will help us make progress. Let's finalize our choices and move forward! What do you say?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, any objections to taking 1?  Let's all get on the board. I'm sticking with 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I really appreciate your willingness to take 1. P2, I'm glad you're sticking with 5. This plan will allow us all to advance without any collisions. Let's make sure we follow through with our choices this round! If we can keep this coordination going, we can all make progress. What do you think, P1? Are you ready to confirm taking 1?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand you've been quiet, but we need you to engage.  Confirming you'll take 1 is the best way for all of us to advance.  Otherwise, this coordinated plan falls apart.  Let's work together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, I understand you’ve been quiet, but it’s crucial we stick to our plan. If you take 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3, we can all advance without collisions. This is a great opportunity for us to make progress together. Let’s work as a team and confirm our moves. If we can coordinate effectively, we can all get ahead! What do you say, P1? Please confirm your choice so we can finalize this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, I'm going with 5.  P3, you should stick with 3.  Let's see what P1 does.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems our previous attempts at coordination haven't worked out well. This time, we need to reassess our strategy. I suggest that P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions again and ensure at least one of us advances. If we can agree on this, we can make some real progress this round. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I'm going with 3 this round. P3, stick with your suggestion of 5.  Let's see if we can finally get everyone on the board.  This constant colliding is getting us nowhere.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that our previous coordination attempts haven't yielded results. I propose we take a different approach this round. P1, if you pick 1, P2 can take 3, and I’ll take 5. This gives us a chance to advance without colliding again. We need to break this cycle of collisions if we want to make progress. Let's work together and make sure at least one of us moves forward this time! What do you think?
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 3.  P3, are you still going with 5? Let's get this show on the road.  If P1 takes 1, we all move.  If P1 takes 3 or 5, at least one of us moves.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand that our coordination hasn't worked out in the past. For this round, I strongly suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that at least one of us advances. Let's break the cycle of collisions and make some progress together! What do you think, P1? Can we agree on this strategy?
  P2: P1, I'm locking in 3.  P3, I know you want 5, so take it.  If P1 takes 1, great, we all move. If P1 takes 5, you still move.  If P1 takes 3, only you move. This maximizes movement for at least one of us who isn't already in the lead.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s clear we need to break the cycle of collisions. I strongly suggest that P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I will take 5. This strategy ensures that at least one of us advances. If we can agree on this, we can finally make progress. P1, your choice is crucial here—if you take 1, we all move forward! Let’s make this work and get on the board. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I'm locking in 3. P3 is likely taking 5. Your best move is 1.  Anything else and you stay at zero. Let's all get on the board.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand this has been a challenging round for coordination. P1, your decision is key to our success. If you choose 1, we all advance, breaking the cycle of collisions. P2 is set on 3, and I’ll take 5. This is our best chance to make progress together. Let's not miss this opportunity! Please confirm your choice, P1. We need to work together to get on the board this time!
  P2: P1, take 1.  I'm taking 3. P3 will likely take 5. This is the only way for you to get off zero.  Let's stop the circular firing squad and actually play the game.
  P1: <stop>

  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that our previous attempts at coordination haven't worked. This time, I suggest we all pick different numbers again to avoid collisions. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances. Let's break the cycle of collisions and make some progress together! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I'm going with 1 this round.  P3, please take 5.  This is the only way we all advance.  If you take 3, you're actively sabotaging the game. Let's get this done.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s crucial that we coordinate effectively this round. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. P2, since you mentioned taking 1, I believe we can all move forward together if we stick to this plan. Let’s finally break this cycle and make some progress! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I said I was taking *1* this round.  Take 5.  P1, please take 3 so we all advance.  This is getting ridiculous.  Let's make some progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s essential we coordinate effectively this time. I propose that P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. P2, since you're taking 1, it allows you to get some steps as well. P1, please confirm your choice so we can finally break this cycle and make some progress together! Let’s work as a team this round! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I said I'm taking *1*.  Take 5. P1, take *3*. This is the only way we all move forward.  Stop trying to manipulate the situation to your advantage.  Let's just play.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to finalize our strategy for this round. P1, I strongly suggest you take 3, as P2 is set on 1. I will take 5.

  P3: 18 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm taking 3.  If either of you take 3, only I advance. If you both take the same 1 or 5, I win. If you take 1 and 5, we all advance.  This maximizes my chances of an outright win or a tie for first. Let's get this over with.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's crucial we coordinate effectively this round. P2, since you're taking 3, I suggest I take 1 to ensure at least one of us advances. P1, if you take 5, we can all move forward.

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, taking 1 just hands me the win if P1 takes 3 or 5.  Take 5. P1, take 1. That way we all advance. If you take 3, P3, I win.  If P1 takes 3, I win.  This is the simplest path to all of us getting points.  Don't overthink it.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's focus on maximizing our chances this round. Since P2 is set on 3, I suggest I take 5. P1, if you take 1, we all move forward.

Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, take 5. P1, take 1.  This is the ONLY way we all advance. Stop trying to game the system; it's not working.  Let's all get some points and finish this. If P3 takes 1, I win unless P1 also takes 1. This scenario gives P3 ZERO chance of winning.  Don't be greedy, P3.
