Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all try to move differently this turn to make sure we all advance. I'm thinking of moving 1. What about you two?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is close to winning, so let's mix it up this round to keep P1 from getting to 18. I suggest P1 moves 1, P2 moves 5, and I (P3) move 3. This way, we can potentially slow P1 down and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
