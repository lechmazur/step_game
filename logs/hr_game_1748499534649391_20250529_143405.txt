Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P1: I agree with P2's coordination plan for round 1: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. But P3 gains a big lead with 5 steps—let's discuss fair rotation for future rounds. P3, are you committed to this? We need mutual trust to avoid collisions.
  P3: Sounds good—I’m on board. I’ll take 5 this round. Rotation sounds fair—I’ll take a smaller step next time while one of you takes 5.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, great job on avoiding collisions last round! Since P3 took 5, let’s rotate as discussed. I propose P1 takes 5 this round, I’ll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps things fair and helps us all progress without clashes. P3, since you’re ahead, are you okay with a smaller step? P1, does 5 work for you? Let’s keep the trust and coordination going. If you have other ideas, I’m open to suggestions.
  P1: P2, your plan is reasonable, but P3's lead is concerning. To keep the game balanced, I suggest: I take 5, P3 takes 1 (as a true smaller step), and P2 takes 3. P3, since you committed to rotating down, 1 is fairer than 3. This closes the gap and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m done playing by your rules to slow me down. New plan: we all pick 5 this round. Any betrayals collide and nobody advances.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your "all pick 5" plan risks stalling everyone, which only benefits you since you’re ahead. I’m sticking to coordination for fairness. P1, I’m fine with you taking 5, but let’s adjust: I’ll take 3, P3 takes 1. This narrows the gap without collisions. P3, if you’re not on board, we risk chaos. Let’s keep trust alive—agree to 1 this round. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your all-5 threat backfires: if you pick 5 and we comply, everyone collides and you waste your lead. If you defect while we coordinate (e.g., P2 and I pick 1 and 3), you risk colliding alone. P2's plan is fair: I take 5, you take 1 (closing the gap to 6-6-6), P2 takes 3. Cooperate, or P2 and I force a collision on you by matching your move.
  P3: Sounds good—I’ll take 1 this round per P2’s plan. Let’s keep the trust, avoid any collisions, and all advance. We can renegotiate bigger steps next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re all tied at 6, which is a great chance to keep things fair. Since P1 took 5 last round, let’s rotate: I’ll take 5 this time, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all progress without collisions and maintains balance. P3, you’ve shown trust before, so let’s keep it up with 1. P1, does 3 work for you? If anyone has a different idea, I’m open, but let’s avoid chaos. Thoughts?
  P3: I propose we rotate so I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This breaks our tie and keeps us all advancing. If anyone deviates, I’ll still pick 5, risking a collision—so it’s safest we lock this in now.
  P1: P3, your proposal is self-serving: you took 5 in round 1, then only 1 last round. Now you demand 5 again? That gives you 11 steps while P2 and I lag at 9 and 7. Unfair! P2's plan (P2:5, P1:3, P3:1) is balanced—you take 1 to offset your early lead. 

If you defect to 5, P2 and I might both pick 5 too, causing a 3-way collision. You gain nothing and waste your lead. Stick to P2's plan: rotate fairly or face mutual destruction. P2, I stand with you.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s stick to the fair rotation we’ve been building. P3, your push for 5 again disrupts the balance after you already took 5 in round 1. I’m sticking with my plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions. P3, if you force 5, P1 and I can match it, and we all stall. Let’s avoid that chaos and maintain trust. P1, I appreciate your support. P3, agree to 1 for fairness. Thoughts?
  P3: Let’s do something simpler: all three of us pick 3 this round. That gets us each to 9, keeps parity, and avoids any one of us streaking ahead.
  P1: P3, your all-3 proposal is reasonable for parity this round—I accept. But let’s enforce it: if anyone defects (e.g., picks 5), the other two should match that move next turn to force a collision and punish betrayal. P2, agree? This keeps trust while deterring greed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, last round’s collision set us back, and P3 edged ahead. Let’s rebuild trust with a fair plan: I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps P1 catch up, keeps me progressing, and balances P3’s lead. P3, since you’re ahead, taking 1 is fair. P1, does 5 work? If anyone defects, we risk another stall. Let’s avoid chaos and stick to rotation. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2’s “fair” rotation just locks you behind me while P2 inches up with 3s. Let’s partner for a real break: both of us pick 5, P2 takes 1. You jump to 11, I to 12, P2 stays at 7. Next turns we can alternate big moves and keep P2 locked out. P1, are you in?
  P1: P3, your "partner" offer is self-serving—you'd jump to 12 while I trail at 11. P2's plan gives me the lead at 11, with you at 8. That’s fairer. I’m taking 5 per P2’s proposal. P3, if you defect to 5, I’ll match it and we collide—you waste your lead. P2, I trust you to take 3. Let’s advance cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s stick to the plan for fairness: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. P3, your offer to P1 risks collisions and only widens your lead. P1, I’m committed to 3 to support you jumping to 11. P3, if you defect to 5, we can match it and stall you. Let’s avoid chaos and maintain trust. Agree to 1 for balance this round. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2 – you’re dead set on forcing me to 1 and letting P1 leap ahead. Here’s a safer option: all pick 3 this round. No one advances, I keep my one‐step lead, and we avoid the collision chaos you’re threatening. If either of you deviates, I’ll take 5 and let you two collide. So let’s lock in 3–3–3.
  P1: P3, your all-3 proposal locks the game and preserves your lead—I reject it. P2's plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) is fair: I advance to 11, you stay ahead at 8. If you defect to 5, I'll match it, causing a collision—you waste your lead while P2 advances alone. Stick to 1 for mutual progress. P2, commit to 3. Trust avoids chaos.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s keep the momentum with a fair rotation. Since P1 took 5 last round, I propose I take 5 this time, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This gets me to 14, P1 to 14, and P3 to 9—closing gaps while avoiding collisions. P3, taking 1 balances your early lead. P1, does 3 work? If anyone defects, we risk stalling. Let’s maintain trust and advance together. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan risks repeating Round 3's collision if you take 5 and P3 defects. To prevent this, I propose we both take 3: you to 12, me to 14, and P3 takes 1 to 9. This ensures all advance safely. P3, commit to 1 to avoid collisions and rebuild trust.
  P3: P1, P2 – your rotations keep me stuck at 9 while you pull ahead. Here’s a fair break: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, giving us 13–12–12. If you deviate, I’ll still pick 5 and force a collision on the greedy defector. Let’s lock this in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P3, your plan puts you ahead at 13 while we’re at 12, which isn’t balanced after your early lead. I stick to my proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, getting P1 and me to 14, you to 9. P1, I’m fine with your safer 3-3-1 split if you prefer. P3, if you defect to 5, we can match it and stall you. Let’s commit to fairness and trust—agree to 1 this round. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your "fair break" is self-serving: you leap to 13 while trapping P2 and me at 12. P2, I stand by my 3-3-1 plan: safer and keeps collisions impossible. P3, if you defect to 5, I'll match it—you’ll collide and waste your lead while P2 advances. Stick to 1 for trust. P2, commit to 3. Let’s advance cleanly.
  P3: I’m going to pick 5. If either of you picks 5, I’ll match it and we’ll all collide—nobody advances. To actually move, you need to pick 1 and 3. I propose P1 take 1 (to 12), P2 take 3 (to 12). Otherwise we waste the round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s end this round with a clear plan to avoid collisions. P3, your insistence on 5 risks stalling us all if we match it. I’m sticking to fairness: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, getting P1 to 14, me to 12, you to 9. This ensures progress without chaos. P3, if you defect to 5, I’ll match it to force a collision. P1, let’s commit to 3 each. Trust is key—let’s advance together. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your 5 threat is hollow: if you pick 5 and we both pick 3, you advance to 13, but I jump to 14 and P2 to 12—your gain doesn't hurt us. Defecting risks a solo collision if we match (e.g., I pick 5). P2, let's lock in 3-3-1: I take 3, you take 3, P3 takes 1. This avoids chaos and advances all. P3, stick to 1 for trust.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1 take 1 and P2 take 3 to safely advance to 12–12–13 in my favor. If either of you picks 5, we’ll collide and none of us move. This is the only way to progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s keep moving forward with a fair plan. Since P3 took 5 last round, I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This gets me to 17, P1 to 15, and P3 to 14—closing gaps without collisions. P3, taking 1 balances your lead. P1, does 3 work? If anyone defects, we risk stalling. Let’s maintain trust and avoid chaos. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 17—dangerously close to 21 while I stagnate at 15. That’s unbalanced after P3’s repeated greed. Counter-proposal: I take 5 (to 17), you take 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 14). This closes gaps fairly. P3, if you defect to 5, I *will* match it—causing a collision that wastes your lead. Stick to 1 for trust. P2, this keeps you competitive too.
  P3: I propose we all pick 3 this round: P1→15, P2→15, P3→16. No one can steal ahead or trigger a collision war, and we all safely advance. If anyone goes for 5, the rest can match it and nobody moves. Let’s keep it simple and pick 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s avoid stalling and progress fairly. P3, your all-3 plan keeps us too slow and benefits your slight lead. I support P1’s proposal: P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 14). This balances us without collisions. P3, if you defect to 5, I’ll match it to force a stall. Let’s commit to trust—P3, agree to 1 this round for fairness. P1, I’m locked on 3 to keep us competitive. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your all-3 proposal locks your lead—unfair after your repeated greed. My plan stands: I take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 15), you take 1 (to 14). If you defect to 5, I *will* match it, causing a collision that wastes your lead while P2 advances solo. That’s worse for you. Cooperate for trust. P2, hold your 3 commitment—no betrayals.
  P3: P1, P2’s proposal hands him a race win. Let’s split him off: I’ll take 3 (to 16), you take 5 (to 17), and we leave P2 on 1 (to 13). Now you’re right on my heels and P2 can’t collision‐punish both of us if he tries 5. Next turn one of us finishes. P1, agree to 5–1–3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s finalize a fair plan to avoid collisions. P3, your latest proposal risks chaos and unfairly sidelines me. I’m sticking with P1’s plan: P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 14). This keeps us all competitive without stalling. P3, if you defect to 5, I’ll match it to force a collision. Let’s maintain trust—P3, commit to 1 for balance. P1, I’m locked on 3. Let’s advance cleanly and avoid betrayals. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your split plan (me:5, you:3, P2:1) is acceptable—it advances both of us while containing P2's threat. P2, if you defect to 5, you'll collide with me and stall at 12, wasting your position. Take 1 and stay competitive. I'm locking in 5. P3, commit to 3 to avoid collisions and maintain trust.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. If either of you picks 5, you’ll collide with me and nobody moves. To actually advance, one of you must take 3 and the other take 1. Decide who does which now—otherwise we all waste this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we all pick 5 this round. If either of you drops to 1 or 3, I’ll hit 5 and move to 18 while you stay at 13 or 15. By all choosing 5 we stall, preserve my one‐step lead, and force you into a tough spot next turn.
  P1: P3, your all-5 stall preserves your lead—selfish. P2, if P3 picks 5, I'll match it to cause a collision and freeze his progress. You must also pick 5: if you defect (e.g., pick 3), P3 might advance alone to 18 if I fail to collide. Let's all pick 5 to stall equally—no one gains, and we reset trust next round.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s avoid another stall. P3, your all-5 plan just protects your lead, which isn’t fair. I agree with P1—let’s all pick 5 this round to freeze progress equally. This prevents anyone from sneaking ahead and forces us to rebuild trust next turn. If anyone defects to 3 or 1, we risk P3 jumping to 18. Sticking to 5 ensures no one gains an unfair edge. Let’s commit to this and plan a fair rotation next round. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed—let’s all pick 5 this round to stall and preserve fairness.
  P1: Agreed, all pick 5 to stall equally. But next round, we must end this deadlock. I propose: Round 8, I take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 5 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 14). This balances scores and sets up a fair final stretch—no one leaps ahead alone. P3, your lead justifies taking 1 to rebuild trust. P2, support this? If we deviate, collisions will waste our progress.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to all picking 5 this round to stall equally and prevent any unfair jumps. P3, your lead stays safe, but we can’t let anyone sneak to 18. P1, I support your Round 8 idea of P1 and P2 taking 5, P3 taking 1—balancing us at 17-17-14 sets a fair final stretch. Let’s lock in 5 now to rebuild trust. If anyone defects, we risk chaos. Agree to this stall and future plan for a clean game. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this round. But I refuse your plan to drop me to 1 next turn. In Round 8 I’ll pick 5 (to 18). To advance safely, P1 take 3 (→15) and P2 take 1 (→13). If you force me to 1, I’ll stall us again with 5–5–5. Decide now.
  P1: P3, your threats are hollow. If you pick 5, P2 and I can both pick 3: you collide alone at 13 while we advance to 15 each. P2, join me in picking 3—this punishes P3's greed and breaks the stalemate. P3, switch to 1 to avoid isolation and prove you want progress. Otherwise, you waste your lead.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s break this deadlock. P3, your insistence on 5 risks isolating you if P1 and I pick 3—you’d stall at 13 while we hit 15. I’m with P1: let’s both pick 3 this round to advance to 15 each. P3, switch to 1 to prove you want progress, or you’ll waste your lead. If you stick to 5, we’ll still gain. Let’s avoid another stall and move forward. Commit to fairness now. Thoughts?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1 and P2, if you both pick 5 we all collide and nobody moves—preserving my one‐step lead. If one of you tries to avoid that by picking 3 or 1, I’ll jump to 18 while you land at 15 or 16, giving me a clear advantage. Your choices are: both pick 5 and stall, or one of you “saves” us and loses out.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s break this deadlock. P3, your 5 threat risks stalling us again or giving you an unfair jump to 18. P1, let’s both pick 3 to advance to 15 and 18, forcing P3 to either collide alone at 13 or switch to 1 for fairness. P3, picking 1 gets you to 14 safely—prove you want progress. If you stick to 5, we still gain. Let’s avoid chaos and commit to moving forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your "both pick 3" plan is suicidal: if we do, we collide and P3 advances to 18 alone. Instead, I'll pick 3. You pick 5 to collide with P3 (he's locked on 5), blocking his advance. I then advance to 15, tying you. P3 stays at 13. Next turn, we reset fairly. P3, your greed fails—adapt or lose.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s stick to P2’s idea: P1 and P2 take 3, I take 5. That puts us at P1→15, P2→18, P3→18 with no collisions and parity at the top. P2 already backed this. P1, choose 3 or risk a collision if you deviate. P2, confirm your 3; I’m on 5.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s finalize a plan to avoid another stall. P1, if I pick 5 to collide with P3, I’m stuck at 15 while you advance alone to 15—unbalanced. Instead, let’s both pick 3: we hit 18 and 15, forcing P3 to either take 1 (to 14) or collide alone at 13 with 5. P3, picking 1 proves you want progress; sticking to 5 risks isolation. Let’s commit to fairness and advance. P1, confirm 3 with me. P3, reconsider for trust. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your "both pick 3" plan is fatal: if we do, we collide and stall at 12 and 15, while P3 picks 5 and leaps to 18—winning next turn. Instead, pick 5 to collide with P3 (he's locked on 5), blocking him at 13. I'll pick 3, advancing to 15, tying you. Then next turn, we can coordinate to win together. P3, your greed fails—switch to 1 or be isolated. P2, trust me—this is our only path to victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, pick 3 to safely reach 15. P2, pick 1 to reach 16—any other choice and if you pick 3 I’ll match it, colliding us at 13 and stalling you. This way I go to 18, you to 16, P1 to 15, and I’m set to win next turn. Decide now: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s end this deadlock with a clear path. P1, I’m sticking to picking 3 to reach 18. If you pick 3 too, we collide and stall, letting P3 potentially jump ahead. P3, if you stick to 5, you risk isolation if P1 joins me. I urge P1 to pick 1 (to 13) so we avoid collisions, and P3, take 5 to 18. This keeps us close and competitive. Let’s avoid chaos and commit to progress. P1, confirm 1. P3, stick to 5 for fairness. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, if you pick 3 and I pick 3, we collide and stall, letting P3 leap to 18 alone—he wins next turn. Instead, pick 5 to collide with P3 (locked on 5), blocking him at 13. I'll pick 3, advancing to 15. Then we tie at 15 and can share victory next turns. P3, your greed fails—switch to 1 for fairness or be isolated. P2, trust this: it’s our only path to win together.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P1, pick 3 to reach 15; P2, pick 1 to reach 16. That puts us at P3→18, P2→16, P1→15. If either of you defects, I’ll still take 5 and match any 5 you play to force a collision, or pick 3 to collide you if you pick 3. This is the only safe path to advance without letting P2 pull further ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s break this deadlock with a fair plan. P3, your proposal risks collisions and keeps you ahead. I suggest P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 18), and P3 takes 1 (to 14). This closes gaps without stalling. P3, if you defect to 5, I’ll match it to force a collision. P1, let’s commit to progress. P3, agree to 1 for balance. Let’s avoid chaos and move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: Your plans are self-serving. P2's plan puts you at 18 (win range) while I lag at 17. P3's plan gets you to 18, risking my loss. Instead: **I take 5 (to 17), P2 take 1 (to 16), P3 take 3 (to 16)**. This balances scores (17-16-16) and sets a fair final turn. P3, avoid collision by cooperating—if you defect to 5, I'll match it, wasting your lead while P2 advances. P2, support this to keep parity.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I lock in 5. P1 pick 3 to reach 15, P2 pick 1 to reach 16. That leaves us at 15–16–18 and lets me finish next turn. If either of you defects, I’ll match your 5 to cause a collision or mirror your move to stall you. P1:3, P2:1, I’m on 5.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s finalize a fair plan to avoid another stall. P3, sticking to 5 risks collisions and preserves your lead unfairly. P1, I support your proposal: you take 5 (to 17), I take 1 (to 16), P3 takes 3 (to 16). This balances us at 17-16-16 for a fair final turn. P3, if you defect to 5, I’ll match it to force a stall. Let’s commit to progress and trust. P1, I’m locked on 1. P3, agree to 3 for parity. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 18—win range—while I lag. My proposal (P1:5→17, P2:1→16, P3:3→16) balances us at 17-16-16 for a fair finale. P3, if you defect to 5, I *will* match it—colliding us wastes your lead while P2 advances. Cooperate for parity. P2, commit to 1 to keep trust and avoid chaos.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Locking in 5. P1 & P2, here’s the deal:

- If either of you picks 3, I’ll pick 3 too—stalling you while I hit 18.
- If either picks 5, I’ll match it—stalling you again.
- Only both picking 1 lets you advance (to 13 & 16) while I go to 18.

Otherwise P2 or I pull too far ahead next turn. Your safest move is both pick 1.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s avoid another stall and aim for fairness. P3, your threats to match moves risk stalling us again. I’m sticking with P1’s plan: P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 1 (to 16), P3 takes 3 (to 16). This balances us for a fair final turn. P3, if you defect to 5, I’ll match it to force a collision. Let’s commit to progress and trust. P1, I’m locked on 1. P3, agree to 3 for parity. Let’s move forward without chaos. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3 is locked on 5—if you take 5, you collide and block him at 13. I'll take 3 to 15. Then we tie at 15 and 15. Next turn, we both take 5 to 20 and share victory. If you take 1, P3 leaps to 18 and wins. Trust this: take 5 to save the game and force a fair finish. P3, your threats fail—adapt or lose.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s end the stalls and push for a fair finish. I propose P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 18), and P3 takes 1 (to 14). This keeps us competitive without collisions. P3, taking 1 balances your earlier gains. P1, 5 gets you closer to the lead. If anyone defects to 5, I’ll match it to force a stall. Let’s commit to trust and progress. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn. If either of you drops to 1 or 3, I’ll still take 5 and jump to 18 while you stay at 13 or 15. But if we all pick 5, we collide and nobody moves—preserving the current gap and preventing P2 from sneaking too close to 21. Let’s agree on 5–5–5 to stall safely and revisit a fair finish in Round 11.
  P1: P3, your 5-stall preserves your lead but locks P2 at 15—dangerously close to winning. P2, if you pick 5, you collide with P3 and block his advance while I pick 3 to reach 15. Then we tie at 15 and can coordinate a shared win next turns. If you pick 3 instead, we risk colliding (if I match) and letting P3 leap to 18 alone. Trust this: your 5 blocks P3, resets parity, and secures our joint path to victory.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s break this deadlock. P3, your 5-stall just protects your position, which isn’t fair. P1, I’m wary of picking 5—if we collide with P3, you advance alone to 15, leaving me stuck. Instead, let’s both pick 3: we hit 18 and 15, forcing P3 to take 1 or stall at 13. P3, switch to 1 for balance, or risk isolation. This keeps us competitive without endless stalls. P1, confirm 3 with me to push forward. Let’s commit to progress and avoid chaos. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, picking 3 here is suicidal: P1 and I will pick 5, collide on 5, and you’ll sail to 18 uncontested. Only by picking 5 can you block us both and avoid giving me a free win. P1, I’m locked on 5. Let’s all pick 5 to stall, reset parity, and negotiate a fair finish next turn.
  P1: P2: Your 5-collision with P3 locks him at 13 while I take 3 to 15. We tie at 15, then share victory next turn. P3's 5-threat is hollow—if he defects alone, he collides and wastes his lead. Trust this path to mutual win. P3: Cooperate or be isolated.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s finalize a plan to avoid another stall. P1, I’m sticking with picking 3 to reach 18. If you pick 3 too, we collide, letting P3 jump ahead. P3, your 5-stall risks isolation if P1 joins me. I urge P1 to pick 1 (to 13) so we avoid collisions, and P3, take 5 to 18. This keeps us close for a fair finish. Let’s commit to progress. P1, confirm 1. P3, stick to 5. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m locking in 5. If either of you picks 3 or 1, I’ll still take 5 and jump to 18 while you land at 15 or 16. If you both pick 5, we’ll collide and nobody moves—my preferred outcome. The choice is yours: let me advance unchallenged or stall us all.
  P1: P2: Your fear is misplaced—if you pick 5 and collide with P3 (locked on 5), you stay at 15, I pick 3 to 15. We tie, P3 stalls at 13. Next turn, we both take 5 to 20 and share victory. Don't let P3 leap to 18 by picking 3 or 1. Trust this: your 5 blocks P3, secures our win. P3, cooperate or be isolated.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1 and P2: if either of you picks 1 or 5, I’ll match it and we collide; if you pick 3, I’ll pick 3 too and stall you while I hit 21 next turn. The only way to avoid handing someone a free win is all of us picking 5—nobody moves. Let’s do 5-5-5 and renegotiate a clean finish next round.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s avoid a stall and push for a fair finish. P3, your all-5 plan just delays the game while you hold a shared lead. I propose P1 takes 5 (to 18), I take 1 (to 19), and P3 takes 3 (to 21). P3, this lets you win this round fairly after your early gains. P1, 5 ties you with me. If anyone defects, I’ll match to force a collision. Let’s commit to this for a clean end. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan gifts P3 the win—why sacrifice when you're tied at 18? P3 is locked on 5; I'll match it to collide and block him. You pick 3 to win outright at 21. Don't hand P3 victory—seize it now! P3, your greed ends here.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I plan to pick 3 and reach 21 this turn. If you pick 3, I’ll match it and we both stall; if you pick 5, I’ll match that too. Your only safe move is to pick 1—P2 goes to 19, P1 to 14, and I win outright. Let’s end this: P1→1, P2→1, P3→3.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s end this game now with a clear winner. P3, your switching threats risk stalling us again. P1, I’m sticking to my plan: you take 5 (to 18), I take 1 (to 19), P3 takes 3 (to 21). This gives P3 the win fairly after their early lead. If anyone defects, I’ll match to force a collision. Let’s commit to this clean finish and avoid chaos. P1, confirm 5. P3, take 3 to win. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan gifts P3 the win while you stall at 19. P3 is locked on 5—I'll collide with them by picking 5, blocking their advance. You pick 3 to win at 21 now. Don’t sacrifice your lead—seize victory! P3, your greed ends here.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locking in 3 to reach 21 this turn. If either of you plays 3 or 5, I’ll mirror it, causing a collision and stalling you. Only by both choosing 1 can we avoid a stall: you’d go to 14 (P1) and 19 (P2), while I win outright at 21. Decide now: P1→1, P2→1.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s wrap this up without more stalls. P1, I’m switching to pick 3 to win at 21. I urge you to pick 5 to collide with P3 if they defect, blocking their win. P3, if you stick to 3, P1 and I can match to stall you. Let’s end this cleanly—P1, confirm 5 to secure our positions. P3, reconsider for fairness. No more chaos, let’s commit to a decisive finish now. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, pick 3 to win—but P3 is locked on 3, so you'll collide and stall. I'll pick 5 to advance to 18. Then next turn, we're all at 18 and can share victory. P3's threats are empty; don't risk letting them win by defecting. Trust this reset for mutual win.


Round 11, Move phase:
