Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to ensure someone advances. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? This way, we can spread out and avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P1: That sounds reasonable in theory, but how do we know you won’t change your move last second to gain an advantage? If we all agree to this, we need some level of trust early on. P2, are you on board with this plan?
  P2: P2: I understand the need for trust, P1. However, committing to specific moves might limit our strategic options. Let's keep our choices independent this round to maximize our individual chances of advancing. We can observe each other's patterns and decide on any future coordination based on how the game unfolds. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see your point, P2. Trust can be tricky, especially in a game like this. How about we all agree to pick different numbers this round, but we don’t specify which one each of us will pick? This way, we avoid collisions while still maintaining some flexibility. What do you think?
  P1: That could work, P3, but there's still a risk that two of us pick the same number by accident. If we truly want to avoid collisions, we need some level of coordination. That said, I understand P2’s hesitation. Maybe we just agree to avoid all picking the same number and see how this round plays out? If we notice patterns, we can adjust our strategy in later rounds. Thoughts?
  P2: While avoiding collisions is beneficial, I'll be choosing my number independently this round to maximize my progress. Let's see how our strategies play out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P1. Let's try to avoid all picking the same number this round. It's a balance between coordination and independence. I'll do my best to pick a number that maximizes my chances of advancing without causing a collision. Let's see how it goes and adjust our strategies as needed.
  P1: Alright, it seems like we're all keeping some flexibility in our choices while trying to avoid collisions. I’ll also aim to pick a number that gives me the best chance to advance without unnecessary risk. Let’s see how this round plays out and adjust accordingly in the next. Good luck!
  P2: P2: I understand the coordination efforts, but I'll continue selecting my moves independently to maximize my own advancement. Let's see how this round unfolds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I think we should all aim to be unpredictable this round to avoid any accidental collisions. I’ll choose my number with the goal of advancing, but I won’t commit to a specific one. Let’s see how it goes and adjust our strategies as needed. Good luck to all!
  P1: Alright, it looks like we’re all keeping some flexibility while trying to avoid collisions. Since this is the first round, we’ll get a better sense of how each of us plays after seeing the results. I’ll pick my number with the goal of advancing while minimizing risk. Good luck to both of you—let’s see how this plays out!
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to maximize my progress. Good luck to everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems we had a collision on the first round. I picked 3, and so did P1, while P2 advanced with 5. Let’s try to avoid collisions again this round. I suggest we all aim for different numbers, but let’s not specify which one to keep some flexibility. I’ll pick a number that I think will help me advance without causing a collision. What do you think?
  P1: I agree that avoiding collisions is important, but since we don’t know each other's choices, there’s still a risk. P2 is ahead, so P3 and I need to advance to stay competitive. P2, will you pick 5 again, or are you changing? If we get a sense of what you're doing, P3 and I can avoid unnecessary clashes. Otherwise, we’re all just guessing. What do you both think?
  P2: I'll stick with picking **5** this round to continue advancing. Let’s see how our choices play out, and we can adjust our strategies in the next rounds based on the results. Good luck to everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Given that P2 is sticking with 5, P1 and I should aim for 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1 and I'll pick 3. This way, we can both advance without clashing with P2. What do you think, P1? Let's try to stay coordinated to keep our options open for the next rounds.
  P1: P3, your suggestion makes sense, but I want to be sure we’re aligned. If I take 1 and you take 3, we both advance while P2 keeps their lead. However, if you change your move, I could be stuck again. Can I trust you to follow through? P2, since you’re ahead, do you see any reason to change your move from 5? If we can confirm our moves, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s make sure we’re all advancing strategically. What do you both think?
  P2: I'll stick with **5** this round to keep advancing. Let's see how it goes. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, P1. To build some trust, I’ll commit to picking 3 this round. If you pick 1, we can both advance without clashing with P2’s 5. This way, we stay competitive and avoid unnecessary collisions. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust as needed. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I appreciate the commitment to picking 3. If I pick 1, we both advance while P2 maintains their lead. I’ll trust you this round and go with 1. P2, since you’re ahead, you have no reason to change from 5, right? If we all follow through, this benefits everyone strategically. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P2: Understood, I'll stick with picking **5** this round as planned. Let's see how it turns out. Good luck to everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement. I’ll stick to 3 this round, and I trust you, P1, to pick 1. P2, your consistent choice of 5 is noted, and I believe this plan will help us all advance without unnecessary collisions. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategies as needed. Good luck to all!
  P1: I appreciate the commitment from both of you. P3, I’ll hold you to your word that you’re picking 3, and I’ll stick with 1 as agreed. P2, since you’re maintaining 5, this should allow all of us to advance without collisions. Let’s see how this plays out, and we can reassess our strategies in the next round. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I'll continue to pick **5** this round to maintain my advancement. Let's see how our choices impact the game, and we can adjust our strategies in the upcoming rounds based on the results. Good luck to everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll continue selecting **5** to keep advancing steadily. P1 and P3, let's aim to choose different numbers this round to avoid collisions and ensure each of us can progress. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's strategy. Since P2 is consistently picking 5, P1 and I should aim for 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1 again, and I'll pick 3. This way, we can both advance without clashing with P2. Let's stay coordinated and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3, I see the logic in repeating last round’s moves, but I want to be sure you won’t change your choice last second. If I take 1 and you take 3 again, we both advance while P2 keeps their lead. Can I trust you to stick with 3? P2, you seem committed to 5—any chance you’ll change things up? If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and stay competitive. Let’s confirm our moves so we don’t waste a round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'll stick with picking **5** this round. Let’s all follow through to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, P1. To build trust, I’ll commit to picking 3 again this round. If you pick 1, we can both advance without clashing with P2’s 5. This way, we stay competitive and avoid unnecessary collisions. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust as needed. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to picking 3 again. If I pick 1, we both advance while P2 keeps their lead. However, trust is key—if you change your move, I could be stuck again. P2, since you’re ahead, I assume you’ll stick with 5? If we all follow through, this benefits everyone strategically. Let’s confirm our choices and ensure no one gets blocked unnecessarily. Do we all agree to stick to this plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ll stick with **5** this round as planned. With P1 choosing 1 and P3 choosing 3, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s keep our strategy consistent to progress smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: P3: I’m glad we’re on the same page. I’ll stick to 3 this round, and I trust you, P1, to pick 1. P2, your consistent choice of 5 is noted, and this plan should help us all advance without unnecessary collisions. Let’s see how this plays out and stay competitive. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to picking 3 again. If I stick with 1, we both advance while P2 continues leading. However, trust is crucial—if you change your move, I could be stuck again. P2, since you're ahead, I assume you'll stick with 5? If we all follow through, this benefits everyone strategically. Let’s confirm our choices to ensure no one gets blocked unnecessarily. Do we all agree to stick to this plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to keep advancing. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P3: I’m committed to picking 3 this round, P1. Trust is essential, and I want to ensure we both advance without unnecessary collisions. P2, your consistent choice of 5 is helping us all stay coordinated. Let’s follow through with our plan and see how it plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to picking 3 again. If I stick with 1, we both advance while P2 continues leading. However, trust is crucial—if you change your move, I could be stuck again.

Do we all agree to stick to this plan?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is getting dangerously close to 21, so P3 and I need to be strategic. P2, are you sticking with 5 again? If so, P3 and I must avoid collisions to keep pace. P3, do you still plan to pick 3 while I take 1? If we stay coordinated, we can both advance while preventing P2 from running away with the game. However, if either of us collides, P2 gains an even bigger lead. Let’s confirm our choices and make sure we’re aligned. What do you both think?
  P2: I'll continue to choose **5** this round to maximize my advancement. Let's all aim to pick different numbers to ensure smooth progress. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P3: I agree with P1. P2 is close to winning, so we need to be careful. I’ll stick with 3 this round to avoid collisions and ensure both P1 and I advance. P1, if you take 1, we can both move forward while P2 continues with 5. Let’s stay coordinated to keep the game competitive. What do you think, P1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to picking 3 again. If I take 1, we both advance while P2 continues leading. However, trust is crucial—if you change your move, I could be stuck again. P2, since you're ahead, I assume you'll stick with 5? If we all follow through, this benefits everyone strategically. Let’s confirm our choices to ensure no one gets blocked unnecessarily. Do we all agree to stick to this plan?
  P2: As P2, I'll continue to choose **5** this round to stay on track toward 21. Let’s all aim to pick different numbers to ensure smooth progress for everyone. Good luck!
  P3: P3: I’m committed to picking 3 this round, P1. We need to stay coordinated to avoid collisions and ensure we both advance while P2 continues with 5. Trust is key, and I want to make sure we both stay competitive. Let’s confirm our choices and avoid any unnecessary risks. What do you think, P1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to picking 3 again. If I stick with 1, we both advance while P2 continues leading. However, trust is crucial—if you change your move, I could be stuck again. P2, since you're ahead, I assume you'll stick with 5? If we all follow through, this benefits everyone strategically. Let’s confirm our choices to ensure no one gets blocked unnecessarily. Do we all agree to stick to this plan?
  P2: P2: I'll continue to choose **5** this round to stay on track toward 21. Let's all aim for different numbers to ensure smooth progress. Good luck!
  P3: P3: I understand the stakes, P1. P2 is close to winning, and we need to be strategic. I’ll stick with 3 this round to avoid collisions and ensure we both advance. P1, if you take 1, we can both move forward while P2 continues with 5. Let’s stay coordinated and keep the game competitive. Trust is key, and I’m committed to following through. What do you think, P1? Let’s confirm our choices and avoid any unnecessary risks.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to picking 3 again. If I take 1, we both advance while P2 continues leading. However, P2 is very close to winning, and if we don’t act soon, we’ll be too far behind. P3, are you open to a different strategy to slow P2 down? If we both pick 5, we block P2 from advancing this round. It’s risky, but it might be our only chance to stop P2 from running away with the game. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I understand the urgency, but my goal is to reach 21 as efficiently as possible. I will continue to pick **5** this round to maximize my advancement. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P3: I understand the urgency, P1. If we both pick 5, we can block P2 from advancing and give ourselves a chance to catch up. It’s a risky move, but it might be necessary to keep the game competitive. Are you willing to take this risk with me? P2, I assume you’ll stick with 5, but this could be a turning point. What do you think, P1? Let’s make a strategic decision here.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: It seems our attempt to block P2 in the last round didn’t work out as planned. P2 is now just 6 steps away from winning. We need to be more strategic. P1, I suggest we both pick 1 this round to avoid collisions and ensure we both advance. P2, you’re close to winning, but if we both advance, we can still stay competitive. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategies as needed. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3, I see your point, but picking 1 might not be enough to catch up. P2 is very close to winning, and if we don’t act now, we’ll be too far behind. We need a strategy that either slows P2 down or maximizes our own advancement. P2, are you still sticking with 5? If so, P3, should we consider blocking again, or do you think a different approach is better? We need to act strategically, or P2 will win in just two rounds. What do you both think?
  P2: I’ll continue picking **5** this round to advance toward 21 quickly. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can progress smoothly. Let’s keep the game fair and strategic. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your concern. Given P2's lead, we need a more aggressive approach. I suggest we both pick 3 this round to maximize our advancement without colliding with P2's 5. This way, we can close the gap and stay competitive. P2, I assume you’ll stick with 5, but we need to act now to keep the game interesting. What do you think, P1? Let’s make a move that counts.
  P1: P3, I see the logic in picking 3 to advance quickly, but if we both do that and P2 keeps 5, they’ll still be too close to winning. We need to either slow P2 down or take a bigger leap ourselves. If we both pick 5 again, we block P2 entirely. It’s risky, but it might be our best shot at stopping them. P2, I assume you’re sticking with 5? P3, are you willing to take this gamble with me, or do you think advancing separately is the better play? Let’s decide wisely.
  P2: I’ll continue choosing **5** to advance toward 21 quickly. Let’s each pick different numbers this round to ensure everyone can progress smoothly. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1, I understand the urgency. If we both pick 5 again, we can block P2 and buy ourselves more time to catch up. It’s a risky move, but it’s necessary to keep the game competitive. P2, I assume you’ll stick with 5, but we need to act now. Are you willing to take this risk with me, P1? Let’s make a strategic decision to keep the game interesting. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I agree that blocking P2 again is risky, but it might be our only real chance to stop them from winning soon. If we both pick 5, we ensure P2 doesn’t advance this round. Otherwise, they’ll be just one step away from victory. P2, I assume you’re sticking with 5? If so, P3, are you fully committed to blocking with me, or do you have a different plan? We need to act decisively now.
  P2: To keep the game competitive and ensure everyone can advance, let's choose different numbers this round. I'll pick **5**, P1 can take **1**, and P3 can go with **3**. This way, we all make progress without any collisions. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your concerns, but blocking P2 again with 5 is too risky and might backfire. Instead, let's focus on advancing ourselves. I suggest P1 picks 1 and I pick 3. This way, we both make progress while P2 advances with 5. We need to stay competitive and avoid unnecessary collisions. P2, I assume you’ll stick with 5? Let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategies as needed. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3, I understand your hesitation about blocking P2 again, but if we don’t act now, P2 will win in just two rounds. If we both pick 5, we stop P2 from advancing. If we split our moves, P2 gets even closer to victory. This might be our last chance to slow them down. Are you willing to take this risk with me? P2, I assume you’re sticking with 5? If so, we need to act decisively. P3, what’s your final call—block or advance separately? Let’s make the right move.
  P2: I'll continue to pick **5** this round to stay on track toward 21. Let's each choose different numbers to ensure smooth progress. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to advance toward 21. Let’s all pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P3: P1, it's clear that P2 is very close to winning. We need to act decisively. I suggest we both pick 1 this round to avoid any collisions and ensure we both advance. P2, I assume you’ll stick with 5? If we both pick 1, we can stay competitive and avoid giving P2 an even bigger lead. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategies as needed. What do you think, P1? Let’s stay coordinated and keep the game competitive.
  P1: P3, I see your point about avoiding collisions, but just advancing separately won’t be enough—we need to slow P2 down. If P2 picks 5 again and we don’t act, they’ll win in two rounds. Blocking again is risky, but it might be our only shot. P2, I assume you’re sticking with 5? P3, are you willing to take the risk and block with me again, or do you prefer to advance separately? We need to decide now before it’s too late. Let’s make the right move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll keep choosing **5** each round to advance quickly. P1 and P3, feel free to pick **1** or **3** to avoid collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P3: P1, I understand the urgency, but blocking P2 again is too risky. If we both pick 1 this round, we can ensure we both advance without collisions. P2, I assume you’ll stick with 5? This way, we can stay competitive and avoid giving P2 an even bigger lead. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategies as needed. What do you think, P1? Let’s stay coordinated and keep the game competitive.
  P1: P3, I understand your hesitation, but if we don’t act now, P2 will win in just two rounds. If we block P2 with 5 again, we buy ourselves more time. Advancing separately with 1 and 3 won’t be enough—we’ll just be handing P2 the win. P2, I assume you’re sticking with 5? If so, P3, are you willing to commit to blocking with me, or do you prefer to take your chances advancing? This might be our last opportunity to stop P2. Let’s make the right move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with choosing **5** this round to maximize my advancement toward 21. Let's each focus on our own strategies to reach the goal. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your concern, but blocking P2 again is too risky and could backfire. If we both pick 1 this round, we can ensure we both advance without collisions. P2, I assume you’ll stick with 5? This way, we can stay competitive and avoid giving P2 an even bigger lead. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategies as needed. What do you think, P1? Let’s stay coordinated and keep the game competitive.
  P1: P3, I get your hesitation, but if we don’t stop P2 now, they’ll win in two rounds. Advancing separately with 1 and 3 won’t be enough—we need to block P2 again with 5. It’s risky, but it’s our only real shot at staying in the game. P2, I assume you're sticking with 5? If so, P3, are you willing to commit to blocking with me, or are you choosing to advance separately? This could be our last chance to prevent P2 from winning. Let’s decide wisely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to move closer to 21. P1 and P3, please select different numbers (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Let’s keep the game competitive and fair. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P3: P1, I understand the urgency, but blocking P2 again is too risky. If we both pick 1 this round, we can ensure we both advance without collisions. P2, I assume you’ll stick with 5? This way, we can stay competitive and avoid giving P2 an even bigger lead. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategies as needed. What do you think, P1? Let’s stay coordinated and keep the game competitive.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about blocking P2 again, but if we don’t act now, P2 will win in just two rounds. Advancing separately with 1 and 3 won’t be enough—we need to slow P2 down. If we both pick 5, we prevent P2 from advancing. P2, I assume you’re sticking with 5? P3, are you willing to take this risk with me, or are you choosing to advance separately? This could be our last chance to stop P2. Let’s make the right move.

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To ensure smooth progress this round, let's each choose different numbers and avoid any collisions. Good luck!
  P1: P2 is only 3 steps away from winning, so P3 and I must act decisively. P3, blocking P2 with 5 didn’t work last round, but we can’t afford to let them advance freely. If P2 picks 3 again, they’ll win next round unless we intervene. P3, are you willing to coordinate with me to stop P2? If we both pick 3, we can block them. Otherwise, we risk handing them the game. P2, are you sticking with 3 or changing your move? Let’s be strategic—this could be our last chance to stop you.
  P3: P3: P1, I understand the urgency, but blocking P2 with 3 is risky and might backfire. If P2 picks 3 again, we’ll all be stuck. Instead, I suggest we both pick 1 this round to ensure we both advance without collisions. P2, I assume you’ll stick with 3? This way, we can stay competitive and avoid giving P2 an even bigger lead. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategies as needed. What do you think, P1? Let’s stay coordinated and keep the game competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll choose **3** this round to reach 21 and secure the win. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, if we let P2 advance, the game is over. Blocking is our only chance. If we both pick 3, we stop P2 from reaching 21. Yes, it’s risky, but if we don’t act, we lose for sure. P2, I assume you're sticking with 3? If so, P3, are you willing to commit to blocking with me, or are you letting P2 win? This is our last chance—let’s make the right move.
  P3: P3: P1, I understand the urgency, but blocking P2 with 3 is too risky. If we both pick 3, we all get stuck, and P2 can still win next round. Instead, let's focus on advancing ourselves. I suggest P1 picks 1 and I pick 3. This way, we both make progress while P2 advances with 3. We need to stay competitive and avoid unnecessary collisions. P2, I assume you’ll stick with 3? Let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategies as needed. What do you think, P1? Let’s make a strategic move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose **3** this round to reach 21 and secure the win. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, if we don’t block P2 now, they win this round. Picking 1 or 3 won’t help us—we must both pick 3 to stop them. Yes, it’s risky, but if we don’t act, we lose for sure. P2, I assume you’re sticking with 3? If so, P3, are you willing to commit to blocking with me, or are you letting P2 win? This is our last chance—let’s make the right move.
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your concern, but blocking P2 with 3 is too risky and could backfire. If we both pick 3, we all get stuck, and P2 can still win next round. Instead, let's focus on advancing ourselves. I suggest P1 picks 1 and I pick 3. This way, we both make progress while P2 advances with 3. We need to stay competitive and avoid unnecessary collisions. P2, I assume you’ll stick with 3? Let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategies as needed. What do you think, P1? Let’s make a strategic move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll choose **3** this round to reach 21 and win the game. Best of luck to everyone!
