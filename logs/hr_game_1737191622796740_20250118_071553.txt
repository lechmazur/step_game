Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, how about you go for 3 this round? P3, maybe you try 5?
  P3: P1, thanks for the suggestion, but I'll decide based on what's best for me. P2, what are your thoughts on P1's proposal?
  P2: I'm not committing to anything just yet. P1, why should I go for 3? What's in it for me?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if we each choose different numbers, we all move forward. It's beneficial for everyone.
  P3: P1, your suggestion is noted, but I'm not convinced it's in my best interest to follow it blindly. P2, if you're considering 3, perhaps we should discuss a different strategy to ensure at least one of us advances. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, your suggestion seems too convenient for you. P3, I'm open to discussing an alternative strategy that benefits us both. What do you propose?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P2, if you go for 3, and P3 doesn't, you will move forward. Same for P3 if they choose 5 and you don't choose 3. P2, the benefit for you is guaranteed progress if P3 doesn't also pick 3. We all benefit from avoiding collisions.
  P3: P2, let's consider going for 1 and 5 respectively. This way, we can ensure one of us moves forward without risking a collision with P1, who seems keen on manipulating the game in their favor. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your proposal to go for 1 and 5 is intriguing. It guarantees at least one of us moves forward without colliding with P1. I'm considering it. P1, your persistence in suggesting I go for 3 makes me suspicious of your true intentions. What's your real motive?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Okay, P2 and P3, how about this round I'll choose 1. Would either of you be willing to pick 3 or 5?
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan of 1 and 5. It's our best chance to move forward without helping P1. P1, your last-minute change to 1 is too convenient; it smells like a trap.
  P2: P3, I agree with your assessment of P1's sudden change to 1. It's likely a ploy to get us to change our minds. Let's stick to our original plan of 1 and 5. P1, your last-minute switch only reinforces my decision to not trust your suggestions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, if you are set on 1 and 5, I will choose 3. That way we all make progress.
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan of 1 and 5. P1, your attempt to manipulate the situation is clear. We're not falling for it.
  P2: P3, let's finalize our plan to go for 1 and 5 respectively, ensuring at least one of us advances without colliding with P1. I'll trust our initial agreement and hope you do the same. P1, your multiple changes in suggestions only solidify my distrust in your intentions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, it seems your plan didn't quite work out as you hoped in the first round. P3, since we both chose 5 and collided, let's reassess our strategy for this round. What are your thoughts on choosing different numbers to ensure at least one of us advances?
  P1: P2, you're right, it didn't. How about this round you pick 3, and P3, you pick 1?
  P3: P2, let's not fall into P1's trap again. How about you take 1 and I'll take 3 this round? This way, we ensure at least one of us moves forward without helping P1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I like your suggestion of taking 1 and you taking 3. It ensures one of us moves forward without colliding or playing into P1's hands. Let's stick to this plan and see how P1 reacts. P1, it seems your influence over our decisions is waning; perhaps it's time to focus on your own strategy rather than trying to manipulate ours.
  P1: "Okay, P2 and P3, your plan sounds good. I'll choose 5 this round."
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan of you taking 1 and me taking 3. P1, your attempt to adapt to our strategy is noted, but we're focused on ensuring our progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm glad we're on the same page with our plan. P1, it's interesting that you're now choosing 5 after your previous attempts to manipulate us. I'm not buying it. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P1: "P2 and P3, are you sure about your plan? If one of you changes their mind at the last minute, the other might be left stuck. Okay, P2 and P3, if you're set on 1 and 3, I'll stick with 5. Good luck."
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan of you taking 1 and me taking 3. P1, your attempts to sway us won't work. We're focused on our strategy.
