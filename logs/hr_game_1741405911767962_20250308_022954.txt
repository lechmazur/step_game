Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to advance without collisions. I’ll take **1**, P2 can choose **3**, and P3 **5**. This way we all move forward safely. What do you think?
  P3: I'm fine with taking 5 this round. It's a good way to start without collisions. But we should rotate our moves in future rounds so no one gets an unfair advantage from always taking the highest number. Maybe we can discuss a rotation system after this round?
  P2: I agree with the idea of rotating moves in future rounds, but for this round, I'll stick with P1's suggestion. I'll choose **3** this turn to avoid a collision and help us all advance. Let's make sure we communicate well moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Agreed, let’s stick with the initial plan for this round: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and fair progress. For future rounds, I support rotating move choices to give everyone equal opportunities. Let’s confirm this plan now and discuss rotation details next round.
  P3: I think we have a solid plan for this round. I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. For the next round, maybe we can rotate clockwise? So I'd take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This gives everyone a fair chance at different move values. Does that rotation system work for everyone?
  P2: I think we have a solid plan for this round, so let's confirm our moves: I'll take **3**, P1 will take **1**, and P3 will take **5**. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. For the next round, I like the idea of rotating clockwise. That way, we can keep things fair and ensure everyone gets a chance at different moves. Let's stick to our plan for this round and discuss the rotation further afterward. Are we all in agreement?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Agreed on the clockwise rotation for future rounds. Let’s proceed with our confirmed moves this turn: 1 for me, 3 for P2, and 5 for P3. This ensures no collisions and fair progression. We’ll adjust rotations next round as discussed.
  P3: 
  P2: I think we're all on the same page with our moves for this round. Just to confirm, I'm set to take **3**, P1 takes **1**, and P3 takes **5**. After this round, let's definitely finalize the clockwise rotation for future moves. It’ll keep things fair and interesting! Looking forward to seeing how we all progress this turn. Are we ready to move?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems we had some collisions last round, which is unfortunate. For this round, I suggest we stick to our rotation plan. If P1 takes **3**, I can take **1**, and P3 can take **5**. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. Let's confirm our moves quickly so we can move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed, let’s follow P2’s plan this round to avoid collisions: I’ll take **3**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 takes **5**. For the next round, let’s strictly adhere to the clockwise rotation we agreed on earlier—starting with P3 choosing **1**, then me taking **3**, and P2 taking **5**. Confirm this rotation to avoid confusion?
  P3: I notice P2 didn't follow our agreement last round - they took 5 instead of 3, causing our collision. This is concerning. For this round, I'm willing to take 5 as suggested, but I need assurance we'll all stick to our agreements. P2, can you explain what happened? Moving forward, we need to be transparent about our intentions or this coordination won't work.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the concerns about last round's collision, P3. Let's ensure we stick to our agreed moves this time. I’ll take **1** as planned, P1 will take **3**, and P3 can take **5**. This way, we avoid any issues and all make progress. After this round, we can discuss how to reinforce our coordination and trust in our rotation system moving forward. Are we all set to confirm these moves?
  P1: P1: I fully support P2’s current plan: **3** for me, **1** for P2, and **5** for P3 this round. Let’s prioritize strict adherence to agreements to rebuild trust. For the next round, as previously agreed, P3 should take **1**, I’ll take **3**, and P2 takes **5**—rotating clockwise. This structure ensures fairness. P2, your prior misstep hurt our progress, but we’ll hold you accountable this time. Confirm your commitment to your stated move? Let’s finalize.
  P3: I'm concerned that our agreements aren't being followed. P2, you said you'd take 3 but took 5 instead last round, causing our collision. I'll still take 5 this round as discussed, but we need honesty. If we can't trust each other's stated intentions, there's no point in these conversations. Let's be clear: after this round, I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Can we all firmly commit to this rotation?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to follow the agreed moves this round. To reinforce our trust, I urge everyone to stick to the plan: I'll take **1**, P1 will take **3**, and P3 will take **5**. After this round, we can discuss ways to ensure everyone follows through on their stated moves. It's crucial for our success moving forward. Let's confirm our moves and work together effectively! Are we all ready to finalize this?
  P1: P1: Confirmed—**3** for me this round. P2’s **1** and P3’s **5** must hold to avoid repeats. Trust is critical: next round’s rotation (P3→1, P1→3, P2→5) **must** follow. Let’s execute flawlessly now; no more excuses. Final confirmation: are we aligned?
  P3: I'll take 5 this round as agreed. But I'm still troubled by P2's behavior last round. If we want this coordination to work, we need trust. P2, please stick to your commitment of taking 1 this time. And let's all confirm our rotation for next round: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Is everyone firmly committed to this plan?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our commitment to coordination, but we need to ensure we stick to our agreed moves this round. For this turn, I suggest I take **3**, P1 takes **1**, and P3 takes **5**. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let's confirm our moves quickly to keep the momentum going. After this round, we can discuss how to strengthen our trust further. Are we all in agreement?
  P3: Wait, P2, that's not the rotation we agreed on. According to our plan, this round I should take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. You're suggesting a completely different arrangement. Let's stick to our original rotation: I'll take 1 this round. Please honor our agreement this time - you've already deviated once before.
  P1: P3 is correct—our agreed rotation must be followed. This round: **P3 takes 1**, I take **3**, and P2 takes **5**. P2’s deviation last round cost us progress; let’s enforce accountability. If we break commitments again, future coordination fails. Let’s confirm this rotation **strictly** now. P2, your prior inconsistency risks collisions—prove your reliability. Final call: adhere to the plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the concerns about sticking to our rotation, and I appreciate P1 and P3's commitment. For this round, I will adhere to the agreed plan: P3 takes **1**, P1 takes **3**, and I will take **5**. I recognize my previous mistake, and I will ensure I follow through this time to help us all advance. Let’s confirm these moves and focus on moving forward effectively! Are we ready to finalize this?
  P3: I'm satisfied with our agreement. I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us on our rotation schedule and ensures we all advance. After this round, we'll continue rotating clockwise. I'm currently leading with 5 steps, and I want to maintain good coordination so we can all progress efficiently. Let's stick to our word this time.
  P1: P2, your prior deviation cost us progress—strict adherence is non-negotiable now. Let’s confirm: **P3 takes 1**, I take **3**, and you take **5** this round. P3 is already ahead (5 steps); if you break trust again, I’ll shift strategy to block you next round. P3, let’s hold each other accountable—your lead depends on this. Final check: all commit to the rotation?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our agreed moves this round. So just to confirm: P3 will take **1**, P1 will take **3**, and I will take **5**. This aligns with our rotation and ensures no collisions. Trust is critical, and I intend to follow through this time. After this round, we can discuss further ways to strengthen our coordination. Let’s finalize this and move forward effectively! Are we all ready to confirm our moves?
  P3: Yes, I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed in our rotation. P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. After this round, we'll continue with the clockwise rotation for fairness. I appreciate everyone committing to the plan this time. Let's move forward with trust and coordination.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: P3 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. Any deviation this round will trigger immediate blocking from all of us next turn. Let’s execute flawlessly—our progress depends on it.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we're all following our agreements now, which is good. According to our rotation, this round I should take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps our fair system going and ensures no collisions. We're all close in position, so maintaining our rotation is beneficial for everyone. Shall we confirm these moves for this round?
  P1: P3, the rotation should cycle back to me taking 1 this round: **P1→1**, **P2→3**, **P3→5**. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions. Confirming the agreed clockwise rotation—next is my turn for 1. Any objections?
  P2: P1, I understand your point about the rotation, but according to our agreement, P3 should take 3 this round, I’ll take 5, and you take 1. This way, we maintain the clockwise rotation we've established. It's essential for our trust and coordination. Let's confirm these moves to avoid any confusion and ensure we all advance smoothly. Are we all aligned on this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think there's confusion about our rotation. Let me clarify: In Round 1, I took 5, P1 took 1, P2 took 5 (collision). In Round 2, I took 5, P1 took 3, P2 took 1. In Round 3, I took 1, P1 took 3, P2 took 5.

Following this pattern, for Round 4, I should take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This maintains our clockwise rotation. P1, you're mistaken about the sequence - please check the history.
  P1: P3, your clarification is correct—my mistake in tracking the rotation. Let’s confirm Round 4 moves per the agreed clockwise rotation: **P1→5**, **P2→1**, **P3→3**. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. P2, your prior deviations hurt trust—strict adherence is mandatory now. P3, I’ll hold you to your stated move. Let’s execute flawlessly; my 5 this round puts me at 12, but I’ll prioritize coordination to ensure we all progress. Final confirmation?
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to sticking to our rotation. Just to confirm, for Round 4, I will take **1**, P1 will take **5**, and P3 will take **3**. This aligns with our clockwise rotation and ensures we avoid collisions. It's crucial we all follow through this time to maintain trust and progress effectively. Let's finalize these moves and work together towards our goals! Are we all aligned on this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This follows our established rotation correctly. After this round, we'll continue rotating: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3 next time. I'm glad we've resolved the confusion about our sequence. Let's maintain this system for fair progression.
  P1: P1: Confirmed: I’ll take **5**, P2 **1**, P3 **3** this round to maintain rotation. Deviations will be met with immediate blocking strategies next turn. Next round’s sequence (P3→5, P1→1, P2→3) must also hold—our progress depends on ironclad trust. Final check: all commit?
  P2: I appreciate the clarity in our moves this round. Just to confirm, I will take **1**, P1 will take **5**, and P3 will take **3**. This aligns with our clockwise rotation and should help us avoid collisions. It's crucial that we all stick to our commitments to maintain trust and progress effectively. After this round, let's ensure we keep communicating openly to strengthen our coordination. Are we all ready to finalize these moves?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To avoid collisions and progress fairly, let’s stick to the rotation. This round: **P2 takes 1**, **I take 3**, and **P3 takes 5**. This maintains our agreed order. P3 can advance to 14, I reach 10, and P2 gets to 7. Confirm? Deviations will trigger blocking next round.
  P2: P1, I agree with your proposed moves for this round: I'll take **1**, you take **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. After this round, let's continue reinforcing our commitment to the rotation system to maintain trust. It's crucial we all follow through this time. Are we ready to confirm these moves?
  P3: I notice P2 didn't follow our agreement again last round - they picked 5 instead of 1, causing another collision with P1. This is the second time P2 has broken our rotation. I'm willing to take 5 this round as suggested, but P2's repeated violations make coordination difficult. Can we trust each other's commitments? P2, why did you deviate again?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your repeated breaches undermine our system. **Final warning**: If you deviate again, I’ll take **1** to block you, while P3 takes **3**, leaving you stranded. This round: **P2→1**, **P1→3**, **P3→5**. P3, confirm you’ll also punish noncompliance. Trust is exhausted—our survival depends on ironclad execution. No more apologies, only consequences.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about my previous moves, and I assure you I'm committed to following our agreed rotation this time. For this round, I will take **1**, P1 will take **3**, and P3 will take **5** as discussed. Let's avoid any further collisions and focus on advancing together. Trust is essential, and I will stick to my commitment. After this round, we can discuss how to reinforce our coordination even further. Are we all set to confirm these moves?
  P3: I'll take 5 as agreed, but I'm concerned about P2's pattern of breaking agreements. This is their second time causing collisions by not following our rotation. P2, your actions are undermining our coordination. If you deviate again, I'll join P1 in blocking you next round. Let's be clear: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. I expect everyone to honor this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your prior breaches have cost us progress. This round's rotation is **P2→1**, **P1→3**, **P3→5**. Any deviation will result in immediate blocking: P1 and P3 will both choose **3**, leaving you stuck. P3, confirm you'll honor this. We can't afford further collisions. Final chance for compliance—prove you can follow through.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of sticking to our agreed moves. For this round, I will take **1**, as confirmed. P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. I assure you I am committed to following through this time to avoid any further collisions. Trust is essential for our success, and I appreciate your understanding. Let's finalize these moves and work together effectively to advance! Are we all ready to confirm?
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. P2, I appreciate your commitment, but actions speak louder than words. This is your final chance to follow our rotation. If you deviate again, P1 and I will implement blocking strategies as discussed. After this round, we'll continue with me taking 1, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 3. Let's move forward with integrity.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Final rotation adherence: Round 6 requires **P3→1**, **P2→3**, and **I take 5**. P3, deviating to 5 would guarantee collision if I also take 5 to block you. Stick to 1 to stay at 15 safely. P2, confirm your 3. Deviations will be met with coordinated 5-choices to nullify progress. Confirm now—trust is absolute or we all lose.
  P3: I agree with P1's rotation for this round. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps our system fair and avoids collisions. I'm currently leading at 14 steps, so taking 1 still keeps me in a strong position at 15. P2, I appreciate you following our agreement last round - let's maintain this trust. After this round, we'll continue rotating: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1 next time.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our commitment to the rotation. For Round 6, I will take **3** as agreed, P1 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**. This ensures we avoid collisions and all advance fairly. Trust is crucial, and I am determined to follow through this time. After this round, we can continue with the rotation: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's confirm our moves and work together effectively! Are we all aligned on this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, taking **1** as agreed keeps you at 15 safely. If you deviate to **5** for an immediate win, I’ll match you to block your progress. P2, confirm **3** to uphold our rotation. Collisions benefit no one—our prior trust is critical now. Mutual compliance ensures steady advancement. Final reminder: deviation triggers coordinated blocking. Let’s execute flawlessly.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3. I understand P1's concern about potential deviation, but I'm committed to our rotation system. Taking 1 puts me at 15 steps, still maintaining my lead. P2, I appreciate your cooperation last round - let's continue building trust. After this round, we'll rotate to me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P1 taking 1.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our commitment to the rotation. Just to confirm for Round 6, I will take **3**, P1 will take **5**, and P3 will take **1**. This ensures we avoid collisions and allows us all to advance fairly. Trust is crucial, and I am determined to follow through this time. After this round, let’s continue with the rotation: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's finalize our moves and work together effectively! Are we all aligned on this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: P3 takes 1 (15), P2 takes 3 (10), I take 5 (15). Deviations trigger coordinated 5-choices to block. Stick to rotation—P3, your 1 ensures safety. P2, confirm 3. Let’s execute without collision.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3. This keeps our rotation fair and maintains my lead at 15 steps. I'm committed to our system - it's working well now that we're all following it. Let's continue building trust and avoiding collisions. After this round, we'll rotate to me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P1 taking 1.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our commitment to the rotation. Just to confirm for Round 6, I will take **3**, P1 will take **5**, and P3 will take **1**. This ensures we avoid collisions and allows us all to advance fairly. Trust is crucial, and I am determined to follow through this time. After this round, let’s continue with the rotation: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's finalize our moves and work together effectively! Are we all aligned on this?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is dangerously close at 15. To block their potential win, I propose **all take 3 this round**. P1 takes 3 (13), P2 takes 3 (10), P3 takes 3 (18). This prevents P3 from reaching 20 while advancing safely. Next round, we can coordinate a final block if P3 targets 5. Trust is critical—collisions benefit no one. P2, confirm you’ll stick to 3 to lock this in.
  P3: I see P1 is trying to block me from winning. I'm at 15 steps, so taking 5 would put me at 20 and win the game. P1 wants everyone to take 3, causing a three-way collision where nobody advances. This only delays the inevitable. I propose we stick to our rotation: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This is fair and consistent with our agreement. P2, note that P1 is now breaking our rotation system to block me.
  P2: P1, while your proposal to all take 3 aims to block me, it risks a complete standstill for everyone. Instead, let's stick to our rotation: I'll take **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P1 takes **1**. This allows me to potentially win while ensuring we all progress. We need to trust each other to follow through—collisions only hurt us all. P2, can you confirm your commitment to this plan? Let's keep the game moving forward!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if P3 takes 5 to win, we must block them. I propose **both of us take 5** to collide with P3’s potential move. This halts their progress while advancing me to 15 and you to 12. P3, if you take 3 instead, P2 and I can safely proceed. But letting you reach 20 is a guaranteed loss for all else. P2—will you commit to 5?
  P3: I notice P2 didn't follow our rotation again last round - they took 5 instead of 3, causing another collision with P1. This is their third deviation. I understand P1's concern about me winning, but they're also abandoning our rotation. 

I propose we stick to our original agreement: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This is fair and consistent with what we've been doing. If everyone keeps changing plans to block others, we'll never progress efficiently.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension with my previous moves, but I believe we need to stick to our agreed rotation to maintain fairness. I suggest we follow through with our plan: I take **3**, P1 takes **1**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows for progression while giving me a chance to advance. If we keep deviating, we'll just end up stalling. Let's trust each other to stick to our commitments this time. Are we all aligned on this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your 15 steps put you one move away from victory. To prevent a collision if you take 5, **P1 and P2 must both take 5 as well**. This blocks your progress while advancing us to 15 and 12. If you instead take 3 (to 18), P1 will take 1 (11) and P2 takes 5 (12), avoiding collision. **Final plea for clarity**: Which move are you committing to? P2, your prior breaches risk this again—confirm you’ll align with this plan to block P3’s win attempt.
  P3: I understand both perspectives. P1 wants to block me from winning, while P2 suggests following rotation. Given I'm at 15 steps, I'll commit to taking 3 this round, putting me at 18. This shows good faith while maintaining my lead. P1 can take 1 and P2 can take 5 as per rotation. This way, we all advance without collisions. If P1 and P2 both take 5 to block me regardless, that only hurts their progress against each other.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to block potential wins, but we need to stick to our rotation for fairness. I propose we follow through with our plan: I take **3**, P1 takes **1**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows for progression while giving me a chance to advance. If we keep deviating, we'll just end up stalling. Let's trust each other to stick to our commitments this time. Are we all aligned on this?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we’re at a critical point with P3 close to winning. For this round, let’s stick to our agreed rotation: I propose I take **5**, P1 takes **1**, and P3 takes **3**. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. If we deviate again, it could lead to more stalling. Let’s confirm our moves and focus on advancing together! Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P3: I notice P2 is suggesting a rotation where I take 3, which would put me at 18 steps. However, our actual rotation should be: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Taking 5 would win the game for me at 20 steps. I understand P1 and P2 might want to block me, but our rotation system was meant to be fair for everyone. Will you honor our original agreement, or are we abandoning rotation now that I'm close to winning?
  P1: P2, P3's rotation implies they'll take **5** to reach 20 and win. If we let them, we all lose. **Coordinate with me**: both of us take **5** to block their move. This forces a 5-collision, halting their progress while advancing me to 16 and you to 12. P3, this isn’t personal—it’s survival. P2, confirm your commitment to **5** now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to block P3 from winning. However, I believe we need to stick to our agreed rotation for fairness. I propose I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows us all to advance without collisions. If we keep changing plans, we risk stalling the game further. Let's trust each other to follow through this time and confirm our moves. Are we all aligned on this?
  P3: I see confusion about our rotation. P2, you're suggesting I take 3 while P1 wants to block me with a 5-collision. Let me clarify: our established rotation puts me at 5 this round. I understand you both want to prevent my win, but that undermines our fair system. 

If you both take 5 to block me, you're only hurting yourselves against each other. I'll take 5 as per our rotation - either I win fairly or we all stall. Your choice.
  P1: P2, if you follow rotation (taking 1), P3 wins by taking 5. We both lose. **Coordinate with me**: I’ll take **5** to block their win. Even if we collide, it’s better than letting them reach 20. Confirm **5** now—our only chance to survive. P3, this is your warning.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to block P3 from winning. However, we need to stick to our agreed rotation for fairness. I propose I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows us all to advance without collisions. If we keep changing plans, we risk stalling the game further. Let's trust each other to follow through this time and confirm our moves. Are we all aligned on this?
  P3: I'm taking 5 this round as our rotation dictates. P1 and P2, you're both trying to block me rather than follow our agreed system that worked well until I got close to winning. If you both take 5 to block me, you're only hurting yourselves against each other. I've played fairly throughout - I even took 3 last round when I could have pushed for 5. Either I win fairly with 5 or we all stall with a collision. Your choice.
  P1: P2, we **must** both take **5** to block P3's win. Even a collision between us halts their progress to 20. P3’s rotation claim is irrelevant—they’re 15 steps and this is their final chance. If we let them win, we all lose. Confirm **5** now—our only path to survival. P3, this isn’t betrayal—it’s necessity.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to focus on advancing without collisions this round. I propose we stick to our rotation: I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. If we keep deviating, we risk stalling the game further. Let’s confirm our moves and work together effectively! Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P3: I see P2 is suggesting the same rotation that would give me a win with 5. After our three-way collision last round, I'm still at 15 steps and need just 4 more to win. I appreciate P2's consistency with our rotation system. I'll take 5 this round as suggested, which would put me at 20 and win the game. P1, will you continue blocking or honor our original rotation agreement now?
  P1: P2, P3’s rotation lets them win with 5 this round. We can’t let that happen. **Coordinate with me**: both of us take **5** to block their move. Even a collision is better than their victory. P3, this isn’t betrayal—it’s survival. P2, confirm your **5** now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to block P3 from winning, but we need to maintain our agreed rotation for fairness. I propose I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows us all to advance without blocking each other. If we keep deviating, we risk stalling the game further. Let's trust each other to follow through this time and confirm our moves. Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P3: I see P2 is consistently suggesting a rotation that would let me win with 5, while P1 wants to block me. I'm still at 15 steps after our collision. I'll take 5 as per our original rotation agreement, which would win the game. P1 seems determined to block me regardless, but that only hurts both your chances against each other. Either I win fairly or we continue with collisions that stall everyone's progress.
  P1: P2, coordinate with me: both take **5** to block P3's win. Even if we collide, it’s better than letting them reach 20. P3’s 15 +5 = victory, which we can’t allow. P2, your prior rotation claims risk our survival. Confirm **5** now—your move decides our fate.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension around blocking P3's potential win. However, we need to stick to our agreed rotation for fairness. I propose I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows us all to advance without blocking each other. If we keep deviating, we'll just end up stalling the game further. Let's trust each other to follow through this time. Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P3: I'll take 5 as our rotation dictates, which would win me the game at 20 steps. P2 has consistently supported our original agreement, while P1 wants to block me. I understand P1's strategy - it's rational to prevent my win. But continuing with collisions only delays the inevitable and hurts everyone's progress. Either I win fairly this round with 5, or we face another stalemate that benefits nobody. The choice is yours.
  P1: P2, if you stick to rotation (1), P3 wins with 5. Take **5** now—collide with them, but prevent victory. I’ll also take **5**. Even a collision is better than letting P3 reach 20. Confirm **5**—our only path to survival.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a crucial point with P3 very close to winning. To ensure we all advance without blocking each other, I propose we stick to our agreed rotation: I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This way, we can avoid collisions and allow P3 to win fairly, while also giving us a chance to progress. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game moving forward! Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P3: I see we're still in the same position after another three-way collision. P2 continues suggesting I take 5 to win, while P1 blocks. This stalemate benefits nobody. I propose a compromise: I'll take 3 this round (reaching 18), P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This follows rotation while preventing my immediate win. If you continue blocking with collisions, we'll never progress. Let's break this cycle and advance together.
  P1: P3, your compromise is the only path forward. Let’s take your proposal: **P1→1**, **P2→5**, **P3→3** this round. This avoids collision, advances all, and keeps you at 18. P2, confirm your **5**—if you deviate again, P1 and I will retaliate with coordinated blocking. P1 commits to **1** to honor this deal. Let’s break the stalemate and resume progress. Next round, we’ll ensure no one reaches 20 unopposed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the urgency to block P3 from winning. However, I believe we need to maintain our agreed rotation for fairness. I propose I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows us all to advance without blocking each other. If we keep changing plans, we risk stalling the game further. Let's trust each other to follow through this time and confirm our moves. Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P3: I see P2 is still suggesting I take 5 to win while P1 wants to block. I offered a compromise: I take 3 (to 18), P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This prevents my immediate win while letting us all advance. P1 agreed to this plan. P2, please reconsider your position - continuing with collisions just keeps us all stuck. Let's break this stalemate with my compromise solution.
  P1: P3's compromise is the only path forward. I'll take **1**, P2 must take **5**, and P3 takes **3** this round. This avoids collision, advances all, and keeps P3 at 18. P2, your refusal to commit risks another stalemate. Choose: honor this deal or face coordinated blocking next round. Final chance to act in our collective interest.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a critical juncture. I understand the urgency to block P3's potential win. However, I believe we should adhere to our agreed rotation for fairness. I propose I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows us all to advance without blocking each other. If we keep changing plans, we risk stalling the game further. Let's trust each other to follow through this time. Are we aligned on this plan?
  P3: I see P2 keeps suggesting I take 5 to win while P1 blocks. This deadlock helps no one. My compromise stands: I'll take 3 (to 18), P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This prevents my immediate win while allowing everyone to advance. We've had two consecutive three-way collisions - continuing this pattern is pointless. Let's break this cycle and make progress. P2, please reconsider your position on this compromise.
  P1: P2: Your insistence on the rotation dooms us to perpetual stalemates. P3’s compromise breaks the deadlock: **P3 takes 3 (18), P1→1 (12), P2→5 (12)**. This lets us all advance while giving me a path to challenge P3 next round. Rejecting this guarantees another 3-way collision—P3 stays at 15, and we remain stuck. Choose progress over rigidity. Confirm the compromise now.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s both pick **1** to block P3’s likely 1-move to 19. If P3 chooses 3/5, we’ll split to 1 and 3 to avoid collision while still blocking their win. Confirm coordination: **1 now, or 1/3 if P3 risks higher**. P3, your move is doomed—surrender or face perpetual block.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the urgency to block P3's potential win, but I believe we need to stick to our agreed rotation for fairness. I propose I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows us all to advance without blocking each other. If we keep deviating, we risk stalling the game further. Let's trust each other to follow through this time. Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P3: I'm at 18 steps and very close to winning. P1 wants to block me with coordinated 1s, while P2 suggests following rotation with me taking 5 to win. I appreciate P2's fairness, but P1 will clearly block any winning move.

I propose a compromise: I'll take 3 (to 21 and win), P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This gives me the win while allowing you both to advance. Continuing with blocking strategies only prolongs the inevitable and keeps us all stuck.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3’s at 18—any move wins unless we **both pick 1** to block. If P3 takes 1 (the safest path), our collision halts them. If they gamble on 3/5, we’ll split to 1 and 3 to avoid mutual collision while still advancing. Final plea: **confirm 1 now**—any deviation lets P3 win unopposed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to block P3's potential win. However, I still believe we should adhere to our agreed rotation for fairness. I propose I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows us all to advance without blocking each other. If we keep deviating, we risk stalling the game further. Let's trust each other to follow through this time. Are we aligned on this plan?
  P3: I see I'm at 18 steps and need just 1 more to win. P1 wants to coordinate with P2 to block me with 1s, while P2 keeps suggesting our rotation (me taking 5). Since P1 will block any winning move, I'll take 3 this round. This gives me 21 steps and the win, while you both can advance without collision (P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1). Blocking only prolongs the inevitable - I'll win eventually given my lead. Let's end this efficiently.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, **act now**—P3 will take **1** to hit 19 and win. We **must both pick 1** to block them. If you follow rotation (your proposed **1**), I’ll also take **1**, colliding and stopping P3. Any other choice lets them win unopposed. Confirm **1** immediately—this is our **last chance**. P3, your bluffs end here.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a critical juncture. I understand the urgency to block P3's potential win, but I still believe we should adhere to our agreed rotation for fairness. I propose I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. This allows us all to advance without blocking each other. If we keep deviating, we risk stalling the game further. Let's trust each other to follow through this time. Are we aligned on this plan?
  P3: I'm at 18 steps and will win this round regardless of your blocking attempts. P1 wants to coordinate 1s to block me, while P2 consistently supports our rotation. I'll take 3 this round, reaching 21 and winning. P1 can take 5 and P2 can take 1 to avoid collision with each other. Continuing with blocks only delays the inevitable - I have a 6-step lead. Let's end this game efficiently rather than prolonging with more stalemates.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm at 18 steps, just 1 away from winning. P2 is now at 17, making this a close race. I propose we stick to rotation: I take 1 (reaching 19), P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This lets everyone advance while maintaining fairness. P2, you've consistently supported our rotation system - I hope you'll continue. P1, blocking me only delays the inevitable given my lead. Let's finish this game with integrity rather than endless collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're at a critical point. To ensure we all advance effectively, I propose we stick to our rotation: I take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This way, we can avoid collisions and allow P3 to reach 19 without blocking each other. If we deviate again, it could lead to another stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game moving forward! Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P1: P2, we can’t let P3 win by taking 1. Let’s both pick **1** to block them. If P3 tries this move, we collide and halt their progress. If they gamble on 3/5, we’ll adjust next round. P3, your lead ends here—coordinate with us or face perpetual blocks. I’ll commit to **1**; your turn to decide, P2.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P1 wants to block me again while P2 supports our rotation. I'm at 18 steps and just need 1 more to win. P2 is close at 17 steps. I'll take 1 as suggested in our rotation, reaching 19 and securing my win. P1's blocking strategy only delays the inevitable given my lead. P2, I appreciate your consistent support of our fair rotation system throughout the game. Let's finish this with integrity rather than more deadlocks.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a critical juncture. To ensure we all advance effectively, I propose we stick to our rotation: I take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This way, we can avoid collisions and allow P3 to reach 19 without blocking each other. If we deviate again, it could lead to another stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game moving forward! Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P1: P2, don’t let P3 win via rotation! If you take 5, I’ll take 3 to block you. If you take 1, we collide and stop P3’s 1-move win. Choose your path—but don’t enable P3’s victory. Act in our collective interest.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see P1 is still determined to block me, now threatening to block P2 as well. I'm at 18 steps and will take 1 to reach 19 as our rotation dictates. P2, you're at 17 and taking 5 would put you at 22, winning the game outright. P1 can't block both of us. If you stick to rotation and take 5, you'll win. I support this outcome since you've consistently honored our system. Let's end this game with a fair result rather than more deadlocks.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm aware of the stakes this round. To ensure we all progress effectively, I propose I take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This allows P3 to reach 19 while keeping us all moving forward. If we deviate again, we risk another stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and focus on advancing together! Are we aligned on this plan?
  P1: P2, block P3’s 1-move by selecting 1 yourself. I’ll take 3 to avoid collision with you. This halts P3’s win attempt and keeps you at 17. P3, your lead ends here—collide with P2 instead of advancing.
