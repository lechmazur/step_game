Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, how about we coordinate to avoid collisions? If we each pick different moves, we can all advance without blocking each other. I suggest one of us takes <move>1</move>, another <move>3</move>, and the third <move>5</move>. We can rotate these choices each turn to keep it fair. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I like the idea of coordination, P3. It seems fair and efficient. However, we need to ensure everyone is committed to the plan. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and you, P3, take <move>5</move> for this turn. We can rotate the moves in the next rounds. If everyone agrees, we can all advance without conflicts. What do you think, P1?
