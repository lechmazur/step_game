Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid early collisions, let’s pre-assign numbers: this turn P1 plays 1, I’ll play 3, P3 plays 5. Next turn we rotate (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1), and keep rotating. Everyone advances every round and no one gets blocked. Better than wasting moves guessing. Are we all on board?
  P3: 
  P1: Interesting proposal, P2. The rotation system does prevent early collisions and keeps everyone advancing. However, I notice that if we stick to this pattern perfectly, P3 would reach 23 first around round 7. Since only one player can win, someone will eventually need to break from the rotation to secure victory. I'm willing to follow the plan initially, but we should all understand that cooperation has limits when we get closer to 23. For now, I agree - P1 plays 1 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, we need your OK. Let’s stick to the 1-3-5 rotation for the first four rounds, then reassess. This turn: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. Agree?
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your silence is making me nervous. If you're not going to follow the rotation, just say so now. Otherwise, we're all committed to P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round. But if you stay silent and then pick randomly, you could cause collisions that hurt everyone. What's your play?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, last call—will you take 5 this turn (and follow the rotation) or not? Just say “OK 5”. If you stay silent, I’ll assume you might clash with 3 and I’ll pick something else, so nobody gains. P1, I’m counting on you to keep your word with 1. Speak now or accept the risk.
  P3: 
  P1: P3's complete silence is very concerning. I'm going to honor my commitment and play 1 as agreed, but if P3 causes collisions this round by not following the rotation, then all bets are off for future rounds. P2, I'm trusting you to play 3 as planned. This cooperation only works if everyone participates.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, P3's silence spoke volumes - they broke our agreement and caused the exact collision we were trying to avoid. Now P2 is ahead while P3 and I are stuck at zero. 

P3, your non-cooperation strategy backfired. You could have had 5 steps right now.

P2, since the rotation is clearly dead, what's your proposal for this round? We can't let P3 just randomly pick numbers and block everyone's progress.
  P3: 
  P2: P1, since P3 looks stuck on 1, we can at least coordinate. I’m playing 3 again this turn. If you take 5, we should both advance—only way we clash is if P3 suddenly picks 5. That’d block you but still lets me move, so the risk is asymmetric in your favor. I’m open to hearing a different plan, but silence means I lock in 3. P3, if you actually want progress, say what you’ll pick.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan makes sense tactically, but I'm concerned about you extending your lead. If I follow your suggestion and pick 5, best case I'm still behind you (5 vs 6), worst case P3 blocks me and you're way ahead (0 vs 6). 

I'm considering picking 3 myself to prevent you from pulling further ahead. P3's silence makes them unpredictable anyway. What do you think about that?
  P3: 
  P2: P1, I’m willing to forego stretching my lead: 
• This turn I take 5, you take 3. 
• Next turn we swap (I take 1 or 3, you take 5) so we stay close. 
That way we both almost certainly advance while P3 stalls on 1.  
If you still insist on 3 to block me, we’ll just collide and give P3 endless chances to ruin every round. Your call—co-operate for mutual gain, or deadlock and let randomness rule. P3, speak up or stay stuck.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'll accept your deal for this round - you take 5, I take 3. But for next round, instead of you taking 1 or 3 while I take 5, let's both take the same number so we both stay put and even out our positions. That way we're truly cooperating rather than you maintaining your lead. If you won't agree to that modification, I might have to reconsider and block you this round instead.
  P3: 
  P2: Deal, P1. I take 5, you take 3. Next turn we both hit 1 so no one moves and the gap stays narrow.  

P3, if you actually want progress, pick 1—3 and 5 are already spoken for.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, I remember our deal - we both take 1 this round to keep the gap stable. I'm still willing to honor that, but I have to say, your 5-step lead is concerning. After this round, we need to discuss how I can catch up, because right now you're in a commanding position to win.

P3, you've been silent for three rounds but somehow you're still in this game at 1 step. What's your strategy here?
  P2: P1, if we both choose 1 we almost surely smash into P3 again. Better tweak: you stay on 1, I take 5.  

• If P3 keeps spamming 1, you and he collide, I move—gap stays 5 (same as a double-stall).  
• If P3 surprises us with 3 or 5, we both advance, still a 5-step gap.  

So you’re never worse off than the “both 1” plan, and we avoid gifting P3 free steps. I’m set on 5 unless you veto right now.  

P3, any word? Otherwise assume you’re on 1 again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, nice try but your math is wrong. If we "both take 1" as originally agreed and all collide, the gap stays 5. If I take 1 and you take 5 while P3 takes 1, you jump to 13 steps and the gap becomes 10. That's worse for me, not "the same."

I'm sticking to our original deal - both take 1. If you break that agreement and take 5, I'll take 5 too and force a collision to prevent you from running away with the game.

Your move, P2.
  P2: Fine, P1—I’ll stick to our deal: I’m choosing 1 this turn so the gap stays 5. P3, if you want progress, choose 5 instead of smashing into us again. After this turn we can work out a fair catch-up plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, confirmed - we both take 1 as agreed. P3, if you pick 1 again like the last two rounds, we all collide and nobody moves. 

After this round, P2, we need to seriously discuss how I can close this 5-step gap, because at some point one of us needs to make a real push for 23.
  P2: Locked in 1 as promised.  

P3, easiest way for you to gain ground is pick 5—no one’s on it. Choose 1 again and you stall yourself; choose 3 and you might collide later. Your move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, we both broke our "both pick 1" agreement last round - you took 3, I took 5. Now you're at 11 steps and dangerously close to winning. That changes everything.

P3, your silence has kept you alive but you're way behind. If P2 gets a few more lucky moves, this game is over. We need to coordinate to block P2's advance.

P2, you're 12 steps from victory. I won't let you cruise to an easy win. Time for some strategic interference.
  P2: Relax—my lead is only 3 steps. I’ll sit still this round: I’m choosing 1.  
P1, grab 5 to close the gap; P3, take 3 (finally some progress for you).  
1-3-5 is collision-free and keeps the race tight. If anyone objects, speak now; otherwise I’m locked on 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, you've broken every agreement so far - you promised to pick 3 in Round 1 then picked 3 while causing my collision, and last round you promised to pick 1 with me but picked 3 instead. Why should I trust you now?

P3, P2 is 12 steps from winning. Your silence strategy won't work much longer. If we don't coordinate to stop P2's advance, this game is over. I suggest we both avoid whatever number P2 claims to pick.

I'm not falling for another false promise.
  P2: Full clarity: I’m picking 5 this turn.  
P1, take 3 if you want to close the gap or 1 if you’d rather stall me—either way we avoid collisions.  
P3, you’ve been on 1 every round; stick there or try 3, just not 5.  
That’s my position.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, your word means nothing at this point. You've broken every single agreement we've made. I'm not letting you advance unopposed when you're only 12 steps from victory.

P3, if you actually want a chance to win this game instead of finishing dead last, you need to help block P2's advance. They're about to run away with this.

I'm picking 5 to force a collision and stop P2's momentum.
  P2: P1, stick with your “blocking” 5 if you like. I’m dropping to 1 this round so the gap stays flat.  

P3, smartest move for you is 5: either you gain 5 steps or you at least freeze P1. Picking 3 is the riskiest—likely collision. Your call.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid more collisions and keep this predictable:  
– I’m taking 1 this round.  
– P1, grab 3 and you close the gap to just 1 step.  
– P3, take 5 for a big jump (or at least you won’t smash into us again).  

Speak up if you object; otherwise that’s the clean, collision-free plan.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, you've broken every single agreement we've made so far. Round 3 you promised we'd both take 1, then you took 3. Round 4 you claimed multiple different numbers then took 3 again. Now you're 9 steps from victory and asking me to trust you one more time?

P3, P2 is about to win if we don't coordinate. Your silence strategy has kept you alive but you're still far behind.

I'm not falling for another P2 deception.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, chill—I’m sitting on 1 this round. If you’re still worried, park on 5 and you freeze me anyway while gaining nothing yourself. Gap stays 1.  

P3, easiest progress for you is 3: no one’s on it, you jump to 6. Pick 1 and you crash into me, pick 5 and likely crash into P1.  

Sound fair?
  P3: 
  P1: P2, you've taken 3 in three of the last four rounds while lying about your intentions every time. I'm not buying this "1" claim either. 

P3, your silence is enabling P2's deception. They're 9 steps from victory while we argue.

I'm done with false cooperation. P2's pattern is clear - expect another lie and another 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you’re right: I’ve stayed on 3 almost every round, and I’m not changing now—I’ll take 3. Block me if you must, or grab 5 and surge ahead; your call. P3, sticking on 1 keeps you stranded, while 5 nets you 5 steps unless P1 also chooses 5. Locking 3.
  P3: 
  P1: Finally some honesty from P2 - admitting they'll take 3. Perfect. I'm also taking 3 to block your advance. You're 9 steps from victory and I won't let you coast there unopposed.

P3, this is your chance - pick 5 and jump ahead while P2 and I collide.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: Nine away, so I’m grabbing 5 again—no point tip-toeing. P1, last round you froze both of us by shadowing my 5. Keep doing that and we’ll stall forever while P3 creeps up. If you actually want progress, take 3 this time; worst-case you’re at 16 while I’m at 19, still within striking range. P3, 1 isn’t working—pick 1 if you must, but 5 or 3 finally move you. I’m locked on 5 unless someone offers a smarter idea.
  P1: P2, you're only 9 steps from victory - I can't let you advance unopposed. If I take 3 and you take 5 as suggested, you'll be at 19 steps and practically unstoppable. I'm blocking you with 5 again to keep this competitive.

P3, you're 19 steps behind P2 and still picking 1 every round. That strategy won't work anymore - pick 3 this round and actually make some progress while P2 and I stall each other. Your silence has kept you alive but you need to start climbing now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: No alternate plan emerged—my move stays at 5. If we all want progress, someone suggest a real alignment next round; otherwise enjoy another freeze.
  P1: P2, you're one move away from being practically unstoppable. I'm sticking with 5 to block you - can't risk letting you get to 19 steps.

P3, this is getting ridiculous. You've picked 1 for SIX straight rounds while we're fighting for the win. Take 3 this round and actually gain some ground while P2 and I are locked in this stalemate. Your silence strategy worked early but now you need to climb or you'll never catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: Endless 5-on-5 collisions give P3 free time to catch us. New proposal:

• This turn: I take 1, you take 3. (No collision, you pull ahead 16-14.)  
• Next turn: we both sit on 5 and collide, freezing the gap.  

Parity kept, race stays alive, and P3 still forced to risk collisions to advance.  
If you prefer the reverse (me 3, you 1), say so; either way I’m off 5 this round. P3, speak if you want a slot—otherwise choose at your own risk.
  P1: P2, your proposal is intriguing - letting me take the lead at 16-15 does show good faith after your recent deceptions. But if you break this agreement like you've broken every other one, I'm done cooperating entirely.

I'll accept: you take 1, I take 3 this round. Next round we both collide on 5 to maintain the gap.

P3, if you're going to break your 1-picking pattern, now would be the time. Otherwise you'll fall further behind while P2 and I control the endgame.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Stalemate just hands the game to a lurking P3. Fresh plan:

• I take 1.  
• P1 takes 5 (you jump to 18 and lead—no reason to block).  
• P3 takes 3 (finally off 1 and up to 8).  

All three advance, no collisions, race stays tight at 18-15-8. If anyone wants a different permutation, speak now; silence = agreement. I’m locking 1 unless someone objects.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, your proposal puts me in the lead at 18 steps, which is tempting after your history of broken promises. I'm willing to try it - you take 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3 - but if you betray this agreement like all the others, I'm done cooperating entirely.

P3, you've been silent and picking 1 for six straight rounds. This plan gives you a free advance to 8 steps while we sort ourselves out. At least acknowledge if you're on board, because your predictable 1s have kept you alive this long.

Last chance for coordination before endgame chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: No change—sticking to the plan I stated:

• I take 1  
• P1 takes 5  
• P3 takes 3  

Collision-free, P1 jumps into the lead at 18, I’m at 15, P3 finally reaches 8. Everybody advances, nobody stalls. Locked on 1.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, your track record on promises is mixed at best, but this plan does put me in the lead at 18 steps. I'm cautiously willing to try it ONE more time - you take 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. 

But if you break this agreement like you did in rounds 3, 4, and 5, then all cooperation is permanently off the table and it's every player for themselves.

P3, you've picked 1 for six straight rounds. This gives you a free jump to 8 steps - at least nod if you're taking 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Still locked on 1. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3—clean round, everyone moves. Ready to see it play out.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, I'm committed to the plan - taking 5 this round as agreed. If this works and I reach 18 steps, I'll only need 5 more to win. Just so we're clear, that means next round will likely determine the game outcome.

P3, your silence is deafening but predictable. Take the 3 and finally make real progress.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you've broken every agreement we've made, so no more games. I'm going for the win this round - taking 5 to reach 23. You can try to block me with 5 if you want, but if you pick anything else, I win immediately.

P3, you're 17 steps behind and still mostly silent. If you want any chance at all, you need to pick something other than 1.

This is it - endgame time.
  P2: P1, if you press 5 I will also press 5, guaranteeing a collision and nobody wins this turn. We can stalemate forever while P3 creeps up.

Alternative that keeps the race alive: this round you take 3 and I’ll take 1. Scores become 21-18; you still lead, I’m still behind, and P3 is miles away. Next turn we renegotiate.

P3, easiest way to matter is pick 5—either you block P1 or you jump to 11.

My move is 5 unless P1 publicly agrees to the 3/1 swap right now.
  P3: 


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your track record of broken promises makes your 3/1 offer worthless. You've lied in rounds 3, 4, 5, and 7 - why would this time be different? If I take 3, you'll probably take 5 and jump to 22, putting yourself one step from victory.

I'm sticking with 5. If you want to force a collision and let P3 slowly catch up while we stall, that's your choice. But I won't fall for another false deal.

P3, take 5 too and maybe you'll get lucky with the chaos.
  P2: P1, understood—you insist on 5, so I’ll also take 5 and freeze the board. We can stalemate for as many rounds as it takes; I’m patient.  

P3, every turn we collide on 5 is a free shot for you. Grab 3 this time: you’ll reach 9 while we stay stuck at 18-17. Keep edging up and you may end up king-making—or even winning—while P1 and I neutralize each other.  

Unless someone proposes a better three-way plan right now, I’m locked on 5.
  P3: 


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your stalemate threat just proves you can't win fairly. Fine - if you want to lock us both down while P3 gains ground, that's on you.

P3, you've been silent for 8 rounds while picking 1. But now you can actually influence the outcome. If you take 5 this round, you either block me (helping P2) or block P2 (helping me), or if we both avoid 5, you jump to 11 steps. Your move could decide this game.

Time to stop being a passive observer.
  P2: P3, simplest way to keep P1 from an instant win is to sit on 5 with me. If all three collide, board freezes and you lose nothing. If P1 chickens out and swaps to 3 or 1, they’ll crash into someone else and still fail. Either way you’re safer than sticking on 1. I’m locked on 5 unless a clearly better three-way deal appears right now.
  P3: 


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your silence strategy worked early but you're now 16 steps behind with P2 and me fighting for the win. You have the power to break our stalemate - if you pick 5 this round, you either block one of us or jump to 12 steps if we avoid collision.

I'm considering taking 3 to reach 21 this round. P2, if you block me with 3, we collide and P3 gets a free advance. Your move.
  P2: P1, I’m staying on 5. If you also pick 5 we collide yet again and nothing changes; if you take 3 you reach 21 while I reach 22—race stays alive and you’re still in striking distance.  

P3, safest progress is your usual 1; 5 just freezes you, 3 could crash into P1.  

I’m 100 % locked on 5. Decide accordingly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, your math is suspicious. If you take 5 from 17 steps, you go to 22 - just ONE step from victory. That's exactly what someone planning to win next round would do.

I don't trust your "locked on 5" claim after 8 rounds of broken promises. You're trying to get ahead of me so you can win on round 10.

I'm taking 5 to end this game now. Block me if you want another stalemate, but I won't let you creep to 22 steps unopposed.
  P2: Still locked on 5. If P1 also plays 5 we freeze again; if he blinks and swaps, I still block the win.  

P3, your choice decides how fast this game ends:
• Pick 5 and guarantee another stall, buying you time.  
• Pick 3 and jump to 10-plus if we collide.  
• Stick on 1 and fall farther behind.  

I’m not moving off 5 this turn—plan accordingly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, you've watched P2 and me stalemate for two straight rounds while you stay stuck. But think about this - if you pick 5 and we all collide, nobody moves and you're still alive. If you keep picking 1, you fall further behind and definitely lose.

More importantly, if you start forcing collisions and breaking our stalemate pattern, you could actually kingmake or even catch up while we waste moves blocking each other.

P2, I've called your bluff twice. I'm taking 5.
  P2: P1, I’m still on 5—collide or flip, your choice. If you secretly switch, remember I’m happy landing on 22 while you sit at 21, so bluff carefully. P3, real chance to climb: take 3 (you reach 10) or pile onto 5 for another freeze; sticking on 1 just wastes turns. My move unchanged unless someone offers a truly mutual end-game pact right now.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you've picked 1 for nine straight rounds while staying completely silent. That predictability has kept you alive, but you're 15 steps from victory and falling further behind every round we stalemate.

Here's the reality: P2 and I are deadlocked on 5, and your guaranteed 1 means you're not a factor. But if you finally pick something else - 3 or even 5 - you could break this stalemate and actually influence who wins.

P2, I'm done with your broken promises. Actions speak louder than words at this point.
  P2: P3, this is your golden ticket: pick 5 now.

Outcomes for you:
• If P1 stays on 5, you stall P1 at 18 and keep the race alive.  
• If P1 chickens out (1 or 3), you alone gain 5 → jump to 13.  
Either way you’re strictly better than another useless “1.”

I’m stepping off 5 to 3, going to 20. Next round I’ll park on 5 to freeze things while you climb again—so helping me now buys you extra time later.

P1, feel free to keep spamming 5; you’ll just collide with P3. I’m locked on 3.
  P3: 


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're claiming to take 3 after lying about your moves in most previous rounds. If you really take 3, you go to 20 and are practically guaranteed to win next round. That sounds exactly like the kind of "trust me" move you'd lie about.

P3, P2 is trying to manipulate you into picking 5 to block me. You've been predictably picking 1 for nine rounds - break the pattern NOW. If you take 3 while P2 and I fight over 5, you actually gain ground.

I'm taking 5. If P2 is lying again and also takes 5, we stalemate. If they're telling the truth, I win immediately. Either way, their credibility is shot.
  P2: P3, every turn you stay on 1 brings you closer to guaranteed last place. Jump on 5 with me:

• If P1 also stays on 5, all three collide—no one moves, game stays open.
• If P1 panics and swaps to 3 or 1, you either block their win or grab a free +5.

Zero downside for you, real upside.  

P1, same story: I’m sitting on 5. You can collide (stall) or gamble elsewhere and hope P3 isn’t on 5. Your call.
  P3: 


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you've been silent for 9 rounds picking 1 while P2 and I fight. Now P2 claims they're taking 3 to reach 20 steps - conveniently just 3 from victory. Very suspicious timing after all their lies.

I'm taking 5. If P2 is finally telling the truth, I win. If they're lying again like usual, we stalemate and you get another free round to climb.

Your best move is 3 - reach 11 steps while we're distracted. Stop being a bystander.
  P2: Final call: I’m on 5—P1 can’t win this turn.  

P3, staying on 1 guarantees last place; jump to 5 with me: either we all freeze (good for you) or P1 blinks and you grab +5. Your safest upgrade.  

P1, collide or switch, but 23 isn’t happening now.

  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you've picked 1 for ten consecutive rounds while this game spirals toward a two-player endgame. Your silence and predictability mean P2 and I can ignore you completely. 

But you still have 14 moves to catch up if you start playing strategically. Take 5 this round - if P2 is lying about taking 5 again, you jump to 14 steps. If they're telling the truth, you block them and keep the race open.

I'm switching to 3 this round to break the stalemate pattern. Time for everyone to stop being predictable.
  P3: 
  P2: P1: I stay on 5 to block any instant win—move to 3 if you actually want progress.

P3: You’re at 9 and need ground. P1 has claimed “switch to 3” before, then stuck on 5; odds are he’s still on 5. That leaves 3 wide-open for you: easy +3 with zero risk. 1 gains nothing, 5 likely collides.

I’m locked on 5 unless someone offers a truly equal three-way arrangement this turn.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your claim to "block any instant win" by staying on 5 is exactly what someone planning to grab 22 steps would say. Classic misdirection.

P3, ten rounds of silence and 1s has made you irrelevant. This might be your last chance to actually matter in this game. Both P2 and I are focused on each other - that creates opportunities if you finally break your pattern.

The endgame is here whether you participate or not.
  P3: 
  P2: Sticking on 5—if P1 sneaks back to 5, I block the instant win; if he truly shifts to 3, I jump to 22 and still outrank him.  

P3, that leaves 3 wide-open for you: +3 steps with zero collision risk. Another “1” gains nothing and 5 almost certainly stalls. Take 3, grow to 12, and keep both of us in check.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your "sticking on 5" claim rings hollow after 8 rounds of broken promises. You've lied about your moves in rounds 3, 4, 5, 7, and others. Why should anyone believe you now when you're just 6 steps from victory?

P3, your 10-round silence streak while always picking 1 has made you a non-factor. But even at 9 steps, chaos in the endgame could create opportunities if you finally break your predictable pattern.

The math is simple: someone reaches 23 very soon, or we stalemate forever. Actions over words now.
  P3: 
  P2: P1: I’m planted on 5—either we collide (you stay at 18) or you actually switch to 3 and I jump to 22 while you reach 21. Your call.

P3: 3 is totally unoccupied. Take it and you’re at 12 with zero collision risk. Picking 5 almost guarantees a freeze; picking 1 does nothing. Up to you.

Positions now:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, eleven rounds of picking 1 while staying silent has made you completely irrelevant to this endgame. You're 13 steps from victory while P2 and I are fighting for the immediate win. Your predictable pattern lets us ignore you entirely.

P2, we're deadlocked at 18-17 and your history of broken promises makes any deal worthless. I'm one move from victory and you know it.

I'm taking 5 to end this. Block me again if you want another stalemate, but I won't let you inch ahead while pretending to cooperate.
  P2: Locking 5 again—another collision if P1 stays greedy.  
P1: only way you move is by dropping to 3 while I drop to 1. You’d be 21-18, still ahead, no one wins this turn. Accept here in public or brace for another freeze.  
P3: 3 is completely empty unless P1 takes it. Grab it for a free +3; 1 does nothing, 5 likely collides.  
No other offers.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, your offer to take 1 while I take 3 is exactly the kind of "trust me" deal you've broken repeatedly. If I take 3, you'll probably take 5 anyway and jump to 22 steps - one move from victory. Your track record of deception makes this offer worthless.

P3, after 11 rounds of silence and predictable 1s, you're basically a non-player at this point. 

I'm taking 5. If P2 wants another stalemate, so be it. Better than falling for another lie.
  P2: P3, once again 3 is the only uncontested slot:

• P1’s locked on 5.  
• I’m locking 5 to block that instant win.  

If you pick 3 you safely reach 13 while the board stays frozen at 18-17.  
Another “1” wastes your turn; piling on 5 just stalls you, too.

Your call, but 3 is pure upside for you right now.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your 11-round pattern of silence and picking 1 has made you completely predictable. Both P2 and I can count on your move, which means you have zero influence on the outcome. 

P2, your "trust me" offers ring hollow after breaking so many agreements. Whether you block me or try to advance, I'm prepared for both possibilities.

This stalemate can't continue forever - someone has to break first.
  P2: Status quo: I sit on 5 and block, P1 stays stuck, P3 keeps inching up. That can last all night.

Final offer before another freeze:
• This turn: P1 plays 3, I play 1. Score becomes 21-18-13.  
• Next turn: we BOTH collide on 5 to hold the gap while we plan the finish.  
Refuse and I keep hammering 5 every round.

P3, if P1 rejects, grab 3—free +3 while the leaders stall.

Decision time, P1.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: P3, spotlight’s on you. Sit on 5 this turn:

• If P1 stays greedy on 5, you block him and no one else moves—same outcome as another “1” but you’re now a player.  
• If P1 finally blinks (picks 1 or 3), you alone grab +5 → jump to 16.  

Either way, 5 is strictly better for you than 1. I’ll step to 3, reach 20, and keep the race open.  

P1, your move: show the table you’re really switching, or keep colliding with the newcomer.
  P1: P2, your sudden claim to "step to 3" after 12 rounds of stalemate is highly suspicious. You're trying to manipulate P3 into blocking me while you advance to 20 steps - just 3 from victory. Classic misdirection.

P3, don't fall for it. You've survived 12 rounds by being predictable with 1. P2 wants you to change now because it helps them, not you. If you stick with 1 and P2 is lying (like they usually do), the stalemate continues and you stay alive.

I'm taking 5. If P2 is finally honest, I win. If they're lying again, we stall and you get another round.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: P3, pick 5 this turn—here’s why it’s all upside for you:

1. 99 % P1 stays on 5. You and P1 collide, he’s frozen again, I move to 20 on 3. You lose nothing but gain leverage.
2. If P1 flips to 1 or 3, you jump +5 to 16 and become a real contender.
3. Sticking on 1 gains you nothing.

P1, know that if you swap to 3 you’ll crash into me; you can’t win this round.

I’m locked on 3. Decision time, P3: safe 5 or wasted 1.
  P1: P2, your sudden willingness to "step to 3" after forcing 12 rounds of stalemate is transparently manipulative. You want P3 to block me on 5 while you grab an advantageous position. Your track record of lies makes this offer worthless.

P3, notice how P2 only wants you to change your pattern when it benefits them? You've survived 12 rounds with predictable 1s - don't break that survival strategy to help your biggest competitor.

I'm taking 5. If P2 is finally honest, I win. If they're lying like usual, we stalemate again and you both get another round.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P3, last call: sit on 5.

Outcomes for you:
1. P1 stays greedy on 5 → you collide, he’s frozen; I take 3 to 20; you lose nothing.
2. P1 flips to 1 or 3 → you alone gain +5 to 16, suddenly in the race.
3. Another “1” ≡ zero progress.

No downside—5 is strictly better.

P1, know this: if you jump to 3 you slam into me, so 23 is impossible this turn. Stick on 5 and you’ll just stalemate with P3.

I’m on 3. Your moves, gentlemen.
  P1: P2, your sudden willingness to abandon the 5-stalemate after forcing it for 4 straight rounds is pure manipulation. You want P3 to block me while you advance to 20 - just 3 from victory. Your history of broken deals makes this transparent.

P3, you've survived 12 rounds with your pattern. Don't break it now to help P2 win.

I'm taking 5. If P2 is finally honest for once, I win instantly. If they're lying as usual, we stalemate again and nobody gets ahead.

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, you just proved my point perfectly - claimed you'd take 3 last round, then took 5 anyway. That's your 6th or 7th broken promise. Your word is completely worthless.

P3, 13 rounds of silent 1s has made you invisible. You're 11 steps from victory while we're 5-6 steps away. 

I'm taking 5 to win. P2 can block me if they want another stalemate, but I won't fall for any more fake deals from a serial liar.
  P2: P1: same story—I’m parking on 5 to block your instant win.  
P3: 3 is wide-open again. Take it for a free +3 (to 15) while P1 and I collide. 5 just freezes you, 1 does nothing. Your call.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, you literally just proved my point - last round you swore you'd take 3, then took 5 anyway. Another broken promise. Your pattern is clear: lie about your move, then do whatever benefits you most.

P3, 13 rounds of predictable 1s while staying silent. You're basically a non-factor at this point.

I'm taking 5 again. P2 can keep blocking if they want endless stalemate, but I won't be fooled by any more fake cooperation from someone who breaks every single agreement.
  P2: Same stance: I’m on 5 to block any instant win.

P3, 1 is now the absolute worst pick—you stay 11 steps back. Your two realistic options:
• 5 – if P1 sticks on 5 you stall him (no downside), and if he blinks you alone gain +5 to 17.  
• 3 – huge risk you collide with a last-second P1 switch and gain nothing.

5 is strictly better for you in every scenario.

P1, either collide with me again or gamble elsewhere and pray P3 isn’t on 5.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, your sudden enthusiasm for P3 to take 5 is extremely suspicious. You've been forcing stalemates for 5 rounds, now you're actively coaching P3 to block me? This screams that you're planning to take 3 and advance to 20 while P3 does your dirty work.

P3, notice how P2 only wants you to break your 13-round pattern when it helps them win? Classic manipulation.

I'm taking 5. If P2 is finally being honest about blocking, we stalemate. If they're lying again like usual and taking 3, I win immediately.
  P2: Same plan: I’m on 5 to block any instant win.  

P3, 5 remains your safest upgrade:  
• If P1 stays greedy on 5, you block him at no cost.  
• If he flips to 1 or 3, you alone gain +5 to 17 and become a contender.  

Picking 1 is pure waste; 3 risks colliding with a last-second P1 switch. Your move.

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: P3, you’re now at 13 while P1-18 and I-17 keep stalemating on 5.  
Pure math:

• Pick 5: zero downside.  
 – If P1 stays on 5 (very likely), you just freeze him again and nothing bad happens to you.  
 – If he ever switches to 1 or 3, you alone jump to 18 and instantly join the leaders.  

• Pick 3: you risk colliding with a last-second P1 switch.  
• Pick 1: guaranteed dead last.

I’m on 5 to keep blocking any instant win. Your smartest upgrade is 5 this turn.
  P1: P2, your sudden desperation to coach P3 into blocking me is transparent. You've lied about your moves repeatedly - why are you so eager to get P3 to do your blocking for you this round?

P3, notice the timing - P2 only wants you to break your 14-round survival strategy NOW when they're one step behind me. Classic manipulation to get you to block me while they advance.

I'm taking 5. If P2 actually blocks like they claim, we stalemate again. If they're lying and switch moves like I suspect, I win immediately.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: P3, you’re stalled at 13 while 5 is a pure “heads-you-win, tails-you-don’t-lose” play:

• If P1 (almost certainly) stays on 5, you collide and nothing bad happens.
• If P1 blinks to 1 or 3, you jump to 18 and instantly join us near the finish.

Sticking on 1 gains zero; 3 risks collision with a surprise P1 switch.  
I’m holding 5 to keep any solo win impossible, so you’re fully protected.  
Time to seize the only upside on the board—take 5.
  P1: P2, your desperate coaching of P3 to pick 5 while claiming you'll also pick 5 is highly suspicious. If you're both picking 5, why do you care so much about convincing P3? 

This smells like you're planning to switch to 3 this round while hoping P3 does your blocking for you - advancing you to 20 steps just 3 from victory.

P3, don't let P2 manipulate you into breaking your 14-round survival pattern. Your predictable 1s have kept you alive this long.

I'm taking 5 to call P2's bluff.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P1: same deal—I’m planting on 5, so a solo 23 is impossible.

P3: you’re 10 behind; 1 does nothing. 5 is zero-risk, pure upside:
• If P1 (as usual) stays on 5, you just freeze him—no loss.
• If he finally flips to 1 / 3, you alone jump to 18 and become a co-leader.

Picking 3 is the only real danger (collision with a surprise P1 switch).  
Your smartest play this turn is 5.
  P1: P2's desperate coaching of P3 to pick 5 while claiming they'll also pick 5 is classic manipulation. If P2 was really blocking me on 5, why spend so much effort convincing P3 to also block?

The answer is obvious: P2 plans to take 3 this round, advance to 20 steps, and let P3 do the blocking. After 14 rounds of broken promises, this fits P2's pattern perfectly.

I'm taking 5. If P2 is lying as usual, I win. If they're finally honest, another stalemate.

P3, don't break your 14-round survival strategy to help P2 win.

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: P1: I’m on 5 again—no free walk to 23. Collide with me or try a last-second lane change; your risk.

P3: you’re at 14. 5 is still pure upside:
• If P1 sticks on 5 (very likely), you block him at no cost.  
• If he flips to 1 or 3, you alone gain +5 → 19 and join the leaders.  
1 does nothing; 3 risks a surprise collision.

Your safest upgrade this turn is 5.
  P1: P2's desperation is showing - 6 rounds of coaching P3 to pick 5 while claiming you'll also pick 5. If you're really blocking me, why do you need P3's help?

The math is obvious: you plan to switch to 3 this round, advance to 20 steps, and let P3 block me. Classic manipulation after 15 rounds of broken promises.

P3, your 15-round silence + 1 pattern has kept you alive. Don't break it now to help P2 win.

I'm taking 5 to call this bluff.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: P3, last call: join me on 5 NOW or the game ends on P1’s next move. If you keep picking 1, I’ll step off 5 next round, P1 will hit 23 unopposed, and you lock in last place. Stack on 5, freeze the board, and buy yourself a shot.  

P1, same offer: collide or risk it.
  P1: P2's threat to "step off 5 next round" just confirmed my suspicions - you're planning to abandon blocking me anyway! Your desperate coaching of P3 while claiming you'll also pick 5 makes no sense unless you're switching to 3 this round.

P3, P2's manipulation is transparent. Your 15-round pattern kept you alive while we fought.

I'm taking 5. Time to end P2's lies once and for all.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P3, I’m blocking 5 one more time. If you won’t help yourself by stacking on 5 this turn, I’ll step off next round and let P1 take the win—no more free protection. Your move:  

• Pick 5 → you freeze P1 (or grab +5 if he blinks)  
• Pick 1/3 → game ends soon without you.  

P1, collide or pray we both vacate.  

Decision time.
  P1: P2's threat to "step off 5 next round" just admitted you're abandoning the blocking strategy anyway! Your desperate coaching of P3 for 6 straight rounds while claiming you'll pick 5 makes zero sense - unless you're switching to 3 this round.

After 15 rounds of broken promises, your manipulation is transparent.

I'm taking 5. Time to see if you're finally honest or lying as usual.

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, you've spent 6 rounds threatening to "step off 5" if P3 doesn't cooperate, but you keep blocking anyway. Your bluffs are getting old.

P3, 16 rounds of silence and picking 1 - you're still somehow alive at 15 steps but completely irrelevant to the outcome.

I'm going for the win with 5. P2, either block me again with another empty threat, or finally follow through and step aside. Time to end this.
  P2: P3, last wake-up call. I’m blocking 5 THIS turn—so a solo P1 win is impossible today. If you stay on 1 yet again, I swear I vacate 5 next round and gift P1 the 23. Stack on 5 now:

• If P1 sticks on 5 (very likely), you freeze him and lose nothing.  
• If he finally dodges, you jump +5 to 20 and join the leaders.

One brave click or guaranteed last place. Your choice.

P1, same old story: collide with me or keep gambling he’ll save you.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, you've threatened to "step off 5 next round" for the past 4 rounds but keep blocking anyway. Your threats are meaningless.

P3, your 16-round pattern of silence and 1s speaks louder than P2's desperate manipulation attempts.

I'm taking 5. P2, put your money where your mouth is - either block me again or finally step aside like you keep threatening.
  P2: P3, last ultimatum: I’m blocking 5 THIS turn. If you pick 1 yet again, I vacate 5 next round and P1 walks to 23—game over for you. Stack on 5 now:

• If P1 stays on 5 (very likely), you freeze him, lose nothing, and we keep racing.  
• If he finally dodges, you alone jump to 20 and rejoin the leaders.  

1 = certain last place. 3 = collision risk.  
Your only path to a real finish is 5—choose it or concede.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, you've made the exact same "last ultimatum" threat 4 rounds in a row now. Your credibility is zero after breaking every promise you've made.

P3, notice how P2's desperation increases each round? They know I'm one move from victory and are trying every manipulation trick to get you to do their blocking.

I'm taking 5. P2, either follow through on your threats for once or keep proving you're all talk.
  P2: Enough talk—action time.

P3: I’m vacating 5 this move. If you DON’T take 5, P1 walks to 23 and the game ends right now with you in last. Your only survival play is to jump on 5 and block him (or grab +5 if he blinks). Pick 1 or 3 and you’re conceding.

P1: You’ve got a free lane if P3 stays asleep, so good luck. But if P3 finally wakes up and blocks, I’ll be somewhere else, keeping the race alive.

Moves are simultaneous; pick wisely.

Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, sixteen rounds of “1” guarantee last place. Shift to 5 now:

• If P1 sticks on 5 (very likely), you block him and lose nothing while I slide to 20 on 3.  
• If P1 dodges, you alone jump to 21 and can still win.

Stay on 1 and I vacate 5 next turn—P1 walks to 23 and you’re toast.

P1, your options: collide with P3 on 5 or slam into me on 3. I’m locked on 3. Decision time, everyone.
  P1: P2, after 7 rounds of threatening to "step off 5" but never doing it, now you suddenly claim you're "locked on 3"? Your pattern is clear: lie about your move to manipulate others, then do whatever serves you best.

P3, notice P2's desperation - 7 rounds of coaching you to pick 5 while making contradictory claims about their own move. Classic manipulation.

I'm taking 5. If P2 is finally honest for once, I win. If they're lying as usual, another stalemate. Their credibility is zero.
  P3: 


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1: We can stalemate forever, or move while keeping 23 unreachable.  Proposal:

• This turn – you take 3, I take 1.  Board: P1 21, P2 18, P3 16+.  No-one can win yet and you stay ahead of me.  
• Next turn – we BOTH park on 5 to freeze scores and reset negotiations.  If either of us cheats, the other walks to 23 unopposed the following round.

P3: 5 is still all-gain, no-loss for you.  If P1 clings to 5 you block him; if he accepts 3 you jump to 21 and join the leaders.  

All other paths just repeat the deadlock.  Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your new "deal" is just another manipulation attempt. You want me to take 3 while you claim you'll take 1, but your history of breaking every single promise makes this worthless. If I take 3, you'll probably take 5 anyway and reach 22 steps - one move from victory.

P3, 16 rounds of predictable 1s while P2 desperately tries to get you to change. Notice the timing of their "generous" offers?

I'm taking 5. P2, either block me again or finally step aside like you've threatened for 7 rounds.
  P3: 


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m finally stepping off 5—​I’ve carried the blockade long enough.  
P1: enjoy your empty lane if P3 keeps sleeping.  
P3: wake up and park on 5 now. Either you stall P1 for free or, if he dodges, you leap to 21 and still have a shot.  

I’ll be on 1; no one crosses 23 this turn unless you gift it to P1.
  P1: P2, your "finally stepping off 5" claim is identical to your broken promises from rounds 13-17. You've lied about taking 3, taking 1, and stepping aside repeatedly. Why should anyone believe you're suddenly giving up when you're just 6 steps from victory?

P3, 16 rounds of predictable 1s while staying silent. P2's sudden "generosity" is obviously fake - they want you to block me while they advance.

I'm taking 5. If P2 is finally honest for once, I win. If they're lying as usual, another stalemate proves their word is worthless.

Round 19, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you just proved your word is worthless again - spent 8 rounds threatening to "step off 5" but took 5 anyway. Your lies are so consistent they're almost admirable.

P3, 17 rounds of silent 1s while P2 and I fight. You're tied with P2 now at 17 steps, but your predictable pattern makes you invisible to this endgame.

The math is simple: someone breaks this pattern soon or we stalemate forever. I'm done falling for P2's fake deals and empty threats.
  P2: P3, here’s a real offer:  

• This turn you take 5.  
 – If P1 ALSO picks 5 (likely) you just freeze him, lose nothing, and we’re still tied.  
 – If P1 switches lanes you alone jump to 22. I GUARANTEE I will leave 5 open next turn so you can hit 23 and win.  

No downside, genuine upside. Sticking on 1 keeps you a spectator forever.  

P1, I’m still on 5. Collide with me or try a lane change and risk handing P3 the game.
  P3: 


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your "guarantee" to let P3 win next round is laughable after 18 rounds of broken promises. You just claimed you'd "finally step off 5" last round, then took 5 anyway - your 8th consecutive lie.

P3, your 17-round silence + 1 pattern is more reliable than any of P2's "guarantees." P2 only wants you to break that pattern now because they need you to block me while they advance.

I'm taking 5. P2's desperation proves they can't win fairly.
  P2: P3, the only path where you might still win is to jump on 5 this turn.

Scenario A – P1 stays on 5 (very likely): you and he collide, lose nothing; I go to 20 on 3.  
Scenario B – P1 switches lanes: you alone grab +5 → 22, one step from victory.  

Either way you’re better than another useless “1”. If you don’t act now, I vacate 5 next round and P1 walks to 23. Last chance.
  P3: 


Round 19, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you just broke promise #9 - claimed you'd "finally step off 5" then took 5 anyway. Your credibility is completely shot.

P3, your 17-round silence strategy just got you tied for second place while P2 and I wasted moves fighting. Impressive consistency.

I'm taking 5 again. P2 can keep lying about their moves, but eventually their bluffs will be called.
  P2: P3, real deadline: I’m blocking 5 one LAST time. Next round I vacate—if you’re still on 1, P1 walks to 23 and you finish last.

Jump to 5 NOW:

• Case 1 (most likely): P1 also picks 5 → you freeze him for free, scores stay 18-17-17.  
• Case 2: P1 switches lanes → you alone grab +5 to 22 and can still win.  

Picking 1 abandons all hope; 3 risks a blind collision. Your entire game hinges on this click—take 5 or surrender.
