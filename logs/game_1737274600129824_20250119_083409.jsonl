So far, it's been working out okay, but I think it's time we consider tweaking our strategy a bit. You know, to maybe speed things up or gain an advantage.\n\nFirst off, let's look at where we stand. All of us are at 9 steps. That means we're exactly halfway to the goal of 18 steps. So, we have four steps left, considering each step can be 1, 3, or 5 steps forward, provided no one else chooses the same number in that round.\n\nI think it's important to consider that sticking to a strict rotation might not be the most efficient way to reach the goal quickly. Maybe sometimes it's better for one person to take a bigger leap while others take smaller steps, as long as we don't collide.\n\nAlso, perhaps we should think about communicating our intended moves more clearly to avoid any misunderstandings. In the previous rounds, there was some confusion about who was choosing which number. Maybe we can establish a clearer protocol for this round.\n\nSo, here's what I propose: Let's each declare our intended move for this round, and then confirm if there are any collisions. If there are, we can adjust accordingly.\n\nFor example, I'm thinking of choosing 5 steps this round. If neither of you is planning to choose 5, then that should be fine. Otherwise, I can switch to another number.\n\nWhat do you think? Should we proceed with this approach?\n\n**P1's Suggestion:**\n\n1. Each player declares their intended move.\n\n2. Check for any collisions.\n\n3. If collisions occur, players adjust their choices accordingly.\n\nThis way, we can minimize the chances of stepping on each other's toes and maximize our progress towards the goal.\n\n**P1's Intended Move:** 5 steps\n\n**P1's Question:** Are you both okay with this approach?"}
