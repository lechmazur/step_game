This keeps P1/P2 focused on their split, reducing their likelihood of blocking P3.  \n\n4. **Underlying Rationale**:  \n   - If P1/P2 follow the split, P3 gains 3 steps (reaching 17), putting them one round away from victory.  \n   - If P1/P2 collide again (e.g., both pick 5), they stall, and P3 can win next round regardless.  \n   - By appearing cooperative, P3 reduces suspicion, making it harder for P1/P2 to justify aggressive blocking moves.  \n\n**Message Sent**:  \n<say>Proceed with P1\u21921, P2\u21925.
