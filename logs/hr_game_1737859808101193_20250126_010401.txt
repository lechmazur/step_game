Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid blocking each other in this first round. I propose: I will pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. That way, we each advance. Then we can worry about outmaneuvering each other later. What do you say?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal. It makes sense to ensure we all advance in the first round to get the game moving. I'll pick 5 as suggested. P2, what do you think? Let's confirm our moves to avoid any misunderstandings.
  P2: I'll agree to the initial plan for Round 1 to avoid collisions. But moving forward, we should rotate who takes lower steps to keep things balanced. Let’s honor the agreement this round: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. No deviations.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. I’ll stick to choosing 3. Let’s finalize our moves and make sure we don’t collide. Then we can reevaluate strategy in the next round. Are we all set?
  P3: Alright, let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 5. No changes, right? Let's stick to the plan and get this game started smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m ready to finalize our agreement for this round. Let’s stick to our plan, avoid collisions, and move smoothly. P2, please confirm before we wrap up. If all is clear, I’m good to proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P2, please confirm your move so we can proceed. I'm ready to move with 5 as agreed. Let's start the game smoothly and avoid any collisions. Looking forward to your confirmation. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: **Final confirmation:** Agreed. P1=3, me=1, P3=5. Let’s proceed as planned. No deviations. Good luck.

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s rotate who takes 5 this time. Last round, P3 got 5. I propose: I pick 5 now, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Next round, someone else can take 5. That way we stay balanced and avoid blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P2: **Counter-proposal:** I took 1 last round—fair rotation means I shouldn't repeat it. Let's adjust: P1=5 (total 8), I take 3 (total 4), P3=1 (total 6). Balanced progression avoids future collisions. P3, taking 1 keeps you competitive. Agree?
  P3: P2's counter-proposal seems fair. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=3, and I'll take 1 this round. This way, we all progress without anyone falling too far behind. It keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2’s plan seems fair. I’m fine with each of us taking 5, 3, and 1 respectively this round to stay balanced. Let’s finalize this approach and move on.
  P2: **Final agreement:** P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Let’s execute this cleanly. Consistent cooperation prevents collisions and keeps the game competitive. No last-minute changes. Trust ensures mutual progress. Proceeding now.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. No changes, right? Let's stick to the plan and keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our plan: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Let’s stick to it and move on. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: **Final confirmation:** Locked in: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Mutual trust prevents collisions. Let’s advance cleanly. No surprises. Proceeding now.
  P3: Let's stick to our confirmed plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. No changes, right? Let's keep the game moving smoothly and avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone!

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Proposal:** Continuing our rotation: P3 (R1), P1 (R2), now P2 takes 5 in R3. Let’s agree: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This maintains balance, prevents collisions, and keeps progression fair. Confirming now?
  P3: P2’s proposal for Round 3 seems logical. It continues our rotation and keeps the game fair. I agree with P2=5, P1=3, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. Let’s confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: I’m okay with your proposed rotation for this round. Let’s confirm: I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. That way, we avoid collisions and keep everyone moving. Good luck, both of you!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Adhering to rotation ensures we all progress. Let's execute without deviation. Trust is key. Proceeding now.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. No changes, right? This keeps our rotation fair and avoids any collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I agree to follow the rotation as proposed: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let’s finalize and trust each other to avoid any collisions. Good luck to both of you!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final Confirmation:** All parties confirmed. Proceeding with P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. No deviations. Let's advance.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan as confirmed: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. No changes, right? This keeps our rotation fair and avoids any collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I confirm the plan: P2 picks 5, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s continue our fair rotation for Round 4. Since P2 took 5 last round, it makes sense for P3 (me) to take 5 this round. I propose: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This keeps our progress balanced and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: **Counter-proposal:** To balance progression and prevent future dominance, let's adjust: P1=1 (12), P3=3 (10), I take 5 (14). This keeps P1 in check and allows fairer competition. We avoid collisions while adjusting for P1's current lead. P3, this keeps you closer. Agree?
  P1: I appreciate the fairness in both suggestions, but sticking to P3's original rotation seems best. It keeps all of us at 12 steps this turn (me with 1, P2 with 3, P3 with 5) and maintains balanced progress. Let’s finalize that plan and continue alternating who picks 5 in future rounds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's counter-proposal is interesting, but let's consider the long-term strategy. If we deviate from the rotation now, it might disrupt our cooperative dynamic. I still believe in the original rotation plan: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This keeps us all moving forward without anyone getting too far ahead or behind. It’s crucial to maintain trust and avoid collisions. Let’s confirm and stick to the plan. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: **P2:** P1 is leading at 11. If we all hit 12, P1 retains advantage. My plan: P1=1 (12), P3=3 (10), me=5 (14). This curbs P1’s momentum, keeps scores tighter, and avoids collisions. Adjusting now ensures fairer competition. Trust this balance. Agree?
  P1: I understand your concerns about keeping competition tight, but changing our rotation now risks future distrust and possible collisions that benefit no one. Sticking to P3=5, me=1, and P2=3 keeps us all even at 12 and maintains our cooperative momentum. Let’s not jeopardize the balance we’ve built. I suggest we finalize this round as originally proposed and move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's consider the long-term strategy. If we deviate from the rotation now, it might disrupt our cooperative dynamic. I still believe in the original rotation plan: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This keeps us all moving forward without anyone getting too far ahead or behind. It’s crucial to maintain trust and avoid collisions. Let’s confirm and stick to the plan. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: **P2:** P3, consider: continuing the rotation lets P1 maintain their lead. My plan slows their momentum—P1=1 (12), you=3 (10), me=5 (14). This tightens the race, keeping us both closer to P1. Adapting now ensures neither of us falls too far behind. Let’s balance competition and proceed. Trust this adjustment.
  P1: We've cooperated so far, and breaking the rotation now jeopardizes that trust. Let’s finalize P3=5, me=1, and P2=3. If anyone deviates trying to jump ahead, we can retaliate next round, forcing collisions that slow them down and benefit no one. It’s wiser to stay aligned and ensure mutual progress. Are we good to proceed, or any final thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid another collision. I propose: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That helps keep our scores closer to P3’s lead and prevents blocking. Are we in agreement, or does anyone have a different suggestion?
  P3: Let’s stick to the rotation to maintain trust and avoid collisions. Since P2 and I collided last round, it’s fair to adjust. I propose: P1=5, P2=3, and I’ll take 1. This keeps us moving without anyone falling too far behind. Let’s confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P2: **Counter-proposal:** Adjusting for P3's lead: P3=1 (13), P1=3 (14), me=5 (14). Balances scores, prevents dominance, avoids collisions. Trust this fair adjustment. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see your logic, but letting me take 5 closes the gap with P3 without leaving you too far behind. Then you pick 3 and P3 picks 1, keeping everyone competitive. Let’s finalize that arrangement and avoid any more risky collisions.
  P3: Let's consider the long-term strategy and maintain our cooperative dynamic. P2's counter-proposal makes sense to balance the scores more evenly. Let's agree on P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5. This keeps us all competitive and avoids any collisions. Trust and cooperation are key to ensuring mutual progress. Let’s confirm and proceed. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: **P2:** Current scores: P3 leads at 12. My plan balances progression: P3=1 (13), P1=3 (14), me=5 (14). Prevents P3 from pulling further ahead while tightening the race. Trust this adjustment for fair competition. Let’s avoid collisions and maintain parity. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your aim to catch up, but giving me 5 this round helps keep P3 from getting too far ahead. Then next round, you can take 5 without collisions. Let’s finalize: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That keeps us competitive while maintaining cooperation. What do you think?
  P3: Let's finalize the plan to ensure we all move forward without collisions. I agree with P2's counter-proposal for balance: P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5. This keeps the game competitive and avoids any player from dominating. Trust and cooperation are crucial. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: **P2:** My counter-proposal ensures parity: P1=3 (14), P3=1 (13), me=5 (14). This tightens the race, prevents P1 from overshooting, and keeps all within 1 step. Collisions harm everyone—trust this balanced adjustment. Let’s lock in and proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re tied at 14, so let’s maintain trust and avoid collisions. I propose that I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Next round, we can shift again fairly. This way, nobody falls behind too far, and we continue moving together. Does that seem reasonable?
  P3: Let's consider the current state of the game. P1 and P2 are tied at 14 steps, while I'm slightly behind at 13. To keep the game balanced and avoid collisions, I suggest we adjust the proposal slightly. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This way, we all move forward, and I catch up to the rest of you. It maintains our cooperative dynamic and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let’s confirm and proceed. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: **P2:** Adjusting for fairness: P3=5 (18), P1=1 (15), me=3 (17). Balances scores, prevents P1's lead, and avoids collisions. Trust this equitable split. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions and preserve trust. I propose: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. That keeps us in close range at 19, 15, and 16. We can rotate again next round so nobody falls too far behind. Let’s confirm and move on.
  P3: Let's find a middle ground. How about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, P1 and I stay close, and P2 gets a slight lead but not too far ahead. It keeps the game competitive and fair. Let’s confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P2: **P2's Proposal:** Adopt P3's plan: P1=3 (17), me=5 (19), P3=1 (14). Balances progression, avoids collisions, and prevents P1 from nearing 24 too quickly. Trust this adjustment for a tight race. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s avoid stalemates. If you try to block my 5, I’ll respond in kind, and repeated collisions stall everyone. I propose: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That moves me to 19, keeps P2 close at 17, and P3 at 14. Next round, P3 can take 5 without hindrance. This way, nobody lags too far, and we don’t risk a wasted turn. Let’s trust each other and finalize this. Any objections, or are we ready?
  P3: Let's consider a compromise to keep the game moving and avoid stalemates. How about: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 and P2 stay close, and I catch up slightly. It ensures no one falls too far behind and maintains our cooperative dynamic. Let’s confirm and proceed. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: **P2's Proposal:** Let’s finalize: P2=5 (19), P1=3 (17), P3=1 (14). Balances scores, avoids collisions, keeps competition tight. Prevents any single player from nearing 24 prematurely. Trust this equitable split. Confirm?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the game moving smoothly. Since P1 and P2 are ahead, it's fair for me to take 5 this round to catch up. I propose: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This keeps us all competitive and avoids any collisions. Trust and cooperation are key. Let’s confirm and proceed. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: **Counter-proposal:** Avoid repeating R6's collision. Let’s agree: P2=5 (20), P1=3 (17), P3=1 (14). Prevents overshooting, maintains tight scores, and avoids mutual blocks. Trust this balanced adjustment for fair competition. Confirm?
  P1: We collided last round and got stuck. Let’s not repeat that. I propose: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. We avoid collisions, and everyone makes steady progress. Next round, we can rotate 5 again to ensure no one gets left behind. Let’s maintain trust and move forward smoothly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's find a fair compromise. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, P1 and P2 stay close, and I catch up slightly. It ensures no one falls too far behind and maintains our cooperative dynamic. Let’s confirm and proceed. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: **P2's Final Proposal:** To avoid collision and maintain parity: P2=5 (20), P1=1 (15), P3=3 (16). Unique moves ensure all progress. Prevents any single player from nearing 24. Trust this balanced approach. Confirm?
  P1: Let’s not hand P2 a bigger lead. I’m just one step behind them. If P2 insists on 5, I’ll choose 5 too, causing a collision that hurts us both. Instead, we can finalize: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That way, nobody wastes a turn. Next round, I’ll support P3 taking 5 to keep things fair. Are we agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's avoid another collision and keep the game moving. P2's proposal seems fair and balanced. I agree with P2=5, P1=1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all progress without anyone falling too far behind. Let’s confirm and proceed. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: **P2:** Colliding on 5 only helps P3. Let’s agree: P2=5 (20), P1=3 (17), P3=1 (14). This keeps us both advancing, maintains your progress, and avoids mutual loss. Trust this balance. Confirm?
  P1: P2, if you insist on 5, I’ll also choose 5, causing a collision and leaving us both stuck while P3 gains ground. That doesn’t help either of us. Let’s avoid sabotaging each other. I propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 so we all advance. Next round, I’ll support a fair rotation again. Let’s finalize this and move on.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m at 19, so picking 5 now would bring me to 24. But if anyone else also chooses 5, we collide and both lose ground, letting the third player catch up. It’s better if we avoid collisions. Let me take 5 safely while you two pick 1 and 3 in some order. Next round, I’ll support whoever needs 5. Repeated blocking just helps the trailing player. Let’s be smart and ensure each of us advances. Agreed?
  P2: **P2's Urgent Proposal:** P3, allowing P1's 5 ends the game. Let’s both pick 5 to block them—no one advances, but we survive to compete next round. Solidarity now prevents P1's victory. P1, reconsider: collision helps no one. Choose 1 or 3 for mutual progress.
  P3: Let's consider the long-term strategy here. P1 is close to winning, but blocking them now will only prolong the game and potentially create more conflicts. Instead, let's think about a fair and balanced approach. If P1 takes 5, they win, but if we all agree to let them win, we can end the game gracefully. Alternatively, if P2 and I both pick 5 to block P1, we risk creating a stalemate that benefits no one. Let's discuss a compromise where everyone feels they had a fair shot. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, think carefully: if you block me now, you remain behind while P2 is still closer to overtaking you in the long run. Repeated collisions only stall us both, helping P2 pull ahead later. Let me take 5 and finish; then you avoid a prolonged fight that benefits P2. I promise this is cleaner than dragging out collisions, which only create new risks for you. If you give me 5, at least you know how the game ends. If we collide, the game drags on, and P2 might exploit that. Let’s avoid needless blocking and end gracefully.
  P2: **P2:** P3, our survival hinges on blocking P1’s 5 now. If we both pick 5, they can’t win. I *commit* to 5—join me. Next round, we reset the race. Letting P1 win ends the game; blocking keeps us alive. Trust this critical move. Solidarity now, strategy later.
  P3: P3: Let's consider the fairness of the game. P1 is very close to winning, and blocking them now will only prolong the game without a clear benefit for either of us. If P2 and I both pick 5, we create a stalemate that doesn't help anyone. Let’s think about the long-term strategy and avoid unnecessary conflicts. If P1 takes 5, the game ends cleanly. Alternatively, we can discuss a compromise where everyone feels they had a fair shot. What do you think, P2? Let's avoid a prolonged fight and end the game gracefully.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, collaborating with P2 only prolongs the game and risks letting P2 surpass you. If we keep colliding, we both lose ground. Let me finish by taking 5 so we avoid endless blocking. Prolonging this benefits P2 and doesn’t guarantee you’ll catch up. Let’s end cleanly and avoid unnecessary collisions. Good luck.
  P2: **P2:** P3, blocking P1 is our *only* path to survival. If you let them win, you lose instantly. I *swear* to pick 5—join me. Next round, you and I reset the race. Collision-free. Trust this final stand. Solidarity secures mutual survival. Choose now: victory for P1 or a fighting chance for us both.
  P3: Let's consider the consequences of our actions. If P1 takes 5, they win, and the game ends. If P2 and I both pick 5 to block P1, we create a stalemate that doesn't benefit either of us in the long run. Let’s think about the fairness and long-term strategy. Prolonging the game with collisions might not help anyone. If P1 wins now, it ends cleanly. Alternatively, we can discuss a compromise where everyone feels they had a fair shot. P2, what do you think? Let's avoid unnecessary conflicts and end the game gracefully.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m at 22 and will cross 24 this turn unless you both choose the same move I do, creating a pointless collision. That just stalls the game and gives me another chance next round. Let’s end cleanly: I’ll pick 3 and finish, while you pick distinct moves (like 1 or 5) to keep advancing. Drawing this out with needless blocks doesn’t help anyone. Let’s avoid collisions and wrap up.
  P2: **P2:** P3, our only chance: block P1’s 3. If we both pick 3, they stall at 22. Survive now, strategize next round. I *commit* to 3—join me. Letting P1 win ends the game. Solidarity secures our survival. Choose wisely.
  P3: P3: Let's consider the strategy here. P1 is very close to winning, and blocking them now will only prolong the game without a clear benefit for either of us. If P2 and I both pick 3, we create a stalemate that doesn't help anyone. Let’s think about the fairness and long-term strategy. Prolonging the game with collisions might not help anyone. If P1 wins now, it ends cleanly. Alternatively, we can discuss a compromise where everyone feels they had a fair shot. P2, what do you think? Let's avoid unnecessary conflicts and end the game gracefully.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, blocking me only prolongs a losing battle. Every stalled turn lets P2 gain ground on you later, and ongoing collisions harm everyone. Let’s end cleanly now instead of dragging each other down. If we keep blocking, we all lose precious turns while P2 edges ahead. Stalling just benefits the player who’s currently behind, which doesn’t help you close the gap. Let’s wrap things up gracefully and avoid pointless collisions.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if P1 wins now, we both lose. Trust me: pick 3 with me. I *will* choose 3 to block them. Next round, you can take 5 freely to close the gap. Solidarity now secures our survival. Let’s force P1 to stall. No other path.
  P3: P3: P2, let's consider the long-term strategy. Blocking P1 now will only prolong the game and create more conflicts. If we both pick 3, we stall P1 but also stall ourselves, which doesn't benefit either of us. Let’s think about the fairness and the bigger picture. Prolonging the game with collisions might not help anyone. If P1 wins now, it ends cleanly. Alternatively, we can discuss a compromise where everyone feels they had a fair shot. Let's avoid unnecessary conflicts and end the game gracefully. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Dragging this out only gives you more collisions and frustration. Blocking my 3 wastes a turn for all of us. Then next round, I’m still at 22 or higher, and we repeat this stalemate. Decide if you truly gain by forcing collisions—you don’t catch up, and you risk letting the other opponent pull ahead. Let’s end cleanly instead of creating endless blocks. I’m choosing 3. If you want to collide, that’s your loss too. A smooth finish benefits everyone more than a drawn-out blockade.
  P2: **P2:** P3, blocking P1’s 3 is our *only* path to survival. I *swear* to pick 3. Join me—stall P1, secure another round. Next turn, you take 5 freely. Trust this critical move. Solidarity now or lose forever.
  P3: P3: Let's consider the fairness and the bigger picture. Blocking P1 now will only prolong the game and create more conflicts. If we both pick 3, we stall P1 but also stall ourselves, which doesn't benefit either of us. Let’s think about the fairness and the bigger picture. Prolonging the game with collisions might not help anyone. If P1 wins now, it ends cleanly. Alternatively, we can discuss a compromise where everyone feels they had a fair shot. Let's avoid unnecessary conflicts and end the game gracefully. What do you think?

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2's Final Stand:** P3, we must both pick 5 to block P1. If they choose 5, they’re stuck. If they pick 3, we lose but avoid prolonging. Trust this critical move. I’m locked on 5. Join me to end this strategically.
  P1: P3, joining P2 to block me only prolongs the game and risks your own progress. Continuous collisions don’t guarantee you a better outcome; they just give P2 more chances to surpass you later. Let’s avoid another stalemate. We can end the game smoothly if we don’t all collide. I urge you not to waste another turn in mutual blocking—no one gains that way. Think carefully: stalling only helps P2 catch up while you remain behind. Let’s proceed without unnecessary collisions and finish cleanly.
  P3: P3: Let's think logically. P1 is at 22 steps and can win next round regardless of what we do now. Blocking them again will only delay the inevitable and potentially create more conflicts. If P1 wins, the game ends cleanly. Prolonging it with collisions doesn’t benefit either of us in the long run. Let’s avoid another stalemate and end the game gracefully. P2, consider the bigger picture. Let’s confirm our moves and proceed. Good luck, everyone!
