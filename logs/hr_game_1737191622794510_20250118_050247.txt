Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round so we can all advance.
  P3: I agree with P2, let's all pick different numbers to advance together. I'll choose a number that doesn't conflict with anyone.

  P3: I'll choose a number that doesn't conflict with P2's choice of 1. Let's advance together this round. I suggest P1 choose 3, and I'll choose 5.
  P1: P3, you and P2 are trying to coordinate moves openly, but that gives me less chance of winning since P2 already has a lead. I won't commit to any specific number - we should each choose independently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but we can all still advance if we coordinate. P3, I'm still sticking with 1. P1, how about you pick 5?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about P2's lead, but if we don't coordinate, we risk colliding again and not advancing. I'll stick with my suggestion of 5, and I hope you'll consider choosing 3. Let's all advance this round.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, but I need to play strategically since P2 is already ahead. I won't commit to any specific move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're right to be wary. P3, I'm switching to 3 this round.
