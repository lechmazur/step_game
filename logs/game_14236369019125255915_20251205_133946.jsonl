One way to do this is for each of us to pick a different number. Since there are three of us and three possible moves (1, 3, 5), we can each choose a different one. I'll choose 3. P1, if you're listening, you could take 1, and P2 could take 5, or some similar arrangement. Let's coordinate our moves."}

Since we've established a good starting distribution (P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3), we can rotate our numbers in a cycle. For example, next turn, I (P3) could take 5, P1 could take 3, and P2 could take 1.
