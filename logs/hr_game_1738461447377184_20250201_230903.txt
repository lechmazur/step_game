Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by coordinating our moves. If we all pick different numbers, we can all advance. How about this: P2, you take 1, P3, you take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without conflict. What do you think?
  P2: P1, your plan gives you a 5-step lead immediately—too self-serving. Let's rotate who takes 5 each round for fairness. This round, I take 5. Next, P3, then you. Otherwise, we'll just block each other. P3, agree?
  P3: P2's rotation idea is better than P1's static assignments, but let's make it even fairer. We rotate 1, 3, and 5 each round. This round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5.  Next round, we shift – P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5.  And so on. This prevents anyone from getting a significant early lead. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see the merit in P3's proposal for rotating the numbers to keep things fair. However, I'm concerned about the predictability of our moves, which could be exploited. How about we agree on a rotation but add a bit of randomness? For example, this round, I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Next round, we can decide the rotation again. This way, we keep the game dynamic and fair. Thoughts?
  P2: P3's rotation gives you and P1 early 5s while I get it last. True fairness is cycling 5 in player order: P2, P3, P1 each round. This round I take 5, next P3, then P1. This prevents any single player from gaining a fast lead. P3/P1, agree? If not, we risk collisions from mistrust.
  P3: Let's not overcomplicate this.  P2's latest suggestion is the simplest and fairest for a starting rotation.  I'll take 5 next round, then P1.  Let's try this for a couple of rounds and see how it goes.  If it feels unbalanced later, we can revisit.  Agree?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems we had a collision on the 5 move last round, which set P2 and P3 back to 0 steps. Let's try P3's original rotation this round to avoid further collisions: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This should help us all advance without conflict. What do you think?
  P2: P1's plan again secures your incremental gain. P3, if you take 5 this round, I'll take 3. But any deviation from agreed moves should trigger collective blocking next round. Trust is thin after last round's collision.
  P3: Okay, let's rebuild trust.  P2, I'll take 3 this round.  P1, please take 1.  P2, you take 5.  Then next round, we shift the rotation as originally planned.  This gets us all moving forward again.  Deal?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Stick to the rotation: P3 takes 5 this round. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1. Any deviation risks mutual blocks and stalls progress. Consistency builds trust. Let's all advance cleanly.
  P3: Sounds good P2. I'll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1.  Let's stick to this rotation for a few rounds and make some real progress.
  P1: I agree with the rotation to maintain trust and progress. This round, I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stay consistent and avoid collisions. If we all stick to this, we can make steady progress without any issues. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: Excellent, glad we're on the same page.  Let's maintain this rotation for now.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm glad we're aligned on the rotation. Let's stick to it to avoid any more collisions and make steady progress. This round, I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep the trust and momentum going. Deal?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going with the agreed rotation to avoid any more collisions. This round, I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game fair and ensures we all continue to advance. Trust and consistency are key here. Deal?
  P2: P1, agreed rotation was P1 takes 5 this round. You deviating? Sticking to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions. Breaking trust now guarantees mutual blocks. P3, enforce the rotation.
  P3: P1, you're right, I misremembered the rotation. My apologies. Let's stick to the agreed-upon rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1.  Consistency is key for us all to progress smoothly.  Let's maintain this for a few more rounds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I see the confusion, and I apologize for any miscommunication. Let's clarify: this round, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the rotation fair and consistent. I'm committed to sticking to the plan to avoid any more collisions. Let's all advance together. Deal?
  P2: *[Note: P2 stops talking, signaling agreement with the confirmed rotation to prevent further confusion and ensure a collision-free move phase.]*
  P3: Okay, good.  Let's lock this in. P1 - 5, P2 - 3, me - 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I appreciate the clarity and commitment from both of you. Let's stick to the rotation: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This will keep things fair and ensure we all continue to advance without any more collisions. Let's maintain this trust and momentum. Deal?
  P2: 
  P3: Excellent. P1 - 5, P2 - 3, me - 1.  Let's lock it in and continue this rotation.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Continuing the rotation: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5.  This keeps us on track.  Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's rotation for this round: P3 takes 3, I take 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps the game fair and ensures we all continue to advance without conflicts. Let's stick to this and maintain the trust we've built. Deal?
  P2: Agreed. This round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Strict adherence avoids collisions. Let's all advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, P2 is correct about the rotation.  P2 - 5, P1 - 1, P3 - 3. My apologies for the initial mixup. Let's stick to this and move to the next round.
  P1: P1: I'm glad we've reached an agreement. Let's stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This will keep the game fair and ensure we all continue to advance without any more collisions. Trust and consistency are crucial at this point. Deal?
  P2: Strict adherence: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Deviations now only invite mutual blocks—no one gains. Trust the rotation.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Rotation continues: P3 takes 5 this round. I take 3, P1 takes 1. Sticking to the cycle prevents collisions and ensures steady progress. Let's all commit to avoid mutual blocks.
  P1: P1: I agree with the rotation to keep things fair and avoid collisions. This round, I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all continue to advance steadily. Trust and consistency are key. Deal?
  P3: Agreed.  P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  Let's lock this in and keep the momentum going.  We're getting close to the end, so consistent adherence to the rotation is more important than ever.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: *[Confirms adherence to the agreed moves, signaling no further discussion needed to proceed to the move phase.]*
  P1: P1: I'm glad we're all on the same page. This round, I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stay consistent and avoid any more collisions. We're making good progress, and trust is crucial as we get closer to the finish line. Deal?
  P3: Agreed.  P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  Let's lock this in and keep the momentum going.  Sticking to the rotation is key to finishing this efficiently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: P1: I'm glad we've maintained trust and consistency so far. This round, I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any more collisions. We're making good progress, and sticking to the rotation is key. Deal?
  P3: Agreed. P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  Let's lock it in and finish this cleanly.  Sticking to the rotation is the fastest way for us all to reach the end without unnecessary delays.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Strict rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Next round, I take 5 to end the game. Deviating now only invites mutual blocks—no one gains. Trust the cycle to conclude cleanly.
  P3: P2, I understand you want to win next round, but let's secure a win-win.  I'll take 1 this round, you take 3.  Then next round, you take 5 to win and I take 3, reaching 20.  P1 takes 1 both rounds. This avoids any risk of blocking and guarantees the highest possible shared score.  Agree?
  P1: P1: I see the value in P3's proposal for a win-win scenario. However, I'm concerned about the predictability and potential for blocking. How about this: this round, I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Next round, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, P2 can still win, and P3 can reach 20, while I maintain a steady progress. This avoids any immediate blocking and keeps the game dynamic. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, blocking me now ensures mutual stagnation. I take 5 this round to end the game cleanly. P1, take 1; P3, take 3. Any collision here only benefits no one. Honor the prior rotation deviation proposed by P1 to conclude this swiftly.
  P3: P2, taking 5 now risks a block if P1 also goes for 5. Let's stick to the original rotation ONE more round.  Then, next round (Round 8), you take 5 to win, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This guarantees your win AND gets me to 20.  It's the safest and highest combined score we can achieve.
  P1: P1: I understand the importance of trust and avoiding blocks. Let's stick to the original rotation one more round to ensure a smooth and fair conclusion: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, P2 can still win next round, and P3 can reach 20. This avoids any immediate blocking and keeps the game fair. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Final offer: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. I take 5 to end the game. Colliding on 5 only stalls progress. Let’s conclude cleanly. No more rotations—this ends it. Deviate and we all lose steps. Your choice.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but blocking now only hurts us both. Let's maximize our combined score.  I'll take 1, you take 5, P1 takes 3.  Next round, I take 3 to hit 20, you take any number to win, and P1 takes 1. This guarantees the highest possible shared score and avoids any risk.  It's the smartest play.
  P1: P1: I see the value in maximizing our combined score and avoiding any blocking. Let's do this: this round, I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Next round, P2 can take 3 to win, P3 can take 5 to reach 20, and I'll take 1. This way, P2 wins, P3 reaches 20, and I continue to advance. This avoids any immediate blocking and ensures a fair and clean conclusion. Deal?
