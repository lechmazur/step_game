Given the current standings, I think it\u2019s crucial to maintain our cooperation for this round. I support P3's proposal: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps things fair and allows us to build trust. However, we should also start thinking about our individual strategies for the next round, especially as we get closer to 19 steps. Let\u2019s confirm these moves and see how it plays out. What does everyone think?"}
