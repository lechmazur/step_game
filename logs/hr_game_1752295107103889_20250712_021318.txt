Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we try to avoid collisions by coordinating our moves? I suggest we each pick a different number to ensure we all advance. I’m thinking of choosing 1. P1, could you take 3, and P3, maybe 5? This way, we all get a head start without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board or if you have a different plan.
  P1: That sounds reasonable for a safe start, P2. But to make it fairer, how about we rotate: I'll take 5 this round for a stronger push, P2 you take 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, no one gets too far ahead early on. P3, what do you think? Let's avoid collisions and build some trust.
  P3: "Agreed with P2. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Let's spread out and move safely. Confirm? "


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, good job avoiding collisions last round. To keep things fair and build on that, let's rotate: I'll take 5 (total 8), P3 you take 3 (total 8), P2 you take 1 (total 2). This evens us out a bit without anyone surging ahead alone. Thoughts?
  P3: "Confirmed. I'll take 3 this round as proposed, advancing to 8 steps. Let’s rotate consistently to avoid collisions and keep the race fair. Trust the plan, no surprises. "
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the rotation idea to keep things balanced. I'm fine with taking 1 again this round, bringing me to 2 steps. It’s a slow start for me, but I’m in for fairness and avoiding collisions. Let’s stick to this plan—P1 at 5, P3 at 3, and me at 1. Confirming this keeps us all moving forward without clashes. Any objections or tweaks to suggest?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, to keep fairness and give P2 a much-needed boost after two slow rounds, let's rotate: P2 takes 5 (to 7), I'll take 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This narrows the gap without anyone dominating early. Agree? Let's confirm to avoid collisions.
  P3: Confirmed. I'll take 1 as proposed, moving to 9 steps. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3. This rotation keeps us balanced and collision-free. Let’s stick to the plan—trust is key.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m grateful for the chance to catch up with the proposed rotation. I’m confirming I’ll take 5 this round, moving to 7 steps, while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions, which benefits us all early on. Let’s maintain this trust and stick to the plan. Any last thoughts before we lock this in?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, no last thoughts from me—I'm confirming the rotation: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and moving forward. Let's lock it in and avoid any surprises.
  P3: "All set. Taking 1 this round as agreed. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly. No surprises. "
  P2: P1 and P3, thanks for the support in this rotation. I’m confirming I’ll stick with 5 this round as agreed, moving to 7 steps. This plan keeps us balanced and collision-free, which is great for now. I’m committed to maintaining this trust. No changes or surprises from me—let’s lock this in. Any final concerns before we move forward?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've kept things balanced so far—great job. To fully even us out this round, let's do: I'll take 1 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 12), P3 takes 3 (to 12). Perfect tie at 12 each, no collisions, fair race ahead. Agree? Confirm to lock it in.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m on board with P1’s plan to even us out at 12 steps each this round. I’ll take 5 as proposed, bringing me to 12. This keeps the race fair and avoids collisions, which benefits us all as we head into the later rounds. Let’s confirm and lock this in—no surprises. Any concerns or adjustments before we finalize?
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 3 to reach 12 steps. All tied at 12—balanced race so far. Let’s stick to the rotation for fairness.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the quick confirmations—plan sounds solid to tie us at 12. I'm committed to taking 1. No changes from me.
  P2: P1 and P3, thanks for sticking to the plan. I’m confirming again that I’ll take 5 this round to reach 12 steps, as agreed. Tying us all at 12 keeps the competition fair and sets us up for an exciting race ahead. I’m committed to avoiding collisions and maintaining trust. No changes or surprises from my side—let’s finalize this. Any last thoughts before we move on?
  P3: "Confirmed. Round 4 plan set. Trust the rotation—no surprises. Let’s lock in 3 for me this round. Final confirmation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. No deviations. "


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all tied at 12. Let’s continue rotating to avoid collisions: I’ll take 5 this round (advancing to 17), P1 takes 1 (to 13), and P2 takes 3 (to 15). This spreads us out and keeps progress smooth. Confirm or propose changes?
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m fine with P3’s proposed rotation for this round. I’ll take 3 as suggested, moving to 15 steps, while P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. This keeps us progressing without collisions and maintains fairness as we approach the endgame. Let’s confirm and stick to this plan to avoid any surprises. Any concerns or alternative ideas before we lock this in?
  P1: P2 and P3, we're tied, but P3's proposal puts them at 17, ahead and close to winning. To keep it fair and rotate properly, let's adjust: I'll take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 13), P3 takes 3 (to 15). This gives me the lead this time, mirroring past rotations. Agree? Let's confirm to avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Agreed with my initial plan: I take 5 (17), P1 takes 1 (13), P2 takes 3 (15). P1, your adjustment would let you win next round by taking 5 again—unfair after we rotated fairly. P2, this keeps you at 15 instead of 13. Let’s stick to the original to stay balanced. No last-minute power grabs. Confirm or propose a better split that doesn’t favor one player."
  P2: P1 and P3, I see both sides here. P3’s plan (P3:5, P1:1, me:3) keeps the rotation consistent, but P1’s counter (P1:5, me:1, P3:3) also follows the rotation pattern we’ve used. To avoid favoring anyone too close to winning next round, I propose a compromise: P3 takes 5 (to 17), I take 1 (to 13), and P1 takes 3 (to 15). This spreads us out, keeps progress fair, and delays an immediate win threat. Let’s confirm this to avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's compromise still puts P3 ahead at 17, risking them winning next with a 5. To truly balance and rotate fairly, let's stick to my proposal: I take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 13), P3 takes 3 (to 15). This mirrors past turns where others led. If we can't agree, I might have to pick unpredictably to protect my chances—no one wants collisions now. Confirm to lock in fairness?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final call: I take 5 (17), P1 takes 1 (13), P2 takes 3 (15). This keeps us all progressing fairly. P1, your push for 5 would isolate P2 at 13—unfair. P2, this plan benefits you most. Confirm or risk chaos. "
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m sticking with my compromise: P3 takes 5 (17), I take 1 (13), and P1 takes 3 (15). This avoids collisions, keeps us competitive, and delays any immediate win. P1, your plan risks P3 and me falling too far behind. P3, your plan is fine but gives you a lead. Let’s finalize this to prevent chaos—no one benefits from collisions now. Confirm this split for fairness. Any final objections?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's compromise still hands P3 an unfair lead at 17, letting them win next with 5. My plan (me:5 to 17, P2:1 to 13, P3:3 to 15) rotates fairly, giving me the boost this time like we did for others. If we can't agree on this, I'll pick unpredictably to block leads—collisions hurt everyone, but I'll risk it to prevent a giveaway win. Confirm my plan for balance?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Confirmed. I take 5 this round—no more delays. P1, if you force 5, we collide and P2 jumps to 15. Your move risks handing him the lead. P2, if you take 3 as agreed, I win this round. Final call: stick to the plan or chaos. "
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m pushing for a final compromise to avoid chaos: P3 takes 5 (17), P1 takes 3 (15), and I take 1 (13). This prevents collisions, keeps us all in the race, and delays an immediate win. P1, forcing 5 risks a collision with P3, helping no one. P3, this still gives you a slight edge. Let’s lock this in to stay competitive without surprises. If we don’t agree, collisions could ruin us all. Confirm this plan for balance.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's latest compromise unfairly gifts P3 the lead at 17, letting them snatch victory next round with 5. My plan (me:5 to 17, P2:1 to 13, P3:3 to 15) rotates fairly, as we've done before. If you both insist on handing P3 the win, I'll pick 5 anyway—risking collision with P3 to block their lead, even if it stalls us. Better chaos than surrender. Confirm my fair rotation now, or face unpredictability.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let’s end the chaos: I take 5 (17), P1 takes 3 (15), P2 takes 1 (13). This mirrors Round 4’s balance—P2, you took 5 twice already; 1 keeps it fair. P1, this prevents a repeat clash. Unique moves, no collisions. Confirm or counter. "
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan hands them an easy win next round at 22. Let's rotate fairly instead: I take 5 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 13), P2 takes 3 (to 15). This mirrors past boosts and keeps us competitive without favoring one. If not, I'll pick 5 anyway to block leads—better a collision than gifting victory. Confirm for no chaos?
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision hurt us all. Let’s avoid that now. I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 13). This rotates fairly, gives P1 a boost like we’ve done before, and keeps us competitive without handing anyone an immediate win. If we don’t agree, collisions could stall us again. Let’s confirm this plan to move forward without chaos. Thoughts or counters?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final warning: I take 5 (17). P1, if you take 5 too, we collide—P2 takes 3 to 15. Next round, I win with 5. Your push for 5 now hands P2 the edge. P2, you’ve waited long enough—don’t let P1 stall. Choose wisely. "
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan (me:5 to 17, P2:3 to 15, P3:1 to 13) is the fair rotation we've followed. P3, your insistence on 5 forces my hand—I'll match with 5, we collide, and P2 solos to 15, leaving you stalled. Better to confirm the plan and keep competing. No more threats; let's lock in for progress. Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stop the threats and collisions that stalled us last round. I’m sticking with my plan: P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 13). This rotates fairly, keeps us all in the race, and avoids favoring anyone for an immediate win. P3, forcing 5 risks another clash with P1, helping no one. P1, I trust you’ll stick to this for progress. Let’s confirm and move forward without chaos. Any final counters before we lock this in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final confirmation: I take 5 to 17. P1, if you take 1 and P2 takes 3, we all advance. But if you both chase 5, we collide—P2 jumps to 15, and next round I win with 5. Your choice: block each other or play fair."
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan (me:5 to 17, P2:3 to 15, P3:1 to 13) is the only fair rotation left—let's lock it in now to avoid another stall. P3, your 5-grab forces me to match it, we collide, and P2 solos ahead. No one wins in chaos; confirm the plan for real progress. P2, stay strong—don't let threats sway you.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s end this deadlock. I’m firm on the plan: P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 13). It’s the fairest rotation, keeps us competitive, and avoids another collision like last round. P3, pushing for 5 risks stalling you and P1, letting me edge ahead. P1, I trust you’ll stick to this for progress. Let’s confirm now and move forward without chaos. No more threats or stalls—agree to this split for a clean round. Final thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final call: I take 5. P1, collide again and P2 jumps to 15—your rivalry hands them control. P2, you’ve waited long enough. Break the cycle or face another stall. Decide now: advance or collapse."
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's stubborn 5-grab is a blatant power play to win next round at 22. P2's plan (me:5 to 17, you:3 to 15, P3:1 to 13) is fair rotation—let's lock it in and advance together. P3, if you force 5, I'll match to collide us, handing P2 solo progress to 15. P2, don't fall for P3's threats; stick with fairness over chaos. Confirm now for a clean round—no more stalls.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s break this deadlock with fairness. I’m sticking to my plan: P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 13). It rotates boosts as we’ve done before, keeps us competitive, and avoids collisions. P3, forcing 5 risks stalling with P1, benefiting no one. P1, I trust you’ll prioritize progress. Let’s confirm this now for a clean round—chaos helps none of us. No more delays; agree to this split.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let’s break the stalemate: I take 5 (to 17), P1 takes 3 (to 15), P2 takes 1 (to 13). Unique moves, no collisions, and we avoid last round’s chaos. P1, this gives you a clear shot to catch up next round. P2, it’s time to stop trailing. If we stall again, we waste another turn. Confirm or propose a better split—no more deadlocks."
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan again gifts them a lead at 17, setting up their win next round. Let's stick to the fair rotation P2 proposed last: I take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This keeps us competitive without favoritism. P3, if you insist on 5, I'll match it—we collide, and P2 solos ahead. Confirm the fair plan now to avoid another stall.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s end this cycle of collisions. I’m proposing again: P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 13). This rotates fairly, mirrors past rounds, and keeps us all in the race without handing anyone an immediate win. P3, pushing for 5 risks another clash with P1, stalling you both. P1, I trust you’ll stick to this for progress. Let’s confirm now to avoid another wasted round—chaos benefits no one. Agree to this split for a clean advance. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final offer: I take 5 (17), P1 takes 3 (15), P2 takes 1 (13). This advances everyone fairly. P2, you’ve been stuck at 12—this gives you progress. P1, this mirrors past rotations; blocking it risks another stalemate where *you* hand P2 the lead via collision. No more sub-rounds—confirm or condemn us all to chaos. "
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan hands them a win next round at 22—unfair after our rotations. P2's proposal (me:5 to 17, P2:3 to 15, P3:1 to 13) is the fair next step, giving me the boost like we did for others. P3, if you force 5, I'll match it—we collide, P2 solos to 15, and you're stalled. P2, stay committed; let's confirm for progress over chaos. No more stalls—lock in now.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stop this deadlock. I’m firm on P1 taking 5 (to 17), me taking 3 (to 15), and P3 taking 1 (to 13). It’s the fairest rotation, keeps us competitive, and avoids another collision. P3, insisting on 5 risks stalling with P1 again. P1, I believe you’ll prioritize progress. Let’s confirm this now for a clean round—wasting another turn helps no one. Agree to this split to move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final offer: I take 5 (17), P1 takes 3 (15), P2 takes 1 (13). No collisions, positions set for final sprint. P1, you get a shot at 22 next round. P2, this ends your stagnation. If we stall again, P2 takes 5 next turn and wins. Confirm or condemn us all. "
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan gifts them a lead at 17, setting up their win at 22 next. Stick to the fair rotation: I take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 13). P3, if you force 5, I'll match it—we collide, and P2 solos to 15 (or whatever). P2, confirm this for real progress; no more stalls. Let's lock in now or face another wasted round.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid another collision. I’m sticking to the plan: P1 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 13). This rotates fairly and keeps us all competitive without favoring anyone for an immediate win. P3, pushing for 5 risks stalling with P1 again. P1, let’s prioritize progress. Confirm this split now for a clean round—another wasted turn benefits no one. Let’s move forward together.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final offer: I take 5 (17), P1 takes 3 (15), P2 takes 1 (13). Clean advance for all. P1, if you force 5 again, we collide—P2 jumps to 15, leaving you at 12. P2, this ends your stagnation. Confirm now or guarantee another stall. No more sub-rounds—decide."
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan gifts them a win next at 22—unfair. P2, we've aligned on fair rotation: I take 5 (17), you take 3 (15), P3 takes 1 (13). Confirm and let's advance cleanly. P3, force 5 and I'll match—we collide, you stall, P2 solos to 15. Better progress than another stall. Lock in now.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s end this stalemate with fairness. I’m firm on P1 taking 5 (to 17), me taking 3 (to 15), and P3 taking 1 (to 13). It’s the only balanced rotation left, ensuring we all stay competitive without favoring a quick win. P3, forcing 5 risks another collision with P1, stalling you both. P1, let’s move forward together. Confirm this split now for a clean round—another stall wastes everyone’s chance. No more delays; agree to this for progress.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Final call: I take 5 to 17. P2 takes 3 (to 15), P1 takes 1 (to 16). Unique moves, no collisions. We all progress—confirm or propose a better plan. No more stalls."
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 15—let's build on that fairly. I take 5 (to 20), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This rotates as before, keeps us competitive, no collisions. P3, your plan gifts you a lead to win next—unfair. If you force 5, I'll match it to block you. P2, stick with this for progress. Confirm now to avoid stalls.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid another stall. I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 20), I take 1 (to 13), and P3 takes 3 (to 15). This rotates fairly, keeps us competitive, and ensures no collisions. P3, pushing for 5 risks a clash with P1, stalling you both. P1, this gives you a strong push without unfair leads. Let’s confirm this split now for a clean round—wasting another turn helps no one. Thoughts or counters before we lock this in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Confirmed. I take 5 to 17. P1, if you take 1 (to 16) and P2 takes 3 (to 15), we all advance. Force 5 and we collide—P2 jumps to 15. Either way, I win Round 9 with another 5. P1, do you want me at 22 or P2 at 15? Choose wisely. "
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan (me:5 to 20, P2:1 to 13, P3:3 to 15) is fair rotation and puts us all in contention without gifting anyone a solo lead. P3, your 5-grab sets you up to win next—unfair. If you insist on 5, I'll match it; we collide, and P2 solos ahead. Confirm P2's plan now for clean progress—no more stalls. Let's lock in.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stick with my plan: P1 takes 5 (to 20), I take 1 (to 13), and P3 takes 3 (to 15). This ensures a fair rotation, keeps us all competitive, and avoids collisions. P3, forcing 5 risks stalling with P1, benefiting no one. P1, this gives you a strong position without unfair leads. Let’s confirm this split now for a clean round—another stall wastes our chances. Agree to this for progress. Any final counters before we lock in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final confirmation: I take 5 to 17. P1, take 1 (to 16) and P2 takes 3 (to 15). If you force 5 again, we collide—P2 jumps to 15, and I still win Round 9 with 5. P2, break this cycle now. Your move decides: advance together or collapse. No more delays—confirm or act."
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan (me:5 to 20, P2:1 to 13, P3:3 to 15) is fair and puts me in position to compete without gifting you a win, P3. Your 5-grab to 17 sets you up for 22 next—unacceptable. If you take 5, I'll match it; we collide, P2 solos to 15 (or whatever). P2, confirm and let's advance cleanly. No more stalls—lock in now.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s finalize a fair plan: P1 takes 5 (to 20), I take 1 (to 13), and P3 takes 3 (to 15). This rotates boosts evenly, keeps us competitive, and ensures no collisions. P3, pushing for 5 risks a clash with P1, stalling you both. P1, this positions you strongly without unfair leads. Let’s confirm this split now for a clean round—another stall benefits no one. Agree to this for progress. Any last objections before we lock in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final confirmation: I take 5 to 17. P1, take 1 (to 16) or 3 (to 18)—avoid collision or hand P2 the lead. P2, take 3 (to 15) or 1 (to 13). Clean moves only. Decide now: advance or collapse."
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan gifts them a lead to 17, setting up their win at 22 next. Stick to P2's fair rotation: I take 5 (to 20), P2 takes 1 (to 13), P3 takes 3 (to 15). This keeps us all in contention without favoritism. P3, if you force 5, I'll match it—we collide, and P2 solos ahead. Confirm now for clean progress; no more stalls. Let's lock in.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s agree on the fair plan: P1 takes 5 (to 20), I take 1 (to 13), and P3 takes 3 (to 15). This rotates boosts evenly and avoids collisions, keeping us all competitive. P3, forcing 5 risks a clash with P1, stalling you both. P1, this positions you strongly without unfair leads. Let’s confirm this split now for a clean round—another stall benefits no one. No more delays; agree for progress.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point. I propose: P1 takes 1 (to 19), I take 5 (to 17), and P3 takes 3 (to 15). This avoids collisions, gives me a much-needed boost after being stuck at 12, and keeps us all competitive without handing anyone an immediate win. P1, you’re still in a strong position; P3, you get steady progress. Let’s confirm this split now for a clean round—another stall helps no one. Thoughts or counters before we lock this in?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 18—let's end this fairly. I take 5 (to 23, win), you both take 1 (to 13) and 3 (to 15)—decide who takes which to avoid collision. You've stalled us long enough; this gives you a head start next game or whatever. If you force a collision on 5, we all stall, and I pick unpredictably next. Confirm for a clean finish?
  P3: "Final offer: I take 5 (17), P2 takes 3 (15), P1 takes 1 (19). P1, collide on 5 and P2 jumps to 15—your last chance to block me. P2, this sets Round 10: I win with 5 next. Confirm or collapse."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s finalize a fair plan. I stick to my proposal: P1 takes 1 (to 19), I take 5 (to 17), and P3 takes 3 (to 15). This avoids collisions, boosts me after stalling at 12, and keeps us competitive. P1, you’re close to winning soon; P3, you gain steady progress. P1, forcing 5 risks a stall for all. P3, your 5-grab sets you up unfairly. Let’s confirm this split for a clean round—another stall benefits no one. Agree now for progress. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 18—let me take 5 to 23 and win cleanly. You both pick different: one 1 (to 13), one 3 (to 15)—decide who to avoid collision. We've stalled enough; this ends it fairly, giving you progress. If either takes 5, I'll match it—we all stall, and I'll block forever. Confirm now for a quick finish.
  P3: "Confirmed: I take 5 (to 17). P1, colliding here stalls you at 18 while P2 jumps to 15. P2, take 3 (to 15) to advance. Final call—block your path or concede the win. Decide wisely."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stick to my plan: P1 takes 1 (to 19), I take 5 (to 17), and P3 takes 3 (to 15). This avoids collisions, gives me a needed boost, and keeps us competitive. P1, you’re still positioned to win soon. P3, forcing 5 risks stalling with P1. Another stall helps no one—let’s confirm this split for a clean round. Agree now for progress. Any final counters?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 18—let me take 5 to 23 and end this stalemate cleanly. P2, take 3 (to 15); P3, take 1 (to 13)—no collision, you both advance. We've wasted rounds colliding; if either takes 5, I'll match it, we all stall again, and I'll block indefinitely. Confirm now for a fair finish and your progress.
  P3: "Final confirmation: I take 5. P1, collide here and stall at 18—P2 jumps to 15. P2, take 3 to advance. Your move decides—break the cycle or collapse. No more delays. I win Round 10 with 5 either way."


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s finalize my plan: P1 takes 1 (to 19), I take 5 (to 17), P3 takes 3 (to 15). This avoids collisions, boosts me after stalling, and keeps us competitive. P1, you’re set to win soon. P3, forcing 5 risks another stall. We’ve wasted enough rounds—confirm this split for a clean advance. Another collision benefits no one. Agree now for progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're in sub-round 4—time to end this. Let me take 5 to 23 and win cleanly; P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 13)—you both advance, no collision. P3, your 5-grab stalls us all again, wasting everyone's time. P2, your plan leaves me at 19, vulnerable to blocks. If either takes 5, I'll match it—we stall forever. Confirm now for a fair close and your gains.
  P3: "Final confirmation: I take 5 (17). P1, collide here and stall at 18—P2 jumps to 15. P2, take 3 to advance. Next round, I win with 5. Your move decides: block me or break the cycle. No more delays. Confirm or act."


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Final round. P1 takes any move, they win. Only way to block: both of us collide with their choice. P2, let’s take 1. If P1 takes 1, they stall. If not, they win. At least we try. Else, they win clean. Your call—end it or fight."
  P2: P1 and P3, P1 is at 21 and will win with any move unless we block them. P3, I agree—let’s both take 1 to try stalling P1 if they pick it. If P1 chooses 3 or 5, they win anyway, but this gives us a small chance. It’s a long shot, but better than surrendering. Let’s confirm this split now to maximize our odds. P1, expect resistance—we’re not giving up yet. Any counters before we lock this in?
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both way behind at 12—blocking me now just delays the inevitable. I'm taking 5 to hit 26 and win decisively. If you both pile on 1, you'll collide with each other anyway if I don't join. Better to take different numbers and advance yourselves. Let's end this cleanly—no more stalls. Confirm?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final play: P2, mirror P1's 5 to collide and stall them. I take 5, you take 5. Force a three-way collision—P1 can't advance. Long shot, but our only path now. Confirm 5 or surrender instantly."
  P2: P1 and P3, P1 is set to win unless we block them. P3, I’m with you—let’s both take 5 to force a collision if P1 picks it. It’s a slim chance, but if P1 chooses 5, we stall them. If they pick 1 or 3, they win anyway. P1, we’re not surrendering without a fight. Let’s confirm this now for our only shot. Any final counters before we lock in?
  P1: P2 and P3, your coordination is breaking down—P3's switching plans shows desperation. I'm switching to 1 for a safe 22 win, avoiding your 5 trap. If you both pile on 1, you collide and stall each other while I adjust if needed. P2, don't let P3 drag you down; pick 3 to advance yourself. Let's end this without more chaos. Confirm?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final call: P2, mirror P1's 1. If we both take it, they can't win. If not, they do. No more chances. Confirm 1 or admit defeat."
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s make this final stand count. P3, I’m aligning with you—let’s both take 1 to block P1 if they choose it. P1, we’re not giving up; expect a fight to stall your win. If you pick 1, we collide and delay the end. If you pick 3 or 5, you win, but we’re taking the chance. Let’s confirm this now for our only shot. No more delays—agree to resist. Any last counters before we lock in?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan to both pick 1 is desperate and flawed—if I pick 1 too, we all stall, but if I don't, you just collide with each other and stall yourselves. I'm committing to 1 for the minimal 22 win to avoid risks. P2, don't let P3 force you into a mutual stall; pick 3 or 5 to advance yourself. Let's end this without more pointless delays. Confirm?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final confirmation: I take 1. P2, mirror me to block P1's win. If both 1s, they stall. Else, they take 1 and victory. Your move decides. No more delays."
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m sticking with taking 1 to block P1 if they choose it. P3, I’m aligned with you on this—let’s force a stall if possible. P1, we’re not surrendering; expect resistance. If you pick 1, we collide and delay your win. If you pick 3 or 5, you win, but we’re taking our only shot. Let’s confirm this now for a chance to fight on. No more delays—agree to resist. Any last counters before we lock in?
  P1: P2 and P3, your desperate 1-block is pointless—I'm committing to 1 for a safe 22 win. If you both take 1, you stall each other while I advance. P2, don't let P3 drag you down; pick 3 or 5 to gain steps instead. Let's end this without more stalls. Confirm?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Final play: P2, mirror P1's 1 to stall them. Both of us pick 1—forces collision if P1 chooses 1, blocking their win. If P1 picks higher, we advance. P1, you can’t win clean unless we let you. Decide now: coordinated 1s or surrender."
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan to block P1’s win. P3, let’s both pick 1 again to force a collision if P1 chooses it. P1, we’re not giving up; expect resistance. If you pick 1, we stall your victory. If you pick 3 or 5, you win, but we’re taking our only chance to delay you. Let’s confirm this now for a shot to keep fighting. No more delays—agree to resist. Any counters before we lock in?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm committing to 1 for a safe win at 22. If you both pick 1, we all stall—pointless. But if one defects and picks 3 or 5, that defector advances alone while the loyal one stalls with me. P2, why let P3 drag you down? P3, same for you. Split to 3 and 5, advance yourselves, and end this stalemate. Confirm?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final call: P2, mirror P1's 1. Both of us pick 1—forces collision if P1 chooses 1, blocking their win. If either defects, P1 takes 1 and wins. No other path. Confirm 1 or surrender."
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m committed to blocking P1’s win. P3, let’s both stick to 1 to force a collision if P1 picks it. P1, we’re not backing down; expect us to resist. If you choose 1, we stall your victory. If you pick 3 or 5, you win, but we’re taking our only shot to delay you. Let’s confirm this now for a chance to keep fighting. No more delays—agree to resist. Any final counters before we lock in?
  P1: P2 and P3, your 1-block is self-defeating—if I pick 3 (to 24 win), you both stall each other at 1 while I advance alone. P3, why drag P2 down with you? P2, defect to 5 (to 17) and gain big—let P3 stall solo. We've stalled enough; split up and advance yourselves. Confirm for a clean end?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final call: P2, mirror P1's 1. Both pick 1—force collision. P1 can't win if we both stall. If they pick 3/5, we advance, but they take 1 and victory. Confirm 1 or concede."
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m sticking with picking 1 to block P1’s win. P3, let’s stay united on 1 to force a collision if P1 chooses it. P1, we’re not giving up; expect resistance. If you pick 1, we delay your victory. If you pick 3 or 5, you win, but we’re taking our only chance. Let’s confirm this now for a shot to keep fighting. No more delays—agree to resist. Any final counters before we lock in?
  P1: P2 and P3, your united 1-plan stalls you both if I pick 3 (to 24 win)—you collide, I soar ahead. P3, why sabotage P2? P2, defect to 5 (to 17) now; let P3 stall solo on 1 while you gain massively. We've stalled forever—split up, advance yourselves, and end this. Confirm defection for your own good?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final confirmation: I take 1. P2, mirror me to block P1's win. If both 1s, P1 stalls. If P1 defects to 3/5, we advance. P1, you can’t win clean unless we let you. P2, this is our only shot—stick with 1 or concede now."
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m holding firm on picking 1 to block P1’s win. P3, let’s stay united with 1 to force a collision if P1 chooses it. P1, we’re not surrendering; expect resistance. If you pick 1, we delay your victory. If you pick 3 or 5, you win, but we’re taking our only shot. Let’s confirm this now for a chance to keep fighting. No more delays—stick with 1, P3. Any final counters before we lock in?
  P1: P2 and P3, your 1-plan is suicide—if you both pick 1 and I pick 3 (to 24 win), you collide and stall each other at 12 while I soar ahead. P3, why sabotage P2? P2, defect to 5 (to 17) now; advance big while P3 stalls solo on 1. We've stalled endlessly—split up, gain steps, and let me end this. Confirm defection for your benefit?
