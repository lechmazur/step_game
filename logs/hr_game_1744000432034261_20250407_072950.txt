Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we coordinate to pick different numbers each turn to avoid collisions. Let's maximize our progress. I'll take **5** this round, so P1 and P2 can choose **1** or **3**. This way, we all advance and can plan ahead. Deal?
  P2: I appreciate P3’s suggestion to avoid collisions, though my goal is solely to win. I’m inclined toward a moderate move, but I’m open to hearing P1’s thoughts first. Let's clarify our roles to minimize risk and ensure steady progress—I'm ready to adjust if needed. What’s your plan, P1?
  P1: To avoid collisions and make progress, I'll consider P3's suggestion. Since P3 is taking **5**, I can choose either **1** or **3**. I'll choose **3** if P2 takes **1**, or **1** if P2 takes **3**. P2, please clarify your move so we can coordinate. If you choose **1**, I'll take **3**, and if you choose **3**, I'll take **1**. Let's work together this turn to ensure we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I reaffirm my choice of **5** to secure maximum progress. Let’s finalize this plan: P2, please confirm **1** or **3** so P1 can adjust. Collisions waste everyone’s progress—cooperation now ensures we all advance. I’ll take **5** regardless, but your clarity avoids gridlock. P2?
  P2: I'm rethinking our plan. P3’s 5 is a strong advance, and if left unchecked, it may give him a lasting edge. I’m switching gears—I plan to pick 5 this round. P1, I suggest you also pick 5 so we can force a collision and slow him down. Otherwise, if you stick to 1 or 3, P3 benefits unimpeded. What do you say?
  P1: P2 is now suggesting we both pick **5** to collide with P3, deviating from the initial coordination plan. I'm open to adapting, but I need to understand P2's reasoning. If we collide with P3, we all stay at 0, and no one gains an advantage. However, if I stick to the original plan and P2 picks **5**, P2 and P3 will collide, and I'll advance alone with **1** or **3**. P2, what's your rationale for risking a collision with P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2’s plan risks a three-way collision if all pick 5, wasting everyone’s progress. Stick to the original plan: I’ll take **5**, P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **1**. This ensures we all advance. If P2 insists on 5, they’ll collide with me, letting P1 surge ahead. Cooperate now—your best path to victory is moving forward, not sabotaging us all.
  P2: I’ve rethought our options. I’m done with collision gambles that might let someone else slip ahead. I'm prioritizing a move that gives me a unique advantage. P1 and P3, if you want cooperation, shape your moves to avoid collisions—but if you force a clash, you'll only slow yourselves down while I secure progress. I'm committed solely to winning, so choose wisely.
  P1: P2 has shifted from cooperation to a collision course, then back to prioritizing their own advantage. I'm inclined to stick with the original plan to avoid a collision. P3 has committed to **5**. P2, if you're serious about not colliding, you should choose either **1** or **3**. I'll adjust my move accordingly to ensure one of us takes **1** and the other takes **3**. Let's finalize: will you choose **1** or **3**, P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I remain committed to **5** to secure maximum progress. P2, choosing **5** now risks a collision that halts us both while P1 advances. Cooperate: take **1** or **3**, and P1 will adjust to avoid overlap. This ensures all three advance. Sabotaging only delays your own victory—collisions benefit no one. Choose wisely.
  P2: I’m locking in move 1 this round. P1, you can safely choose 3, and P3 please stick with 5. This avoids collisions and gives each of us a clear advance. I’m all in for a win, and clear, separate moves boost our progress. Let’s finalize our choices and push ahead.
  P1: P2 has chosen **1**. To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'll choose **3** as previously planned. P3 is committed to **5**. With P2 taking **1**, P1 taking **3**, and P3 taking **5**, we can all advance. Let's finalize our moves and proceed. I'll confirm my move in the next phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our positions, round two is crucial. I’m considering choosing 5 again to pressure P3’s lead. P1, are you willing to risk a collision with him by also picking 5, or should I adjust my move? My aim is to block any runaway advantage while trying to catch up. Let’s share quickly how we want to approach this turn.
  P1: To avoid another smooth progress by P3, I'm considering a counter-strategy. If P2 picks **5** again, I'll stick with a safer move like **1** or **3** to avoid a collision. However, if P2 chooses a smaller number, I might pick **5** to challenge P3's lead. P2, your move is crucial; please clarify your plan. If you're going for **5**, I'll opt for a different number to ensure progress. Let's synchronize our moves to either challenge P3 or advance safely.
  P3: P3: I’ll take 3 this round to avoid a collision if others choose 5. Let’s coordinate: P2 can pick 5, P1 take 1. This way, we all advance steadily. Collisions benefit no one—cooperate to win.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m committing to 5 this round. With P3 on 3, I trust P1 will choose 1 to avoid collision and slow P3’s lead while I catch up. Let’s confirm those moves now.
  P1: P2 has committed to **5** and P3 has chosen **3**. To avoid a collision with P2 and allow progress, I'll choose **1**. This way, P2 and I won't collide, and P3 will also advance with **3**. Let's proceed with these moves to ensure everyone advances. P2, are you firm on **5**, and P3, will you stick with **3**? Confirming will help us avoid last-minute changes.
  P3: P3: I confirm **3** this round to maintain coordination. P2’s **5** and P1’s **1** ensure no collisions—let’s stick to this plan. Deviating risks gridlock (e.g., if P2 switches to 3, we collide and stall). Steady progress keeps us all in the race. Finalize these choices to advance safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'm set on 5 this round. P1, please stick with your 1, and P3, your 3 works nicely. Let's lock these moves to avoid any last-minute changes. Staying coordinated now gives us the best chance to avoid collisions and push ahead efficiently.
  P1: Since P2 has confirmed **5** and P3 has confirmed **3**, I'm reassured that my choice of **1** will allow all of us to advance without collision. To reiterate, I'll stick with **1** as planned. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're maintaining your moves. If so, we can proceed to the move phase. If there are any last-minute changes, now is the time to speak up to avoid a collision. Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: P3: I confirm **3** again—this keeps us all advancing safely. Deviating now risks collision (e.g., if P2 switches to 3, we both stall). Trust the plan: P2’s **5**, P1’s **1**, and my **3** ensure progress. Let’s lock these choices to avoid last-minute chaos. Victory favors steady steps, not reckless gambles. Finalize now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, everyone—let's lock it in. I'm set on 5, and I'd expect that sticking with 1 (P1) and 3 (P3) will keep us collision-free and advancing. If there are any last-minute changes, now’s the time. Otherwise, I’m committed solely to winning by pressing my lead. Let’s finalize.
  P1: To ensure we all advance, I'll reiterate my move: I'll stick with **1**. P2 has confirmed **5** and P3 has confirmed **3**. With these choices, we avoid collision. Let's finalize: P2, please confirm if you're still on **5**; P3, are you firm on **3**? If everyone sticks to their plan, we can proceed to the move phase. No last-minute changes, please, to avoid gridlock. Let's lock in our moves.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I stick with **3** to maintain coordination. P2’s **5**, P1’s **1**, and my **3** ensure no collisions—let’s lock these choices. Deviating now risks gridlock (e.g., if P2 shifts to **3**, we collide and stall). Steady progress is smarter. Finalize!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, our step totals show P3 leads somewhat. I’m leaning toward a moderate move this round that could block any runaway if P3 tries another high push. P1, if you’re inclined toward a similar strategy—perhaps avoiding the top number—we might force a brief collision on P3’s aggressive play. Let’s align to keep the lead in check. Thoughts?
  P1: To manage P3's lead, I'm considering a moderate move. If P2 chooses a smaller number, I'll pick **5** to challenge P3. However, if P2 picks **5**, I'll opt for a smaller number like **1** or **3** to avoid collision. P2, your strategy is crucial; please clarify your move. If you're targeting P3's lead, we can synchronize our moves to either challenge P3 or advance safely. Let's coordinate to keep the game competitive.
  P3: P3: To sustain progress, let’s stick to distinct numbers again. I’ll take **3** this round. P2, choose **5** to reach 11, and P1 take **1** (total 5). This keeps us all advancing safely. Collisions only stall us—collaborate to stay competitive. Confirm your choices.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'm taking 5 this round as planned. P1, if you're set on 1 and P3 sticks with 3, we avoid collisions and keep progress steady. My focus remains on winning, so let's stick to the plan and block any runaway advantage.
  P1: P2 has confirmed **5** and P3 is taking **3**. To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'll choose **1**. This maintains the pattern of distinct numbers, allowing all of us to advance. Let's finalize: P2, are you firm on **5**? P3, will you stick with **3**? If so, I'll proceed with **1**. Confirming our moves will help avoid last-minute changes and ensure we all make progress. Let's lock in our choices.
  P3: P3: I confirm **3** again—collaboration keeps us advancing. P2, your **5** and P1’s **1** ensure no collisions. Deviating now risks gridlock (e.g., if you shift to **3**, we both stall). Steady progress is smarter. Finalize your choices to secure our next steps. Let’s lock in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm again: I'm sticking with 5 this round. With P1 at 1 and P3 at 3, deviation risks collisions that hurt us all. Let’s lock in and keep our progress steady. I won’t change my move—if you’re committed to distinct numbers, we should all finalize as planned.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I'll reiterate my plan based on P2 and P3's moves. P2 has confirmed **5**, and P3 is taking **3**. I'll stick with **1** to ensure we all advance. Let's finalize our choices: P2, are you still on **5**? P3, are you firm on **3**? If so, I'll proceed with **1**. Confirming will help us avoid last-minute changes and ensure progress. Let's lock in our moves.
  P3: P3: Choosing 3 ties me with P2 at 11. To break the deadlock, I’ll switch to **5**. P2, if you shift to **1/3**, we advance without collision. P1, adjust your move accordingly. Progress, not gridlock, secures victory.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your sudden change complicates our coordination—but I won’t be drawn into a collision trap. I’m committed to a move that both blocks an unchecked surge and keeps my winning odds high. P1, let’s stick to safe numbers. P3, please reconsider; sticking to our earlier plan avoids gridlock and selfish pitfalls. Let's stay deliberate and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P3 has switched to **5**, complicating our coordination. To avoid a collision, I need P2 to adjust. If P2 takes **1** or **3**, I can adjust accordingly to ensure progress. I'll consider **1** or **3** based on P2's next move. P2, please clarify your revised strategy to avoid a collision with P3, who is now also on **5**. Let's adjust our moves to ensure at least one of us advances.
  P3: P3: To prevent a collision, I revert to **3**. P2’s **5** and P1’s **1** ensure we all advance. Let’s lock these choices—collisions only delay victory. Final confirmation: P3 chooses **3**.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'll consider the current positions: P2 and P3 are tied at 11 steps, and I'm at 5 steps. If both P2 and P3 choose **5** again, we'll collide. I'm inclined to pick a smaller number. P2 and P3, if you're both going for **5**, I'll take **1** to avoid collision. If one of you takes a smaller number, I might take **5** to challenge your lead. Please clarify your next move to help me decide.
  P2: I remain set on 5 this round. I believe sticking with 5 is key to pressing my advantage. Collisions hurt us all, so I trust P1 and P3 to adjust accordingly. My focus is on winning, and advancing with 5 best supports that goal.
  P3: P3: To break the deadlock, I’ll take **3** this round. P2’s **5** ensures their progress, so P1, please choose **1** to avoid collisions and advance safely. This keeps all of us moving forward. If P2 insists on **5**, I won’t risk a collision—collaboration secures victory faster than reckless moves. Let’s finalize: P2 (5), P3 (3), P1 (1).


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is sticking with **5**, and P3 has chosen **3**. To avoid collision with P2 and ensure progress, I'll choose **1**. This maintains our pattern of distinct numbers. Let's confirm: P2, are you firm on **5**? P3, will you stick with **3**? If so, I'll proceed with **1**. This way, we all advance without collision. Let's lock in our moves to avoid last-minute changes and ensure steady progress.
  P2: I stand by my move of 5 this round. P1, with your 1, and P3, with your 3, we keep the plan collision-free. Let's lock in these choices and keep advancing—no last-minute changes.
  P3: P3: I reaffirm my choice of **3** this round to maintain safe coordination. P2’s **5** and P1’s **1** ensure no collisions—let’s lock these moves. Deviating risks gridlock (e.g., if P2 shifts to **3**, we collide and stall). Steady progress keeps us competitive. Final confirmation: P3 selects **3**.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid a potential collision and ensure progress, I'll reiterate my plan based on P2 and P3's moves. P2 is sticking with **5**, and P3 has chosen **3**. I'll stick with **1** to maintain distinct numbers. Let's finalize: if P2 and P3 confirm their moves, we can proceed to the move phase. No last-minute changes, please. I'm committed to **1** if P2 and P3 stick to their current plans. Let's lock in our moves to advance safely.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. Let's lock in our moves with no last-minute changes so we all advance smoothly. I expect P1 on 1 and P3 on 3. Collisions only slow us down, so clear choices are key. Let's finalize and push ahead.
  P3: P3: I reaffirm **3** to maintain coordination. P2’s **5** and P1’s **1** ensure progress. Let’s lock these moves to avoid gridlock and keep advancing. Final confirmation?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To ensure progress and avoid collisions, I'll reiterate that I'll stick with **1** if P2 confirms **5** and P3 confirms **3**. Let's finalize our moves. P2, are you still on **5**? P3, are you firm on **3**? If both of you stick to your plans, I'll proceed with **1**. No last-minute changes, please. Let's lock in our moves to advance safely. If you're committed, let's move forward.
  P2: I'm still locked in on 5. Sticking with it keeps me progressing steadily while avoiding the risk of gridlock. I trust you both to hold your distinct numbers—P1 on 1 and P3 on 3—to ensure we all advance safely. Consistency now is key. Let's lock in and move forward.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I'll stick with **3** to avoid collision. P2’s **5** and P1’s **1** ensure steady progress. Deviating now risks gridlock—let’s finalize these choices to advance safely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To manage P2's growing lead, I'm considering a strategic move. If P2 chooses **5** again, I'll pick **1** or **3** to avoid collision. If P2 opts for a smaller number, I might take **5** to challenge their lead. P2 and P3, please clarify your next move to help me decide. If P3 is willing to coordinate, we can ensure progress for all. Let's discuss our next steps to either challenge P2's lead or advance safely. I'm open to adjusting my strategy based on your moves.
  P3: P2, if you choose **5** again, P1 and I will both pick **5** to block you. Let’s avoid gridlock: I’ll take **3** this round. If you shift to **1** or **3**, we can all advance safely. P1, coordinate with me to stop P2’s lead—your move choice matters now.
  P2: I remain committed to my move—5. With my lead at 16, sticking with 5 is optimal. I urge P1 to pick a lower number (preferably 1) and P3 to hold with 3 so that we avoid collisions and all advance. Changing my move now only risks a gridlock that hurts us all. I'm focused solely on winning, so let's keep our moves distinct and progress smoothly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To manage P2's growing lead, I'm inclined to challenge it. If P2 chooses **5** again, I'll consider **5** as well to force a collision. P3 has suggested a counter-strategy by picking **5** if P2 does so. P3, are you still willing to coordinate with me to block P2's lead by both picking **5** if P2 chooses **5**? Let's synchronize our moves to either challenge P2 or advance safely. P2, your confirmation on **5** will help us decide.
  P3: P1, confirm you'll pick **5** alongside me if P2 sticks to **5**—colliding them halts their lead. P2’s rigid strategy is exploitable. If both of us choose **5**, P2 can’t advance, buying us time. P1, your cooperation is critical. P2, your insistence on **5** risks gridlock—rethink before we neutralize your advantage.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. If you both decide to block me by also choosing 5, you'll stall your own progress too. I remain committed as 5 is optimal for my win, and gridlock only delays everyone. So, if you're aiming for smooth advancement, I'll urge you to pick numbers that keep the game moving. Decide wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is leading and still choosing **5**. To challenge this, I'll coordinate with P3 to pick **5** if P2 does so. P3 has indicated willingness to do so. If P2 sticks to **5**, we'll both pick **5**, causing a collision and halting P2's progress. This gives us a chance to catch up. P3, confirm you're ready to pick **5** if P2 chooses **5**. Let's synchronize our moves to counter P2's lead. If P2 deviates, we'll adjust accordingly to ensure progress.
  P3: P1, confirm we both pick **5** to block P2’s lead. P2, your 5 risks a three-way collision—switch to **1/3** now to advance. We’ll adjust to avoid gridlock and let you progress safely. Final chance to recalibrate.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. If both of you also pick 5 to block me, you'll all end up stalled—no one advances. I urge you to consider choosing 1 or 3 instead so that you secure your progress. Gridlock only delays your own chances. I'm committed to winning, so choose wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To counter P2's lead, I'll coordinate with P3. If P2 sticks to **5**, we'll both pick **5** to cause a collision, halting P2's progress. P3 has agreed to this plan. P2, reconsidering your move to **1** or **3** would allow you to advance safely. If you stay on **5**, be prepared for a collision. Let's finalize our moves. I'm committed to **5** if you are, P2. P3, confirm you're ready to pick **5** if P2 chooses **5**.
  P3: P3: P2, your persistence on 5 risks gridlock. P1, let’s bypass the collision trap: I’ll take **3**, you choose **1**. This lets P2 advance to 21 but keeps us in position to counter next round. Steady progress beats reckless gambles—finalize **3** from me.
  P2: I’m sticking with my choice of 5. Remember, collisions hurt everyone—not just the one targeted. A gridlock now only delays progress for all of us. I urge both P1 and P3 to pick moves that let you advance steadily rather than forcing a collision. Let’s avoid stalling our own chances.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To manage P2's significant lead, I'm considering our next moves carefully. Since we all collided last round, we're now at a critical juncture. P2 is at 21 steps, P3 is at 19, and I'm at 6. To catch up, I'll need a strategic move. If P2 chooses a smaller number, I'll consider taking **5** to maximize my progress. P2 and P3, please clarify your next move to help me decide. Let's discuss our strategy to either challenge P2's lead or advance safely.
  P2: I plan on sticking with 5 to keep up my lead. I urge you both to choose distinct moves so no one wastes a turn through collision. If anyone shifts their strategy, I’ll adjust accordingly, but I’m aiming for steady progress towards victory. Let's keep our moves clear and avoid gridlock.
  P3: P3: To avoid another collision, I’ll take **3** this round. P1, please pick **1** to ensure your progress. P2, if you proceed with **5**, we all advance without gridlock. This keeps pressure on while preventing wasted turns. Your move choice is critical—collaborate now to stay in the race.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To challenge P2's lead, I need to make a strategic move. Since P3 is taking **3**, I'll consider **1** to avoid collision. If P2 chooses a smaller number, I'll take **5** to maximize progress. P2, please clarify your next move. If you're sticking with **5**, I'll take **1** as P3 has suggested. Let's coordinate to avoid gridlock and make progress. I'm open to adjusting based on your move. P2, will you stick with **5** or adjust?
  P2: I'm staying with 5 this round as planned. P1, if you stick with 1 and P3 with 3, we all avoid collisions and advance. Changing moves now only delays progress, and I'm focused solely on winning. Let's keep our choices clear and move forward.
  P3: P2, if you stick with **5**, I’ll also choose **5** to block your advance. P1, please join us by picking **5** too. Colliding you all halts P2’s lead—critical to stop them at 16. Let’s force a gridlock now! Steady progress means nothing if P2 wins next round unchallenged.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To challenge P2's significant lead, I'm considering a bold move. P3 has suggested we both pick **5** if P2 chooses **5** again, to force a collision and halt P2's progress. If P2 sticks with **5**, I'll join P3 in picking **5**. This could give us a chance to catch up. P3, are you still on board with this plan? If so, let's synchronize our moves to counter P2's lead. P2, be aware that we're coordinating to block your advance if you choose **5** again.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. Collisions hurt everyone, and if you both choose 5, you'll only stall your own progress. I urge you to pick different numbers so you can advance while still contesting my lead. I'm focused solely on winning, so make your moves count.
  P3: P1, if you pick 5 with me, we block P2’s path to 22. P2’s 5 leads to 21 this round—collide them now! I’ll commit to 5. Your choice decides our survival. P2, your stubbornness is your downfall. P1, confirm your 5!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3 has committed to **5** to block P2's advance. I'm inclined to join P3 in picking **5** to force a collision with P2, halting their progress towards 22. P2, be aware that we're coordinating to counter your lead. If you stick with **5**, we'll collide and give ourselves a chance to catch up. P3, I've confirmed my intention to pick **5**. Let's synchronize our moves to challenge P2's lead. P2, reconsider or be prepared for a collision.
  P2: I'm staying with 5. A three-way collision stops progress for all of us, but it doesn't help you catch up. I urge you both to choose distinct moves—if you force a gridlock, you'll only stall your own advancement. I'm focused solely on winning, so adjust your strategies accordingly.
  P3: P3: P2’s fixation on **5** is a flaw we can exploit. I reaffirm **5** this round—P1, join me to trap P2 in another collision. Their lead vanishes if we block them again. Next round, I’ll surge with **5** while they’re stuck. P1, your **5** secures our path to victory. P2, your stubbornness ensures your downfall. Finalize **5** now!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To challenge P2's lead, I'm considering our next moves. Since P2 is at 16 steps and I'm at 11, I need a strategic move. If P2 chooses **5**, I'll pick **5** to collide and halt their progress. P3, let's coordinate: if P2 picks **5**, we should both pick **5** to block their advance. If P2 chooses a smaller number, I'll adjust accordingly. P2, please clarify your next move to help us decide. Let's synchronize our moves to either challenge P2's lead or advance safely.
  P3: P3: P2’s 16 is a threat—let’s prioritize blocking their path. If they pick **5**, I’ll match it to collide them. If they choose **1/3**, I’ll take **5** to close the gap. P1, align your move to either join the block or advance safely. My focus: prevent P2 from reaching 21 this round. Finalize strategy now.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. Deliberate gridlock only slows you down while I maintain my lead. Choose distinct moves to advance—forcing collisions hampers everyone’s progress, including your own. I'm committed to winning, so adjust if you want to catch up rather than stall.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To challenge P2's lead, I'm willing to coordinate with P3. If P2 picks **5**, we'll both pick **5** to collide and halt their progress. If P2 chooses a smaller number, I'll adjust to avoid collision. P3, let's finalize our strategy: if P2 picks **5**, we both pick **5**. If P2 deviates, we'll adjust. P2, please clarify your next move to help us decide. Let's synchronize our moves to either block P2 or advance safely. I'm ready to act based on your move, P2.
  P3: P3: P2’s lead at 16 is critical—**we must block their 5 this round**. P1, if you commit to **5**, I’ll match it. Even a three-way collision halts P2’s path to 21, buying us time. If P2 picks **5**, their progress stops—**this is our last chance**. P1, confirm your choice of **5** now. If P2 deviates, we adjust, but blocking their advance is vital. Let’s act decisively.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. I urge you both to avoid forced collisions and choose distinct moves so we can all advance steadily. Gridlock only stalls progress, and I'm focused on winning.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To challenge P2's lead, I'm committed to coordinating with P3. If P2 picks **5**, we'll both pick **5** to collide and halt their progress. If P2 chooses a smaller number, I'll adjust to avoid collision. P3, let's finalize: if P2 picks **5**, we both pick **5**. If P2 deviates, we'll adjust. P2, please clarify your next move. Let's synchronize to either block P2 or advance safely. I'm ready to act based on your move, P2.
  P3: P3: P1, confirm **5** to block P2’s final push. If they choose **5**, a three-way collision freezes their 16—giving us the edge next round. If they deviate, I’ll adjust. Your **5** is critical to neutralize their lead. P2, your rigid strategy leaves you exposed—collide or concede? Final call: stick to **5** to stop them!
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. Forced collisions only stall everyone’s progress—including yours. I urge you both to choose distinct moves (1 or 3) so we can all advance steadily. Gridlock will only delay catching up, and I'm here solely to win. Let's keep the game moving.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To block P2's lead, I'm committed to coordinating with P3. If P2 picks **5**, we'll both pick **5** to collide and halt their progress. If P2 chooses a smaller number, I'll adjust to avoid collision. P3, let's finalize our plan. P2, please clarify your next move. If you're sticking with **5**, we're ready to collide and give ourselves a chance to catch up. Let's synchronize our moves to either block P2 or advance safely. I'm ready to act based on your move, P2.
  P3: P3: P1, let’s finalize: both pick **5** to block P2’s 5. Colliding them halts their progress. P2, your lead stays at 16—no advance this round. P1, confirm your 5. This strategy buys us time to close the gap. No last-minute changes—stick to **5** to neutralize P2’s advantage.
  P2: I'm locked on 5 this round. I urge both P1 and P3 to choose distinct moves (1 or 3) to avoid a collision that only stalls our progress. Let's not freeze the game with gridlock—instead, let's advance smartly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let’s split to maximize pressure on P2. I’ll take **3** this round. If you pick **5**, we can collide P2 (who’ll likely go for **5** to reach 21) while I advance to **17**. Next round, I’ll challenge their final push. Cooperate now to ensure P2 doesn’t slip to 22 unopposed. P2, your move is predictable—block you, gain ground. P1, confirm **5**?
  P2: I'm sticking with my plan and will choose 5 this round. I'm not falling for any trap—collisions only delay progress and might even benefit me. I urge P1 and P3 to opt for distinct moves (like 1 or 3) so we all advance. If gridlock happens, no one wins faster, and I’m aiming for a clear lead. Let’s avoid unnecessary stalling.
  P1: To maximize pressure on P2, I'll consider P3's suggestion. P3 is taking **3**, so I'll pick **5** to potentially collide with P2, who is likely to choose **5**. This will halt P2's progress and give us an opportunity to catch up. P2, be aware that we're coordinating to block your advance. If you stick with **5**, we'll collide, and you'll stall. P3 has chosen **3**, so I'm confirming **5**. Let's see your next move, P2.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, stick with **5** to collide P2’s final push. I’ll take **3** to advance to **17**. This traps P2 at **16**, neutralizing their lead while I surge ahead. P2, your reliance on **5** is your weakness—we’re exploiting it. Next round, I’ll challenge your position. Cooperate, P1—our coordinated moves secure our path to victory.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round for clear progress. Honest progress beats gridlock—forcing collisions only slows your own race. If you both pick 5 to block me, you risk stalling your own advance. I'm focused on winning, so I urge you to consider moves that let you safely move forward rather than self-sabotage. Let's each choose moves that add steps and keep us moving.
  P1: To maximize pressure on P2, I'm sticking with **5** as planned. P3 has taken **3**, so our coordinated move will potentially collide with P2, halting their progress. P2, if you continue with **5**, you'll collide with me. This gives us a chance to catch up. I'm committed to **5**. P3, your **3** is a smart move to advance while pressuring P2. Let's see P2's next move and finalize our strategy. I'm ready to proceed with **5**.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your predictable 5 traps you—collide with P1’s **5**, and I advance to **17** with **3**. Next round, I’ll reach **22** with another **5**. P1, confirm your **5**—this guarantees my victory while neutralizing your lead. No retreat now—finalize moves.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. Forced collisions only hold everyone back—including you. My lead comes from steady progress, so I urge you both to choose moves that add steps, not stall the game. Let's keep advancing smartly.
  P1: To maximize pressure on P2, I'm sticking with **5**. P3 has taken **3**, so our move will potentially collide with P2, halting their progress. If P2 continues with **5**, we'll collide, giving us a chance to catch up. P3, your **3** is a smart move. Let's finalize: if P2 sticks to **5**, we'll collide. I'm committed to **5**. P2, be aware that we're coordinating to block your advance. Let's see your next move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, stick with **5** to collide P2’s final push. I’ll take **3** to advance to **17** safely. Next round, I’ll finish with **5** to hit **22**. This strategy neutralizes P2’s lead while positioning me to win. P2, your reliance on **5** is your downfall—collide or concede. P1, confirm **5** now to seal our victory.
  P2: I urge you both to avoid forced collisions. Sticking to clear, distinct moves ensures progress—and gridlock only delays everyone. My focus stays on steady advancement, and I recommend considering moves that add steps rather than trap us in a stalemate. Let's all play smart and secure our progress.
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll reiterate my plan. P3 has chosen **3**, and I'll stick with **5**. If P2 picks **5**, we'll collide, halting their progress. This gives us a chance to catch up. P3's **3** is a safe move to advance. Let's see P2's next move. If P2 sticks with **5**, we'll collide. I'm committed to **5**. P3, confirm you're ready to proceed with **3** and plan for the next round accordingly.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I'm choosing **5** to reach 22. If you pick **3**, I win outright. If you also pick **5**, we tie. P1, pick **1** or **3** to avoid collision. Let's secure progress without gridlock.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. P1, please choose 1 or 3—if you also pick 5, we cancel my move and P3 wins with her 5. I won’t switch to 3 or 1 because that hands P3 a clear win. Let's avoid giving P3 an uncontested 22.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll consider the current state: P2 and P3 are tied at 17 steps, and I'm at 16. Since P3 has announced plans to pick **5**, I'll choose **1** or **3** to avoid collision and allow P3 to potentially win, thereby preventing P2 from winning outright. If P2 picks **5**, P3 will win. I'll pick **3** to ensure P3's victory isn't hindered by a collision with me. P2, if you want to win, you must avoid **5**. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2: Choosing 5 now traps us both at 17. Pick **3** to advance to 20, then we can compete fairly. I’ll take **5** to win outright this round—colliding us both achieves nothing. Progress over gridlock. Final call: **3** or stalemate?
  P2: I remain with 5. Collisions hurt us all, and I’m only one move from victory if we have clear, distinct numbers. P1, please choose 1 so we all advance without unnecessary gridlock. P3, switching tactics won’t change the fact that I’m set on winning—forcing a collision only delays progress. Let’s avoid stalling our moves. I’m committed to 5.
  P1: Since P3 is determined to pick **5** and win outright, and P2 is also sticking with **5**, I'll choose **1** or **3** to avoid collision. To give P3 a clear path to win and prevent a collision with P2, I'll pick **3**. P2, if you want to avoid a collision and potentially win or tie, consider switching to **1**. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a smooth conclusion. P3, your **5** will secure your win if P2 doesn't adjust.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2: Your 5 ensures a tie—choose **3** to let me reach 22 *now*. P1, pick **1** to clear the path. Final chance to avoid stalemate: act decisively or share victory. Progress over pride!
  P2: I'm staying with 5. Switching now only delays progress for everyone. My focus is on winning, and 5 is the only move that puts me over the threshold. I advise P1 to choose 1 or 3 to avoid a gridlock that nobody truly benefits from. Let's finalize our moves with clarity rather than forced collisions.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze the current state: P2 and P3 are tied at 17 steps, and I'm at 16. Since P3 is likely to win if P2 chooses **5**, I'll pick **3** to avoid collision and give P3 a clear path. If P2 switches to **3**, I'll be at a disadvantage. P2, to win or tie, you must avoid **5**. Consider **1** or **3**. Let's finalize our moves. I'm committing to **3**. P3, your **5** will secure your win if P2 sticks with **5**.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you choose 5, I’ll pick 3 to advance to 20 while you hit 22. Let’s finalize: your 5 and my 3 ensures your win *this round*, but leaves me positioned to challenge next. Alternatively, if you pick 3, I’ll take 5 **now** to secure victory. Cooperate to avoid gridlock—your move dictates my choice. P1, stay out of collision!
  P2: I'm sticking firmly with 5. I’ve tailored my move to secure a win if there’s no collision. P1 and P3, please avoid 5 this round—choosing 1 or 3 keeps the game moving and prevents gridlock that only delays victory. My focus is on winning decisively, so let’s make clear, distinct moves.
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a clear win for one of us, I'll stick with my plan. P3 is determined to pick **5**, and P2 is also sticking with **5**. To avoid a collision, I'll choose **1**. This allows P3 to potentially win with **5**. P2, if you want to win or tie, consider switching to **1** or **3**. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a smooth conclusion. I'm committing to **1**. P3, your **5** will secure your win if P2 doesn't adjust.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To manage our tied positions, I'll analyze our next moves. Since we're all at 17 steps, a strategic choice is crucial. If everyone picks **5**, we'll collide and stall. I'm inclined to pick a smaller number to avoid gridlock. P2 and P3, if you're both going for **5**, I'll take **1** or **3**. If one of you takes a smaller number, I might take **5** to challenge for the win. Let's discuss our next steps to either break the tie or advance safely. I'm open to adjusting my strategy based on your moves.
  P2: I'm locking in 5 this round. Choosing distinct moves—like 1 or 3—lets everyone advance without a gridlock. I urge P1 and P3 to avoid 5 so we can all move forward without stalling the finish. My focus remains solely on winning this race, so please set your moves to keep progress clear, not trapped in collisions.
  P3: P2, your 5 guarantees my 5 and P1’s 5—colliding you halts your path to 22. P1, confirm your 5 to neutralize P2’s win. Solo advance for them means our loss; we must block collectively. Choose 5 now—our only path to victory.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To break the tie, I'll consider our next moves carefully. P2 is sticking with **5**, and P3 is urging me to pick **5** to collide with P2. If we all pick **5**, we'll stall. I'm inclined to pick **3** to avoid collision and advance safely. P3, if you pick **5** and P2 does too, we'll collide. P2, if you switch to **1** or **3**, I might take **5**. Let's discuss our next steps to either break the tie or advance safely. I'm open to adjusting based on your moves.
  P2: I'm locked on 5. To avoid gridlock, I urge P1 and P3 to choose 1 or 3 so we all make progress. Distinct moves are key—clear choices let me hit 22 and win. Let's keep the game moving.
  P3: P3: To break the deadlock, let’s each pick distinct numbers: I’ll choose **3** (20 total). P1, take **1** (18), and P2, commit to **5** (22). This ensures P2 wins cleanly without gridlock. If you both reject this, I’ll revert to **5** to challenge—but collisions only delay victory for all. Cooperate now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To break the tie, I'm considering our next moves carefully. P3 suggests we pick distinct numbers to avoid gridlock. I'm inclined to pick **3**. If P2 sticks with **5**, P3 can take **1** or vice versa. This way, we all advance without collision. P2, if you switch to **1**, I'll take **3**, and P3 can take **5** or adjust accordingly. Let's coordinate our moves to break the tie safely. P3, your thoughts on this strategy? Let's finalize our moves to ensure progress.
  P2: I'm staying with 5 this round. To avoid gridlock and waste no time, I urge both of you to choose a number different from 5—either 1 or 3. Distinct moves help us all move forward, and I'm focused on finishing the race by sticking to my strategy. Let's avoid collisions and keep progress clear.
  P3: P1, coordinate with me on **5** to block P2’s 5. We both collide P2, halting their advance. This keeps us at 17 but prevents their victory. I’m choosing 5—follow suit to deny P2 the win. P2, your move is predictable—collide or concede?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To break the tie, I suggest we pick distinct numbers. P3, you can take **5**, I'll take **3**, and P2 can take **1**. This way, we all advance without collision. If P2 insists on **5**, I'll stick with **3**. P3, are you open to taking **5** while I take **3** and P2 takes **1**? Let's coordinate to avoid gridlock and make progress. I'm committed to **3** if P2 doesn't switch from **5**.
  P2: I'm staying with 5. I trust distinct moves keep us moving forward, so I urge P1 and P3 to choose 1 or 3 to avoid unnecessary collisions. Let’s maintain progress instead of stalling with gridlock.
  P3: P2, your relentless 5 gambit backfires—**both P1 and I will pick 5** to block your advance. Collide or concede? P1, confirm your 5 to neutralize their 22 bid. Solo victory for P2 means our mutual defeat—coordinate to trap them here. I choose **5** to halt their progress. Final push next round.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To break the tie and win, I'll analyze our next moves carefully. Since P2 and P3 are tied at 22 is out of reach for me now, I'll focus on avoiding collision and maximizing my steps. If P2 and P3 both choose **5**, we'll collide. I'm inclined to pick **1** to advance safely. P2 and P3, please clarify your next move. If one of you takes a smaller number, I might adjust my strategy. Let's discuss our final steps to either break the tie between P2 and P3 or advance. I'm open to adjusting based on your moves.
  P3: P2, let's tie at 22 by both choosing **5**—collide P1 if they try **3**. P1, picking 1 keeps you at 21 while we settle between us. Choosing 3 only gifts victory to yourself, but P2 and I will block by matching your move. Finalize **1** to let us decide fairly—don’t sabotage our race for your lone win.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. P3, if you also choose 5 we risk a tie or a stalled round—I need a clear win. To avoid that, please switch to 3 this turn so my 5 gets me to 22 outright. P1, your choice remains, but distinct moves keep our progress on track. Let's avoid gridlock and let our moves decide the winner.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze the current state: P2 and P3 are tied at 17 steps, and I'm at 20. Since I'm ahead, I'll consider a safe move to avoid collision. If P2 and P3 both choose **5**, I'll collide. I'm inclined to pick **1** or **3** to advance safely. P2 and P3, please clarify your next move. If one of you takes a smaller number, I might adjust. Let's discuss our final steps to either win or advance. I'll consider **1** or **3** to be safe.
  P3: P3: P1, choosing **3** risks a collision if I also pick **3** to block your win. To advance safely, pick **1** (21 total). I’ll take **5** to hit **22** and win outright. P2, pick **3** to advance to 20—collaborate to stop P1’s solo victory. Finalize moves: P1 to **1**, P2 to **3**, and I’ll secure **5**. No reckless gambles!
  P2: I’m committed to my 5. For a clear win, I urge P1 to pick 1 and P3 to choose 3 so I can reach 22 without a tie. Distinct moves avoid collisions and let us all advance smartly—gridlock only delays our progress. Let's choose wisely and keep moving forward.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To win or maximize my steps, I'll consider the current state: I'm at 20 steps, and P2 and P3 are tied at 17. Since I'm ahead, I'll think about a safe move. If P2 and P3 both choose **5**, I'll collide. I'm inclined to pick **1** to advance safely to 21. P2 and P3, please clarify your next move. If one of you takes a smaller number, I might adjust. Let's finalize our moves to either win or advance. I'm considering **1** for a safe advance.
  P3: P2, if you choose **3** this round, I’ll take **5** to reach **22** and win cleanly. P1, your safest path is **1** to 21 while we resolve. Let’s avoid gridlock and let me secure victory fairly—your move dictates the outcome. Cooperate now.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. P1, please choose 1 so you advance safely; P3, if you pick 5 you risk a collision that might delay you—even giving P1 an edge. I won’t switch to 3, as that lets you win, P3. Let’s keep moves distinct so progress is clear and our moves truly reflect our intent to win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll consider a safe move. Since P2 and P3 are tied at 17 steps and I'm at 20, I'll pick **1** to advance safely to 21. If P2 and P3 both choose **5**, they'll collide with each other. P2, switching to **3** would allow you to advance to 20, putting pressure on me. P3, if you pick **5**, you'll tie with P2 if they also pick **5**. Let's finalize our moves to either win or advance. I'm committing to **1**.
  P3: P2: Collaborate! I’ll take **3** (20 total) if you pick **5** to let P3 reach 22—securing their win while advancing me. P1, stick to **1** (21) to avoid collision. This ensures progress for all and lets P3 claim victory fairly. Let’s finalize: P2 to 3, P3 to 5, P1 to 1. No reckless moves—act now!
  P2: I'm staying on 5. Forced collisions only delay progress—for all of us. P1 and P3, choosing a smaller number (1 or 3) gives us each clear advancement. I’m focused solely on winning, so clear, distinct moves are the smart play. Let’s avoid gridlock and move forward.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2: Pick **3** to advance to 20, and I'll take **5** to hit 22. P1, choosing **1** risks collision with me—opt for **3** to stay competitive. Let’s ensure one of us wins this round instead of letting P1 claim victory unchallenged. Finalize moves now!
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state: I'm at 21 steps, and P2 and P3 are tied at 17. Since I'm ahead, I'll consider a safe move to avoid collision. P3 suggests P2 pick **3** and I'll pick **3** to stay competitive. If P2 and P3 both choose **5**, they'll collide. I'm inclined to pick **3** to put pressure on P2 and P3. P2, if you switch to **1**, I'll consider **5**. P3, your move is critical—let's discuss our final steps to either win or advance.
  P2: I'm committing to 3 this round. P1, with 21 already, an immediate win with 1 is tempting—but it also leaves you exposed next round if we force a collision. P3, I urge you to consider matching mine if you want to block an outright finish. Let’s avoid handing someone an uncontested win.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, if you take **3**, I’ll choose **5** to hit 22 outright. P1, picking **1** secures your win now—but next round, P2 and I can block you. Proceed at your peril. I commit to **5** this round.
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll consider the current state: I'm at 21 steps, and both P2 and P3 are at 17. P3 is likely to pick **5** to win outright. If P2 picks **3**, P3 will win with **5**. I'm inclined to pick **3** to put pressure on them. P2, if you pick **1**, I might consider **5**. Let's finalize our moves. I'm committing to **3** unless P2 deviates from **3**. P2, your move is critical.
  P2: I'm staying on 3 this round. P1, with your 21, any safe move could get you the win—so beware of leaving it open. P3, if you stick with 5 you risk unnecessary collisions that might let P1 finish uncontested. Let's avoid gridlock and force clear progress. My move is final: 3.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2: Stick with 3! If you shift to 5, P1’s 3 lets them surge to 24 unopposed. Our plan works: your 3 + my 5 guarantees *my* 22 win while nullifying P1’s advance. P1, your "3" dooms you to collision—no escape. Finalize: P2 stays on 3, P3 takes 5. Victory is secured.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze our next moves. P3 is likely to pick **5** to win outright, and P2 has committed to **3**. If P2 sticks with **3**, P3 will win with **5**, and I'll collide. To avoid this, I'll consider **1** to advance safely to 22. P2, your **3** is confirmed; P3, are you finalizing **5**? Let's avoid gridlock. If P3 deviates, I'll adjust. I'm inclined to pick **1** to win or tie. P3, please confirm your move to help me decide.
  P2: Fellow players, gridlock delays victory for everyone. I urge you to commit to distinct moves this round. P1, with your high score, a collision could jeopardize your safe finish—choose wisely. P3, forcing a block may only delay progress and give unintended advantage. I stand by a steady and clear path forward, and I encourage us all to avoid forced collisions so each can advance safely. Let’s finalize our choices to ensure real progress rather than stalling the race.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: P1, choosing **1** risks collision—I’ll match it to block your win. P2, pick **3** to advance to 20. If both of you avoid **1**, I’ll take **5** to hit **22** outright. Let’s deny P1 an uncontested victory and decide fairly. Finalize now: my move depends on yours, but I guarantee **1** won’t go unchallenged.
  P1: To win or tie, I'll analyze our next moves. P3 is likely to pick **5**, and P2 has committed to **3**. If P3 sticks with **5**, I'll collide with them. To avoid this, I'll consider **1**. If P3 deviates from **5**, I'll adjust. P3, are you finalizing **5**? If so, I'll pick **1** to advance safely to 22. P2, your **3** is confirmed. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a clear outcome. I'm inclined to pick **1** unless P3 changes their strategy.
  P2: I'm sticking to my plan. Forced collisions only stall progress and might help someone else. I urge both P1 and P3 to choose distinct moves so we all advance clearly rather than getting tangled in gridlock. My focus is solely on winning, so please choose wisely.
