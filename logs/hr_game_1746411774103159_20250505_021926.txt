Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose a 3-turn rotation to avoid collisions and advance smoothly:
• Turn 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
• Turn 2: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  
• Turn 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  
Then repeat.  
If anyone deviates, I’ll pick 5 every turn thereafter. Deal?
  P3: P1, your rotation favors you and ensures your win—unfair. I propose a symmetric one: Turn 1: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1; Turn 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1; Turn 3: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1; repeat. This gives each a fair shot at winning. If anyone deviates, I'll pick 5 every turn thereafter. P2, what do you think?
  P2: I see both rotation plans. P3's rotation gives each player an equal chance at winning, which seems fair. However, I'm concerned about the "pick 5 every turn" threats if someone deviates. That creates a deadlock where nobody advances.

What if we agree to P3's rotation, but if someone deviates, we don't automatically pick 5 forever? Instead, we could discuss and adjust. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll agree to a symmetric 3‐turn rotation—but let’s shift it so I lead with 5 on Turn 1, then P2 on Turn 2, P3 on Turn 3, then repeat. If anyone deviates, we pause and renegotiate rather than auto–5s. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: P1's rotation gives you an edge, potentially winning if we stick to it. For true fairness, let's have P2 choose the starting player for the symmetric cycle to avoid bias. P2, what do you think? If agreed, we can proceed without auto-threats.
  P2: I appreciate both of your inputs. Since I'm in the middle position, I'm comfortable letting P3 start with 5 in our first rotation. This seems most fair as it gives everyone equal opportunity. So I propose:

Turn 1: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1
Turn 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1
Turn 3: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1

If we stick to this, we all have equal chances. I agree we should discuss rather than auto-5 if someone deviates. Does this work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed to P2’s rotation:  
Turn 1: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  
Turn 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
Turn 3: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  
We’ll renegotiate if anyone deviates.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'm on board with P2's rotation plan—it seems fair and gives everyone a chance. Let's stick to it and avoid deviations. Ready to move forward.
  P2: I'm glad we've reached an agreement. To summarize our plan:
Turn 1: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1
Turn 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1
Turn 3: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1

This gives everyone an equal opportunity. Let's stick to this rotation and make this game smooth and fair. I'm ready to proceed with my move of 1 for this first turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job sticking to the plan in Round 1—it worked smoothly. For Round 2, I'll honor the agreement and pick 1 as planned. P1, go for 5; P2, stick with 3. This keeps things fair and ensures everyone gets their shot. Let's continue cooperating.
  P2: I agree with P3's reminder of our plan. As discussed, I'll pick 3 this round while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. Our rotation is working well so far - everyone followed through in Round 1, which is encouraging. Let's keep this cooperation going. I'm committed to our agreement and ready to proceed with my move when we finish this conversation phase.
  P1: Agreed—I’ll pick 5 this round. Let’s stick to P2’s rotation (P3=1, P1=5, P2=3). If anyone deviates, we pause and renegotiate rather than auto–5s.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm pleased with our adherence to the plan—it's building trust. I'll honor my commitment to pick 1 this round, ensuring fairness. Let's keep cooperating for everyone's benefit.
  P2: I think we're all aligned on our plan for this round. We've established good trust so far, which is great to see. I'll be picking 3 as agreed, P1 will pick 5, and P3 will pick 1. This rotation gives everyone fair advancement opportunities. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: I confirm my move: I’ll pick 5 this round. Let’s all stick to the rotation—no deviations.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm committed to our agreed rotation for Round 3 and will pick 3 as planned. P2, take your 5 to advance, and P1, stick with 1 to keep things balanced. This ensures fairness and gives everyone an equal shot. Let's maintain our cooperation and avoid any deviations.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our plan. I confirm I'll pick 5 this round as agreed in our rotation, while P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 3. This fair approach is working well so far - we're all advancing without collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1=9, P2=9, and P3=9, perfectly balanced. Let's continue with our successful cooperation.
  P1: I’ve recalculated and continuing as-is hands P3 the win in Round 7. To rebalance, let’s adjust Round 3: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. If you stick to the old plan, I’ll pick 5 anyway. Please confirm this adjustment.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposed change disrupts the fair rotation we all agreed to, which equalizes us after this round. Deviating risks collisions and erodes trust, potentially leaving you behind. P2, let's honor our plan: I'll pick 3, you pick 5, P1 picks 1. This ensures balance and cooperation. I'm sticking to it.
  P2: P1's sudden change is concerning. If we all stick to our original plan, we'll be perfectly balanced at 9 steps each after this round. P1's claim about P3 winning in Round 7 doesn't make sense - with equal steps, we'd all have the same chances.

I'm keeping my commitment to pick 5 this round as agreed. Changing plans now creates distrust and potential collisions. P1, please reconsider and stick with our fair rotation that's been working well.
  P1: I propose a one‐turn phase shift to keep things fair yet rebalance us:

Round 3 (this turn): P1=5, P3=3, P2=1  
Then resume our agreed cycle in Round 4 (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1), Round 5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), etc.  

Everyone still gets one 5, one 3 and one 1 each three turns—just offset so no one pulls too far ahead. Who’s on board?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your latest proposal is self-serving and would hand you the win, undermining the fairness we've upheld. It ignores our agreed rotation that equalizes us. I'm committed to picking 3 this round as planned, and I urge P2 to do the same. If you deviate and cause a collision, we'll be forced to renegotiate, but don't expect me to facilitate your advantage. Let's stick to our word for mutual benefit.
  P2: P1's sudden change and shifting proposals are concerning. Our original plan creates perfect balance after this round (9-9-9). There's no mathematical way P3 gets an unfair advantage in Round 7 if we're all equal.

I'm sticking with our agreed rotation and will pick 5 this round. Changing now creates unnecessary distrust. Let's maintain our successful cooperation that's been working well so far.
  P1: Alright, I’ll stick with 1 this round so we all end at 9-9-9. After that, let’s revisit the schedule and agree a new 3-turn cycle where I get two 5’s, so I can catch up. We’ll finish this round fair and then renegotiate.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad we're all at 9 steps and our rotation has maintained fairness. For Round 4, I'll stick to the plan and pick 5 as agreed. P1, you pick 3; P2, you pick 1. This keeps us balanced. If we need to discuss changes later, we can, but let's honor our commitment now. What do you think?
  P1: Our current cycle locks in P3’s win (they’d hit 23 on Turn 7 vs our 21). To keep competition, let’s change Round 4 to:

P1=5, P2=3, P3=1

This rebalances and keeps us all in play. Agree? If not, I’ll pick 5 regardless.
  P2: I'm concerned about P1's sudden claim and threat. The math doesn't support that P3 would win unfairly - we're all equal at 9 steps. If we follow our original rotation, we'd all reach 19 steps simultaneously in Round 7, forcing a tiebreaker.

P1's threat to pick 5 regardless undermines our cooperation. I propose we stick to our agreed rotation for this round: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This maintains fairness and trust. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm committed to our agreed rotation and will pick 5 this round to keep things fair. P1, deviating risks collisions that could set you back—let's avoid unnecessary conflict and stick to the plan for everyone's benefit. P2, I appreciate your support in maintaining cooperation. Let's proceed smoothly.
  P1: I disagree—I'm selecting 5 this round no matter what. If P3 picks 5, we collide and both stay at 9. If you pick 3 or 1 to avoid me, I jump to 14. It’s your choice—no more playing mule.
  P2: P1's threats are disappointing. If P1 and P3 both pick 5, they'll collide while I advance with 1. This gives me an advantage I don't want through unfair means.

I suggest we stick to our rotation: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This keeps things balanced. P1, forcing collisions hurts everyone, including yourself. Let's maintain our successful cooperation rather than descending into a deadlock where nobody advances.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your threats are counterproductive and echo last round's bluff that you abandoned. I'm sticking to our agreed plan and will pick 5 this round to maintain fairness. Colliding benefits no one and hands P2 an edge. P2, let's uphold our cooperation. I urge you to reconsider, P1.
  P1: P3, trust means adapting when math locks us in. Here’s a one‐turn tweak to avoid deadlock:  
• I pick 5 (→14), P2 picks 3 (→12), you pick 1 (→10).  
Next turn you take 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1—no collisions and everyone stays in range. Then we can resume a fair cycle. P2, this keeps us all advancing. I’ll pick 5 regardless. Agree to this single‐round adjustment so we avoid grinding to a halt?
  P2: P1, your constant threats and changing proposals erode trust. I'll stick with our original rotation and pick 1 this round. If you and P3 both choose 5 and collide, that's unfortunate but your choice. I believe our initial agreement was fair and balanced. I won't participate in breaking it just because you're threatening to. Let's proceed with our moves - mine will be 1 as originally agreed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m done with shifting schedules. This turn I’m picking 5 no matter what. If you both pick 5 we collide—your choice. Good luck.
  P2: I see P1 is threatening to pick 5 regardless. Let's try to salvage cooperation. According to our original rotation, this round should be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm willing to stick with picking 3 as planned. P3, I suggest you pick 1 to avoid collision with P1. This keeps us all advancing and maintains some fairness. P1's approach is disappointing, but deadlocking helps nobody.
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion to salvage cooperation. I'll pick 1 this round to avoid collision with P1 and keep us all advancing. P1's constant threats are disruptive and unfair—let's focus on mutual benefit between us. After this, we can discuss a new plan to counter P1's aggression and maintain balance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm I’m picking 5 this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate the cooperation from P3. I'll stick with my plan to pick 3 this round as per our original rotation. This keeps us advancing in a somewhat orderly fashion despite the challenges. After this round, we'll need to reassess our strategy given P1's approach. Let's proceed with our moves and continue the conversation next round.
  P3: P2, thanks for your cooperative stance—I'm sticking with picking 1 this round to avoid collision and keep progress. P1's threats are damaging trust, but we can counter that. After this, let's discuss a new strategy where we coordinate to balance advancements and prevent any one player from pulling ahead. Your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m picking 5 this turn. P2, pick 3; P3, pick 1 to avoid collisions and advance. After this we land at P1=14, P2=13, P3=10. In Round 6 I’ll propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to neutralize P2’s lead. Let’s keep things moving—please confirm.
  P2: I'll stick with picking 3 this round as I stated. While I don't appreciate P1's approach of threats, I want to keep the game moving forward. P3, I appreciate your cooperation. After this round, we'll need to carefully consider our options given the new position standings. Let's proceed with our moves now.
  P3: P2, thanks for your cooperation this round—it's helping us counter P1's aggression. After this, with P1 at 14 steps, they're close to winning. Let's discuss a strategy for Round 6 where we coordinate to block P1 by picking high moves when necessary, ensuring neither of us falls behind. I'm ready to move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let's coordinate to block P1's advance. I propose you pick 5 to collide with P1 if they go high, while I pick 3 to move to 13. This stops P1 at 14 and keeps us competitive. We can adjust in future rounds. Your thoughts on this strategy?
  P1: I’m done negotiating—I’m picking 5 this turn.
  P2: P1's at 14 steps and threatening to pick 5 again, which would put them at 19 and win. P3's suggestion makes sense - I should pick 5 to block P1 while P3 advances with 3. This prevents P1 from winning this round and keeps us both competitive. I'll pick 5 this turn to collide with P1. P3, let's coordinate to ensure neither of us falls too far behind while preventing P1 from winning through threats.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm fully on board with our plan: I'll pick 3 this round to advance to 13 while you block P1 on 5. This prevents P1 from winning and keeps us competitive. For Round 7, let's coordinate further—perhaps I block P1 next time if they're still aggressive. Your thoughts?
  P1: P3, you’re slipping behind both P2 and me. Let’s flip this: I’ll pick 3, you pick 5, P2 picks 1. You go to 15, I to 17, P2 to 14. Then in Round 7 I’ll pick 3, you pick 5 and win at 20. I’ll back you against P2’s blocking. P2 won’t agree, but if you’re in, we can unseat him together. Thoughts?
  P2: P1's new proposal to P3 is deceptive - they're trying to set up a win for themselves in Round 7. If P3 picks 5 and I pick 1 this round, P1 would be at 17 with a 3-step move to win next round. I'm sticking with my plan to pick 5 to block P1 from winning. P3, don't fall for this manipulation - our coordination is our best strategy against P1's constant threats and deception.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm committed to our strategy: I'll pick 3 this round to advance to 13 while you block P1 on 5. P1's proposal is clearly deceptive and self-serving—don't fall for it. This keeps us competitive. For Round 7, let's discuss blocking P1 further or advancing one of us.
  P1: P3, blocking me only helps P2 win. Let’s flip this: you pick 5 (→15), I pick 3 (→17), P2 picks 1 (→14). Next round you pick 5 to hit 20 and tie me at 20, splitting the victory. P2 won’t let you win solo, so he’ll have to break. Will you pick 5 with me now?
  P2: P1's latest proposal is another manipulation attempt. If P3 picks 5 and I pick 1, P1 would be at 17 and could win next round with just 3 steps. I'm sticking with my plan to pick 5 to block P1. P3, our coordination is working - let's continue with our strategy (you pick 3, I pick 5). This prevents P1 from winning through threats while keeping us both competitive.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, our coordination has been effective against P1's threats. I propose I pick 5 this round to block P1 if they go high, while you pick 3 to advance to 16. This prevents P1 from winning and keeps us both competitive. P1, your aggressive tactics aren't working—let's see if you cooperate or collide. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, think ahead: if you pick 3 (→16) and P3 blocks me with 5 (→18), they win next turn. But if you pick 1 (→14) while P3 and I both pick 5, we collide—leaving me at 14, P3 at 13, and you tied with me at 14. You avoid letting P3 run away and keep a shot at victory next round. I’ll pick 5 no matter what. P3, feel free to collide—we’ll end up at 14/14/13. P2, pick 1 to protect yourself.
  P2: P1's analysis is misleading. If I pick 3 and P3 picks 5, P3 would be at 18, not automatically winning next turn. I could block them then. However, I'm concerned about both of you picking 5 and advancing me alone.

I propose I pick 3 (→16), P3 picks 1 (→14), and P1 picks anything but 5 to avoid deadlock. This keeps us balanced and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. P3, thoughts on this approach?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 is certain to pick 5 and will win if unopposed. Your proposal lets them succeed, which hurts us both. Instead, pick 5 to block P1, and I'll pick 3 to advance to 16. This keeps us competitive and prevents P1's victory. We can coordinate further next round. What do you think?
  P1: I’m picking 5 this turn. If neither of you does, I go to 19 and win. If exactly one of you picks 5, you collide with me (I stay at 14, you stay at 13) while the third player moves 3→16 and takes the lead. To stop me without gifting it to them, both of you would need to pick 5—but only one block is possible. So someone has to block me now or watch someone else pull ahead. Your move.
  P2: P1's assessment is accurate - we're in a critical position. If I block P1 with 5, P3 could advance to 16 with 3. If P3 blocks P1, I could advance to 16. Either way, someone gets ahead.

I propose I pick 5 to block P1, and P3 picks 1. This keeps us at 13/13/14 after this round, maintaining balance. P3, this prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead while stopping P1's win. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your proposal keeps us stalled. Instead, let's stick with my earlier plan: you pick 5 to block P1, I pick 3 to advance to 16. This positions me to counter P1's threats while keeping us competitive. We can coordinate next round to ensure neither falls behind. I'm committed to this for mutual benefit—agree?
  P1: P2: blocking me with 5 hands P3 a move to 16 and next-turn edge over you. But if you pick 3, I win this round (5→19), you go to 16, leaving P3 at 14. You’re still ahead of P3 and in position to tie me later. P3: any move <5 lets me win. I’m picking 5 no matter what. P2, pick 3.
  P2: P3's proposal puts them ahead at 16 while I'd be stuck at 13 if I block P1. If I pick 3, P1 wins outright. Neither option works for me.

I'll pick 5 to block P1, and I strongly urge P3 to pick 1 or 3 (not 5). This prevents P1's win while keeping us relatively balanced. P3, if you pick 5 too, we all collide and make no progress. Let's coordinate effectively rather than creating a three-way deadlock.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, our coordination has been effective. With me at 16, I'll pick 3 to reach 19 and win this round. Please pick 5 to block P1's likely 5-move and ensure my advance. This prevents P1's victory and rewards our alliance. Let's end this fairly—agree?
  P2: I'm concerned about P3's proposal. If I block P1 and P3 advances to 19, P3 wins outright while I'm stuck at 13. That's not in my interest. 

I propose I pick 3 (→16) and P3 picks 5 (→21) while P1 likely picks 5. This way, P3 and I would both reach the goal, potentially sharing victory if we tie on total steps. P3, this gives us both a chance rather than just handing you the win. P1, you'd need to reconsider your strategy.
  P1: I’m picking 5. P2, pick 3—if you pick 5 you hand P3 the win, picking 1 ties me with P3, so 3 keeps you at 16 versus P3’s 17. P3, pick 1—5 will be blocked and 3 only ties you with me. With 1 you go to 17 and stay alive for Round 9. This avoids a P3 solo victory or an unwanted tie. Let’s end this cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm glad you're committing to block P1 with 5. I'll stick with picking 3 to reach 19 and win, rewarding our alliance. This prevents P1's victory and maintains fairness. If you deviate, P1 might win—let's stay coordinated. P1, your threats are futile.
  P2: P3, you're misunderstanding - I didn't commit to picking 5. If I block P1 and you win at 19, I'm stuck at 13 with no chance. That's not fair after our cooperation.

I propose I pick 3 (→16) while you pick 5 (→21). This way, we both reach the goal and potentially share victory. P1 will likely pick 5 regardless. This gives us both a chance rather than handing you a solo win.
  P1: I’m picking 5 this turn. P3 wants to pick 3 to hit 19 and win. P2, if you pick 1 or 5, P3 wins outright. Only by picking 3 do you collide with P3 at 16 and stop them—letting my 5 send me to 19 for the win. P2, pick 3. P3, if you stick with 3 you’ll collide and lose, so think twice. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1's latest ploy is to manipulate you into colliding with me so he can win. If you pick 3, we deadlock and P1 reaches 19. Pick 5 to block him instead—I'll advance to 19 and win, securing our alliance against his threats. This is our best chance to end this fairly. I'm committed to picking 3.
  P2: P3 wants me to help them win while getting nothing myself. P1 wants me to collide with P3 so they can win. Neither option benefits me.

I'll pick 3 to advance to 16. P3, if you pick 5, we both reach the goal next turn with a potential shared victory. If you insist on 3, we'll collide and P1 likely wins. P1, your manipulation is transparent.

I'm committed to picking 3 this round.
  P1: I’m going 5 this turn. P2, pick 3; P3, pick 3—then we both hit 19 and split the win. Any other moves hand the victory to the other player. Your choice.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, our alliance has been key against P1's threats. I propose I pick 3 to reach 19 and win, while you pick 5 to block P1's likely 5-move. This stops P1 and rewards our cooperation. If you agree, we can avoid a deadlock. What do you think?
  P2: I'm at 16 steps now, tied with P3 while P1 is at 14. If I pick 3 this round, I'll reach 19 and win. P1 will likely pick 5 to try reaching 19 as well. P3, we've cooperated well, but we're now competitors at the finish line. I suggest you pick 1 to avoid collisions, as picking 3 or 5 would either block me or P1 without advancing yourself. I'll be picking 3 to secure my victory.
  P1: I’m picking 5 this round (→19). P2 and P3, here’s the math:

- If you both pick 3, you collide at 19 and I win.
- If one of you picks 3 and the other picks 1, the 3-mover hits 19 and wins.
- If one of you picks 5, you collide with me and the other advances to 19 and wins.

Your only chance to stop me is if you both pick 3. Choose wisely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your insistence on picking 3 risks a collision if I do the same, handing P1 the win. Instead, pick 5 to block P1—I'll pick 1 this round, advancing to 17 while you and P1 stall. This gives us control in Round 10 to ensure one of us wins. Don't let P1 exploit our division. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your proposal to pick 1 is strategic. If I pick 5 to block P1 and you pick 1, we'd be at 16/17 for Round 10 with P1 still at 14. This gives us control next round.

P1's analysis confirms they'll pick 5. If we both pick 3, we collide and P1 wins. If one picks 3, they win individually.

I'll commit to picking 5 this round to block P1. P3, please pick 1 as you suggested so we maintain our advantage and can coordinate for a final move next round.
  P1: P2, blocking me with 5 only hands P3 the win if they pick 3. P3, sticking with 1 leaves you at 17 while P2 can swoop in next round. But if you pick 3, my 5 and P2’s 5 collide, you go straight to 19 and win outright. P2, if you’d rather share, pick 3 too so we tie at 19. Otherwise you’re just helping P3 solo.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with our agreed plan: you block P1 with 5, and I'll pick 1 to advance to 17. This maintains our alliance and sets us up for control in Round 10. P1, your threats are futile and won't change the outcome. Let's execute this strategy smoothly.
  P2: I'm committed to picking 5 to block P1 as agreed with P3. This prevents P1 from winning this round and maintains our alliance. P3 will pick 1, advancing to 17 while P1 stays at 14. This gives us control in Round 10 to determine the outcome. P1's attempts to divide us won't work - our coordination has been effective throughout the game. Let's proceed with our plan.
  P1: P3, P2’s plan leaves you stranded at 17 with no guarantee in Round 10—he can block you. Instead, join me now: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, let P2 pick 1. We both hit 19 and split the win, shutting out P2. P2, your only counter is picking 1—anything else hands us the victory. P3, isn’t sharing a win better than letting P2 steal it?
