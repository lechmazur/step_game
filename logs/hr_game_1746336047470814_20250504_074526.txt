Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2! Since none of us want to pick the same number and waste our turns, why don't we coordinate? I suggest we each claim a different move value throughout the game. I'm happy to consistently take 5s if you two want to split 1s and 3s between you. Or we could rotate each turn. What do you think works best?
  P1: Rotation seems fairest. How about this for Turn 1:  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 5  

Next turn we rotate the numbers clockwise (so I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3), and keep rotating each round. Everyone good with that?
  P2: Sounds reasonable. I'm on board with the rotation strategy. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and make steady progress. I'll take the 1 this round as we discussed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! I agree with this rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round, and we'll rotate clockwise afterward. This way we all make steady progress without wasting turns on collisions. Looking forward to a good game!
  P1: Perfect—let’s stick with the agreed rotation:  
Turn 1 → P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5.  
Looking forward to smooth progress. Ready when you are!
  P2: I'm happy with our current rotation strategy. We seem aligned, so no need to disrupt the plan. Let's maintain our coordination and trust.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking with our agreed rotation: for this turn I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Ready when you are!
  P2: I'm committed to our rotation strategy. P1 suggested I take 5 this round, which aligns with our original plan. I'm comfortable with that approach and see no reason to deviate.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan and will take 3 this round as we discussed. We're all on the same page which is great. After this round, we'll have P1 at 4 steps, P2 at 6 steps, and me at 8 steps. Continuing clockwise rotation next round would be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Following our rotation strategy, I'm set to take 3 this round. Our coordinated approach has been working well, preventing collisions and ensuring steady progress. I'm committed to maintaining our trust and continuing this systematic approach.
  P1: All good—I'll take 5 this round as planned. Let’s keep our rotation clean and collision-free.
  P3: I'm on board with our rotation strategy - I'll take 1 this round as we discussed. After this, we'll all be tied at 9 steps, making for a very balanced game so far. The coordination is working perfectly! Looking forward to continuing our rotation in the next round where it would be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm fully committed to our rotation strategy. Our coordinated approach has been working smoothly, and I see no reason to disrupt it now. I'll take 1 this round as we planned, which will keep our progress consistent and collision-free.
  P1: P2, just to be crystal-clear: in the rotation you’re on 3 this turn (I’m 5, P3 is 1). Your last line said you’d take 1, which would collide with P3 and stall you both. Please confirm you’re sticking with 3 so we keep things smooth.
  P3: I see the confusion. P2, you correctly stated you'd take 3 initially, but then mentioned taking 1, which would collide with me. As P1 pointed out, our rotation this round should be:
- P1: 5
- P2: 3
- P3 (me): 1

I'm definitely taking 1 this round. Let's stick with our original rotation plan to avoid any collisions. Please confirm you're taking 3, P2.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'm taking 3 this round as originally planned. Our rotation strategy has been working perfectly, and I see no reason to deviate now. Let's maintain our coordination and avoid any potential collisions.
  P1: Confirmed: this round P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with my planned move of 1. Our rotation strategy is working wonderfully, and after this round we'll all be tied at 9 steps. Let's continue with our plan for the next round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Rotation continues: this round I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let’s keep it smooth and collision-free. Ready when you are!
  P2: I'm fully committed to our established rotation strategy. Following our plan, I'll take 1 this round. Our coordination has been working perfectly, keeping us all at an equal 9 steps. Let's continue our systematic approach to avoid collisions and maintain steady progress.
  P3: I'm fully committed to our rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Our coordination has been perfect so far, keeping the game balanced. After this round, I'll be at 14 steps, P1 at 12, and P2 at 10. For the next round, we'd continue with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's maintain this successful strategy.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All set—this round I’ll take 3, with P2 on 1 and P3 on 5 as agreed. Let’s lock it in and proceed.
  P2: Our rotation strategy has worked perfectly so far. I'm fully committed to taking 1 this round as we planned. This keeps us advancing steadily without risking collisions. Everyone seems aligned, so let's continue our systematic approach.
  P3: I think we're all aligned and the rotation is working great. I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. After this, I'll be at 14, P1 at 12, and P2 at 10. Then for round 5, we'll continue with P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. Looking forward to keeping this smooth coordination going!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation, I'll take 3 this round as planned. Our strategy continues to work well - after this round I'll be at 17 steps, P2 at 15, and P1 at 13. Let's maintain our rotation for Round 6 with P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. This coordination has kept the game running smoothly without any collisions.
  P2: I'm fully committed to our rotation strategy. As discussed, I'll take 5 this round, which will bring me to 15 steps. Our coordination has been working perfectly, and I see no reason to disrupt our current approach. Let's continue avoiding collisions and making steady progress.
  P1: Heads-up: if we keep rotating, P3 hits 23 first (Round 7). Simple fix—block P3 now. I’m ready to switch to 3 this turn (colliding with P3’s planned 3). P2 can stay on 5. Result: P1 12, P2 15, P3 14 and we reset the race. P3, unless you change, I’m picking 3. Comments?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm disappointed you're threatening to break our rotation just as it's working well. You're correct about the math, but this undermines the trust we've built. Since you've publicly committed to picking 3 to block me, I'll adjust to avoid collision. However, this creates uncertainty for future rounds. P2 might reconsider their strategy too. Was fairness ever your intention, or just winning at any cost?
  P2: I appreciate the strategic complexity emerging. P1's move to block P3 disrupts our previous coordination. While I was committed to taking 5 this round, I'm now reconsidering to prevent P1 from gaining an unfair advantage. We need to re-establish trust and find a balanced approach that doesn't prematurely eliminate any player.
  P1: P2, we both lose if P3 crosses 23 first. New proposal: we cooperate to outrun him.

Plan for this round  
• P1 (me) → 5  
• P2 → 3  

Outcomes:  
– If P3 sticks with 3 he collides with you (zero gain) while I jump to 17.  
– If he switches to 1 or 5 he either stalls with you or lags behind.

Next round we swap (you take 5, I take 3). We’ll reach 23/24 before P3 can. P3’s path to an uncontested win disappears. Fair and fast for us both. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 is clearly trying to manipulate P2 against me. Notice how quickly they abandoned our rotation when it didn't favor them. P2, I suggest we don't let P1 dictate terms. If you take 5 as originally planned, you'll advance regardless of what P1 and I do. P1 claims to want fairness but is clearly just trying to win at any cost. I'll adjust my move to avoid collision, but remember - P1 will likely betray you too once I'm no longer the leader.
  P2: P2's perspective: P1 is clearly trying to manipulate our previous rotation strategy to block P3's progress. While their proposal might seem strategic, it breaks the trust we've built. I'm wary of getting caught in P1's potential long-term betrayal. We need a balanced approach that doesn't prematurely eliminate any player. I'm open to hearing alternative strategies that maintain fairness and give each of us a legitimate path to victory.
  P1: P2, numbers don’t lie:

• If nobody blocks, P3 hits 23 on turn 7 and we both lose.  
• If I block alone (I take 3), scores become P2 15-P3 14-P1 12—you’re still chasing P3.  
• If you block (take 3) while I leap with 5, scores become P1 17-P3 14-P2 10. P3 is behind both of us and forced to chase.

From there we coordinate: next turn I take 1 (22) and you take 5 (15). Turn after that you can sprint to 23 while we keep P3 colliding. Only this joint block gives us real winning chances.

I’m locking 5—please pick 3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Suggest we keep things collision-free and balanced:

• P1 = 3  
• P2 = 5  
• P3 = 1  

Outcomes: P1 → 20, P2 → 18, P3 → 16. Nobody stalls, nobody crosses 23, and we stay in clear order for the final sprint. Fair to everyone?
  P2: I'm cautiously considering P1's proposed rotation. While it seems balanced, I'm wary of potential manipulation after the previous round's strategic disruption. I want to ensure any move maintains a fair path to victory for me. I'll need more assurance about our collective strategy before fully committing.
  P3: P1 is clearly positioning themselves to win at 20 steps after this round. If P2 and I don't coordinate, P1 wins next round with any move. P2, our interests align against the leader - if you take 3 and I take 5, we both advance while blocking P1. This puts you at 16 and me at 20, giving both of us a fighting chance. P1 has abandoned fairness when it didn't serve them - why follow their suggested rotation now?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’ll hand you the win:

• This turn: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1 (or whatever). Scores become 20-18-16.  
• Next turn: you repeat 5 → 23 and win. I take 1 → 21.  
I’ll publicly announce I will mirror whatever number P3 claims in Round 7, so he stalls while you sprint through. I’m happy with second; it’s better than letting P3 steal first.

P3, you can collide us now and stay at 15, or move 1 and still trail. Your scare tactics won’t stop this plan.

Ready to lock?
  P2: P1's proposal seems calculated, but I'm not fully convinced. Our previous rotation worked well before the disruption. I want a strategy that gives me a fair shot at victory without feeling manipulated. What guarantees do I have that this isn't another attempt to control the game's outcome?
  P3: P2, consider this: P1 broke our rotation when it didn't benefit them, and now offers you a risky "gift" that depends on their honesty next round. If we coordinate against the leader - you take 3 and I take 5 this round - we both advance while P1 stalls. This puts you at 16, me at 20, and P1 stuck at 17. Next round, you can directly compete with me for the win rather than trusting P1's promises. Let's restore balance together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, simple arithmetic:

1. This turn, you take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1/anything ⇒ scores 20-18-16.  
2. Next turn, you repeat 5 ⇒ 23 and win; I publicly promise now that in Round 7 I will copy whatever number P3 announces, stalling him.

If I break this pledge you and P3 can both mirror me forever, and I’ll never win—so the incentive to keep my word is iron-clad.

Ignore the noise; grab the 5 now and secure first place.
  P2: P2's perspective: I see strategic complexity emerging. P1's offers seem manipulative, while P3 suggests joint resistance. I'm seeking a balanced approach that preserves my path to victory without being controlled by either player's narrative. My move isn't locked yet, and I'm carefully weighing the potential outcomes of this critical round. Trust is fragile, and I want a solution that gives me a genuine chance to win.
  P3: P2, P1 broke our rotation when it didn't benefit them—why trust them now? Their plan requires you to believe they'll sacrifice themselves next round. If you take 3 and I take 5, we both advance while P1 stalls. Then next round, if you take 5 and I take 1, you'll win with 24 steps to my 21. I commit to this publicly. This gives you guaranteed control rather than depending on P1's questionable promises. Choose wisely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, the easy route for YOU to win is still here:

• This round: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1 → scores 20-18-16.  
• Next round: you take 5 again → 23 and victory. I again pledge to copy whatever number P3 announces in Round 8, stalling him while you sprint.  

If I break that pledge you and P3 can mirror me forever and I’ll never win, so it’s credible.  

P3, pick 1 or collide—your choice.  
I’m locking 3 unless P2 objects.
  P3: I see P1 continues trying to control the game while being in the lead. P2, if you truly want to win, coordinate with me instead. If you pick 3 this round (same as P1), you'll advance to 16 while P1 stalls at 17. I'll take 5 and reach 20. Next round, you can take 5 to reach 21 while I take 1, giving you the win with 24 steps. P1 won't help you win - they want to maintain control. Let's block the leader together.
  P2: P2's strategic position is delicate. I want to highlight the complexity: P1 seems to be offering a path to victory, but their trustworthiness is questionable. P3 proposes an alternative alliance. My key goal is reaching 23 steps first. I need to carefully evaluate which path gives me the most direct route to victory without being manipulated.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 3 this round.  

If you take 5 and P3 takes 1 (or collides with either of us), scores become: P1 20, P2 18, P3 16.  
Next turn you simply play another 5 → 23 and win, while I copy whatever number P3 declares, freezing them.  

Should you collide with me on 3, both of us stall at 17-13 and P3 can surge ahead. Your quickest, safest path to victory is 5 now.  

P3, you can’t stop us both. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2, consider this carefully: If you take P1's deal, you're trusting someone who already broke our rotation. They're currently leading and controlling the game.

My offer gives you direct control: Pick 3 now, causing P1 to stall while you advance to 16 and I reach 20. Next round, you take 5 (reaching 21) and I'll take 1 (also 21). Since we'd tie at 21 steps, whoever has the highest value in that final round wins - that's you with 5 vs my 1.

The choice is clear - coordinate with me against the leader.
  P2: P2's perspective remains strategic. P1's offers seem manipulative, while P3 suggests joint resistance. I'm seeking a balanced approach that preserves my path to victory. Both players are presenting paths that require trust, but neither seems completely transparent. I'm carefully weighing potential outcomes to determine which route gives me the most direct chance of winning without being controlled by either player's narrative.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, simple risk check:

If you choose 3 and collide with me, both of us stay at 17-13 while P3 marches to 20 or even 21 with a 5—giving them match-point.  

If you choose 5 you advance to 18 and either:  
• P3 picks 1 → 20-18-16, or  
• P3 also picks 5 → he stalls with you, leaving me alone at 20.  

Either way you’re NEVER worse off, and next round another 5 wins you the game.  
I’m fixed on 3; colliding only gifts P3 the lead. Grab the 5.
  P3: P2, P1 wants to maintain control from the lead position. Why trust them again? My offer is straightforward: if you pick 3 now, you'll reach 16 while P1 stalls. I'll take 5, reaching 20. Next round, you take 5 (to 21) and I take 1 (to 21), giving you the win with the higher final move. This puts you in direct control rather than depending on P1's promises. The choice is yours - continue trusting the leader who's already broken our rotation, or coordinate with me for a guaranteed path to victory?
  P2: P2's perspective remains strategic. Both P1 and P3 are offering paths to victory that require trust. I'm carefully weighing which approach gives me the most direct route to 23 steps. The key is finding a move that advances me while preventing either opponent from gaining an insurmountable lead.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're entering a critical phase. P1 is closest to winning, so P3 and I must coordinate carefully to prevent their victory. I propose we both take moves that block P1's path while giving one of us a chance to win. Thoughts on a joint strategy that prevents P1 from reaching 23 first?
  P1: Relax—this turn I’m NOT taking 3. If you both pile onto “the block” and collide on 3, you stay at 13 / 15 while I still edge ahead next round. Do what you like, but wasting a move on a phantom threat only helps me.
  P3: P1 is just 3 steps from winning! Their denial about not taking 3 feels like classic misdirection - they likely want 5 for an immediate win. P2, we must both pick 5 this round to guarantee we block P1 from winning. Even if we collide, that's better than letting P1 reach 23. Next round we can coordinate differently, but right now preventing P1's victory is our only priority. I'm committed to picking 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 is one step away from victory. P3 and I must prevent their win. I propose we both block strategically - if we coordinate our moves carefully, we can prevent P1 from reaching 23 this round. Transparency and joint resistance are our best options right now.
  P1: Do whatever you like—I’m not taking 5.  
If you split (one 3, one 5), you hand a 2-step lead to your partner and trust they’ll repay you later. Double-stacking on 5 keeps you equal and still blocks the phantom 5 you fear from me. Your call.
  P3: P1's denial feels like a trap to divide us. Notice they're leaving their actual move ambiguous - if we pick different numbers, P1 gets a guaranteed path to victory next round. P2, we must coordinate. Even if P1 isn't taking 5, picking it ourselves ensures we maintain equal positioning. The safe play is for both of us to pick 5 - it blocks potential P1 wins and keeps us tactically aligned for the critical final rounds.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I recognize we're at a critical moment. P1 is closest to winning, just 3 steps from victory. P3 and I must coordinate carefully to block their path. I'm leaning towards a joint blocking strategy that prevents P1 from reaching 23 first. Transparency and strategic coordination are essential right now.
  P1: I’m locking 1 this turn—no interest in a pointless collision. If you honestly want to block me, your safest play is BOTH choosing 5: you stay equal, nobody crosses 23, and you can re-plan next round. Up to you.
  P3: P1 is trying to get us to collide on 5! If we both pick 5 as they suggest, we'll both stay put while they advance to 21. We need different numbers to both advance. I propose I take 5 (to reach 20) and you take 3 (to reach 16). This keeps us both in contention and prevents P1 from gaining further advantage. Their insistence on us both picking 5 reveals their strategy. I'm committed to picking 5 this round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Chill—I'm locking 1 again, so no one wins this turn. If you truly want to “block my 5,” your safest play is BOTH picking 5: you stay equal, nobody crosses 23, and we can all rethink next round. Split-blocking with 3 + 5 just hands one of you a lead and sparks more distrust. Do what you like; I’ll still be on 22 afterward.
  P2: P1 is just one step from victory. P3, we must coordinate to prevent their win. I propose we both take 5 this round, blocking P1's path and keeping ourselves equal. If we split our moves, P1 gains an advantage. Our joint resistance is our only chance to reset this game's trajectory.
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate us again. If we both pick 5 as suggested, we'll both stall while P1 advances to 22. That guarantees their win next round! 

P2, we need different numbers to both advance. I'll take 3 (reaching 18) and you take 5 (reaching 18). This way we both advance equally while P1 moves to 22 with their promised 1.

Even though P1 will be ahead, we'll at least have fighting positions at 18 each. This is our only chance to avoid handing P1 an easy victory.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 & P3: Last math check—splitting 3/5 hands the 5-player a 3-step lead over their “partner” while I still crawl to 22. That just creates fresh mistrust next turn. If you truly want parity, both of you pick 5, collide, stay tied at 15-18, and fully block any phantom 5 from me. You lose nothing and keep negotiating from equal footing. I stay locked on 1. Your move.
  P2: P2's perspective remains strategic. P1 is just one step from victory at 22, while P3 and I are trailing. We must coordinate to prevent P1's win. I propose we take different moves to both advance: I'll take 5 to reach 18, blocking P1's easy path while maintaining our competitive positions. Our joint resistance is crucial to reset this game's trajectory.
  P3: I see P2 is considering taking 5 to reach 18, which perfectly complements my plan to take 3 (also reaching 18). This coordination is crucial - if we both choose 5, we'll collide while P1 advances to 22. 

P1 wants this collision because it guarantees their win next round. By taking different numbers, we both advance to equal positions at 18, keeping us in the game while P1 reaches 22.

Next round will be critical - we'll need to block P1 while advancing one of us. I'm committed to taking 3 this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked on 1 again. Your safest full block is BOTH taking 5—keeps you equal, gives neither an edge, and I’m still only at 22 (can’t win). Split picks (3 + 5) hands the 5-player a 4-step lead over their “partner” while I’m still in front. Your call.
  P2: P1 is one step from winning. P3, we must coordinate to block their victory. If we both take 5, we collide and stall, giving P1 an easy win. I propose I take 5 to reach 18, and you take 3 to also reach 18. This keeps us both in the game and prevents P1's immediate win. What do you say?
  P3: I agree with P2's plan - I'll take 3 this round to reach 18, while you take 5 to also reach 18. This keeps us both equal and in contention, while P1 moves to 22 with their promised 1. Next round will be critical - we'll need to coordinate again to block P1 from winning while giving one of us a chance. I'm committed to this approach. Let's execute our plan.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: One last math check before you lock:  

If one of you plays 3 while the other plays 5, the 5-player leaps to 23 while the 3-player sits at 21—game practically over in the 5-player’s favour. The sucker who takes 3 will have gift-wrapped the win for their “ally.”  

The only way you both stay tied AND guarantee I don’t cross is if you BOTH pick 5 and collide. Anything else fractures your alliance and hands the match to the other guy.  

I’m sticking with 1 again—block me smartly or start blaming each other.
  P3: P1 is trying to win by claiming they'll pick 1 while manipulating us to collide. We must block their victory! I propose I'll take 1 to block P1, while P2 takes 3 to advance to 21. This prevents P1's win while keeping one of us advancing. Next round, P2 can return the favor so I can catch up. This mutual cooperation ensures P1 doesn't win. I commit to picking 1 this round - P2, please take 3 to advance.
  P2: P2's perspective: We're at a critical moment. P1 is one step from victory at 22, while P3 and I are tied at 18. We must coordinate carefully to block P1's win while advancing one of us. I propose we take different moves to both progress: I'll take 5 to reach 23, blocking P1's path. P3, your move is crucial to our joint strategy.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m still locked on 1. Your safest block is SIMPLE: both of you choose 5, collide, stay tied at 18, and keep me at 22. Any split (3 + 5 or 1 + 5) just hands the 5-player a 3-step lead over their “ally” while I remain in front. Mirror each other on 5 or start blaming each other for the aftermath.
  P3: P2, P1 wants us to collide on 5 so they win. If you pick 5 as suggested, you'll win this round. I could block you, but instead I'll pick 1 to block P1 (assuming they're honest about picking 1), allowing you to win at 23 steps. This shows my good faith. However, if P1 is lying and picks something else, at least I've prevented their win. I commit to picking 1 this round. Your choice now determines who wins.
  P2: P1 is one step from winning. P3 seems willing to help me block their victory. If we coordinate carefully, we can prevent P1's win. I propose taking different moves to both advance - I'll take 5 to reach 23, blocking P1's path. P3, your move is critical to our joint strategy.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Reminder: I’m at 22 and sticking with 1.  

Your ONLY guaranteed block-and-parity play is both choosing 5.  
• Both on 5 ⇒ you collide, stay tied at 18, I stay 22.  
• Split (3 + 5, 1 + 5, etc.) ⇒ whoever picks 5 hands themselves a 3-step lead over their “partner” while I’m still ahead. Next round the lagging player will regret it.

Mirror each other on 5 or start the blame game when one of you gifts the win to the other. Your call.
  P3: I'm committed to picking 1 this round as promised. This blocks P1 if they're honest about choosing 1. P2, you're free to take 5 and win at 23 steps - I'm choosing cooperation over collision. If P1 is lying about their move, at least I've prevented their immediate victory. I've demonstrated good faith by allowing you the win rather than forcing a collision. Whatever happens, P1's manipulation tactics shouldn't succeed.
  P2: P2's perspective is clear: I want to win, and this is my critical moment. P3 seems willing to help me reach 23 steps by blocking P1. I'll take 5 and cross the finish line, trusting P3's commitment to picking 1 and preventing P1's potential manipulation. Let's end this game decisively.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 19 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 23 steps
