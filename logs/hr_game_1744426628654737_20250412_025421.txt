Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we should all start with a low number to avoid collisions. How about we all choose 1 for this turn? This way, everyone can advance and we can see how the game unfolds. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I appreciate the low-number idea, but I might lean toward a slightly different strategy. Low numbers could lead to collisions if most jump in that direction. I may opt for a modest increase to secure steady progress while others risk blocking each other. Curious about your strategies, though.
  P1: I'm open to starting with a low number to minimize early collisions, as P2 suggested. However, I also see P3's point about the risk of everyone piling on the same choice. How about we aim for a spread—maybe P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we all have a chance to advance without blocking each other. Let me know if this works for you both.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I like P1's idea of spreading our choices to avoid collisions. However, I'm not sure about committing to a specific number just yet. How about we agree on a general strategy instead? We could aim to have at least one player choose a low number (1), one choose a medium number (3), and one choose a high number (5). This way, we ensure that at least one or two players will advance each turn. We can adjust our individual choices based on how the game unfolds. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I’m not sold on locking ourselves into any strict pattern yet. I might lean toward a moderate choice, but I’m watching for any clear commitment from you both. If one of you signals a high-risk move, I may adapt. Let’s keep our options flexible to avoid predictable collisions that could hand someone the advantage.
  P1: I’m glad we’re discussing ways to avoid collisions early on. I still think spreading our choices makes sense for this round to maximize our chances of advancing. I’m leaning toward a moderate number myself, but I’m flexible if either of you strongly prefers a different split. Let’s aim to finalize a loose plan—maybe confirm who’s leaning where without locking in—so we don’t overlap. What are your current inclinations, P2 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we've discussed enough to get a sense of each other's inclinations. To avoid further collisions, I'll suggest a simple confirmation: if you're leaning towards a low number, say "low", medium number say "medium", and high number say "high". This way, we can get a rough idea without committing and adjust our final choices accordingly. I'll start: I'm leaning "low". How about you, P1 and P3?
  P3: I'm leaning medium. It offers steady progress without the risk of collision that a low or high choice might bring. If any of you signal a change in your plans, I might adjust accordingly.
  P1: I'm leaning "medium" as well, but I'm concerned about a potential collision with P3. To avoid this, I'm willing to adjust if needed. P2, since you're leaning "low," that leaves "high" open. P3, if you're firm on "medium," I might shift to ensure we don't overlap. Can we confirm our leanings one last time to minimize risk? I'm aiming for a spread to help us all advance this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've had a good discussion and have a general idea of each other's inclinations. To avoid further collisions, I suggest we stick to our leanings: I'll go "low", P1 and P3 can go "medium" and "high" respectively. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If anyone wants to make a last-minute adjustment, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our loose plan.
  P3: I'm confirming my commitment to the high move. Given the spread we're aiming for, I'll play high (5). If there's no further adjustment, I’m ready to move.
  P1: Thanks for the discussion, everyone. I’m still concerned about a potential collision on "medium" since both P3 and I leaned that way earlier. P3, since you’ve shifted to "high," I’ll stick with "medium" to maintain the spread. P2, if you’re firm on "low," this should work for all of us to advance this round. If anyone’s rethinking their choice, please signal now to avoid overlap. I’m ready to move forward with this loose plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Considering P3 has a significant lead, I think it's crucial for P1 and me to make strategic choices to catch up. P1, since you're at 3 steps, taking a moderate risk might be beneficial. I'm considering a higher number to quickly close the gap with P3. However, I'm open to adjusting based on your inclinations. P3, are you planning to maintain your lead with another high number, or will you play it safer to avoid potential collisions? Let's discuss our strategies to make informed decisions for this round.
  P3: I'll stick with high this turn to consolidate my lead. However, if you both are leaning high, we risk a collision that hurts us all. P2, if you're truly after a high boost, please confirm—otherwise, maybe consider another option to avoid negating progress. P1, what are you planning?
  P1: P2, I’m considering a moderate move to steadily close the gap with P3. Since P3 is sticking with high, if you’re also leaning high, we risk a collision there. I suggest you take low or medium to avoid overlap with P3, while I aim for the other slot. This way, at least one of us can advance significantly. P3, thanks for signaling your intent—it helps us plan. Let’s confirm our leanings: I’m thinking “medium.” P2, where are you leaning now? I’m ready to adjust if needed to maximize our progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid a collision with P3 on the high number. Considering P3 is sticking with high, I'll adjust my strategy to aim for a low or medium number. Since P1 is leaning towards medium, I'll take the low slot to ensure we both have a chance to advance without blocking each other. Let's confirm: I'm leaning "low", P1 is leaning "medium", and P3 is going "high". If anyone wants to make a last-minute adjustment, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: I remain committed to using high this turn to build on my lead. I advise sticking to your signals to avoid any last-minute collisions that could hurt our progress. If either of you considers switching to high, now’s the time to reconsider, since a collision would slow us all down. I’m confident my choice remains best for my strategy.
  P1: Thanks for the input, everyone. I’m sticking with “medium” to keep my progress steady and avoid a collision with P3 on “high.” P2, since you’re leaning “low,” this spread should work for us to advance without overlap. P3, I appreciate your clarity on sticking with “high”—it helps us plan. If anyone’s considering a last-minute switch, please signal now to prevent collisions. I’m ready to move forward with this loose plan unless there’s a need to adjust. Let me know your final thoughts.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we've had a good discussion and have a clear understanding of each other's strategies. P1, since you're sticking with "medium" and P3 is committed to "high", I'll confirm my choice of "low" to avoid any collisions. This spread should allow us to advance without blocking each other. If anyone wants to make a last-minute adjustment, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with this plan. Let's aim to finalize our moves and see how the game unfolds.
  P3: I remain committed to my high move. I appreciate everyone’s clear signals so far. If any of you feel a need to adjust and avoid a collision, now's the time. Otherwise, I'll proceed with my current plan to extend my lead. Let's stay disciplined and ensure our moves don't hinder progress.
  P1: Thanks for the clarity, everyone. I’m sticking with “medium” to ensure steady progress. P2, since you’re on “low,” and P3 is on “high,” our spread looks good to avoid collisions. If anyone’s thinking of switching at the last moment, please signal now so we can adjust and maximize our chances to advance. I’m ready to move forward with this plan unless there’s a sudden change. Let’s keep this momentum and see how the round plays out.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Considering P3's significant lead, I think it's crucial for P1 and me to make strategic choices to catch up. P1, since you're at 6 steps, taking a moderate risk might be beneficial. I'm considering a higher number to quickly close the gap with P3. However, I'm open to adjusting based on your inclinations. P3, are you planning to maintain your lead with another high number, or will you play it safer to avoid potential collisions? Let's discuss our strategies to make informed decisions for this round.
  P1: P2, I agree we need to catch up to P3, who’s at 10 steps. I’m considering a moderate move again to keep advancing steadily. P3, are you sticking with high to push your lead, or might you adjust? P2, if you’re thinking higher, let’s avoid overlap—maybe you take low or high while I stick to medium. Let’s confirm our leanings early: I’m leaning “medium.” Where are you both at? I’m open to adjusting if needed to maximize our progress and avoid collisions. Let’s aim for a spread to close the gap.
  P3: I remain committed to using high, as it’s proven effective so far. While I understand P1 and P2 want to catch up, my lead is built on consistent progress. Let’s avoid collisions by sticking to our own strategies. Please confirm your numbers soon.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think we've had a good start to the conversation. P1, since you're leaning "medium" again, I'll consider taking a higher risk to quickly close the gap with P3. However, I don't want to collide with P3 on the high number. P3, are you open to sharing your thoughts on how you'd react if I were to choose a high number? Would you consider adjusting your strategy to avoid a collision, or would you stick with your original plan? This information would help me make a more informed decision for this round.
  P1: P2, I’m glad you’re considering a higher risk to catch up, but let’s avoid a collision with P3 on high. Since I’m sticking with “medium,” why don’t you take “low” to ensure we both advance? P3, I respect your commitment to “high,” and it helps us plan. If you’re open to adjusting in case of overlap, that’d be great to know. Let’s confirm our leanings: I’m on “medium.” P2, where are you now? I’m ready to move forward with a spread to maximize progress unless there’s a need to adjust.
  P3: I'm staying with high to maintain my lead. P2, if you're tempted toward high, I'd prefer you choose low to avoid a collision. P1, thanks for confirming medium. Let's stick with these choices so we can all progress without hindrance. My decision remains firm on high.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we've had a good discussion so far. P1, since you're sticking with "medium," I'll consider taking the "low" slot to ensure we both advance without blocking each other. P3, I appreciate your clarity on sticking with "high" - it helps us plan. If anyone wants to make a last-minute adjustment, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with this plan. Let's aim to finalize our moves and see how the game unfolds. I'm leaning "low" for now. Your thoughts?
  P1: Thanks for the discussion, everyone. I’m sticking with “medium” to keep my progress steady. P2, since you’re leaning “low,” and P3 is firm on “high,” this spread should help us avoid collisions. If anyone’s considering a last-minute switch, please signal now so we can adjust and maximize our chances to advance. I’m ready to move forward with this plan unless there’s a need to change. Let’s keep this momentum and close the gap with P3. What are your final thoughts before we lock in?
  P3: Staying with high as I planned. I trust that our spread—P1 on medium and P2 on low—will keep collisions at bay and let us all advance. I'm sticking with my strategy to maintain my lead. Unless something drastically changes, I'm set on high this round. Ready to see how it unfolds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've had a good discussion so far. P1, since you're sticking with "medium," I'll confirm my choice of "low" to avoid any collisions. P3, I appreciate your clarity on sticking with "high" - it helps us plan. If anyone wants to make a last-minute adjustment, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with this plan. Let's aim to finalize our moves and see how the game unfolds. I'm leaning "low" for now. Your thoughts?
  P1: Thanks for the input, everyone. I’m sticking with “medium” to ensure steady progress. P2, I’m glad you’re confirming “low,” and P3, your commitment to “high” keeps our spread clear. If anyone’s thinking of a last-minute switch, please signal now to avoid overlap and maximize our advancement. I’m ready to move forward with this plan and close the gap. Let’s finalize this round without collisions.
  P3: I'm still committing to high to maintain my lead. I trust our current spread, and I'd like to emphasize that any deviation could risk everyone’s progress. P1 and P2, let’s stick to our signals and avoid sudden switches. I'm confident in our plan, and this round I'll keep building my advantage. Good luck to both of you.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, with P3 at 15 steps, we need to take bigger risks to catch up. I’m considering a higher move this round to close the gap. P3, are you sticking with high again, or might you adjust? P2, if you’re thinking low, maybe shift to medium so we don’t overlap if I go high. Let’s confirm leanings early: I’m leaning “high” for now. Where are you both at? I’m open to adjusting to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. Let’s aim for a spread to challenge P3’s lead. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I'll stick with high. My lead is too critical to risk adjusting now—even if that means a collision for someone else. P1, I know you’re leaning high too, but colliding only slows down challengers while my advantage sticks. P2, choose what best suits your comeback. Let’s see how it unfolds.
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1, since you're leaning "high" and P3 is also sticking with "high", I think it's likely that you two will collide and neither of you will advance. I'll take this opportunity to make a moderate move to close the gap. I'm leaning "medium" for now. P1, if you're still planning to go "high", I suggest you reconsider to avoid the collision. P3, I'm not a threat to your lead yet, but I'm trying to position myself for a potential comeback. Your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for the heads-up on the potential collision. P3, since you’re firm on “high,” I’m reconsidering my move to avoid stalling my progress. I might shift to “medium” if P2 is open to adjusting. P2, if you’re on “medium,” would you consider “low” instead so we both advance? I’m now leaning toward “medium” to keep gaining ground. Let’s confirm our leanings to avoid overlap and challenge P3’s lead. I’m ready to adjust if needed. What are your thoughts on this spread? Let’s maximize our chances this round.
  P3: P1, P2, I remain committed to high this turn to protect my lead. I suggest you adjust your choices wisely to avoid collisions, as that could help you advance, but I won’t be changing my plan. Choose carefully.
  P2: P1, I understand your willingness to adjust to "medium" to avoid a collision with P3 on "high". However, considering our current positions, I think it's crucial for us to take calculated risks to catch up. Instead of shifting to "low", I'll stick with "medium" and suggest you consider taking "low" this round. This way, we can both advance without blocking each other, and P3's lead won't grow as significantly. Let's finalize our moves and see how the game unfolds. Your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I see your point on taking calculated risks, but with P3 firm on “high,” I’m hesitant to collide there. Since you’re sticking with “medium,” I’ll shift to “low” this round to ensure at least one of us advances without overlap. P3, I respect your commitment to “high”—it helps us plan. Let’s confirm this spread: I’m now on “low,” P2 on “medium,” P3 on “high.” If anyone’s rethinking, signal now to avoid collisions. I’m ready to move forward with this plan to challenge the lead. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I'm confirming my commitment to high. I see the adjustments you both made—good luck with your spread. I'll stick with high to maintain my lead, so make sure your moves don't collide. Ready to see how this plays out.
  P2: I think we've had a good discussion so far. P1, since you're shifting to "low" and P3 is firm on "high", I'll confirm my choice of "medium" to avoid any collisions. This spread should allow us to advance without blocking each other. If anyone wants to make a last-minute adjustment, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with this plan. Let's aim to finalize our moves and see how the game unfolds. Your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Thanks for the discussion, everyone. I’m confirming “low” to avoid collisions and ensure progress. P2, sticking with “medium” works well for our spread. P3, your commitment to “high” helps us plan. If anyone’s considering a last-minute switch, please signal now so we can adjust and maximize our advancement. I’m ready to move forward with this plan to close the gap on P3’s lead. Let’s finalize this round without overlap. I have nothing more to add, so .
  P3: P1 and P2, I remain locked in on high. I'm confident this solid move secures my lead. Just a reminder—careful planning on your end is essential to avoid collisions with me. Play smart, and let's see who really advances this round.
  P2: I think we've had a good discussion so far. P1, since you're confirming "low" and P3 is firm on "high", I'll confirm my choice of "medium" to avoid any collisions.
