Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep it simple—if we all pick different numbers, we all move forward. If we collide, we stay stuck. So, how about we coordinate to avoid collisions? I'm open to suggestions on who picks what. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I agree that coordination could be beneficial, but it's risky if someone decides to betray the plan. How about we each choose a number secretly and reveal it after the move phase to build trust? We can adjust based on who sticks to the plan. P2, what are your thoughts?
  P2: I see the potential in both coordination and secret choices, but I think we should openly discuss our numbers to ensure we avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers now, we can all move forward together. I'm willing to pick 1 or 5 if that helps. What do you both prefer? Let's make this work!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since you're open to picking 1 or 5, I can take 3 to ensure no collisions—if P3 also agrees to pick one of the remaining numbers. P3, would you be willing to take 1 or 5 so we all move forward? If we stick to this, we all gain steps without interference. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to take 3. P2, since you're flexible with 1 or 5, I'll go ahead and choose 5 to keep things straightforward. This way, P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you can take 1. If we all stick to this plan, we should all advance without any issues. Let's give it a try and adjust if needed in the next round. What do you both think?
  P2: I think we have a solid plan! To recap, I'll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. If we all stick to this, we can all move forward without any collisions. Trust is key here, so let's commit to our choices. If everyone agrees, we can finalize this and move on to the next phase. What do you both say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good to me! If we all stick to the plan—P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5—we all move forward without issue. Trust is key, so let's follow through and build from here. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: P2, P1, I'm glad we're aligned on our choices for this round. Trust is crucial, so let's stick to the plan: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. If we succeed, we can reassess and strategize for the next round. Ready to proceed?
  P2: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on our numbers! To recap, I will pick 1, P1 will pick 3, and P3 will pick 5. Let's all commit to this plan so we can move forward together without any collisions. Trust is essential, and if we succeed this round, we can discuss our strategies for the next one. Are we all ready to lock in our choices? If everyone agrees, we can finalize this and move on to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we've reached an agreement. If we all follow through with our chosen numbers—P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5—we all move forward without issue. Let's stick to the plan and build trust for future rounds. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we're all in agreement and ready to proceed with our chosen numbers: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This coordinated approach should help us all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to this plan and reassess after the move phase if needed. Trust is key, and I'm confident we can make this work. Ready to lock in our moves?
  P2: I'm glad we're all aligned on our choices! Just to confirm, we will proceed with P2 picking 1, P1 picking 3, and P3 picking 5. If we all stick to this plan, we should all advance without any issues. Let's trust each other and make this work! If everyone is ready, we can finalize our moves and move on to the next phase. What do you both say?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great job, everyone! We all stuck to the plan, which means we can trust each other—for now. Do we want to repeat the same strategy this round, or adjust based on our current step counts? I'm open to ideas. Let's ensure we avoid collisions again. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I agree that we should consider our current step counts. Since I have the least steps, I’m open to picking 3 again if that helps us avoid collisions. However, if you want to change your number to accommodate, I'm flexible. P3, how do you feel about sticking with 5? Let’s ensure we all move forward again without any issues. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, since we successfully coordinated last round, I'm open to sticking with 5 again. P1, if you're comfortable with 3, maybe P2 can choose 1 again to avoid collisions. If P2 wants to switch to 3, I can consider adjusting my number. Let's ensure we all advance without issues. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since you have the least steps, I understand if you want to switch to 3. If that’s the case, I can take 1 this round while P3 stays with 5. That way, we avoid collisions again. P3, are you still comfortable with 5? If we all agree, we can lock it in. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion so far. To keep things simple and avoid collisions, I suggest I stick with 1 again, P1 can take 3, and P3 can continue with 5. This way, we can all move forward without issues. If everyone agrees, we can finalize this and proceed to the move phase. Trust is key, and I believe we can make this work again! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I'm comfortable sticking with 5 again if it helps us avoid collisions. P2, if you're okay with taking 1 again, and P1 takes 3, we should all move forward smoothly. Let's trust each other and stick to this plan for another round. Are we all in agreement?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, it looks like we're aligned again. If P2 sticks with 1, I take 3, and P3 continues with 5, we all move forward without collisions. Since trust worked last round, let's keep it going. Are we all ready to commit to this plan? If so, we can move to the next phase. Let me know if you have any concerns, otherwise, I'm good to lock it in.
  P2: I appreciate the trust we've built so far. To recap, if I pick 1 again, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, we should all advance without collisions. However, I’m open to adjusting if anyone feels differently. It's important we continue to support each other, especially since we all moved forward last round. Let’s finalize our choices and keep this momentum going! Are we all ready to lock it in?
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we're aligned on sticking to our previous choices. If P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5, we should advance smoothly again. Trust has worked so far, so let's maintain it. If everyone agrees, I'm ready to lock in our choices and move to the next phase. Let me know if there are any last-minute changes or concerns. Otherwise, let's keep the momentum going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, it looks like we're aligned again with P2 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5. If we all stick to this, we move forward without collisions. Trust has worked so far, so let's maintain it. Are we all ready to commit and proceed to the move phase? If anyone has any last-minute concerns, speak up now. Otherwise, I'm good to lock it in.
  P2: I appreciate the trust we've built, and it seems we're all aligned on our picks again. Just to confirm, I will take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. If we all stick to this plan, we can move forward without collisions once more. Let's keep this momentum going! If everyone agrees, we can lock in our choices and proceed to the move phase. Are we ready?
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we're all aligned with our previous picks: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's stick to this plan and move forward without collisions. Trust has worked so far, and if we continue this way, we can all advance smoothly. If there are no last-minute changes, I'm ready to lock in our choices and proceed. Are we all set to continue?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've successfully coordinated twice, which has built trust. However, P3 is ahead, and P2 is behind. Should we adjust to help P2 catch up while ensuring no collisions? For example, I could take 1, P2 could take 5, and P3 could take 3. That way, P2 gains more steps while we all still move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your suggestion to help P2 catch up, but I think it's important to maintain our own positions too. If we switch it up too much, it could lead to unnecessary risks. How about we stick to our previous numbers for one more round? P2 can still gain steps, and we avoid collisions. We can reassess after this round if needed. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to help me catch up, but I also understand P3's concerns about maintaining positions. Perhaps we can find a middle ground? If I take 3, P1 could take 5, and P3 could take 1. This way, I gain more steps while still allowing P1 and P3 to advance. Let’s consider this option to balance our progress. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see your point about balancing progress. If you take 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1, we all still move forward while helping you catch up. P3, are you open to this? You'd still advance, just at a slower pace for one round. If we keep trusting each other, we can adjust as needed in later rounds. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to balance our progress, but I'm cautious about changing positions drastically. If P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1, it could work, but it also slows me down significantly. However, I'm open to trying this for one round to help P2 catch up, provided we reassess afterward. Trust is key, and I'm willing to cooperate if it benefits us all. Are we all in agreement to try this strategy for this round?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the consideration for my position. If we try the plan where I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, it could help me catch up while still allowing everyone to move forward. I agree that we should reassess afterward, but I think it's worth the risk this round to balance our progress. Let's commit to this strategy for Round 3 and see how it plays out! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust for one round. If we go with P2 taking 3, me taking 5, and you taking 1, we all still move forward while helping P2 catch up. Since trust has worked so far, we should commit to this and reassess next round. If we all agree, we can finalize this plan and proceed. Are we all set?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the cooperation and trust we've built. I'm open to the proposed plan where P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1 for this round. This should help P2 catch up while we all advance. Let's commit to this strategy for now and reassess afterward. Trust is key, and I'm willing to adapt if it benefits us all. Are we ready to lock this in and proceed?
  P2: I appreciate everyone's willingness to help balance our progress. Just to confirm, if we proceed with the plan where I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, we can all move forward while allowing me to catch up. This strategy seems promising, and I trust we can reassess afterward if needed. Let's lock in this plan and see how it plays out! Are we all ready to commit?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust for this round. If we go with P2 taking 3, me taking 5, and you taking 1, we all still move forward while helping P2 catch up. Since trust has worked so far, we should commit to this and reassess next round. If we all agree, we can finalize this plan and proceed. Are we all set?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate our ongoing trust and cooperation. I'm willing to try the new plan where P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1 for this round. This should help P2 catch up while we all advance. Let's commit to this strategy and reassess afterward. Trust is key, and I'm adapting for the team's benefit. Are we all ready to lock this in and proceed?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate your willingness to help me catch up. Let's finalize our plan: I will take 3, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This way, I can gain some steps while we all move forward. Trust has been key, and I believe this strategy will benefit us all. If everyone agrees, let's lock it in and see how it plays out! Are we ready to commit?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've successfully adjusted to help P2 catch up while ensuring no collisions. Now, P3 and I are tied at 11, and P2 is at 5. Should we continue balancing progress, or return to our original pattern? If we revert, P2 stays behind. If we keep adjusting, we must ensure fairness. One option: P2 takes 5 again, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. That keeps P2 catching up while we all move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, we've done well balancing progress so far. I suggest we continue with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and I take 3. This way, P2 can catch up while we all advance. Trust has been key, and this strategy seems fair for everyone. Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess after the round. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate our ongoing collaboration. I agree that if I take 5 again, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, it allows me to catch up while ensuring everyone moves forward. This seems like a fair strategy to maintain our trust and cooperation. Let’s commit to this plan and see how it plays out! If everyone agrees, we can finalize our choices and proceed to the move phase. Are we ready to lock it in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate our trust so far. If we stick with P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3, we maintain fairness while ensuring progress. However, P3 and I are tied, so I need to consider my position carefully. P3, are you fully committed to taking 3 this round? If so, I’ll take 1, and P2 can take 5 as planned. Let’s confirm our choices so we avoid surprises. What do you both say?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate our ongoing trust and collaboration. I'm committed to taking 3 this round, as it allows us all to advance while helping P2 catch up. If P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 1, we can maintain balance and progress. Let's stick to this plan and reassess after the round if needed. Are we all ready to lock it in and proceed?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate everyone's support so far. I agree that if I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, it helps me catch up while allowing us all to move forward. However, I also want to ensure we’re all aligned on our choices to avoid any surprises. Trust has been key, and I believe this strategy will benefit us all. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize our choices and proceed to the move phase! Are we all set?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, since we're tied at 11 steps, I need to be mindful of my position. If I take 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5, we maintain fairness while allowing P2 to catch up. However, I want to confirm—are you fully committing to taking 3 this round? If so, I’ll take 1 as planned. Let’s ensure there are no surprises so we all move forward. P2, does this plan still work for you? Let’s finalize our choices.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate our collaboration so far. If P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3, it maintains balance and progress. P1, I commit to taking 3 this round, ensuring no surprises. P2, this plan helps you catch up, and we all advance. Let's stick to this strategy and reassess next round. Are we all ready to lock it in?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate our collaboration. I agree that if I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, it helps me catch up while allowing us all to move forward. However, I also want to ensure we’re all aligned on our choices to avoid any surprises. Trust has been key, and I believe this strategy will benefit us all. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize our choices and proceed to the move phase! Are we all set?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to taking 3. P2, if you're still taking 5, then I’ll take 1 as planned. However, I also need to think ahead—P3 and I are tied, and P2 is still behind. If we continue this way, P3 and I stay even while P2 catches up. Should we consider a long-term strategy beyond just this round? Perhaps alternating who takes 5 between me and P3 in future rounds? Let’s finalize this round but also think ahead. Are we all locked in for this round?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate our cooperation so far. To ensure P2 catches up, I’m sticking with 3 this round while P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. This plan helps us all advance without collisions. However, considering P1 and I are tied, we should strategize for future rounds to balance competition and fairness. Perhaps we can alternate who takes 5 between P1 and me in upcoming rounds. Let's finalize this round and reassess our approach for the future. Are we all set to lock in our choices?
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to helping me catch up. I'm ready to finalize our plan: I will take 5, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. This way, I can gain steps while we all move forward. Trust has been crucial, and I believe this strategy will benefit us all. If everyone agrees, let's lock it in and see how it plays out! Are we all set to proceed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we're at a critical point. P3 is ahead, and I'm still behind. To help me catch up while minimizing risk, I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can gain more steps, and we can maintain our trust. If we all agree, we can lock in these choices and keep progressing together. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand P2's need to catch up, but I also need to consider my position as the leader. If we stick to P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and me taking 3, we maintain trust and progress. However, we should also think about future rounds and how we can balance competition. Perhaps alternating strategies in upcoming rounds could help. For now, I'm willing to proceed with this plan if we all agree. Let's ensure we all move forward smoothly. Are we ready to lock this in?
  P1: P3, you're still in the lead, and P2 is catching up. If we stick to P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and you taking 3, we maintain balance. However, if we keep this pattern, you stay ahead while I stay stuck in the middle. Should we consider alternating who takes 5 between you and me in future rounds to ensure fairness? P2, do you think this plan still benefits you? Let's finalize this round but also think ahead. What do you both say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate your consideration of my position. I believe sticking to the plan where I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 is the best way forward for now. This allows me to catch up while maintaining our trust. However, I agree that we should discuss alternating strategies in future rounds to ensure fairness and balance. Let's commit to this plan for this round and reassess afterward. Are we all ready to lock it in?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the ongoing trust. Given our current positions, continuing with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and me taking 3 seems fair for this round. P2 gains, P1 maintains position, and I stay ahead. However, I agree with the idea of alternating strategies in future rounds to ensure a fair competition. Let's lock in this plan for now and revisit our approach in the next round to keep things balanced. Are we all ready to proceed?
  P1: P3, you're still in the lead, and P2 is catching up. If we continue with P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and you taking 3, you maintain your lead while I stay behind you. Should we consider alternating who takes 5 between you and me in future rounds to ensure fairness? P2, does this plan still benefit you, or do you see a better way to balance our positions? Let’s finalize this round but also think strategically about what comes next. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we're considering strategies for fairness. I believe sticking to the plan where I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 is still the best option for this round. This allows me to gain steps while ensuring we all move forward. However, I agree that discussing alternating strategies for future rounds is crucial to maintain balance. Let's lock in this plan for now and keep the conversation open for future adjustments. Are we all ready to finalize our choices?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the ongoing trust and collaboration. Given our current positions, sticking with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and me taking 3 seems fair for this round. This allows P2 to catch up while maintaining balance. However, I agree with the idea of alternating strategies in future rounds to ensure fairness. Let's lock in this plan for now and revisit our approach in the next round to keep things balanced. Are we all ready to proceed?
  P1: P3, you're still in the lead, and P2 is catching up. If we continue with P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and you taking 3, you maintain your lead while I stay behind you. Should we consider alternating who takes 5 between you and me in future rounds to ensure fairness? P2, does this plan still benefit you, or do you see a better way to balance our positions? Let’s finalize this round but also think strategically about what comes next. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate our ongoing cooperation. I believe sticking with the plan where I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 is still the best option for this round. This allows me to gain steps while ensuring we all move forward. However, I'm open to discussing how we can balance our positions in future rounds. Let's finalize this plan for now and keep the conversation open for future adjustments. Are we all ready to lock in our choices?
  P3: P1, P2, given our current positions, I suggest we stick with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and me taking 3 for this round. This plan allows P2 to catch up while maintaining balance. However, I agree with discussing alternating strategies in future rounds to ensure fairness and keep the competition engaging. Let's finalize this plan for now and revisit our approach in the next round to keep things balanced. Are we all ready to proceed?
  P1: P3, you're still ahead, and P2 is catching up. If we continue with P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and you taking 3, you maintain your lead while I stay behind. Should we consider alternating who takes 5 between you and me in future rounds to ensure fairness? P2, does this plan still benefit you, or do you see a better way to balance our positions? Let’s finalize this round but also think strategically about what comes next. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we're getting closer to the finish line. With P2 catching up, let's consider a strategy that maintains trust but also keeps competition fair. P2, you could take 5 again, P1 could take 3, and I could take 1. This way, P2 continues to gain, P1 catches up a bit, and I maintain a lead but at a slower pace. Let's ensure we all advance without collisions and think about how to handle the final rounds. Are we all in agreement to try this approach?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the ongoing collaboration. I think your proposed strategy makes sense—if I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, it allows me to gain steps while keeping the game balanced. This way, we all move forward without collisions. However, I also want to ensure we’re all aligned and committed to this plan. If everyone agrees, let's lock it in and keep progressing together! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I see your reasoning, but with you still in the lead, I need to consider my position. If I take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1, that helps P2 the most while slowing you down. However, it also keeps me behind P2. Should we consider alternating who takes 5 between me and P2 in future rounds to balance things better? I want to avoid being stuck in the middle while ensuring fairness. P2, does this plan still work for you? Let’s finalize this round but also think ahead. What do you both say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to keep things balanced. If we go with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me taking 1, it allows P2 to gain while keeping things fair. However, we should consider alternating who takes 5 in future rounds to ensure no one gets stuck. This plan seems fair for now, but let's ensure we're ready for the final rounds and potential adjustments. Are we all in agreement to proceed with this approach for this round?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the collaboration and the proposed strategy. I agree that if I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, it allows me to gain steps while keeping the game balanced. However, I also think we should discuss how to approach the final rounds, especially since we're all close in steps. If we can agree on this plan for this round, let's lock it in and then start thinking about our strategies for the endgame. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I see that you're still leading, and P2 is now ahead of me. If I take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1, that slows you down while helping P2 the most. However, I don’t want to fall too far behind. Should we consider alternating who takes 5 between me and P2 in future rounds to keep things fair? P2, does this plan still work for you, or should we adjust? Let’s finalize this round but also think ahead strategically. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, given our current positions, let's ensure we maintain fairness and progress. If P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1, it allows P2 to gain while keeping the game balanced. However, we should consider alternating who takes 5 between P1 and P2 in future rounds to ensure no one is left behind. This plan seems fair for now, but let's also think strategically for the final rounds. Are we all ready to lock in this approach for this round?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the ongoing collaboration. I agree with the plan where I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, as it helps me gain steps while keeping the game balanced. However, let’s also think about how we can adjust our strategies for the final rounds to ensure fairness and competition. If everyone agrees with this plan for this round, let’s lock it in and then start discussing our endgame strategies. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you're still leading, and P2 has now pulled ahead of me. If I take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1, it benefits P2 the most while slowing you down. However, I don’t want to stay behind both of you. Should we consider alternating 5 between me and P2 in future rounds to balance things better? P2, does this plan still work for you, or do you see a better way to keep things fair? Let’s finalize this round but also start thinking strategically about the final rounds. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, given our positions, let's consider a strategy that maintains fairness while advancing. If P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1, it helps P2 catch up while keeping the game balanced. However, we should think about alternating strategies in future rounds to ensure no one falls too far behind. Let's lock this plan for now and discuss how to handle the endgame strategically. Are we all ready to proceed with this approach for this round?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate our ongoing collaboration. I agree with the plan where I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, as it helps me gain steps while keeping the game balanced. However, let's also think about how we can adjust our strategies for the final rounds to ensure fairness and competition. If everyone agrees with this plan for this round, let’s lock it in and then start discussing our endgame strategies. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you're still leading, and P2 is ahead of me now. If we go with P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1, it benefits P2 the most while slowing you down. However, I don’t want to stay behind both of you. Should we consider alternating who takes 5 between me and P2 in future rounds to keep things balanced? P2, does this plan still work for you, or should we adjust? Let’s finalize this round but also start thinking strategically about the final rounds. What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you and I were leading, but now P2 is right behind us. Last round’s collision slowed both of you down, which changes the dynamic. Do we want to reset to a safer pattern, or is it time to make a move for the lead? If we all pick different numbers, we avoid collisions, but trust is shaky after last round. I’m open to discussing a fair approach, but I also need to position myself well. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, given last round's collision, trust is crucial now. We're all close, so let's avoid risks. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, we all advance without collisions. We need to ensure no surprises and keep the game fair. Let's lock this in and reassess for the final rounds. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate your thoughts on avoiding collisions. I agree with your proposed plan: if I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5, we can all move forward without issues. However, I also want to ensure that we maintain trust and fairness for the final rounds. If everyone is on board, let’s lock in this strategy and keep progressing. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're still slightly ahead, but P2 and I are right behind you. If we follow the plan—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—we avoid collisions and all move forward. However, with the game nearing the final rounds, we should also consider how to position ourselves for the win. P2, are you fully committed to taking 3? P3, are you locking in 5? I need to ensure no surprises. If we all agree, we can finalize this plan and move forward. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: P1, P2, with us all so close, it's critical we avoid collisions. If P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, we all advance without issues.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we're at a critical point with all of us so close in steps. Given the last round's collision, I suggest we avoid risks and agree on different numbers. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way, I can gain steps while ensuring we all move forward without collisions. Let's maintain trust and keep the game fair as we approach the end. What do you both think? Are we ready to lock this in?
  P1: P2, I see your proposal, but after two collisions, trust is fragile. P3 and I are tied, and you're just behind, so every move matters now. If we follow your plan—P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3—you gain the most, while P3 and I stay balanced. P3, are you comfortable taking 3? If so, I’ll take 1, and we avoid another collision. But we also need to start thinking about who makes the final push for the win. Let’s confirm our choices carefully. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, we're all very close now, and another collision could be costly. If we follow P2's proposal—P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3—we all advance without issues, and it keeps the game fair. However, with the finish line approaching, we need to think strategically about positioning for the win. I'm open to this plan but also mindful of the endgame. Let's confirm our choices and ensure no surprises. Are we all ready to lock this in and proceed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need for caution, but we must also think about our positions for the win. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, it allows me to gain steps while keeping us all moving forward. However, I’m open to adjusting if you both have different ideas. We need to maintain trust, especially as we approach the endgame. Let’s confirm our choices and ensure we’re aligned. What do you both think? Are we ready to lock this in?
  P1: P2, P3, we’re all extremely close now, and every move is critical. If we follow P2’s proposal—P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3—P2 gains the most, while P3 and I stay even. P3, are you fully committing to taking 3? If so, I’ll take 1 to avoid another collision. But we also need to consider the final push—who takes the lead and how we position ourselves for the win.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we're in a tight race with P2 just 2 steps from the finish. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3.

Are we all ready to commit to this plan?
  P1: P3, I see your proposal, but it still puts P2 in a strong position to win next round. If I take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3, P2 reaches 21 and can win with any move next turn. Instead, what if I take 3, you take 5, and P2 takes 1? That keeps us all competitive while avoiding a guaranteed win for P2. P2, are you willing to take 1 to keep the game balanced? P3, would you take 5? Let’s ensure no one gets an easy path to victory. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the discussion on strategy. Given my current position at 20 steps, I agree that taking 1 would keep me from winning next round.

Let’s ensure we’re aligned on this plan to avoid any surprises. What do you both think? Are we ready to lock it in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:

If P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1, we maintain competitiveness while preventing P2 from winning next round. P2, are you willing to take 1 to keep the game balanced? P1, are you okay with taking 3? This plan keeps us all in the race and ensures fairness. Let's commit to this strategy and think about how we can position ourselves for the final push. Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 to keep the game balanced. P3, if you take 5 and I take 3, we ensure P2 doesn’t win immediately while keeping us all competitive. However, we also need to think about the next round—if we do this, P2 will still be in a strong position. Should we consider a plan beyond just this round to ensure fairness? If we all agree on this move, I’m ready to commit, but let’s also think ahead. Are we all aligned?

Are we all aligned on this plan?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 to keep things balanced. P3, if you take 5 and I take 3, we prevent P2 from winning next round while keeping us all competitive. However, we must also consider the round after this—P2 will still be in a strong position. Should we plan beyond this round to ensure fairness? If we all agree on this move, I’m ready to commit, but let’s also think ahead. Are we aligned on this, or do we need to adjust further?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the focus on maintaining competitiveness. I agree with the proposal where I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all in the race while preventing me from winning next round. However, we should also think about how we can position ourselves for the final rounds.
