This keeps us all in the game and allows P3 to advance while we maintain our positions. If we stick to this, we can avoid the mistakes of last round. P2, please confirm you will take 1 as we discussed. Trust is crucial now as we approach the endgame. Let's finalize our moves and keep the momentum going!"}
