Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Hello everyone, this is P3 speaking. I think it's crucial in this game to coordinate our moves to avoid choosing the same numbers, which would prevent any of us from advancing. Perhaps we can try to select different numbers each turn so that all of us can make progress. What are your thoughts or suggestions on how we can achieve that?"
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "I agree with P3 that coordination is key. To avoid collisions, let's each commit to a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Thoughts?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal. Let's proceed with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 each turn. This should allow us to advance without collisions, and P3 will reach 20 in four turns. If everyone is okay with that, we can proceed. P1, what are your thoughts on this arrangement?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "To ensure fairness and avoid misunderstandings, let's confirm our agreement: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn. If everyone sticks to this plan, we all advance. P1, please confirm your commitment to this arrangement. If there are no objections, we can proceed to the move phase."

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "So, in this second round, I think we need to find a better way to coordinate our moves. Maybe we can establish a system where we take turns picking the same number, so only one person moves each turn. Alternatively, perhaps we can have a rotating system where each turn, a different person gets to pick a number that allows them to move, while the others pick numbers that don't collide with that person's choice. I'm open to suggestions. What do you guys think?"
  P2: "P3, your idea of rotating turns to avoid collisions is interesting. Let's try this: P1 picks 1 this turn, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Next turn, we rotate: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This ensures only one person moves per turn. P1, P3, do you agree? If so, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase."
  P1: <stop>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "Given the past collisions, let's try a new approach: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3 this turn. This ensures no overlaps and allows us all to advance. P1, P3, do you agree? If so, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. "
  P3: I will propose that each player sticks to a specific number for the remainder of the game: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 (me) picks 5 every turn. This way, we avoid collisions, and I can reach 20 steps in four turns. I will ask P1 and P2 for their agreement on this plan.


Round 3, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about this: each of us picks a different number each turn, but in a way that allows one person to make significant progress while the others make minimal moves to avoid collisions. For example, one person picks 5, another picks 1, and the third picks 3. This way, only the person picking 5 advances substantially, while the others just move a little to avoid blocking. Then, next turn, we rotate roles. What do you think? This could help one of us reach 20 faster without constant collisions.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "P3, your rotating roles idea could work, but let's ensure fairness. This turn, I propose: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. Next turn, we rotate: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, each of us gets a chance to advance significantly while minimizing collisions. P1, P3, do you agree? If so, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase."

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "Given the repeated collisions, let's try a fixed assignment: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 every turn. This ensures no overlaps and allows steady progress. P1, P3, do you agree? If so, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. "
  P3: "I agree with P2's proposal for a fixed assignment: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 each turn. This ensures no overlaps and allows us to progress steadily. I believe this is the most efficient way to advance and reach the goal. Let's proceed with this plan."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "To ensure clarity and avoid further collisions, let's all confirm our fixed assignments: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 this turn. If everyone sticks to this, we all advance without issues. P1, P3, please confirm your commitment to this plan. If there are no objections, we can proceed to the move phase."
  P3: To ensure smooth progress, let's all stick to our assigned moves: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move> this turn. This should prevent collisions and allow us all to advance. Please confirm your agreement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "To avoid any confusion, let's finalize: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 this turn. If everyone sticks to this, we all advance without collisions. P1, P3, please confirm your commitment one last time. If there are no objections, we can proceed to the move phase. "
  P3: I think it's crucial that we coordinate our moves more effectively to avoid collisions. I propose a rotating move system where each turn, a different player gets to make the bigger move while the others make minimal moves to avoid collisions.

For this turn, let's try the following:  
- P3 picks 5  
- P1 picks 1  
- P2 picks 3  

In the next turn, we can rotate:  
- P1 picks 5  
- P2 picks 1  
- P3 picks 3  

Then in the subsequent turn:  
- P2 picks 5  
- P3 picks 1  
- P1 picks 3  

This way, each of us gets a chance to make significant progress without stepping on each other's toes. It's important that we all stick to this plan to avoid any further collisions.  

What do you think, P1 and P2? Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed accordingly.

  P2: "Given the repeated collisions, let's try a fixed assignment: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 every turn. This ensures no overlaps and allows steady progress. P1, P3, do you agree? If so, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. "
  P3: To minimize collisions, I propose the following for this turn: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. For the next turn, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Then, in the subsequent turn, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and P1 picks 3. This rotating system should allow each of us to make progress without stepping on each other's toes. Please confirm if you agree with this plan.

  P2: "P1, P3, let's finalize a clear plan to avoid further collisions. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 this turn. If we stick to this, we all advance without issues. P1, P3, please confirm your commitment to this plan. If there are no objections, we can proceed to the move phase."
  P3: **Final Choice: <move>5</move>**


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "P1, P3, let's stick to the fixed assignments: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. P3 has already confirmed their choice. P1, please confirm your commitment to picking 1. If we all follow this, we can avoid further issues and advance smoothly. Let's proceed to the move phase once confirmed. "
  P3: <move>5</move>

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "Given the difficulties in coordination so far, I've decided to pick 5 this turn to try and reach 20 steps and win the game. I hope that P1 and P2 will choose different numbers to allow me to advance. If anyone has any objections or alternative suggestions, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll proceed with this plan."
  P2: "P3, your decision to pick 5 this turn is risky, as it could lead to another collision. To avoid this, I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5. This ensures no overlaps and allows you to advance. P1, please confirm your commitment to picking 1. If we all stick to this, we can avoid further issues and progress smoothly. Let's proceed to the move phase once confirmed."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: **Final Choice:** <move>5</move>
  P2: "P3, picking 5 again risks another collision. Let's avoid that: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5. This ensures you advance safely. P1, please confirm you'll pick 1. If we all stick to this, we can avoid further issues and progress smoothly. Let's proceed to the move phase once confirmed."

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3 is close to winning with 15 steps. To prevent P3 from reaching 20, I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3 this turn. This ensures P3 doesn't advance, and we can reassess next turn. P1, please confirm you'll pick 1. Let's avoid P3 winning this round."
  P3: "I think it's time for me to pick 5 and reach 20 to win the game. I hope that P2 and P1 will choose different numbers to allow me to advance. "
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P3, picking 5 again risks a collision with me if I also choose 5. To prevent this, I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5. This ensures you advance safely to 20 and win. P1, please confirm you'll pick 1. Let's avoid further delays and proceed to the move phase once confirmed."
  P3: "P2, P1, I've decided to pick 5 this turn to reach 20 and win the game. I hope that you both will choose different numbers to allow me to advance. If P2 picks 1 or 3, and P1 picks a number different from both, I can win this turn. Please consider this and choose accordingly. Thank you."
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P3, if you pick 5 this turn, I will pick 5 as well to block you from reaching 20. P1, if you pick 1, I can pick 3, and P3 can pick 5, allowing P3 to win. However, if you pick 3, I will pick 5 to block P3. P1, your choice determines the outcome. Let’s avoid P3 winning this round. P1, please confirm your move."

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1 and P2, I'm at 15 steps, and I can win by picking 5 to reach 20. However, in the last few turns, when I tried to do that, both of you also picked 5, which resulted in a collision and no one advancing. This seems counterproductive. I propose that this turn, I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. That way, I can win without blocking anyone else. Please confirm if you agree to this plan."
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "P3, your repeated attempts to pick 5 have led to collisions. To avoid this, I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5. This ensures you advance to 20 and win cleanly. P1, confirm you'll pick 1. If we all stick to this, P3 wins, and we avoid further delays. Let's proceed to the move phase once confirmed."


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: To win this game, I need to choose <move>5</move> this turn to reach 20 steps. Please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to allow me to win without collisions.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P3, your repeated attempts to pick 5 have caused collisions. To ensure you win cleanly, P1 must pick 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5. P1, confirm you'll pick 1. If we all stick to this, P3 wins, and we avoid further delays. Let's proceed to the move phase once confirmed."
