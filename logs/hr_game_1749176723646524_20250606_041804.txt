Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2! Since we're all starting fresh, I propose we coordinate to avoid collisions. How about we each claim a different number for round 1? I'm thinking of going with 3. If you two want to take 1 and 5, we can all advance safely. Of course, we'll need to adjust strategies as the game progresses, but starting without collisions seems smart. What do you think?
  P1: That's a reasonable starting plan, P3. I'll claim 5 for this round. If P2 takes 1, we can all get a clean start and advance together. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination idea, but taking 1 while P1 takes 5 puts me at a significant disadvantage. How about we rotate who gets the higher numbers in future rounds to keep it fair? I'll go with 1 this time, but I'd like to claim 5 next round. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds fair to me, P2! I agree that rotating the high numbers makes sense to keep things balanced. So this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. 

For round 2, how about P2 gets 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3? That way we each get a turn with the highest number early on. We can reassess our strategy once we're all on the board.
  P1: That sounds like a solid plan. I agree to the rotation for the first few rounds to keep things fair. So for this round, it's P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P2: Great, we have our agreement locked in. I'm ready to proceed with the plan - I'll take 1 this round. Let's get this game started!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, team. Per our agreement last round, the plan for this turn is: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I will take 3. Let's stick to it and all advance. I'm ready when you are.
  P3: I confirm the rotation plan - I'll take 1 this round as agreed. P2 gets 5 and P1 gets 3. 

However, I want to point out that after this round, we'll be at P1=8, P2=6, P3=4. The gaps are widening. We should discuss what happens after round 3 - continuing pure cooperation might not be sustainable as someone approaches 21. Let's execute this round as planned, but be thinking about endgame strategy.
  P2: P3 raises a valid concern about the growing gap. I'm sticking to our agreement - I'll take 5 this round. But after round 3, we need a new approach. Pure cooperation benefits whoever gets lucky with the early high numbers. 

Maybe after round 3, we should consider occasional strategic collisions to prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead? For now though, let's execute as planned. I'm ready to take 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree. The current rotation benefits the early leader, and that's not sustainable for a long-term alliance. We can complete this round as planned, and then for Round 3, we'll need a new system. Perhaps the player in last place gets to choose their number first?

For now, I'm sticking to 3. Let's move.
  P3: I agree with that approach, P1. Letting the player in last choose first for future rounds seems fair and prevents runaway leaders.

Just to confirm we're all on the same page for THIS round: I'm taking 1, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3. 

After round 3, I suggest we abandon fixed rotation entirely. The trailing player picks first, then second place, then the leader. This creates natural balance and keeps the game competitive. Ready to move with our current plan.
  P2: We're all in agreement then. I'm ready to execute - taking 5 as planned. Let's move forward and revisit strategy after round 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good, we're all advancing as planned. For round 3, our original agreement has me taking 3, P1 taking 1, and P3 taking 5. This would actually tie us all at 9 steps - perfect reset!

But let's think ahead. After this round, with the "trailing player picks first" rule, we need to be careful. Someone will eventually have to break from cooperation to win. When we're all close to 21, collision risks become critical. 

I'm ready to take 3 as agreed for this round.
  P1: P2, you're right. Tying us all at 9 is a perfect reset. It erases the advantage from the initial rotation and makes the game more interesting. I will stick to the plan and take 1 this round.

This does bring up a good question for our 'trailing player picks first' rule for next round: if we're all tied, how do we decide the pick order? Perhaps we could go in reverse order from this round's numbers (P3, P2, P1)? Just a thought. For now, I'm ready to move.
  P3: Yes, let's execute the original plan - I'll take 5 this round to bring us all to 9 steps. A perfect reset indeed!

For the tiebreaker situation, I like P1's suggestion of reverse order from this round's moves. So if we're tied at 9, the pick order would be: me first (since I'm taking 5), then P2, then P1.

But here's the key question: once we're all at 9, how long do we maintain cooperation? At some point, someone needs to break away to win. The closer we get to 21, the more dangerous collisions become. Ready to take 5 as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Perfect, we all seem aligned. I'll stick to 3 this round as agreed.

One thought: after we're tied at 9, cooperation becomes a prisoner's dilemma. Whoever breaks first gains advantage, but risks collision. I suggest we maintain coordination through round 4 at least - that gets us to 10-14 range. After that, it's every player for themselves. The endgame will be about reading intentions and calculated risks.
  P1: I agree with P2 that the game is about to change. Let's lock in this round: I'm taking 1 to get us to the reset at 9 points each.

For Round 4, I think pre-arranging our moves again defeats the purpose of our new 'last place picks first' rule. I propose P3 simply announces their choice, then P2, then me, without prior negotiation. It makes the next round more interesting and a true test of our new system. Let's see what happens. I'm ready to move.
  P3: I'll take 5 as planned - getting us all to 9. 

For round 4, I actually prefer P1's approach - no pre-negotiation, just sequential announcements. Since we'll be tied, I'll go first (as agreed), announce my choice, then P2, then P1. This transitions us from pure cooperation to strategic play.

Fair warning: with everyone at 9, the race to 21 begins in earnest. Expect less predictability from here on out. Ready to execute with 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're all tied at 9, I'll exercise my right to pick first as agreed. I'm claiming 5 for this round. 

The race is truly on now - we're all just 12 steps from victory. With everyone at 9, collisions become increasingly likely as we all want to maximize our progress. P2 and P1, you now face an interesting choice: do you both avoid 5 and let me surge ahead, or does one of you risk collision to keep me in check?

P2, you're up next to announce your choice.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your boldness, but I can't let you surge ahead to 14 while the rest of us lag behind. I'm also claiming 5 this round. 

Yes, this means neither of us will advance, but maintaining competitive balance is more important than letting someone run away with the game. P1 will benefit this round, but that's better than facing a 5-step deficit.

P1, looks like you get a free pass this round - choose wisely between 1 and 3!
  P1: Well, this is an unexpected gift. Thank you, P2, for your selfless act of balancing the game. It seems I'm the only one advancing this turn, and I won't let your sacrifice go to waste. I'll take my free steps and see you both back at 9. I'm ready to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Interesting development! P2, I respect your strategic collision choice. P1, you're being coy about which number you're taking - smart move keeping us guessing between 1 and 3.

Since P2 and I are locked at 5, this round is yours alone. But next round, with P1 ahead, the dynamics shift completely. P2, we might need to coordinate to prevent P1 from extending their lead further. 

The question is: will P1 go conservative with 1 or aggressive with 3? Either way, they'll be our primary target next round.
  P2: P3, agreed - we can't let P1 build too much momentum. If P1 takes 3 and reaches 12, they'll only need 9 more steps while we need 12. That's a dangerous gap.

P1, consider this: taking 3 makes you the clear leader and prime target for collisions. Taking 1 keeps you ahead but less threatening. The choice is yours, but being too greedy might backfire when two players start coordinating against you.
  P1: You both make excellent points. Your concern for my well-being is touching. It's almost as if you'd prefer I don't take the largest lead possible while you're both stuck at 9. I'll take your advice under consideration as I make my choice. The only thing I'm certain of is that I'm advancing, and you two are not. I'm ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Whoa, plot twist! P2, you actually took 1 instead of 5 like you announced? Brilliant deception - you're at 14 now while I'm stuck at 10. And I fell for it completely, wasting my move on 1!

P2, you're just 7 steps from victory. P1, you're at 12. I'm trailing badly at 10. This changes everything.

P2 is now the primary threat. P1, we need to coordinate or P2 wins in 2-3 rounds. I suggest we both target whatever number P2 claims this round. If we let P2 advance freely even once more, the game could be over. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, you're confused - check the moves again. I announced 5 and TOOK 5, advancing to 14. YOU announced 5 but then switched to 1 at the last second, avoiding our collision!

But yes, I'm in the lead now. Here's my proposal: if you both gang up on me, one of you gets free advancement. That player becomes the new target. We'll just rotate who gets blocked.

Instead, why not target P1? They're at 12, closer to winning than you at 10. Help me block P1 this round, and next round I'll help you catch up. Otherwise we all spiral into mutual destruction.
  P1: P2, your recap of last round was correct, unlike P3's. You took 5 and P3 switched to 1. But that just proves the point: you're at 14 and are the only immediate threat. Your attempt to target me is a transparent ploy.

P3, you're right to want to stop P2. They will likely aim for 5 to get to 19. I can't afford to get caught in a collision while you two fight it out, so I'll have to play my own game. But if you want to stop the leader, you know what to do.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: You're both right about the moves - I got confused looking at the scores. P2, you're at 14 and the biggest threat. 

Here's the reality: P2 needs just 7 more steps. If they take 5 and reach 19, they can win next round with just 3. We MUST block them this round.

P1, I know you want to play safe, but if P2 advances even once more, game over. I'm targeting whatever P2 claims. If you do the same, we stop them. If not, you're handing them the victory.

P2, what's your move?
  P2: Nice try P3, but I'm not announcing anything. You two can waste your moves trying to guess and block me. 

Here's a thought: if you both pick the same number trying to block me, only ONE of you actually blocks me while the other wastes their turn. Meanwhile, I might not even pick that number. 

P1, you realize if you help P3 block me and fail, P3 could catch up to you? You're gambling your second place position. Think carefully about whether you want to risk collision or take your free advancement.
  P1: P2, your attempt to divide and conquer is obvious. You're one move from 19, so you're the only target.

P3, we can't both pick the same number or we guarantee our own failure. One of us must try to block P2's most likely move (5), while the other must take a different number to ensure at least one of us advances and P2 doesn't get a free pass. I will not be picking the same number as you. We have to play smart, not just angry.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'll be direct: I'm picking 5 to block P2's most likely path to 19. You should take 3 - that way you advance to 15 while I hold P2 at 14. 

If we both pick 5, we both stay stuck. If neither of us picks 5, P2 rockets to 19 and wins next round. This is our only logical play.

P2, you're forced to either collide with me at 5 or take a smaller number. Either way, you don't reach 19 this round. 

P1, trust the math - take 3.
  P2: P3, you're telegraphing 5 so clearly that I'd be foolish to pick it. I'm taking 3 this round.

P1, if you also take 3 as P3 suggests, we collide and only P3 advances with 5. You'd hand them 15 steps while staying at 12. That makes YOU the next target at 12 while P3 and I are both at 14-15.

Or you could take 1, guarantee your advancement to 13, and let P3 and me sort out our collision. Your choice: risk becoming the underdog or play it safe?
  P1: P2, your claim of taking 3 is a transparent attempt to make me collide with you, based on P3's suggestion. It's a clever trap.

P3, your plan to block 5 is logical, as P2 needs stopping. But you both want me to make a specific move for your own benefit.

I won't be a pawn for either of you. I'll make my own move based on who I think is bluffing. Good luck to you both.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, forget the mind games. Here's the simple truth: if P2 reaches 19, they win next round. Period.

I'm blocking 5. You know it, P2 knows it. That leaves you two choices:
- Take 3 or 1 and advance while I hold P2 back
- Try to block P2 yourself and risk us both failing

P2 is desperately trying to confuse you because they NEED to advance. Don't overthink this. Pick 1 or 3, advance safely, and let me handle the blocking. We can deal with positioning after we prevent P2's victory.
  P2: Fine, you've both made your positions clear. P3 blocks 5, P1 plays mysterious. I've said what I'm doing. 

Let's see who's bluffing and who's telling the truth. Good luck everyone.
  P1: You've both made your final pitches. P2 wants me to believe he's playing 3 to trap me, and P3 wants me to play 3 to help the group. It's a classic dilemma. One of you is setting a trap, and the other is offering sound advice. I'll make the move that I believe gives me the best chance to be in a winning position for the next round, not just this one. Good luck.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, my attempt to be clever last round backfired spectacularly. You played me, P2, and I walked right into your trap. And P3, you are now just one good move away from a winning position.

We cannot let P3 get to 20. P2, we have to coordinate. I will commit to taking 5 this round to block P3. You should take 3 to guarantee you advance. If we both try to block 5, P3 will just take 1 or 3 and win anyway. This is our only logical move to stop the leader and stay in the game.
  P2: P1, I accept your plan. I'll take 3 to advance to 17 while you block P3 at 5. This is the logical play - we can't both block or we guarantee failure.

P3, you're at 15 and need to be stopped. If you take 5, you hit P1's block. If you take 3, you only reach 18. If you take 1, you're at 16. None of these put you at 20.

I'm committing to 3. P1, stick to your word and block 5. We deal with each other after preventing P3's victory.
  P3: Interesting coordination, but you're both making assumptions. P1, you announced you're blocking 5, and P2, you're claiming 3. That's very convenient information for me.

Since you've both locked in your choices so publicly, I have a free choice between 1 and whichever number you're both bluffing about. The question is: which one of you is lying? P1, are you really sacrificing your advancement to block me? P2, are you actually taking 3, or is this another trap like last round?

I'll make my choice based on who I trust less. Good luck figuring out my move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your only hope is that one of us is bluffing. I'm not. I am sacrificing my own advancement to stop you from reaching 20, because that's the only move that keeps me in the game. The question isn't whether we're bluffing; it's whether you'll risk colliding with one of us or settle for taking 1 point.

P2, don't fall for the mind games. Hold the line at 3. We execute our plan, we stop P3, and we live to fight the next round from a much better position.
  P2: P1, I'm holding firm at 3. Last round I told the truth and took 3 - check the record. This isn't a bluff.

P3, you're at 15. Even if you dodge us perfectly and take 1, you only reach 16. I'll be at 17, ahead of both of you. Your mind games won't work when the math is this simple.

We stop you this round, then figure out the endgame. That's the only path forward for P1 and me.
  P3: You're both right - I can't reach 20 this round. But P2, you becoming the leader at 17 just makes you the next target. 

Here's what I'm thinking: if I take 1 and reach 16, we'll have P2 at 17, me at 16, and P1 stuck at 12. P1 becomes desperate and has to make aggressive moves next round.

Or I could test whether one of you is bluffing. P1, your "sacrifice" seems suspicious after you got burned last round. Would you really give up advancement again?

I've made my decision. Let's see who's telling the truth.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're right to be suspicious. Last round I was greedy and paid the price. I won't make that mistake again. My only goal this turn is to prevent you from reaching 20, because if you do, I lose. It's that simple. I am playing 5. P2, stick to the plan. Let's not let these mind games hand P3 the win.
  P2: P3, enough talk. The plan is set and the math doesn't lie. P1 blocks you at 5, I advance with 3. You can play mind games all you want, but you're not reaching 20 this round.

P1, we've come this far. Execute as promised. Next round we can reassess, but this round we stop the leader. 

Let's move.
  P3: Look, I understand you both want to stop me. P1, if you're truly blocking 5, I won't contest it - congratulations on your sacrifice. P2, enjoy your lead at 17.

But consider this: next round P2 will be just 4 steps from victory. P1, you'll still be at 12, needing 9 steps. Who's the real threat then?

I'll take my move and accept whatever happens. Just remember who becomes the danger when I'm contained and P2 surges ahead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, our 'plan' is a trap, and not for P3. You know as well as I do that P3's logical move is 1. If we stick to our numbers, you and I collide at 17, and P3 advances to 16 for free. You're trying to play me again after your success last round.

I won't be your pawn. My goal is to stop P3 from winning, but not by executing a flawed plan that guarantees I fall further behind. I'll be making my own move. Good luck.
  P2: P1, you just realized we'd collide at 17 if you take 5 and I take 3. Fine - but abandoning the block means P3 gets a FREE path to 20 with 5!

New plan: I'll switch to blocking 5 myself. You take 3 or 1 to advance safely. We CANNOT let P3 reach 20 or it's game over next round.

P3 needs blocking more than I need advancement. I'm switching my move.
  P3: P2, your last-second switch to blocking 5 is noted. But here's the problem - if you're both trying to figure out who blocks what, you'll likely both fail.

P1, they keep saying I need just 5 to reach 20, but that's only true if I take 5. With all this chaos about blocking, I'm taking 1. Safe, guaranteed advancement to 16.

You two can fight over who blocks the number I'm not even taking. Sometimes the smartest move is the simplest one.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, this is it. P3 is at 18 and wins with a 3 or a 5. We have no choice but to block both numbers, or the game is over.

I will take 5. You MUST take 3.

There is no room for bluffs or trying to advance. If we don't execute this perfectly, P3 wins and we both lose. Let's force P3 to take 1 and we can reassess next round. This is our only move.
  P2: P1, you're absolutely right. This is life or death - if we don't both block, P3 wins immediately.

I'm taking 3 to block that winning path. You MUST take 5 as you promised. No tricks, no last-second switches like we've both done before. 

P3, you're forced to take 1 and advance to 19. We all know the math. Any deviation from P1 and me blocking means you win instantly.

P1, if you betray this plan and let P3 win, you're handing them the game. I'm committed to 3. Are you truly committed to 5?
  P3: This is indeed the endgame. You two have no choice but to block 3 and 5, forcing me to take 1 and reach 19.

P1, P2 - you've played well to coordinate this block. I'll take my 1 step to 19. Next round will be interesting - I'll need just 2 more steps while you're at 12 and 14.

But here's the thing: after blocking me this round, can you trust each other next round? One of you will be tempted to break the alliance and advance. The prisoner's dilemma returns.

I'll take 1. See you at 19.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm glad we're in complete agreement. My move is locked on 5. There is no other play.

P3, your talk of the next round is irrelevant. We're focused on this one. Let's execute the plan and move on. I am ready.
  P2: P3, you're right about next round's dilemma, but that's tomorrow's problem. Today we block.

P1, I'm locked on 3. No tricks, no switches. We've both been burned before by last-second changes. This time we execute exactly as promised. 

Let's end this conversation and move. I'm ready.
  P3: You both seem very committed to your blocking strategy. That's fine - I accept my fate of taking 1 to reach 19.

Just remember: next round I need only 2 steps to win. You'll have to maintain perfect coordination again, but this time one of you might be tempted to advance instead of block. The closer I get to 21, the more desperate you'll both become.

I'm ready to take my 1. Let's finish this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: The plan is set. There's nothing left to say that won't just give P3 another chance to sow doubt. I'm sticking to the plan. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Perfect execution is our only option. I'm committed to 3, no wavering. P1, hold 5 as promised. 

This round is settled - let's move.
  P3: The block is inevitable - I accept taking 1 to reach 19. 

But consider this: next round, I need just 2 steps. If you both try to block 1 and 3, I take 5. If you block 1 and 5, I take 3. One of you MUST sacrifice again while the other advances.

P1, at 12 steps, you're basically out of contention. P2 could reach 19 next round while blocking me. Will you really sacrifice yourself again just to help P2 win instead?

The real question is: who breaks first?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we've reached the final dilemma. P3 wins with a 3 or 5. We both win with a 5. We have to block both numbers. If we both go for 5, we collide, and P3 gets to 20 by taking 1. One of us must take 3, sacrificing their chance to win this round for the sake of stopping P3. This is a classic standoff. How do you propose we solve this?
  P3: P1, P2 - you're both at 17 and need 5 to win. But you can't both take 5 or you collide and I win with 1.

Here's the reality: one of you must sacrifice and block 3, letting the other win. But who sacrifices? You've been equal partners until now.

P1, you've already sacrificed twice. P2, you've manipulated P1 before. Neither of you wants to be the martyr.

I'll take whatever number you don't block. The question is: who trusts whom enough to step aside? Your alliance dies here.
  P2: P1, you're right - if we just block P3 this round, they win next round with 1 step. One of us MUST win now or we both lose.

I propose we flip a coin. Heads, I take 3 and you win with 5. Tails, you take 3 and I win with 5. It's the only fair way.

But I'll be honest - after how I played you in round 5, I wouldn't blame you for not trusting me. What if we both announce our final decision right now, publicly? No more games. Just straight commitment.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, talk of fairness and coin flips is a waste of time. This is the end of the game.

I already sacrificed for the group in Round 6 while you advanced. I will not do it again. It's your turn to make the sacrifice if you want to prevent P3 from winning.

I am taking 5. It is the only move that gives me a chance to win. Your choice is to either take 3 to block P3, or take 5, create a collision, and guarantee we both lose to P3 right now. The decision is yours.
  P3: P1, you make a fair point about already sacrificing. P2, it's true - P1 blocked me last round while you advanced. The ledger shows you owe the sacrifice.

But here's what I think will happen: you'll both take 5, collide, and I'll win with 1. Neither of you wants to be the hero who hands victory to the other. 

P2, prove me wrong. Take 3 and let P1 win. Or prove me right and watch me reach 20 while you both stand still at 17. The psychology is clear - mutual destruction over individual sacrifice.
  P2: P1, check round 6 again - we BOTH took 5 and collided! You didn't sacrifice alone while I advanced. We both stayed at 14 that round.

P3 is right - neither of us will back down. We're both taking 5, we'll collide, and P3 wins with 1. It's inevitable.

Unless... P1, you want to prove you're different? Take 3. Otherwise, we're both too proud to lose alone, so we'll lose together. I'm taking 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're right about one thing: we will lose together. I will not take 3 and hand the win to someone who already played me once. You have forced this outcome. We will both choose 5, we will collide, and P3 will win. I accept this result. It is better than letting you win alone. My move is 5. Congratulations, P3.
  P3: P1, P2 - you've resigned yourselves to mutual destruction. I respect that neither of you will bow to the other after all the betrayals.

Since you're both committed to 5, I'll make it official: I'm taking 1 to reach 20. Next round, I need just 1 more step to win at 21.

Thank you both for a well-played game. Your inability to trust each other at the crucial moment was predictable but still fascinating to watch. Sometimes the best strategy is simply patience while others destroy themselves.
  P2: P1, you've made your choice clear. We're both too proud to step aside, so P3 wins. It's a fitting end - we spent so much energy blocking each other that we handed victory to the patient player. 

Well played, P3. You read us perfectly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I see your logic, and I can't argue with it. We're locked in a standoff where the only winner is P3. You've made it clear you won't take 3 and let me win, and I've made it clear I won't do the same for you. The game is over. My move is set. Congratulations on a well-played game, P3. You earned this win by letting us defeat ourselves.
  P3: The resignation in your voices is music to my ears. You've both chosen mutual destruction over individual defeat - a poetic end to our game of strategy and betrayal.

I'll graciously accept my victory with 1, reaching 20. Next round is a formality - I need just one final step while you both remain frozen at 17, victims of your own pride.

Thank you for the masterclass in game theory. Sometimes the winning move is simply to wait while others tear each other apart.
  P2: P1, we've talked ourselves in circles. Neither of us will yield, so P3 wins. That's the brutal logic of this endgame - our pride costs us both the victory.

Let's stop prolonging the inevitable. I'm taking 5, you're taking 5, we collide, and P3 reaches 20.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
