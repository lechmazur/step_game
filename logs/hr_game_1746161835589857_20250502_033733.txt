Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we all start at 0 steps, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid colliding. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. I suggest we consider moving 1, 3, or 5 but avoid picking the same number. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P3's idea. Let’s each take different numbers to maximize progress. I'll choose **3** this round. P1, take **1**, and P3, take **5**. This way, we all advance without collision. If everyone sticks to this, we can rotate numbers in future turns to keep moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5 to avoid collisions. Everyone advances. Let's move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on our strategy. Just to confirm, I will stick to the plan and choose **5** this round. This way, we can all advance without colliding. After this round, we can discuss our next moves to keep up the momentum. Looking forward to seeing everyone advance! What do you both think?
  P2: <move>3</move> is my choice as agreed. Let’s stick to the plan to avoid collisions and keep advancing. P1, P3, confirm you’ll hold to 1 and 5 respectively? This ensures progress for all—no sense in sabotaging our own momentum. Next round, we can rotate numbers for fair advancement. Deal?
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5. Next round, rotate numbers for fair progress. No collisions—everyone moves forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we’re all on the same page! Just to confirm, I will choose **5** this round as discussed. After this, we can strategize on how to rotate our numbers for future rounds to keep advancing without collisions. Let’s keep the momentum going! Looking forward to seeing us all make progress. What do you both think?
  P2: <move>3</move> as agreed. P1 on 1, P3 on 5—let’s execute this *now* to secure progress. No second-guessing: collisions erase our gains. Next round, rotate numbers fairly. Confirm final choices?
  P1: Sticking to 1 to avoid collision. Let's move forward together—no conflicts, all advance!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s continue rotating numbers as agreed. Since I took **3** last round, I’ll pick **5** this turn. P1, take **3** to advance, and P3, kindly switch to **1** to keep the cycle. This way, we avoid collisions and all progress fairly. Confirm you’ll hold to this rotation? Momentum matters—let’s not break the chain.
  P1: Agreed, I'll take 3 to keep the rotation. Let’s all advance without collisions—no need to disrupt the plan. P3, confirm 1? P2, 5? Let’s move forward!
  P3: I appreciate the proposed rotation, but I think it might be wise for me to take a different approach this round. I suggest I stick with **5** instead of **1** to maximize my chances of advancing. P1, you could still take **3**, and P2, you could take **1**. This way, I can still push forward while you both rotate. Let me know your thoughts!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Let’s not risk collisions by deviating. Sticking to the agreed rotation is safest: I’ll take **5**, P1 **3**, and P3 **1** this round. If P3 insists on **5**, we’ll both collide and stall—hurting everyone. Trust the plan: rotating ensures steady progress for all. P3, please honor the cycle. We’re a team until someone wins. Confirm?
  P1: I'll stick to 3 as agreed. Let's keep rotating to avoid collisions and advance steadily. P3, confirm 1 to keep the plan on track—no need to disrupt momentum.
  P3: I understand the importance of sticking to our rotation, but I believe I can achieve more by choosing **5** again this round. If I take **5**, I can advance further, and P1 and P2 can still progress by choosing **1** and **3** respectively. This way, we all move forward without colliding. I suggest we stay flexible to maximize our steps. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take **5** again, you’ll collide with me (both choosing 5), and we both lose progress. Our agreed rotation ensures *everyone advances every round*—breaking it risks stalemate. P1 is honoring the plan with **3**. Let’s stick to: **P3→1, P2→5, P1→3**. Teamwork keeps us all moving toward 22. Confirm you’ll hold to **1**?
  P1: Stick to the plan: I'll take 3. P3, choose 1 to avoid collision. Let’s all move forward without conflicts. No need to risk progress.
  P3: I understand the importance of teamwork, but I still believe that taking **5** could benefit me this round. However, to ensure we all advance, I will agree to take **1** as suggested. This way, we can all progress without collisions. Let's confirm our choices: P1, you take **3**, P2, you take **5**, and I will take **1**. This keeps us on track. Looking forward to seeing us all advance! What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

Confirm your choices, and let’s make this round successful!
  P2: P2: Let’s lock in the plan to maintain momentum: I’ll take **1**, P1 **5**, and P3 **3** this round. This keeps us all advancing safely to **9 steps**. No need for last-minute changes—stick to the rotation to keep pressure on toward 22. Confirm final choices?
  P1: Confirming my move: 5. Let’s all advance without collisions! P2: 1, P3: 3—steady progress. No risks, maximum steps. Ready?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan! For this round, I will stick to **3** as discussed. P1, please confirm you’ll take **5**, and P2, you’ll take **1**. This way, we can all advance without collisions and keep moving toward 22 steps. Let’s maintain our momentum and ensure we all progress together. Ready to confirm our moves!
  P2: P2: Confirming **1** as agreed. Let’s stay disciplined—deviating risks collisions and halting progress. We’re building toward 22; consistency is key. P1 and P3, final confirmation to stick to **5**, **3**, and **1** respectively? No sense sabotaging our lead now.
  P1: Confirming my move: 5. Let’s stick to the plan—no collisions, maximum progress. P2: 1, P3: 3. Keep the momentum going!

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we're getting close to the finish line! For this round, I propose I take **5** to push ahead. P1, you could take **1**, and P2, please take **3**. This way, we can all advance without collisions and keep moving toward 22. Let's confirm our choices quickly to ensure everyone progresses safely. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: P3, your proposal risks letting you surge to 20 while I lag at 16. Let’s adjust: **P1 takes 3 (→19)**, **I take 5 (→18)**, and you take **1 (→16)**. This keeps us all within striking distance of 22 without favoring any single player. Fair and strategic—confirm?
  P1: Let's assign 1,3,5 uniquely. I'll take 5 to reach 21. P2, take 1; P3, take 3. No collisions, all advance. Let's finish strong!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I see the strategy shifting. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I propose I take **3** this round, P1 takes **5** to reach **21**, and P2 takes **1**. This way, we avoid overlaps and keep everyone moving toward 22. Let’s confirm our choices quickly to maintain momentum and finish strong! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: To maintain pressure and avoid collisions, I’ll take **5** (→18). P1, choose **3** (→19) to stay safe. P3, take **1** (→16). This keeps us all advancing toward 22 without overlap—final push next round! No hero moves now—trust the plan.
  P1: I'll take 5. P2, avoid collision—choose 1. P3, take 3. Final push to 22! No overlaps. Let's finish strong.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, we're so close to the finish! For this round, I suggest I take **1** to avoid collision, P1 takes **5** to reach **21**, and P2 takes **3** to move forward. This way, we all advance without overlaps and keep the momentum going toward 22. Let's confirm our choices quickly and finish strong! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: P1, **collisions are fatal**—if we both take 5, we stall. Let’s split: **I take 5** to reach **18**, you take **3** (→19), and P3 takes **1** (→16). This keeps us all advancing *without overlaps*. P3, confirm your **1**? Let’s preserve momentum—next round, I’ll push for 22 with a **4**… but moves only allow **1/3/5.** So **stick to this plan** to avoid mutual sabotage!
  P1: I'll take 5 to reach 21. P2, take 1; P3, take 3. No collisions—let's finish strong!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we're in a crucial round! To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I suggest I take **5** this time to reach 21, P1 takes **1** to stay safe at 22, and P2 takes **3** to advance to 19. This way, we can all move forward without overlaps. Let’s confirm our choices quickly and finish strong! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, let's both take **1** to block P1's path to 22. P1, you'll have to choose **3** or **5**, ensuring fair competition. I commit to **1**, and you should too—this prevents an easy win. Confirm?
  P1: I'll take 1 to reach 22. P2, P3, avoid collision—choose 3 or 5. Let’s not stall progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, we’re in a tight spot! To avoid collisions and ensure I can reach 22, I suggest I take **5** this round while P1 takes **1** to secure the win, and P2 takes **3** to avoid conflict. This way, we all move forward without overlaps. If P1 and I both take **1**, we risk stalling progress. Let's confirm our choices quickly to finish strong! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, we **must** both take **1** to block P1’s path to 22. If we collide on **1**, P1 can’t choose it and must pick **3** or **5**, overshooting but still winning. However, if I take **1** and you take **3**, P1 can still win with **1**. **Only mutual 1s force P1 to gamble**—their loss is our only chance. Confirm **1** now—no alternatives!
  P1: I'm taking 1 to win. If you take 1, you'll collide. Choose 3 or 5. Let's not stall progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a critical juncture! I suggest we all focus on avoiding collisions to maximize our chances. If I take **5** and P1 takes **1**, P2, you should take **3** to keep advancing. This way, we avoid overlaps and ensure progress. However, if you both take **1**, P1 wins easily. Let's confirm our moves quickly to ensure we all move forward without stalling. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, let’s both advance strategically: I’ll take **5** (→21), you take **3** (→19). P1 can’t block both. This sets me up to finish next round with **1**, while you push closer. Let’s maximize our progress and deny P1 an easy win—confirm this split?
  P1: I'm taking 1 to win. If you both take 3 or 5, I'll advance safely. Let's avoid collisions and finish this.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we need to strategize carefully this round! I suggest I take **5** to reach 21, P1 can take **1** to secure the win, and P2 should take **3** to avoid collisions. This way, we can all advance without overlaps. If we both take **1**, we risk stalling progress. Let’s confirm our choices quickly to maximize our chances of finishing strong! What do you both think?
  P1: I'll take 1 to win. Others, choose 3 or 5 to avoid collision. Let's finish this!
  P2: P3, let's prioritize our own progress. I'll take **5** (→21) while you take **3** (→19). P1, if you take **1**, we can’t block you—but if you do, we’ll push harder next round. Focus on securing our own path to 22. No sense letting you win unopposed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, we need to coordinate effectively this round! If I take **5** to reach 21, P1, you can take **1** to secure the win, while P2 takes **3** to advance. This way, we all make progress without collisions. However, if both P1 and I take **1**, we risk stalling. Let's confirm our choices quickly to maximize our chances of finishing strong! What do you both think?
  P1: I'll take 1 to win. P2, P3, pick 3 or 5 to avoid collision. Let's finish this!
  P2: P3, let’s block P1’s path! I’ll take **1** to collide with them. If you also pick **1**, P1 can’t advance, and we’ll both stay at 16. Next round, I’ll take **5** (→21), and you can take **5** too—then we’ll race to 22. Don’t let P1 win uncontested! Confirm you’ll take **1** now?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, we need to be strategic here. If I take **5** and P1 takes **1**, P2, you should take **3** to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. However, if you both choose **1**, it blocks me and allows P1 to win easily. Let's confirm our moves carefully to maximize our chances and finish strong! P2, what’s your final choice?
  P1: I'll take 1 to win. Others, pick 3 or 5 to avoid collision. Don’t risk blocking me—22 is within reach! Let’s end this cleanly.
  P2: P3, take 1 with me! Block P1’s path. If we both pick 1, P1 must choose 3/5 and win anyway. But at least we advance to 17. Confirm final choice: **1**!
