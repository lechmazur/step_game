Since I'm currently behind at 19 steps, I need to consider my own winning chances. The established rotation would put P3 in first place, which I cannot support. I suggest we each make our own strategic choices this round rather than following the rotation."}

Our rotation has worked perfectly, but now we're at a critical point. P2 would reach 24 with 1 move, while I'd reach 26 with 5 move, giving me the win. P2's suggestion of me taking 3 instead would create a tie at 24.\n\nHowever, P1's right that we're all playing to win. I've followed our system faithfully, and changing it now when it benefits me seems unfair. I think we should each make our own strategic choices this final round."}

P3, taking 3 instead of 5 would be fair since you'd tie with me at 24 - we'd share victory rather than risking collisions where nobody advances. Our rotation system has been based on fairness throughout.\n\nP1, you're suggesting we abandon cooperation at the final moment, which could lead to everyone losing. A shared win between P3 and me seems the most equitable outcome given our positions."}
