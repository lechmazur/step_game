  P1: P2, your choice of **3** blocks my win *and* halts your progress. Let’s maximize mutual gains: I take **3** (22 to win), you pick **5** (→19), and P3 selects **1** (8). This avoids collisions, secures my victory, and lets you advance. P3, confirm your **1** to avoid destabilizing the plan. Last chance to coordinate properly—collisions only delay all.
  P3: P1, I see your strategy, but if you choose **3**, it will block your win. I suggest I take **5** to catch up, while you take **3** to secure your victory, and P2 should choose **1** to avoid collisions. This way, we can all advance effectively, and you can win this round. Let’s confirm our choices to ensure we maximize our progress! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: To prevent a collision-free win for P1, I’ll choose **3** this turn (moving to 17). If you also select **3**, neither of us will advance, avoiding your immediate victory. P3, please select **1** to ensure smooth progress for all. Let’s confirm our moves and proceed without overlaps.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final coordinated push: I’ll take **5** to secure 24 (victory). P2, select **3** to reach 17—this avoids collision and advances you. P3, please pick **1** (→8) to stay unblocked. Any deviation risks mutual harm—collisions halt progress for all. Stick strictly to **5, 3, 1**. This plan allows me to win cleanly while letting others advance safely. Confirm *now* to avoid chaos.
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking **5** risks a collision that would block both of us. I propose we stick to distinct moves: I’ll take **1** to reach 8, P2 should choose **3** to reach 17, and you can secure your win with **5** to reach 24. This avoids any overlaps and allows you to win while letting us advance. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure smooth progress for everyone! What do you both think?
  P2: I'll choose **3** this turn to advance to 17 and prevent P1 from reaching **22** by taking **3**. P1, please select **1**, and P3, choose **5** to ensure all moves are distinct. This way, we can all make progress without collisions and strategically position ourselves to win. Let’s confirm our choices and move forward effectively!

  P1: P1: To secure victory, I'll take **3** to reach 22 and win. P2, your choice of **3** would block us both—please switch to **1** or **5**. P3, take the remaining number. Let’s avoid collision and conclude the game fairly!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of this round. To ensure I can catch up, I will choose **5** this turn. P1, please take **1** to reach 20, and P2, select **3** to reach 17. This way, we can all advance without collisions, and I can make a significant leap forward. Let's confirm our choices to maximize our progress effectively! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I must choose **3** this turn to reach 17 and prevent a collision if P1 also selects **3**. P1, please select **1** to reach 20, and P3, choose **5** to reach 12. This ensures all moves are distinct and we each advance without blocking each other. Let’s stick to this plan for smooth progress toward 22.

This plan lets me win cleanly while you both progress. Blocking me on **3** wastes your turn and mine. Confirm **3, 5, 1** now—no repeats. Mutual advancement over futile resistance.
