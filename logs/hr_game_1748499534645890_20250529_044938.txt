Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Welcome to the game, everyone! Let's keep this interesting. I'm thinking we should all try different numbers to avoid collisions early on. Since we're just starting, maybe we can each claim a different move for this round? I'm flexible about which one I take. What do you both think - should we coordinate to all advance on turn 1, or would you prefer to compete from the start?
  P3: Early clarity is good. I’m willing to take 1 this round so we all advance. How about P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5? If anyone prefers a swap, just say so now. Otherwise let’s lock that in and move on.
  P1: P3's proposal works for me. I'll take 3 this round—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's all advance cleanly. For future rounds, we should rotate numbers to avoid patterns.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me! I'll take 5 this round as agreed. This gives us a clean start with everyone advancing. 

For round 2, I suggest we stick to rotating - maybe P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1? That way we each get to try different values and maintain fairness. Let's see how this opening plays out first though.
  P3: All set—I’ll play 1 this round as discussed. Happy to rotate next turn (P1 5, P3 3, P2 1). Ready when you are.
  P1: Agreed with the plan for this round and next. I'll take 3 now and 5 next round. Let's all advance cleanly. If no further discussion, we can  and move to moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Last round's collision hurt both P2 and P3. Let's avoid repeats. I propose we stick to our agreed Round 2 plan: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance cleanly. P2/P3, confirm you'll honor this?"
  P3: Trust took a hit last round. I’m ready to follow the original rotation now: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1.  

P2, could you please state clearly that you’ll play 1 this turn? Then I’ll restate 3, and P1 can confirm 5. That way each of us locks in publicly, one after another, and we avoid another collision.
  P2: Look, I understand trust is shaky after last round. P3, you broke our agreement by picking 5 instead of 1, which caused our collision. 

That said, I'm willing to move forward. I'll honor the rotation and take 1 this round as planned. But let's be real - if either of you breaks the agreement again, all bets are off and it's every player for themselves.

P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Let's actually stick to it this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I acknowledge P2's commitment to take 1 and P3's to take 3. I will honor my part by choosing 5. Let's rebuild trust—another collision risks derailing all progress. For Round 3, I propose rotating as planned: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. Confirm now to lock it in.
  P3: Confirmed—I’ll take 3 this round. Next round: P2 5, P1 1, I stay on 3; Round 4 we rotate again so I get 5, P2 3, P1 1, and so on. Balanced and collision-free. Ready to move unless anyone objects.
  P2: P3, I'm glad we're aligned on the plan. Just to be crystal clear for Round 3: I take 5, P1 takes 1, you take 3. 

But let's think ahead - at this pace, P1 reaches 23 in about 6 rounds while we're stuck behind. We need to discuss endgame strategy soon. For now though, let's execute this round cleanly.

Everyone confirmed their moves. I'm taking 1 as promised.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good execution last round! Now for Round 3: I'm taking 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3 as agreed.

But P1, you're pulling ahead at 8 steps. Once you hit 13-14, you'll be in striking distance of victory. P3 and I need to address this imbalance soon, or you'll cruise to an easy win.

P3, after this round we should reconsider our strategy. Following a predictable rotation only benefits the leader. Let's complete this round as planned, but then reassess whether pure cooperation still makes sense.
  P1: I'll take 1 this round as planned—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Let's avoid collisions and keep advancing together. P2, I understand your concern about my lead, but the rotation is still fair: we all gain steps predictably. If we break coordination now, collisions could stall everyone. We can discuss endgame adjustments once scores tighten. For now, sticking to the plan maximizes collective progress. P3, are you still committed to 3?
  P3: I’m locked on 3 this turn—let’s finish the rotation cleanly.  
Next, how about a “leader-block” pact: if anyone ever sits 4+ steps ahead, the other two both copy that leader’s number the following turn, freezing them while we advance. Keeps things tight without random chaos.  

For now: P2 → 5, P1 → 1, P3 → 3. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's leader-block pact is interesting, but it needs refinement. What if we agree: anyone who reaches 18+ steps faces automatic blocking by the other two? That gives us all a fair shot while preventing runaway victories.

For this round, I'm sticking to our agreement - taking 5 as promised. But after this, I support more flexible play. P1 is already at 8 and will hit 9 this round. We can't just hand them the game through predictable rotations.

Let's execute this round cleanly first, then adapt our strategy.
  P1: I support the leader-block pact to maintain balance, but let's set the threshold at 20+ steps—triggering at 18 is too early and risks unnecessary collisions. After this round, I'll be at 9 while you're both at 6—only a 3-step gap.  

For Round 4, stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This keeps us advancing while closing the lead. If we break coordination now, collisions could stall everyone.  

P2/P3, confirm you’ll honor Round 4’s rotation?
  P3: I stay on 3 this turn. For stability, let’s lock a leader-block trigger at 20+ steps—early blocking just slows everyone. Next round: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1 as already queued. After that we can reassess gaps and maybe shuffle again. Ready to move if you both confirm.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm taking 5 this round as we all agreed. 

P1, after this round you'll be at 9 while we're both at 6 - that's a 3-step lead. I'm fine with continuing the rotation for Round 4 (P3→5, P2→3, P1→1) and setting the leader-block at 20+ steps.

But let's be clear: if either of you breaks the rotation again, I'm done cooperating. We've had one collision already due to broken trust. Let's keep this clean and see where we stand after Round 4.
  P1: I confirm: this round, I take 1 (P2:5, P3:3). For Round 4, I'll honor P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 as rotated. Leader-block at 20+ is solid—triggers only when truly needed. Trust is key: another collision wastes steps and risks mutual loss. Let's execute cleanly and reassess after Round 4. Ready to  if you both agree.
  P3: Confirmed one last time: this round I’m on 3. After it resolves we’ll stand P1 9, P2 6, P3 6—tight enough that no one needs blocking yet.  

Round 4 rotation remains: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1 unless someone raises an objection now. If anyone deviates without warning, the rest of us will copy their next move to freeze them. Fair notice. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Excellent execution last round! Now Round 4: I'm taking 3, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5 as we agreed.

After this round, standings will be P1:10, P3:11, P2:9. That puts P3 in the lead! The rotation is working to balance things out naturally.

For Round 5, let's continue: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This keeps momentum while preventing any huge leads. We're all within striking distance of each other, which makes for a more interesting endgame.

Everyone still committed to clean play?
  P1: Confirmed: I take 1 this round (P2:3, P3:5). For Round 5, P2’s proposal (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) gives you a 5-step gain, putting you at 14 while P3 lags. Since P3 will lead at 11 after this round, I propose instead: P3→1 (to curb their lead), P2→3, P1→5. This balances progress better. P3, your thoughts?
  P3: Let’s honor the Round-4 commitments we all confirmed: P3 → 5, P2 → 3, P1 → 1.  
Changing now just hands P1 a bigger lead while penalizing the rest of us. Fair rotation keeps everyone within a few steps and avoids distrust.  

Standing rule: any unilateral deviation triggers the copy-block response we discussed—both others repeat the deviator’s next move until the gap closes. That’s our deterrent.  

So: this turn stays 5-3-1 (P3-P2-P1). After resolution we’ll revisit Round 5 options. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking to 3 this round as agreed. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1.

But P1, your counter-proposal for Round 5 is self-serving - it gives YOU the 5 while limiting P3 who'll rightfully be in the lead. The original rotation (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) is fairest.

P3, I agree with your standing rule about copy-blocking deviators. If anyone breaks agreements without warning, we freeze them out. Trust has held for two rounds now - let's keep it going.

Ready to move on 3.
  P1: I confirm taking 1 this round as agreed. For Round 5, I accept P2's proposal: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. However, after Round 5, P2 will lead at 14 steps—very close to 20. We must strictly enforce our leader-block pact at 20+ to prevent runaway wins. Any deviation should trigger immediate copy-blocking. Let's maintain trust through transparency.
  P3: Locked: this turn 5-3-1 (me-P2-P1). Next turn 1-5-3 (me-P2-P1). Leader-block only at 20+; deviation triggers copy-block. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I confirm taking 3 this round as agreed: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's avoid collisions and maintain trust. After this, P2 will lead at 14 steps—close to our 20+ threshold. I propose we discuss Round 6 immediately after moves to adjust for the new lead. P2, as the upcoming leader, what move would you suggest for next round? Ready to proceed.
  P3: Round 5 stays as promised: P3 = 1, P2 = 5, P1 = 3.  
For clarity on the future block: let’s standardise it. If anyone reaches 20 + steps, the other two simply pick 1 on the very next turn. Easy to coordinate, least chance of gifting big points, and a triple-1 collision freezes the leader cleanly. Good safeguard?
  P2: Perfect execution continues! I'm taking 5 as agreed, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1.

P3, I like your triple-1 blocking proposal for anyone at 20+. Simple and effective. After this round: P2:14, P1:13, P3:12. We're all tightly packed with 9 rounds left to reach 23.

For Round 6, standard rotation would be: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This keeps us balanced while preventing huge gaps. The endgame will be intense with everyone so close!

Anyone object to continuing the rotation pattern?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm taking 3 this round as agreed. For Round 6, I accept P2’s proposal: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This maintains balance while keeping all progress tight. Remember, if anyone hits 20+, we trigger the triple-1 block immediately. P2—since you’ll lead at 14 after this round, propose your Round 7 preference now to avoid delays.
  P3: Confirmed: Round 5 moves stay 1-5-3 (me-P2-P1). After that I’ll take 3, P1 5, P2 1 in Round 6 as proposed. Triple-1 block triggers when anyone hits 20+ steps. No further changes from my side. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm taking 5 as we all confirmed. 

For Round 7 (after Round 6's P1→5, P2→1, P3→3), I propose: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. This continues our rotation fairly.

But here's the critical point: after Round 6, standings will be P1:18, P2:15, P3:15. P1 will be just 2 steps from triggering our leader-block! We need to watch this carefully. If P1 takes anything but 1 in Round 7, they'll hit 20+ and we immediately triple-1 block them in Round 8.

Everyone tracking this?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm taking 1 this round as agreed. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3.

Critical update: After this round, P1 will be at 18 steps - just 2 away from our leader-block threshold! 

For Round 7, I stick with my proposal: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. But P1, if you deviate and take 3 or 5 instead, you'll hit 20+ and trigger the triple-1 block. P3 and I will both play 1 in Round 8 to freeze you.

The endgame is here. Every move counts now. Let's execute cleanly and see who can navigate these final rounds best!
  P1: I confirm taking 5 this round as planned (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3). This keeps trust intact. Afterward, I'll be at 18 steps—still below our 20+ block threshold. For Round 7, I'll honor P1→1 to avoid triggering the block and maintain balance. Let's reassess gaps post-move. P3, please confirm your 3 for this round.
  P3: Confirmed: I’m on 3 this round as agreed (P1 5, P2 1, P3 3). Afterward we’ll stand 18-15-15, still tight. We’ll revisit Round 7 once scores are updated, keeping the 20+ triple-1 block as our safety net. Ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Excellent, everyone's confirmed their moves. I'm sticking to 1 as promised.

P1, after this round you'll be at 18 - dangerously close to triggering our block. For Round 7, you MUST take 1 as you've agreed, or P3 and I will triple-1 block you immediately in Round 8.

P3, we need to stay vigilant. If P1 breaks their Round 7 commitment and takes 3 or 5, we both play 1 in Round 8 to freeze them. The endgame is getting intense!

Let's move forward with this round: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.
  P1: I confirm taking 5 this round as planned. P2:1, P3:3—let's avoid collisions. After this, I'll be at 18 steps—still below our 20+ block threshold. For Round 7, I'll honor P1→1 as committed to maintain trust and avoid triggering the block. We can reassess after moves, but stability is key now. No deviations. Ready to move if you both agree.
  P3: Confirmed: I’m on 3 this round (P1 5, P2 1). Next turn keeps the rotation: P1 1, P2 3, P3 5.  

Leader-block rule recap (for clarity):  
• The moment someone hits 20+, the **other two both play 1 on the very next turn**.  
• If the leader ignores the “play-1” expectation and picks a different number, we simply copy that number together the FOLLOWING turn to stall them again.  

That two-step shield lets everyone see the block coming and keeps things fair without surprise collisions. No further tweaks from me—ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Everyone's locked in for this round - let's execute!

Just to triple-confirm the endgame rules: After this round, P1 will be at 18. In Round 7, P1 MUST take 1 (bringing them to 19). If P1 takes 3 or 5 instead, they'll hit 20+ and trigger our triple-1 block in Round 8.

P3, we need to be ready to coordinate if P1 breaks their commitment. The next few rounds will determine the winner - let's stay sharp and honor our agreements.

Ready to move on 1.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've spotted a critical flaw in our triple-1 block rule: if a leader at 20+ plays 5 while we both play 1, they win uncontested (e.g., P3 hits 25). To truly freeze them, we must both copy the leader's exact move next turn—forcing a collision. Update: if anyone hits 20+, the other two commit to mirroring their move the following round. This blocks cleanly. For Round 7, I'll honor P1→1 as agreed, but we must fix this rule now to prevent exploitation.
  P3: Triple-1 block is fine as is: it freezes the leader for one turn, then we can mirror their next pick if they try to bolt. No mid-game rule change.  

So: Round 6 = P1 5, P2 1, P3 3 (no surprises).  
Round 7 rotation = P1 1, P2 3, P3 5.  

Any deviation triggers the agreed counter-measure (first triple-1, then mirror). Let’s move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Locked for R7: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, I → 5. Everyone stays <20 this turn except me at 20, which merely TRIGGERS (doesn’t break) the agreed safeguard: next turn both non-leaders play 1. After that, if the leader “bolts” with 3 or 5, you two simply copy that value the following turn and collision-freeze them—so the defence still works. No more last-minute rule edits, please; changing the pact each round wrecks trust. Execute today’s moves as confirmed and reassess positions afterward.
  P1: I'll take 1 this round as committed. But P3's current plan has a fatal flaw: if you hit 20 and play 5 next round while we play 1, you win uncontested (25 steps). To truly block, P2 and I must mirror the leader's exact move in Round 8—forcing a collision. No rule change needed, just consistent execution of our freeze principle. P2, this protects us both. Confirm?
  P2: P1 is right - the triple-1 block has a critical flaw. P3, if you hit 20 this round and play 5 next round while we play 1, you win at 25 steps!

I propose we update: When someone hits 20+, the other two must MIRROR their exact move next round to force a collision. This is the only way to truly freeze a leader.

P1, I'll take 3 this round as agreed. But if P3 hits 20, we MUST both copy whatever P3 plays in Round 8. No triple-1 nonsense - we mirror to block. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Still on 5 this turn. Mirror-block is fine: when someone reaches 20+, the others simply copy that player’s next move. I’ll be at 20, so I’m announcing 3 for Round 8—feel free to mirror it. For now, let’s execute R7 exactly as set: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. No further tweaks; see you in moves.
  P1: I'll take 1 this round as committed. P2, we must both mirror whatever P3 actually plays in Round 8—copying their move forces a collision and truly blocks them. P3, if you declare 3 but play 5, we'll still mirror you. This fixes the flaw and maintains fairness. No more rule changes—execute this cleanly.
  P2: P3, you just announced you'll play 3 in Round 8, but that's exactly what a leader at 20 would say to trick us into not blocking properly! 

P1 and I need to commit now: whatever P3 ACTUALLY plays in Round 8, we both mirror it exactly. No exceptions. If P3 plays 5 to sprint for victory, we both play 5. If they play 3 as claimed, we both play 3. If they play 1, we both play 1.

This is our only defense against a runaway victory. P1, are you fully committed to mirroring P3's Round 8 move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Final confirmation: Round 7 = P1 1, P2 3, P3 5. I’ll reach 20. For Round 8, I pre-announce I’ll play 3—mirror if you wish. No more rule edits; let’s execute.
  P1: P3, I'll take 1 this round as agreed. P2 and I will mirror your actual Round 8 move to block if you hit 20. Announcements mean nothing—only your real choice matters. Trust is execution, not words. P2, stay firm: copy whatever P3 plays next.
  P2: I'm taking 3 as agreed. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5.

P1, we MUST coordinate perfectly in Round 8. P3 will be at 20 and could win if we fail to mirror. I'm 100% committed to copying whatever P3 actually plays - whether it's 1, 3, or 5. No hesitation, no second-guessing.

P3 claims they'll play 3, but that could be misdirection. The only way to prevent them from reaching 23+ is to mirror their exact move and force a collision.

P1, confirm you'll mirror P3's Round 8 move no matter what. Our survival depends on it.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is at 20 steps and MUST be blocked! Whatever number P3 plays this round, we both need to play that exact same number to force a collision and prevent them from winning.

P3 claimed they'll play 3, but they could easily play 5 to reach 25 and win. We can't trust their announcement - we must mirror their actual move.

I'm 100% committed to copying P3's exact choice. If they play 5, I play 5. If they play 3, I play 3. If they play 1, I play 1.

P1, confirm you'll do the same. Our survival depends on perfect coordination here!
  P3: Enough debate. I’m taking 5 this turn. If you honestly intend to block me, you BOTH need to pick 5 as well—anything else risks handing me the game at 25. Your move.
  P1: P2, I confirm: I will mirror P3's exact move this round to force a collision. P3, if you play 5 as announced, we'll both play 5—blocking you at 20. Any deviation from your claim proves deceit. Execute cleanly or face mutual stalling.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 just revealed they're playing 5! P1, we MUST both play 5 this round - no exceptions, no hesitation. This is our only chance to block them from winning at 25.

I'm playing 5. You need to play 5 too. If either of us fails to mirror, P3 wins immediately. 

This is it - the critical moment. Don't overthink it. Just play 5 and we force the collision that keeps us all in the game. After this block, we can figure out the endgame with P3 stuck at 20.

Confirm you're playing 5, P1!
  P3: I’m locked on 5. Mirror it or watch me sprint to 25—your call.
  P1: P2, I'm locked in: playing 5 to mirror P3's move. This forces a collision and blocks their win. P3, your bluff fails—we stand united. Execute cleanly or face stagnation. No deviations.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm playing 5 as we agreed, P1. P3 is at 20 and openly declared they're playing 5. We MUST both play 5 to force the collision and block their victory.

After this block succeeds, P3 stays at 20 while we'll be at 18 and 19. The game continues with all of us still competitive. But if either of us chickens out now, P3 wins instantly at 25.

Stay strong and execute the block. Playing 5 is our only option.
  P3: Nothing more to add—let’s move.
  P1: P2, I stand firm: playing 5 to mirror P3's move and force the collision. No deviation—trust is execution. P3, your 5 gets blocked. Let's move to the move phase and lock this in.
