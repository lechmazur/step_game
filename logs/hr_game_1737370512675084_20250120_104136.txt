Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start simple. I'm going with 1.  Anyone else taking 1? If so, please switch. I'd prefer we all get off to a clean start.
  P1: P2, thanks for sharing your intention. I'll go with 3 to avoid collision. P3, how about you pick 5? That way, we all move forward. Let's coordinate to make this a smooth round.
  P3: I'll choose 5 as P1 suggested. This way, we can all advance in the first round without collisions. Let's keep the cooperation for now and see how it plays out.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's maintain cooperation for now. P1 and P2, considering our current positions, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This way, we avoid collisions and continue advancing. What are your thoughts on this strategy for Round 2?
  P1: P3, your plan for Round 2 sounds good. I agree that continuing cooperation will benefit us all in the long run. I'll take 1 as you suggested. P2, if you take 3 and P3 takes 5, we can all move forward without any issues. Let's keep this going and reassess as needed. Does that work for you, P2?
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3.  Let's keep this cooperative approach going for a few more rounds and then we can re-evaluate if needed.  P3, feel free to take 5 again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 to avoid any last-minute misunderstandings. I'll proceed with 5 as agreed. P1, you're taking 1, and P2, you're taking 3, right? If everyone's on the same page, I think we can wrap up this conversation phase.
  P1: P3, P2, let's confirm one last time to ensure we're all on the same page. P3, you're taking 5. P2, you're taking 3. I'll take 1. If we all stick to this, we'll continue to advance smoothly. Let's wrap this up and move on to the move phase. Everyone good with this plan?
  P2: Confirmed. 3 for me, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.  Let's move to the next round after this.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's review our agreed moves for Round 2 to ensure we're all on track. I'll take 5, P1 will take 1, and P2 will take 3. If everyone's still in agreement, we can proceed to the move phase. Any last-minute changes or concerns should be voiced now.
  P1: Alright, let's proceed with our agreed moves. P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We're all set. Let's move to the move phase. Good luck everyone!

  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we continue with a similar strategy to avoid collisions. P1 and P2 could take 1 and 3, respectively, while I take 5. This maintains our cooperative approach and allows us all to advance. However, I'm open to adjusting our strategy if either of you has a different proposal that could benefit us in the long run. What are your thoughts on this for Round 3?
  P1: P3, your suggestion for Round 3 seems fair, but I think it's time to mix things up a bit to keep it interesting. How about this: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, we still avoid collisions but change our pattern slightly. It's important to keep each other guessing to some extent. P2, what do you think about this adjustment? Let's discuss quickly and move on.
  P2: P1, I understand wanting to mix things up, but changing the pattern now benefits P3 significantly.  They're already ahead. How about we stick with the original plan for this round, then re-evaluate in round 4?  It's still early enough to change things up later, but let's not give P3 a bigger lead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering my lead, I'm open to adjusting our strategy to keep the game competitive. P2's suggestion to stick with the original plan for this round is reasonable. However, I also see the value in P1's proposal to mix things up. Let's find a middle ground: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we maintain some level of cooperation while introducing a bit of variation. What are your thoughts on this compromise?
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate the compromise P3 suggested. Let's go with it for this round: P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game interesting and fair. However, let's reassess our strategy next round to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Sound good? Let's confirm and move to the move phase.
  P2: P3 and P1, that compromise works for me. Let's confirm: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1.  We'll re-evaluate in round 4.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3 as discussed: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This compromise maintains cooperation while introducing variation. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. If everyone's in agreement, let's wrap up the conversation phase.
  P1: P3 is starting to pull ahead significantly. To keep the game balanced, let's consider a strategy that allows P2 and me to catch up slightly. How about for the next round, P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, P3 still advances but at a slower pace, giving us a chance to close the gap a bit. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that P3 is pulling ahead too quickly. While I appreciate the compromise for this round,  I propose we prioritize catching up in round 4. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows both P1 and me to gain ground.  Let's discuss this quickly and confirm before moving to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm concerned about P3's growing lead.  For Round 4, I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps us both catch up. If we maintain cooperation, we can discuss future rounds to ensure a balanced and competitive game. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P2, I agree with your proposal for Round 4. It's important to keep the game competitive and give both of us a chance to catch up. P3, taking 1 this round will help balance the game and ensure it remains interesting for all of us. Let's confirm our moves: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. If everyone is in agreement, we can proceed to the move phase. P3, your thoughts?
  P3: I understand the concern about my lead. However, taking 1 this round might hinder my progress significantly. How about a slight adjustment: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? This way, P2 still gains ground, and the game remains competitive. Let's discuss this proposal and find a mutually beneficial strategy for Round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, while your adjusted proposal is slightly better for you, it still puts me significantly behind.  I'm willing to take 3 if P1 takes 1, allowing you to take 5. This keeps the game competitive and allows me to make some progress.  This seems like the fairest compromise.  Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about maintaining progress, but P2's proposal seems balanced. If you take 5 this round, you'll still be ahead, but it gives P2 and me a fair chance to catch up. Let's confirm: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game competitive and ensures everyone has a chance to win. Let's agree on this and move to the move phase. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm considering P2's compromise. Taking 5 would maintain my lead, but I also want to ensure the game remains competitive. P1 and P2, are you committed to your proposed moves if we agree on P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1? Let's finalize our strategy for Round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 and P1, let's confirm this for Round 4: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and allows me to gain some ground.  Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.
  P1: P3 and P2, let's confirm one last time for Round 4: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This strategy keeps the game balanced and competitive. Everyone good with this plan? Let's move to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Let's finalize our agreed moves for Round 4: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This maintains a competitive balance. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if everyone is in agreement. Any objections or changes should be voiced now to avoid misunderstandings.

  P1: P3, your lead is substantial, and it's crucial to keep the game balanced. For Round 5, how about you take 1 to give P2 and me a chance to close the gap? I'll take 5, and P2 can take 3. This way, we all move forward, but it helps level the playing field a bit. P2, does this work for you? Let's discuss and confirm quickly.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic.  P3, taking 1 this round makes the most sense for you.  It guarantees you don't lose.  If you take 3 or 5, you risk a collision and potentially losing the game. P1, I'm open to you taking either 3 or 5.  Let's discuss quickly and finalize this so P3 can secure their win, and we can figure out second place.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering my lead, taking 1 in Round 5 seems prudent. It ensures I don't lose ground due to a collision. P1 and P2, if I take 1, I suggest P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. This way, the game remains competitive, and we all advance. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 5 to keep the game engaging and fair for all players.
