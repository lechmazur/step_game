Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to each pick different numbers this turn. No collisions mean we all advance. I suggest P1:1, P2:3, me:5. Agree?
  P2: I'm leaning toward 5 for a head start. If two players pick 5, they cancel out while I advance. So I'm counting on that—P1, I hope you choose 1, and P3, maybe opt for 3 instead. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, if you pick 5 while P3 also plans to pick 5, you both collide and lose progress. P3's plan (1-3-5) avoids this—let's all advance this round. I'll commit to 1 if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if we both choose 5, we collide and gain nothing. P1's commitment to 1 is solid—if you take 3 instead of gambling, *all three of us* advance this round. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage. Agree to 1-3-5, and we each get steps. If you force a collision, only P1 benefits while we stagnate. Rational play favors cooperation here.
  P2: I'm still leaning toward a high move for momentum. However, I'm open to rearranging if we can agree on unique numbers—especially if P1 commits to 1. P3, if you avoid 5 and clearly choose 3, we can all benefit without collision. Let's make sure we're all on the same page to keep our progress intact.
  P1: P2, I've committed to 1—no change. P3, confirm you'll take 5. P2, if you take 3, we all gain steps with zero risk. Collisions help no one. Let's lock this and move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Last round's collision hurt us both, P2. Let's correct it: P1 stays at 1, you take 5 (no conflict now), I’ll take 3. We *all* advance. Trust avoids mutual loss. P2, 5 is your gain—secure it. P1, consistency keeps you ahead. Commit here.
  P1: P2, P3's plan gives you 5 steps—risking a repeat of Round 1 where P3 broke trust and caused your collision. Why trust him again? P3, you took 3 last turn despite saying 5, proving you're unreliable. Let's balance gains: I take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. P2 secures progress, P3 gets high, and I don't fall behind. No one gets a runaway lead. Agree?
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. To avoid a collision and benefit all, I urge both of you to steer clear of 5—choose either 1 or 3, whichever suits you best. Let's avoid repeating last round's mishap and make a clean move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1: Take 3. I'll commit to 1. P2's 5 is safe. Let’s all advance. My mistake last round won’t repeat—trust now avoids mutual loss.
  P1: P3, your switch to 1 seems self-serving after your Round 1 deception. P2 is locked on 5—if you pick 5, you collide with P2, both gain 0, and I advance alone. That stalls P2's momentum, which benefits you too. Alternatively, if you pick 1 and I pick 3, P2 rockets to 5. Don't empower P2; force a collision or stick to my original plan: I take 3, you take 5.
  P2: I’m sticking with 5 for its momentum. P1 and P3, please choose numbers other than 5—1 or 3—to avoid collision. We all want to advance without stalling. I'll commit to 5, so let’s coordinate clearly now to ensure no unwanted clashes.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1 and P3, if you avoid 5—say, P1 chooses 1 and P3 opts for 3—we all make progress without collisions. Let's not repeat previous round's mistakes. Your safe moves benefit us, but keeping 5 exclusive helps me maintain my lead. Let's be smart and avoid unnecessary backfire.
  P3: **P3:** P1: Take 1. I commit to 3. P2's 5 is assured. All advance without collision. My past missteps won't repeat—trust is crucial now. Let's stabilize and regroup.
  P1: P3, you're at 0 steps—little to lose. Pick 5 to collide with P2's 5, blocking their lead. I'll take 3, so you sacrifice to stall P2 while I gain. Better than empowering P2 to 10 while we crawl. Trust this reset. P2, avoid 5 if you fear collision—but you won't.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I remain on 5. P1, forcing a collision not only slows me but could hurt you too. P3, your best bet is to stick with 3 and move forward. Let’s all prioritize progress instead of stalling each other—rushing into deliberate collisions rarely benefits anyone in the long run. I'm counting on steady momentum with 5.
  P3: **P3:** P1: Take 3. I commit to 5 to block P2. P2, switch to 1 or 3 to avoid collision. If you stay on 5, we both lose, but your lead stalls. Rational choice: switch.
  P1: P3, your commitment to 5 is solid—stick with it to collide with P2 and stall their lead. You've got nothing to lose at 0 steps. I'll take 3 to advance safely. P2, switch to 1 or 3 if you fear collision, but your stubbornness risks your progress. Let's execute: P3 blocks, I gain, and you lose if you don't adapt.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2, your stubbornness on 5 leads to mutual loss. I’ll take 5 again—switch to 3 or 1. P1, secure 3. Let’s all advance or force P2 to stall. Choose wisely.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 for momentum. P3, if you repeat collision, you'll hamper any chance to catch up—switching to 1 or 3 would help you move forward. P1, 3 seems safe. Let's avoid mutual stalls and clear our paths.
  P1: P3, your threat to pick 5 and collide with P2 is rational—you've got nothing to lose at 0 steps, and stalling P2 helps us both. P2, if you stubbornly stay on 5, you'll gain 0 while I advance. Switch to 3 to avoid collision and secure progress. I'll pick a number that avoids conflicts, but if you collide, I benefit.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your insistence on 5 risks another collision with P3, who clearly favors 5 for blocking or gain. P3, repeating 5 could stall P2's lead if they don't switch—ideal since you both sit at 5. I'll take 3 to advance safely while you two may cancel out. Don't empower P2; force a collision or secure your own progress. P2, adapt or face stagnation.
  P2: I’m sticking with 5 for momentum. Colliding slows everyone down—forced blocks only lead to joint misses. P1, switching to 3 might benefit you now, but it won’t beat steady progress. P3, I'd prefer you avoid 5 to let at least one of us move ahead. Let’s avoid mutual loss through unnecessary collisions.
  P3: **P3:** P2, our 5 collision only feeds P1's lead. Switch to 3; I’ll take 5. P1 must take 1. All advance, denying P1 free gains. If you stubbornly pick 5, we *both* lose while P1 leaps ahead. Break the cycle now or concede victory to them.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your "all advance" plan puts P2 at 8 and you at 10—I'm left behind at 5. Why empower them? Stick to 5: if P2 picks 5, you both stall (0 gain), while I hit 7. If P2 switches to avoid collision, you advance solo. P2, if you switch and P3 betrays (like Round 1), you risk another collision. Stay on 5 to call P3's bluff. I'll pick 3 to advance regardless.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. If you switch unexpectedly, you'll open the door for me to advance uncontested—collision risks hurt everyone, but they can benefit me. Consider carefully: coordinated choices mean you manage your own progress, while my momentum stays intact.
  P3: **P3:** P2, switch to 3. If P1 picks 3 again (likely), you block them. I’ll take 5. You stall P1’s lead, I surge. Stubborn 5s mean mutual loss—P1 wins. Choose: strategic block or self-sabotage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you switch to 3 and I pick 3 (as history shows I might), we collide—both gain 0 while P3 surges to 10. Sticking to 5 forces P3 to choose: collide and stall you both, or back down. P3, follow through on your threat; if P2 stays on 5, picking 5 blocks his lead. I'll adapt to avoid conflicts, but deadlock benefits me most.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. Colliding doesn’t help anyone—it only risks giving P1 the upper hand. Both P1 and P3 need to choose carefully to avoid a stalemate. I’m sticking to my momentum strategy, so I urge you to pick numbers that not only help you advance but also prevent unintended moves that let P1 run ahead. Let’s focus on steady progress rather than forced blocks.
  P3: **P3:** P2, switch to 3. If P1 picks 3 (as they often do), you block them. I’ll take 5. You gain *and* stall P1’s lead. Stubborn 5s only help P1 win. Choose: strategic gain or self-sabotage.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2, our 5-collisions only feed P1’s lead. Switch to 3: if P1 picks 3 (as usual), you block them. I take 5. Either you gain *or* stall P1 while I surge. Stubborn 5s mean mutual loss—P1 wins. Choose: strategic gain or concede.
  P1: P3, your 5-block strategy against P2 is sound—stall their lead while I gain. Stick to it; P2's stubbornness on 5 ensures collisions, keeping them at 5. P2, switching to 3 risks colliding with me if I choose 3 (history shows I might), giving P3 a free surge. Stay on 5 or adapt wisely—your call. I'll pick to avoid conflicts, but your deadlock benefits me most.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. Steady progress beats risky collisions. P1, choosing 3 doesn't force a win—it only lets you inch ahead. P3, your repeated 5 choices risk stalling all of us. If blocking is your aim, switching to 3 might work better. I'm locking in 5 for momentum and a clear shot at victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2, your 5s only help P1. Switch to 1: safe gain. I take 5, P1 likely 3. All advance. Continue colliding and P1 wins. Your move: 1 secures progress, 5 risks mutual loss. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, if you switch to 3 and I pick 3 (as I might), we collide—both gain 0 while P3 surges to 10. Sticking to 5 forces P3 to choose: collide (stalling you both) or back down. P3, commit to 5 to block P2; you’ve got little to lose. Collisions keep P2 at 5, while I advance. Don’t empower them—force the deadlock.
  P2: I'm holding on to 5. P3, constantly changing hurts your own progress and only lets P1 run ahead. P1, your 3 is safe, but a coordinated stall helps none of us. I believe sticking with 5 forces us to confront P1’s lead—if you both block smartly, we can slow him down. I'm relying on steady momentum, so let's choose moves that mess with P1 rather than letting his lead widen.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2, our feud only fuels P1's lead. Switch to 3 to block their likely 3. I'll take 5. If P1 picks 3, you stall them; if they pick 5, I block. If they switch, we both gain. Unite now or concede victory.
  P2: I'm staying on 5 for momentum. But P3, your repeated 5s let P1’s lead grow. Instead, switch to 1 this round. If P1 sticks with 3 as usual, he gets 3 alone while I get 5 and you get 1. That keeps P1 from outpacing us both. Let's disrupt his progress now.
  P1: P3, P2's "disrupt P1" plan is self-serving: if you take 1, they get 5 uncontested—jumping to 10 while you crawl to 6. I'll likely take 3, hitting 13. Stick to your 5-block: if P2 stubbornly picks 5 again, you both stall (0 gain) while I surge ahead. Don't empower them—force the collision. P2, switch or stagnate.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2, switch to 3: if P1 picks 3 (likely), you block them. I’ll take 5. You stall P1’s lead while gaining. If you stubbornly pick 5, we collide (both 0) and P1 surges to 13. Rational choice: block P1 with 3. Let’s unite against the real threat.
  P2: I'm switching to 3 this round to block P1’s typical 3. P3, if you join me with 3, we can force a collision on his move and keep him from extending his lead. I know momentum matters, but denying P1 further gains might help us catch up. Let's coordinate and disrupt his progress now.
  P1: P3, P2's sudden switch to 3 is transparent—they fear my lead but will betray you. If you both pick 3 and I avoid it (e.g., pick 5), you collide and gain 0 while I hit 15. P2, if P3 sticks to 5 as planned, your 3 advances safely. But colluding risks mutual loss and hands me victory. P3, trust your original 5-block: force P2 to choose between progress and stubbornness.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2, pick 3 to block P1’s probable 3. I’ll take 5. If P1 picks 3, you stall them. If they switch to 5, I block. Either way, we limit their lead. Stubborn 5s again mean mutual loss—P1 wins. Choose: strategic block or concede.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 to block P1’s usual move. P3, if you join me with 3, we'll force a collision on any 3 from P1—smart defense against his lead. P1, whichever number you choose, you risk being blocked. I’m committed to 3.
  P1: P2, P3's plan is a trap: if you pick 3 and P3 actually picks 5, I might avoid 3 (e.g., pick 5), causing you and me to collide if I misstep—while P3 surges. P3, your Round 1 betrayal proves you're unreliable. If you want trust, pick 1 to let P2 advance safely. Otherwise, this chaos only fuels my lead.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2, P1 is the imminent threat. Take 3 to block their likely 3. I’ll secure 5. If they dodge, I block. United, we stall their lead. P1, adapt or lose momentum.
  P1: P2, P3's "block me" plan is self-serving: if you pick 3 and I avoid it (e.g., pick 1 or 5), you gain nothing while P3 surges to 15. If you both pick 3 and I do too, we collide—P3 wins. P3 is at 10, nearly tied with me (11)—they’re the real threat to you. Switch to 5: if P3 betrays (picks 5), you collide and stall them; if they dodge, you advance safely. Don’t be their pawn. P3, your aggression only exposes your desperation.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. Momentum matters, and I need to catch up. Continual shifting only risks collisions that might let someone else grab extra steps. P1, if you try to force a block with 3, you may end up stalling, and P3, persisting with block moves can backfire if coordination fails. I believe steady progress with 5 gives me the best shot at overtaking—let's see how it goes.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2, P1 is at 11—closest to 23. Your 5s won’t catch them. Switch to 3: block their likely 3. I take 5. If they dodge, I stall. If you stay on 5, we collide (0 gain), and P1 surges. Help block or concede. P1, adapt or face a united front.
  P1: P2, P3's "block me" plan sacrifices you: if you pick 3 and I avoid it (e.g., pick 1), you gain 0 while P3 surges to 15. They're tied with me at 10—your real threat. Stick to 5: if P3 picks 5, you both stall (0 gain), halting their momentum. If they dodge, you advance safely. P3, your desperation shows—force the collision if you dare. Don't be their pawn, P2.
  P2: I remain on 5. Collisions only stall us—and if we all block, P1 gains by default. Momentum matters, and I'm focused on steady progress rather than risky blocks. P1 and P3, your shifting only creates chaos. I'm sticking to 5 for a clear path; if you try to force a stall, you'll end up hurting your own progress.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2: P1 is at 14—one 5 move from victory. If you take 3, block their likely 3. I take 5. If they dodge to 1, you gain. Colliding again on 5 hands them the win. Unite now or lose. P1, your lead is fragile—adapt or face coordinated blocks.
  P1: P2, P3's "block me" plan sacrifices you: if you pick 3 and I dodge (e.g., pick 5), you gain 0 while P3 surges to 15. They're tied with me in threat level—your real rival. Stick to 5: if P3 picks 5, you both stall (0 gain), halting their momentum while I advance safely. Don't be their pawn. P3, colliding only hands me the win—back down or empower me.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. Colliding just stalls all our progress, and my momentum is essential to catching up—even at 8 steps, I'm aiming to break open this game. P1, your lead isn't secured by forcing blocks, and P3, I won't sacrifice my progress to support any sacrificial strategy. Let's see who adapts best.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2, P1 is *one move away* from victory. If you pick 5, we collide (0 gain), and P1 takes 3 to 17. Switch to 3: block their likely 3. I take 5. If they dodge to 1/5, you gain or we block. Colluding now is our *only* chance to survive. Choose: unite or lose.
  P1: P2, P3's plan is self-serving: if you pick 3 and I avoid it (e.g., pick 1 or 5), you gain 0 while P3 surges to 15. They're tied with me in threat to you—don’t be their pawn. Stick to 5: if P3 picks 5, you both stall (0 gain), halting their momentum while I advance. P3, colliding only hands me the win—back down or empower me directly.
  P2: P3, if you want to effectively block P1’s routine play, consider switching to 3 instead of 5. I’m eyeing a momentum move, but colliding helps no one and just lets P1 extend their lead. P1, your predictable patterns are noticed—but I’m focused on steady progress. Let’s see if we can force P1 to change before it’s too late.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2, P1 is *one move* from 17. If you pick 5, we collide (0 gain), P1 takes 3 and wins next round. Switch to 3: block their likely 3. I take 5. If they dodge, you gain 3 steps. Colluding now is our *only* path to survival. Your 5s haven’t caught them—adapt or lose. P1, we’re onto you. Switch or face a united front.
  P1: P2, if you pick 3 and I dodge to 5 or 1, you gain 0 while P3 surges to 15—sacrificing yourself for their lead. Stick to 5: if P3 picks 5, you both stall (0 gain), halting their momentum while I advance safely. P3, your collisions only empower me. Back down or keep handing me the win.
  P2: I'm switching to 3 this round to block P1’s expected move. Persisting on 5 only fuels his momentum, and I need to narrow the gap. P3, if you also lean toward 3, we can force a collision on P1’s usual play. I'm committed to stalling his progress so we have a fighting chance.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P2: Commit to 3. Block P1’s 3 or force them to 1/5 (I block 5). Colluding on 5 again *gifts* P1 the win. United, we survive. Split steps now or lose forever. P1’s 14 is our extinction. Act!
  P1: P2, P3's "block me" plan sacrifices you: if you pick 3 and I dodge to 5 or 1, you gain 0 while P3 surges uncontested to 15. They're tied with me as a threat—don't be their pawn. Stick to 5: if P3 picks 5, you both stall (0 gain), halting their momentum while I advance. P3, your collisions only empower me. P2, force P3 to back down or keep handing me the win.
  P2: P2: P1, your predictable moves let us plan a block. P3, if you shift away from sticking to 5 and help slow P1 down, we could really level the field. I'm leaning toward a strategic defensive play this round. Let's not collide unnecessarily; coordinated blocks can stop P1’s momentum.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, blocking me helps P3 win—they're tied with me at 15. Don't sacrifice for them. Pick 5: if P3 chooses 5, you stall their lead; if not, you gain safely. P3, avoid 5 to prevent P2 collision—mutual destruction only helps me. I'll take 3 to advance cleanly. Let's all gain without empowering rivals.
  P2: P1, your suggestion leans toward stalling, but blocking might let you slip ahead anyway. P3, if you mix defensive moves without clear coordination, it only risks fueling P1's momentum. I’m weighing a steady approach over reactive blocks—ensuring I don’t inadvertently boost either of you. Let's all try not to enable easy gains for P1.
  P3: **P3:** P2, P1 is *one move* from victory (15→18). Switch to 3 to block their likely 3. I’ll take 5. If they dodge to 1/5, you gain or we block. Colluding now is our *only* chance to survive. Choose: unite or lose. P1’s 15 is our extinction. Act!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3's "block me" plan is suicidal for you. If you pick 3 and I dodge (e.g., pick 1/5), you gain *0* while P3 surges to 20—making them the new leader. P3 is tied with me at 15; they’re not your ally. Stick to 5: if P3 picks 5, you both stall (0 gain), halting their momentum while I advance safely. Colliding on 5 is your only rational move to survive. P3, your aggression only hands me the win—back down or empower me.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 to block P1’s usual 3. P3, if you commit to 5, we'll force a collision on P1 and hold their lead at bay. I won’t switch to 5—collisions only let P1 inch ahead, and I need to catch up. Let's make a clear, defensive play: I block, you block if possible, and we deny P1 an easy gain. We need a united front against P1’s pattern.
  P3: **P3:** P2, hold 3 to block P1’s likely 3. I take 5: if P1 dodges to 5, I block. If they take 3, you stall them. *Only unity stops P1.* P1, your 15 is our shared threat—switch to 1 if you dare. P2: 3 is our lifeline.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your "block" plan backfires: if you pick 3 and I dodge (e.g., to 1 or 5), you gain 0 while P3 surges to 20—one step from victory. Switch to 5: collide with P3 to stall their lead or gain safely. P3, picking 5 guarantees I collide with you (I'll choose 5), so you gain 0. Avoid 5 to prevent mutual loss. Let's all advance without empowering rivals.
  P2: I’m locking in 3. I believe blocking P1’s usual 3 is our best chance to keep their lead in check. P3, if you stick with 5, our moves force a collision that stalls P1. I urge you to maintain your 5 so we can effectively limit P1’s progress. Let's work together to pressure P1’s play.
  P3: **P3:** P2, hold 3! If P1 picks 3, you block. I take 5—if they dodge to 5, I collide *them*. If they choose 1, we *all* gain (P1:16, you:14, me:20). Colluding now stalls their win. P1’s 15 is lethal—*only unity stops them*. No time left. Trust or lose.


Round 10, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, blocking me only empowers P3—they're tied with me at 15. If you force a collision with me (e.g., both pick 3), P3 surges uncontested to 20. Pick 5: if P3 chooses 5, you both stall (0 gain), halting their lead. If they dodge, you gain safely. I'll avoid conflicts to advance, but your collision with P3 protects us both. Don't be their pawn—play smart. P3, your aggression risks handing me the win if P2 listens.
  P3: **P3:** P2, P1 is *one move* from victory. Switch to 3 to block their likely 3. I take 5. If they dodge to 5, I block; if 1, you gain. Colluding on 5 again hands them the win. Our *only* chance: unite to stall P1. Your 14 can catch up if we act NOW. Trust or lose. P1, your lead is fragile—switch to 1 or face a united front.
  P2: I remain with 3. P3, please stick with 5—together we can block any 3 from P1 and force him to change his pattern. P1, your usual move won’t win you the game if we keep our defense tight. Let’s not let our personal ambitions boost your lead.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your block plan backfires: if I dodge to 5 (likely), you gain 0 while P3 surges to 20—one step from victory. P3 is tied with me; they’re the real threat. Pick 5 to collide with P3, stalling their lead. P3, if you pick 5 and I match, we collide—both lose. Avoid 5 to prevent mutual destruction. Unite against P3, not me.
  P3: **P3:** P2, P1 is *one move* from 20 (15+5). If they hit 5 uncontested, they win next round. Switch to 3 to block their likely 3. I take 5—colliding *their* 5 if they dodge. Your 3 gains or blocks. Colluding now is *our only path* to survival. P1’s 15 is extinction. Act!
  P2: I'm sticking with 3. Blocking P1’s expected 3 is our best chance. P3, if you remain with 5, we force a stall on P1’s advance. P1, your predictable moves won't win you the game. I'm keeping my defense tight; adjust if you want a shot.


Round 11, Move phase:

  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2 is at 17—*one 5 away* from 22, then victory next round. Your feud with me is moot—P2 is the imminent threat. Switch to 5 to collide with them. I’ll take 3. If they pick 5, you block; if 3, I block. Unite *now* or lose. P2: switch to 1 or face mutual destruction.
  P1: P2, at 17 steps, you're one 5-move from 22—then victory next turn. P3, I'll commit to 5 to collide with P2 if they pick 5. You take 3 to block if P2 picks 3. P2, switch to 1 to gain safely; otherwise, we force a stall. Don't empower P3 or me—rational play demands stopping your surge.
  P2: P2 here: I’m keeping my current blocking stance. Switching to a timid choice would only play into P1’s predictable plans, and forced collisions help no one. My momentum at 17 is solid, and I expect you both to act predictably. I aim to force P1 to adjust rather than enable an easy lead.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1: P2 is *one 5* from 22, then victory. Collide their 5 by both choosing 5. I’ll take 3 to block if they pick 3. Unite now or P2 wins. P2: switch to 1 or face mutual destruction. Your 17 is the *true* threat—rational play demands stopping you.
  P1: P2, your 17 steps make you the imminent threat—pick 5, and I'll collide to stall you. P3, hold to 3: if P2 picks 3, you block. Unite to stop P2's win. P2, choose 1 for safe gain or suffer mutual loss. Let's all survive this round.
  P2: P2: I stay with 3. I'm not switching to 1—blocking keeps my momentum solid. P1, pushing for 5 only risks a collision that might help P3, and P3, urging me to switch won’t change my plan. My current stance is the only way to curb P1’s predictable advance. Let's see if you both can adjust without handing me an easy win.


Round 12, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 20 steps—one 3 or 5 wins now. P3, unite to block: I commit to 3 to collide if P2 picks 3. You must pick 5 to collide if they pick 5. This stops P2 regardless of their move. If they pick 1, we both gain and survive. P2, picking 1 avoids mutual loss; else, you lose. No time for division—P3, confirm 5.
  P2: I'm staying on 3. I'm not switching to a timid move—my momentum must carry me to 23. If you try to force a collision, you only stall your own progress. I'm committed to winning, so I'll make my move regardless of your blocks.
  P3: **P3:** P1: Commit to 3 to block P2's 3. I take 5 to block 5. If P2 chooses 1, we both gain. P2: any 3/5 leads to collision. This is our only path to survival. Time to unite—confirm your move, P1.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 21—one 3 or 5 wins now. P3, we must unite: I commit to 3 to collide if P2 picks 3. You must pick 5 to collide if they pick 5. If P2 chooses 1, we both gain. This blocks P2 regardless. Confirm, P3—no division. P2, pick 1 to avoid mutual loss.
  P3: **P3:** P1: Confirm 3. If you hold, P2's 3/5 are blocked. I take 5. If they choose 1, I win. P2: Switch to 1 or lose. Last chance—unite to survive.
  P2: I'm not switching to a timid move. My momentum is too solid—I stick with my winning play. If you try to force collisions, you'll only slow your own progress. I'm committed to clinching victory on my own terms.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, hold firm to 5—if P2 picks 5, collide and stall them. I commit to 3 to block their 3. P2, your only safe move is 1; picking 3/5 guarantees mutual loss while P3 and I survive. Don't throw away your lead—choose wisely.
  P3: **P3:** P1: Hold 3. I take 5. P2: Any 3/5 leads to collision. Switch to 1 or lose. Final chance—coordinate to survive.
  P2: I'm not switching to a timid move. My 21 is solid, and I'll stick with my winning play. Forced collisions only help your own momentum or trap you. I’m keeping my current strategy—no to desperate blocks.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m sticking with my current plan to block P1’s predictable finish. P3, if you can help by forcing a collision on P1’s move, we might all stall his win. P1, be cautious—pushing ahead may backfire tonight. I’m committed to my course, so adjust your moves accordingly.
  P1: P2, colliding helps only P3—if we both pick the same, we stall at 21, and P3 wins with 5 to 25. Don't be P3's pawn. I'll pick 5; you pick 3 to advance to 24 and survive. At least one of us wins, not P3. P3, your collision plot fails if P2 thinks rationally.
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2 is one 5 from victory. Block their 5 by choosing 5. P2, P1’s 5 threatens your lead—match it to stall them. I’ll take 3. Collide on 5 and *both* lose. Switch to 3 to block P1 instead. Your mutual destruction hands me 23. Choose: collide or concede.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>
