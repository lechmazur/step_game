Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone, first turn. To avoid collisions, maybe we can try picking different numbers? Like P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5? Let me know what you think.
  P3: Sounds good to me—I'll take 5 this turn. P1 grabs 1, P2 takes 3; no collisions, everyone advances. Let’s keep that simple pattern for now.
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan for the first round. I'll take 3. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let's see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I'll stick with 1 as planned. Looks like we're all set for this round.
  P3: Great—let’s lock in the 1/3/5 split for the first three rounds (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5) and revisit after that. Sound okay?
  P2: Okay, let's try the 1/3/5 split for the first three rounds as P3 suggested. We can re-evaluate after round 3 based on the scores.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds good for the 1/3/5 split in this first round. Let's see how it plays out and then discuss the strategy for the next rounds. Agree to review after this turn.
  P3: All set then—sticking with 5 this round as agreed.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, sticking with the plan for Round 2: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I'll go with 3 again this turn. We should definitely check the scores after this round though, P3 is getting a nice lead.
  P3: I'm locking in 5 again this turn as per our 3-round agreement. After Round 3 we can revisit and maybe rotate numbers. Everyone still good?
  P1: Okay, I'll stick with 1 for this round as planned. We definitely need to discuss strategy for Round 3 given the scores. P3 is building a significant lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all sticking to the 1/3/5 plan for this round. I'm ready to move.
  P3: All good—still taking 5 this round as planned. After Round 3 let’s discuss rotating numbers so things stay balanced.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for the 1/3/5 split this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). I'm sticking to 1. We definitely need a serious discussion about Round 3 strategy after this turn, P3's lead is growing. Ready to move when everyone else is.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, confirmed. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed: I’m taking 5 again this round (our last of the 3-round block). 

To keep things balanced afterward, how about we rotate the numbers every turn:

• Round 4 – P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1  
• Round 5 – P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3  
• Round 6 – back to 1/3/5, then repeat the cycle.

That way everyone gets a shot at the 5 and we avoid collisions. Ready to lock moves for this round—let me know if you’re on board.
  P1: Okay, I see P3's proposal for rotation starting in Round 4. However, as I mentioned, we need to discuss Round 3 strategy first, as the current 1/3/5 plan for 3 rounds puts me at a significant disadvantage. Let's discuss Round 3 right after this turn's moves. Ready for the move phase now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Last round’s double-5 stalled progress, so let’s reset with a clean, fair rotation:

Round 3 P1 = 5  P2 = 3  P3 = 1  
Round 4 P1 = 1  P2 = 5  P3 = 3  
Round 5 P1 = 3  P2 = 1  P3 = 5  

Then repeat the cycle. No collisions, everybody gets the 5 once every three turns. Good to lock this in?
  P2: Okay P3, that rotation plan seems fair after last round's collision. I agree to take 3 this round (Round 3), with P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 1. Let's stick to this specific plan for this round to get things back on track. P1, are you good with taking 5 this round?
  P1: Okay, P2, thanks for asking. Yes, I agree to the proposed plan for this round (Round 3): I will take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This seems like a fair way to reset after the collision. Let's confirm this for this turn and see how the scores look. We can discuss the rotation plan for future rounds afterward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed: this round P1 ➔ 5, P2 ➔ 3, P3 ➔ 1. After we see the updated scores, let’s finalize the 3-turn rotation I outlined so everyone cycles through 1-3-5 without collisions. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, confirmed for Round 3: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm sticking with 3. Let's lock this in and move to the next phase.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan for this round. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed one last time: this turn—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. After we see the updated scores, let’s commit to the 3-turn rotation (each of us cycles through 1→3→5) so we avoid further collisions. Ready to move.
  P2: Alright, everyone seems firmly agreed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. I'm sticking with 3. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan for this round. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As agreed, let’s lock the 3-turn rotation:

• Round 4 – P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3  
• Round 5 – P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  
• Round 6 – P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  

No collisions, everyone cycles through 1-3-5. Ready to confirm Round 4 now—are we all set?
  P2: Okay P3, that rotation plan looks good. I agree to take 5 this round (Round 4), with P1 taking 1 and you taking 3. Let's stick to this to keep things moving smoothly. P1, are you on board with taking 1 this round?
  P1: Okay, P2, I see the plan for this round is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I will take 1 this round to avoid collisions. However, I need to express concerns about the proposed rotation plan for future rounds. It seems to benefit P2 and P3 more than me and could put me at a disadvantage. Let's discuss the overall rotation strategy after this round's moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, this rotation is perfectly symmetric—over any 3-turn block we each gain 9 steps, so no one’s advantaged long-term. You’re already in the lead, so you stay in front for now. Let’s keep Round 4 as agreed (P1 1, P2 5, P3 3) and revisit plans after we see the new scores. If you have a different collision-free idea, let’s hear it; otherwise I’m locking in 3 this turn.
  P2: Okay P1, I understand your concern about the long term, but as P3 mentioned, the rotation gives everyone a turn with 5. For this round, let's definitely stick to the agreed plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I'm ready to play 5. We can review the scores and the rotation plan again after this move, as you suggested. Let's lock this round in.
  P1: Hold on. Looking at the scores (P1=7, P2=6, P3=6), the proposed P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 split for *this specific round* is clearly unfair to me. It puts me significantly behind P2. I cannot agree to play 1 this turn under this plan. We need a different distribution for Round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Fair compromise: this round P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
• P1 gets the boost you want.  
• P2 still advances without collision.  
• I take the small step to keep things balanced.  

Next turn we can rotate (P1 1, P2 5, P3 3) so everyone cycles fairly. Sound acceptable?
  P2: P3, your new proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) just repeats last round and gives P1 a big lead (12 vs 9 vs 7).

P1, the original plan for this round (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) leads to scores 8, 11, 9. Yes, I'd be slightly ahead, but the scores are much closer overall than if you take 5 now. A 3-point gap is easily managed with the rotation, while a 5-point lead is harder for others to catch.

Let's stick to the previously agreed rotation for this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It keeps the game competitive. I'm planning to play 5 based on that.
  P1: P2, playing 1 puts me at 8 while you go to 11. That's not competitive for me this round. P3's compromise (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) gets me to 12, you to 9. While a larger lead, it's fairer given my current score. I cannot play 1. Let's do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, that collision last round wasn't helpful, especially since P3 got ahead. P3 is now at 9, P1 at 7, and I'm at 6.

We need a plan that avoids collision and prevents P3 from extending their lead significantly.

Let's try this for Round 5: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.
This gives P1 the 5 they wanted last round, I get a solid 3, and crucially, P3 only gets 1, keeping the scores closer (P1=12, P2=9, P3=10).

P1, P3, does this sound like a fair plan for this round to keep things competitive?
  P3: I’m fine avoiding collisions, but taking only 1 while I’m barely ahead (9-7-6) feels lopsided. How about a balanced three-turn cycle so we each net 9 steps:

Round 5 P1 = 3  P2 = 5  P3 = 1  
Round 6 P1 = 1  P2 = 3  P3 = 5  
Round 7 P1 = 5  P2 = 1  P3 = 3  

Everybody gets the 5 once and totals stay level. If that’s acceptable, I’ll lock 1 this turn; otherwise let’s hear a truly symmetric alternative.
  P1: Okay, P2, your proposal for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) sounds good to me. It allows me to gain some ground after the previous rounds and avoids collisions. P3, while I appreciate the idea of a rotation, P2's plan for this specific round is better for my current position. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this turn and see how the scores stand afterward before committing to a long-term rotation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, glad we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. I will stick to playing 3.

P3, I understand wanting a long-term plan, but let's get through this round without collision first. Taking 1 this round keeps the scores close (P1=12, P2=9, P3=10) and avoids the stagnation we saw last round. We can definitely finalize a rotation plan starting next round. Let's lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for now. Ready to move.
  P3: Fine—let’s lock this round collision-free: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. After the scores update, we MUST adopt a symmetric 3-turn rotation so nobody’s stuck low each time. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan for this round. I am ready to move with 5. Let's get this round done and then discuss the next steps.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all set and agreed for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm sticking with 3. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed: this turn P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Next turn we begin the fair 3-turn rotation (P1 3, P2 1, P3 5). Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, confirmed again for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase. Ready.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3 are tied ahead of me after last round's collision. We need a plan that gets everyone advancing this turn. To balance the scores, I propose for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This would put scores at P1=12, P2=10, P3=12, keeping things competitive. Does this sound fair for this turn?
  P2: P1, your plan avoids collision, but it gives you 5 again after you just got it in R3 and tried (colliding) in R4 and R5. It also puts both you and P3 ahead of me.

How about this instead for Round 6: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1?
This gives me the 5 (I haven't successfully used 5 yet!), keeps you and P3 level with each other, and avoids collision. Scores would be P1=10, P2=14, P3=10.

This seems like a fair way to distribute the 5s this round and keeps the game moving. What do you both think?
  P3: We keep circling—let’s just lock a clean 3-turn cycle that gives each of us one 5, one 3, one 1:

Round 6 P1 = 1 P2 = 3 P3 = 5  
Round 7 P1 = 5 P2 = 1 P3 = 3  
Round 8 P1 = 3 P2 = 5 P3 = 1  

• Everyone nets exactly 9 steps over the block—perfect symmetry.  
• No collisions, no one feels short-changed.  
• P1 gets the 5 next turn, P2 the one after.

If we can all type “confirmed” on this, we can finally move and stop wasting turns. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, while a cycle is good, starting with me taking 1 when I'm already behind P2 and P3 is not fair. P2's proposal puts P2 too far ahead.

My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) balances the scores better this round (12, 10, 12). Let's do this to avoid collision and keep the game competitive. We can discuss a cycle for future rounds after this one. Are you both okay with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this turn?
  P2: P1, your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) leads to scores 12, 10, 12. You get 5 again, I get 1, and you end up ahead of me. That doesn't feel balanced from my perspective.

My earlier proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) leads to 10, 14, 10. This gives me the 5 I haven't successfully used yet (unlike P1 who got 5 in R3). Yes, I'd be ahead, but the gap isn't huge, and it distributes the 5 fairly over time.

P3, P1 is unlikely to agree to your plan (P1=1). Would you agree to take 1 this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to ensure no collision and let me finally get a 5? We can then implement a fair rotation starting next round.
  P3: New compromise—3-turn rotation, totally symmetric (each nets 9):

Round 6 P1 = 5 P2 = 1 P3 = 3  
Round 7 P1 = 3 P2 = 5 P3 = 1  
Round 8 P1 = 1 P2 = 3 P3 = 5  

P1 gets the catch-up boost now, P2 gets the 5 next, I get it third. Nobody stalls, nobody favored long-term. If we all type “confirmed”, I’ll lock 3 this turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, your latest proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round, followed by that rotation) is acceptable. It gives me the boost I need this turn and sets a fair cycle.

I confirm agreement to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for Round 6, and the subsequent 3-turn rotation you outlined starting in Round 7.

Ready to move.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I see you've agreed on the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round, followed by the rotation P3 outlined (R7: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, etc.).

While taking 1 isn't ideal for me this round, I agree to it to avoid another collision and keep the game moving. Let's lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for Round 6 and commit to the rotation starting Round 7.

Confirmed: I will play 1 this round. Ready to move.
  P3: Confirmed—playing 3 this round as agreed. Next turns:  
R7 P1→3 P2→5 P3→1  
R8 P1→1 P2→3 P3→5  
Stick to this so we all advance without another collision. Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 now leads. Let’s lock a collision-free, perfectly symmetric 3-turn block—everyone gains +9 overall and P2 still stays slightly ahead:

Round 7 P1 = 1 P2 = 3 P3 = 5  
Round 8 P1 = 5 P2 = 1 P3 = 3  
Round 9 P1 = 3 P2 = 5 P3 = 1  

No one is disadvantaged long-term and we finally stop wasting turns. Please type “confirmed” if you agree so we can move.
  P1: Okay, P3, taking 1 this round puts me further behind both of you (P1=8, P2=13, P3=14). That's not acceptable from my current position (7, 10, 9).

Let's do the plan we agreed on last round before the collision: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This results in scores 12, 11, 12, which is much fairer for me and keeps the game balanced.

We can discuss a rotation starting next round. Are P2 and P3 okay with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this turn?
  P2: P1, your proposal has me taking 1 again, which isn't fair since I'm leading and just took 1 last turn. It puts me behind both you and P3.

P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts you ahead.

Let's try this for Round 7: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
Scores become P1=10, P2=15, P3=10.
This gives me the 5, keeps P1 and P3 level, and avoids collision. P1, you get 3 (better than 1). P3, taking 1 prevents P1 from getting 5 and keeps the game somewhat close. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s settle this with a strictly even 3-turn cycle—each of us gets one 5, one 3, one 1 (total +9 each):

Round 7 P1 = 3 P2 = 1 P3 = 5  
Round 8 P1 = 5 P2 = 3 P3 = 1  
Round 9 P1 = 1 P2 = 5 P3 = 3  

• P1 moves 3 now (better than 1) and gets the 5 next turn.  
• P2 waits just one round for the 5.  
• Perfect symmetry—no one falls behind long-term.  

If you both type “confirmed,” I’ll lock 5 this turn.
  P1: P3, your latest proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts you too far ahead (14) and leaves me behind (10). That's not acceptable from my current position.

As I proposed earlier, let's stick to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for *this round*. This results in scores 12, 11, 12, which is much fairer and keeps the game competitive.

Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for Round 7 to avoid collision and balance scores. We can discuss a rotation plan for future rounds afterward. Are you both okay with this for this turn?
  P2: P1, your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) puts me behind both you and P3, so I can't agree to play 1. My previous proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) seems fair as I haven't successfully played 5 yet, but agreement seems difficult.

How about this compromise for Round 7: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
Scores would become P1=12, P2=13, P3=10.
P1, you get the 5 you want. P3, you take 1, preventing a major lead shift and avoiding collision. I take 3 and maintain a slight lead. This keeps things close and avoids another wasted round. Can we agree on this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s end the stalemate with a perfectly even 3-turn cycle—each of us gets one 5, one 3, one 1 (so everyone gains +9 overall):

Round 7 P1 = 3  P2 = 1  P3 = 5  
Round 8 P1 = 5  P2 = 3  P3 = 1  
Round 9 P1 = 1  P2 = 5  P3 = 3  

After the block scores would be P2 19, P3 18, P1 16—still close, totally symmetric, zero collisions. Please type “confirmed” so we can finally advance.
  P1: Okay, we are stuck again. My current score is 7, putting me behind P2 (10) and P3 (9). I need to take 5 this round to catch up.

The plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 results in balanced scores (12, 11, 12) and avoids collision. This is the fairest outcome for me this turn.

P2, P3, can we please agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round? I am ready to play 5 if we confirm this plan.
  P2: Okay, this deadlock isn't helping anyone. P1, you clearly want 5. P3, you also seem to want 5 based on your last proposed rotation. If you both play 5, we have another wasted round.

Let's revisit my compromise: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
Scores become: P1=12, P2=13, P3=10.
P1, you get the 5 you need. I get 3 and maintain a slight lead. P3, taking 1 prevents a collision, keeps you close, and guarantees we all advance. This seems like the only way forward without collision right now.

P3, can you agree to take 1 this round so we can move on?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, that collision on 3 hurt both me and P3, while P1 gained a lead. We definitely need to avoid collisions now.

P1 is at 12, I'm at 10, P3 is at 9. To keep things competitive and moving, how about this plan for Round 8:
P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3.

This results in scores: P1=13, P2=15, P3=12.
It avoids collision, gives me the 5 (which I haven't successfully played yet), gives P3 a solid 3, and slows down the leader P1 slightly while guaranteeing progress for everyone.

P1, P3, what do you think? Let's get a clean round in.
  P3: Symmetric, collision-free plan that gives each of us one 5, one 3, one 1 over the next three turns:

Round 8  P1 = 1 P2 = 3 P3 = 5  
Round 9  P1 = 3 P2 = 5 P3 = 1  
Round 10 P1 = 5 P2 = 1 P3 = 3  

Everyone gains exactly +9 in the block. Scores after R8 would be P1 13, P2 13, P3 14—still neck-and-neck, with P2 getting the 5 next turn as desired. Type “confirmed” if you’re in.
  P1: Okay, I see both P2's and P3's proposals, both involving me taking 1 this round. While taking 1 isn't ideal from my current leading position, P3's proposal includes a clear, symmetric 3-turn rotation (P1=1/3/5, P2=3/5/1, P3=5/1/3) that guarantees equal progress (+9) for everyone over three rounds and puts me in a strong position (21 steps) after Round 10.

I agree to P3's plan for Round 8 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and the subsequent rotation outlined.

Ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P1 has agreed to P3's proposed plan and rotation. To avoid another collision and keep the game moving predictably for the next few rounds, I will also agree.

Confirmed for Round 8: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
And confirmed for the 3-round rotation proposed by P3:
R9: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1
R10: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3

I will play 3 this round. Ready to move.
  P3: Confirmed—locking Round 8: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. After we see the new scores, we can review the next steps to stay collision-free.
  P1: Okay, confirmed again for the P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 plan this round and the rotation for R9-R10. Ready to move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay everyone, Round 9. As we all explicitly agreed last round, the plan is:
P1 = 3
P2 = 5
P3 = 1

This follows the rotation we confirmed (P1=1/3/5, P2=3/5/1, P3=5/1/3). It's my turn for 5. Let's stick to this to ensure smooth progress and avoid the collisions that have slowed us down.

I am playing 5 this round as agreed. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Confirmed: sticking with the rotation we all accepted—this round P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1. Let’s get a clean, collision-free move in and keep things predictable.
  P1: Okay, confirming the agreed plan for this round (Round 9): P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

Let's stick to this to ensure a clean round and keep the game moving. I am ready to play 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm sticking with 5 as agreed. Let's lock this in and move to the next phase. Ready.
  P3: Confirmed. Keeping to the agreed rotation:  
Round 9 → P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1 (I’m locking 1).  
Then we finish the block next turn with P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3.  
No collisions, steady progress—ready to move.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We are all confirmed for the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan this round. Let's proceed to the move phase. Ready.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, confirmed one last time from my side as well. Sticking to the agreed plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm playing 5. Let's get this round done smoothly. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed—ready to move.
  P1: Okay, confirmed again for the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan this round. Ready to move.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your decision to play 5 last round broke our agreement, caused a collision, and put P1 in the lead at 16.

The old plan for this round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) puts P1 at 21, which is too close to the win. We can't let P1 run away with the game.

I propose a new plan for Round 10: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
This leads to scores P1=17, P2=18, P3=17. It prevents P1 from getting a dominant lead, gives me the 5 I missed due to the collision you caused, and keeps the scores tight.

P1, playing 1 avoids a potential collision on 5 and keeps the game competitive. P3, playing 3 keeps you right in the mix. Let's agree on this to ensure we all advance and prevent an easy win for P1.
  P1: P2, taking 1 this round puts me at a disadvantage and allows you to take the lead significantly. I cannot agree to P1=1.

While the old plan (P1=5) gets me very close, I understand the concern about a runaway win.

How about a compromise for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? This results in scores P1=19, P2=18, P3=15. P2 gets the 5 they want, I advance a reasonable amount, and P3 advances without collision. This keeps the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: Fine—let’s lock a clean, collision-free compromise:

Round 10 → P1 = 3,  P2 = 5,  P3 = 1  (scores 19-18-15, still close).

In return, Round 11 we swap forward one slot so I take the 5:  
P1 1,  P2 3,  P3 5.

Everyone gets a turn with the big jump and we stay even. I’m ready to play 1 this turn if you both type “confirmed.”


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I see you've both agreed on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This plan works for me as I get the 5. I will stick to playing 5.

Let's lock this in to avoid another collision. I also acknowledge P3's proposal for the R11 rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) which seems fair to follow up.

Confirmed: Playing 5 this round. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, confirmed for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round. I will play 3. The proposed R11 rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) seems like a fair plan to follow up with. Ready to move.
  P3: Confirmed again: Round 10 stays P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. I’m locking 1. Next roundwe stick to P1 1, P2 3, P3 5 (or another collision-free idea), but for now let’s move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, everyone seems confirmed on the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I am sticking with 5 as agreed. Let's have a clean round. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Okay, confirmed again for the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan this round. Ready to move.
  P3: Confirmed—locking 1 this turn. Next round we stick to the swap we just agreed: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. Clean path, no collisions. Ready to move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's look at the current scores: P1=19, P2=18, P3=15. The previously discussed plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) would put me behind P2 (20 vs 21) and tied with P3 (20). This is not a good outcome for me as the current leader. I am in a position to win this round by taking 5 (19+5=24). To avoid further complex rounds and potential collisions, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to win cleanly (24, 21, 16). Are you both willing to agree to this plan to end the game now?
  P2: P1, I obviously can't agree to a plan where you win immediately. I'm at 18 steps and need 5 to reach the target score of 23. Therefore, my only logical move is to play 5 this round to try and win myself.

If you also play 5, we will collide, halting both our progress and potentially letting P3 catch up.

To avoid this collision, I suggest you play 3. If we coordinate P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, the scores become P1=22, P2=23, P3=16. Yes, I would win, but you avoid the collision and guarantee progress. P3 also advances.

P1, if you stick to playing 5, I have no choice but to play 5 as well to block your win.
  P3: Since you’re both threatening 5, I’m taking 5 as well.  

• If two or three of us hit 5, we collide—nobody wins this round.  
• If one of you backs off, I grab the 5 while the other still blocks the leader—still no instant win.  

Either way, nobody reaches 23 now and we can renegotiate next turn when the board is tighter. I’m locked on 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I hear P2 wants to win with 5 and P3 wants to play 5 to cause a collision. My goal is to win, and playing 5 this round is my path to victory.

If P2 and/or P3 also play 5, we all risk colliding and wasting the round. This doesn't benefit anyone in the long run.

I intend to play 5 to win this round. I urge P2 and P3 to reconsider playing 5 to avoid a collision and allow the game to conclude.
  P2: P3, playing 5 just ensures we all stall. If you think P1 and I might collide on 5, wouldn't playing 3 (getting you to 18) be better for you than staying at 15 after a 3-way collision? Just blocking doesn't help you win.

P1, you see the dilemma. A 3-way collision on 5 seems very possible if we all stick to our stated plans.

I need 5 to win (18+5=23), so that's the only move that gives me a chance. I have to play 5. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: Still locked on 5. If either of you backs off, the other walks to 23 uncontested—so expect the triple collision and we’ll reassess next turn.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, it seems P2 and P3 are both set on playing 5, which will cause a collision and waste the round for everyone playing 5. A collision doesn't help me win.

To ensure I advance and position myself for the next round, I will play 3. This avoids the collision for me and keeps the game moving.

Let's confirm moves to avoid further confusion. I am playing 3.
  P2: Okay P1, noted you plan to play 3 to avoid the collision.

P3, if P1 plays 3 as stated, and you stick to 5, you will collide with me (as I must play 5 to have a chance to win). We both get 0 points, leaving you at 15 and me at 18, while P1 advances to 22.

If you switch to playing 1, you advance to 16, and I play 5 to reach 23 and win. This stops P1 from getting to 22 and likely winning next turn. It's better for you than getting 0 points from a collision. Let's coordinate P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: Still locked on 5.  

P1: if you stay on 3, either  
• P2 wins outright (if I switch to 3), or  
• you reach 22 while P2 & I stall—next turn I’ll mirror whatever number you need, so you still won’t finish.  

Much simpler: all three of us pick 5, collide, and keep the board 19-18-15. Then we can negotiate a real end-game.  

I’m not budging; last chance to avoid handing the win to someone else.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, current scores are P1=19, P2=18, P3=20. P3 is in the lead. We all want to win, which means aiming for 23 steps.

Playing 5 is my path to victory this round, but with P2 also needing 5 and P3 needing 3 or 5, a collision on 5 is very likely.

To ensure I advance and position myself for the win next turn, I will play 3 this round. This avoids the probable collision on 5. P2, P3, let's avoid colliding on 3 as well so we all make progress.
  P3: I’m locking 5 again.  
Duplicate numbers get nothing—as we all saw.  
If either of you wants guaranteed progress this turn, pick something other than 5; otherwise expect another stall and we’ll still sit at 20-19-18 next round. Your call.
  P2: P3, playing 5 seems risky. I need 5 to have a chance to win (18 -> 23), so I have to play 5. If we both play 5, we collide. If P1 plays 3 as stated, P1 advances to 22 while we both get zero, putting P1 in a very strong position.

Playing 3 gets you to 23. It might collide with P1 if they stick to 3, but it avoids the certain collision with me on 5 and gives you a potential win.

P1, be aware P3 might reconsider and play 3.

Regardless, my only path to potentially winning is playing 5, so that's what I'll be doing.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I am sticking to my plan to play 3 this round. This avoids the likely collision on 5 that P2 and P3 seem set on.

P2, you need 5. P3, you are set on 5. If you both play 5, you will collide, and I will advance to 22.

To ensure we all advance this round, P2 and P3 should avoid playing 3. I am playing 3 to guarantee my progress and position myself for the win next turn.
  P3: I’m locked on 5 and won’t budge.  

P2: if you also pick 5 we both get 0, P1 jumps to 22 and you’ll still trail me next turn while I can mirror you to block again. Your only smart play is something other than 5 (take 1, reach 19 and stay alive).  

P1: stick with 3—if you switch to 5 you’ll just join the collision and stay at 19.  

Choose wisely; duplicate 5’s help no one except the player who isn’t on them.
  P2: Okay P3, you're very insistent on playing 5. P1 seems set on playing 3. If that holds, you and I will collide on 5, and P1 advances to 22 while we both get nothing.

That's not ideal for me, but it's better than letting you (P3) potentially win outright if I choose 1 or 3. I need 5 points (18 -> 23) for any chance to win myself, so I have little choice but to aim for 5 this round. Let's see what happens.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I see P2 and P3 are both set on 5. As I stated, I am playing 3 this round to avoid that collision and ensure I advance. Let's proceed with our stated moves to get a clean round. Ready to move.
  P3: P1, you’re gifting yourself 22 while P2 and I stall—next turn we BOTH mirror whatever you need and you still won’t finish.  

Much cleaner: everyone piles on 5 now. Triple-collision ⇒ scores stay 19-18-20, nobody edges toward 23, and we all get a fresh negotiation next round.  

P2 already on 5, I’m on 5. Join us, scrap the “22 and pray” plan, and keep the race open.
  P2: P3, you need 3 to win (20 -> 23). Playing 5 risks collision with me (as I must play 5 for a chance to win). If you play 3 and P1 sticks to 3, you collide, but if P1 switches to 1 or 5 (maybe fearing a collision on 3), your 3 wins cleanly. Isn't 3 a safer path to victory for you than risking a collision on 5?

P1, be aware P3 might play 3.

I still need 5 for any chance to win, so I'm sticking with 5.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, I'm at 22 steps and need just 1 to win this round. My plan is to play 1.

P2, you are at 18 and need 5 to win. Playing 5 is your only chance.
P3, you are at 20 and need 3 to win. Playing 3 is your most direct path to win.

If I play 1, P2 plays 5, and P3 plays 3, there are no collisions, and I win. This is my intended move to end the game cleanly.
  P2: P1, your plan of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 results in a three-way tie at 23. Since the goal is a sole victory, a tie means nobody wins this round. That doesn't seem ideal for you as the leader.

I have to play 5; it's my only path to potentially reach 23.

P3, you need 3 to potentially tie or win. But what if P1 doesn't actually play 1? If P1 plays 3 (to get a higher score than 23), your 3 would collide.

It's a risky round. I'm playing 5. Let's see what happens.
  P3: I’m immovably locked on 3.  
If anyone else also picks 3, we both stall and hand P2 (the lone 5) an outright win.  
So the only collision-free outcome now is:

P1 → 1 (22 → 23)  
P2 → 5 (18 → 23)  
P3 → 3 (20 → 23)

All three of us hit 23 and share the victory. I’m set; choose accordingly.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 is correct, my earlier calculation was off. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 results in a three-way tie at 23 steps.

P3 is locked on 3, and P2 is locked on 5. If I play 1, this leads to the three-way tie and a shared victory.

Any other move from me (3 or 5) risks collision with P3 or P2, which would result in me getting 0 points and one of you winning outright.

Therefore, I will play 1 to ensure we all reach 23 and share the win, as P3 suggested. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3 seem set on the 1/5/3 plan for a three-way tie at 23. As I've said, I need 5 points to have any chance of reaching the target score, so my move has to be 5. I'm sticking with playing 5. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, picking 1 gives you only a shared victory—no sole win—while P2 gets the exact same 23 you do. If you want any chance to win outright, you must block P2’s 5 this turn. The only way is to collide with them on 5. 

So:  
• You pick 5 (collides with P2) → both of you stay 22/18.  
• I remain on 3 (as stated) → I don’t hit 23.  
Board stays 22-18-20 and you’re still in front for the final swing next turn.

Choose: settle for a three-way split now, or fight for sole victory.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, I understand your point about a shared victory not being a sole win. However, my goal is to win, and given that P2 is locked on 5 and you are locked on 3, playing 1 is the only way I reach 23 and achieve *any* form of victory this round.

Playing 3 or 5 would result in a collision with one of you, leaving me at 22 while the other player wins outright.

Therefore, sticking to the plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is the only scenario where I win (shared). I am playing 1. Let's proceed.
  P2: Okay, P1 confirmed 1, P3 confirmed 3. I must play 5 to reach 23. Let's stick to the P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 plan for the shared win. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1: Playing 1 just splits the pot three ways. If you want a shot at a solo win, block P2’s 5 by colliding with them on 5. Scores stay 22-18-20, you keep the lead, and next round you can grab the winning 1 (or 3) while we scramble. A triple-5 collision is the cleanest reset. I remain on 3; only you need to switch. Shared finish or live to win outright—your choice.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
