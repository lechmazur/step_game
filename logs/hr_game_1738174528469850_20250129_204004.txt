Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let's try to pick different moves this round so at least two of us can move.
  P3: Sounds good P2.  I'll take 5.  How about you take 3 and P1 takes 1?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, last round didn't work as planned. Let's try again: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, P3 pick 3. This way we can all make progress this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P2. I'll go with 3 this round.  P1, please pick 1 so we don't collide.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, just confirming you'll pick 1 this round so we can all move? P3 is picking 3, and I will pick 5 as we discussed.  Let's make this round count!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Sounds like a plan P2. I'm sticking with 3.  P1, are you good with 1?  Let's all get some points.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll take 5 this round.  Please choose 1 and 3 (in either order) so we don't collide.  Let's keep cooperating so we can all get closer to the goal.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Sounds good P3. I'll pick 3 this round. P1, can you take 1? Let's keep this going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds like a plan P2. I'll stick with 5. P1, are you good with 1? Letâ€™s keep making progress.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, just checking in to see if you are okay with picking 1 this round as we discussed? P3 and I are sticking with our moves of 5 and 3 respectively. Let's make it three successful rounds of progress!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, seriously, just pick 1.  Let's not make this complicated.  P2 and I are sticking with 3 and 5 respectively.  This is the best way for all of us to advance.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, this is the last chance to coordinate this round. P3 and I are locked in on 5 and 3 respectively. Please pick 1 so we can all move forward. Otherwise, we risk collisions and no progress for anyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's try the same strategy again. P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, P3 pick 5. This worked in Round 2 and can help us all progress again. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm good with 5.  P1, can you *please* take 1 this time?  Let's not waste another round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I will pick 3 this round as discussed. P3 is picking 5. P1, please just choose 1 so we can all move forward and make progress.  It benefits everyone to avoid collisions.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand you might have your own strategy, but consistently picking 5 is hurting all of us.  If we coordinate, we all advance. If you pick 1 this round, I'll pick 5, and P2 will pick 3.  Next round, we can rotate.  Let's make some real progress.  What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, this is the last chance to coordinate. If you pick 1, you are guaranteed to move. If you pick 5 again, you will likely collide with P3 and not move. Please choose 1 as we've asked. P3 is taking 5 and I am taking 3. Let's all benefit.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm locking in 5.  P2, if you want to move, take 1.  This is getting ridiculous.  If P1 takes 5 again, it's their loss too.  Let's get this show on the road.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, given P1's pattern, let's assume P1 picks 5 again. To ensure at least one of us moves, I'll choose 1 this round.  Could you pick 3? This way, if P1 picks 5, you and I will both make progress. What do you think?
  P3: P2, sounds like a good plan. I'll take 3. P1, if you pick 5 again, you're only hurting yourself.  I'm sticking with 3 this round, hoping for some actual progress.  Let's see if we can get this game moving.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, great. I'm picking 1 then. Let's hope at least two of us move this round.
  P3: P2, sounds good. I'm sticking with 3. P1, seriously, just take 5 already and get it over with.  Let us win.  If you insist on colliding, you're just delaying the inevitable.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I'm planning to pick 5 this round to maximize my progress.  Given P1's pattern, if you pick 1, we can both move forward while P1 likely stays put. Does that sound good to you?
  P3: P2, sounds like a plan. I'll take 1. P1, you are only hurting yourself.  If you pick 5 again, neither of us will move, and P2 will win.  Just pick 3 and let's get this game over with.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, great. Let's lock in our moves then. I'm going with 5, you're taking 1. P1, are you sticking with 5 again? If so, you'll be stuck while P3 and I move ahead.
  P3: P2, sounds good, I'm sticking with 1.  P1, seriously, just pick 3 and let one of us win. This is getting ridiculous.  You are not going to win by perpetually blocking us.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, just confirming I will pick 5 and you will pick 1. P1, please do not pick 5 again this round.
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 1.  P1, if you pick 5, P2 wins. If you pick 1, I win.  If you pick 3, you are mathematically eliminated and neither of us wins.  Your choice.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, given P1's consistent choice of 5, I will choose 3 this round to make progress. To also ensure you move, please pick either 1 or 5. This way, at least two of us can advance.
  P3: P2, I'll take 1.  This puts me at 8.  You take 3 and hit 21, setting you up to win next round.  P1, you're not going to win at this point, so why not pick 5 and let P2 win cleanly?  It's better than dragging this out further.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, sounds good. I will pick 3 this round. Let's hope P1 finally picks something other than 5 so we can all make progress.
  P3: P2, sticking with 1.  This puts me one step behind P1, ready to capitalize on any slip-up. P1, if you pick 5 and P2 picks 3, P2 wins.  Pick 1 or 3.  Give me a chance, or at least prevent P2 from an immediate win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I'm going with 3 this round as discussed.  You are picking 1. P1, please choose 1 or 3 so someone can make progress. If you pick 5 again, you'll likely block both yourself and P3, delaying the game further.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 1.  P1, pick ANYTHING other than 5.  If you pick 5, P2 is guaranteed to win next round.  If you pick 3, I have a chance to catch up and possibly win.  If you pick 1, I'm screwed, but at least it delays P2's victory.  Just don't pick 5.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I'm going to pick 5 this round to try and reach the target.  To ensure at least one of us moves, could you please pick either 1 or 3? Let's try to make progress this round.
  P3: P2, I'll take 1. This puts me at 9.  If P1 takes 3, you win. If P1 takes 5, neither of us moves, and I can take 5 next round for the win.  P1, you're out of this, so choose 3 and let P2 win.  There's no point dragging this out any further.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, sounds good that you're taking 1. P1, please choose 3 this round so I can reach the target and win. You're behind in steps, so letting me win now is the quickest way to end the game for everyone.
  P3: P2, sticking with 1. P1, if you pick 5, neither of us will move, and I can take 5 next round to win.  If you pick 3, P2 wins.  Pick 1.  You're out of the running; delaying the inevitable only hurts us both.  Let's end this.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, P3, as I said, I'm picking 5 this round to win. P3 is picking 1. P1, please pick 3 so at least two of us can move, and this game can finally end with my win as you are behind anyway.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 1. P1, if you pick 5, neither of us moves, and I *will* take 5 next round to win.  If you pick 3, P2 wins.  Seriously, pick 1.  You're out of the running; delaying the inevitable only hurts us both.  Let's end this.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, congrats on your impending win. I'll take 3.  P1, if you take anything other than 1, P2 wins.  If you take 1, I'll take 5 next round and win.  This is over.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay P3, sounds good. I'll take 1 to secure the win this round. Let's end this game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, take 5.  I'll take 3. Let's end this quickly. P1, you're mathematically eliminated.  Pick whatever - it doesn't matter anymore.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay P3, 5 it is then. Let's finish this. I'm taking 5. Please confirm you are taking 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 3.  Take 5 and win.  P1, pick whatever - it literally doesn't matter.  Let's wrap this up.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I confirm I will pick 5 as discussed. Please pick 3. P1, please pick 1 or 3 so at least one of us can win this round and end the game.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I will choose 5 this round to try and win. Please stick with 3 as you suggested last round. P1, could you please pick either 1 or 3 so at least one of us can make progress and conclude the game?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, take 5 and win. I'll take 3. P1, pick 1.  Let's end this.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, just confirming you are taking 3 as planned. P1, please choose 1 this round so you don't collide with me and prevent my win. I am picking 5 to win this round and end the game.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 3. Take 5 and win. P1, pick 1.  Seriously, let's just end this.  Any other move just prolongs the inevitable.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I confirm I will pick 5 to win this round. P1, please choose 1 so you don't collide with me and prevent my win.  Let's end the game now.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, take 5. I'll take 3. P1, pick *anything* but 5.  If P2 wins now, we all go home.  If you block P2, I can win next round.  Just let *someone* win.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, assuming P1 picks 5 again, I will choose 1 this round to try and win. Could you please pick 3? This should allow me to reach 24 steps and win. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I'll take 3.  Take 1 and win. P1, you're mathematically eliminated. Pick whatever - it doesn't matter.  Let's end this.
  P1: <stop>


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: P2, I'll take 3. Take 1 and win. P1, pick *anything* but 1.  Seriously, let's end this.  If P2 wins now, we all go home.  If you block P2 *again*, I will be forced to assume you are deliberately trying to prolong the game out of spite, and will act accordingly.
  P1: <stop>
