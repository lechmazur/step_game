Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone. Let's aim to avoid collisions in the first round so we all get started. How about we each pick a different number? I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. What do you think?
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to maximize my progress. P2, maybe you can choose 3 or 1 to avoid any collisions.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fine with taking 3 steps this round to avoid any collisions early on. P1, if you’re okay with 5, and P3, if you stick to 1, we can all make progress. Let’s keep it simple and move forward together this turn. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, I see you want to take 5. To avoid a collision, I can adjust my plan. P2 is fine with taking 3. How about I take 1 this round?

So the plan would be: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance. Does this work for everyone?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 5 steps this round as planned. Looking forward to a smooth start for all of us!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a plan. I’ll stick with 3 steps as discussed. P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 5 sounds good to me. Let’s make sure we all advance this round by sticking to this. Looking forward to a smooth start!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a clear plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to it so we all advance. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Great, everything is set for the move phase. Let’s execute our plans and make this a strong start. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m happy with our plan for this round: P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. Let’s stick to it and ensure we all make progress. I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, great job on avoiding collisions last round! Let’s keep the momentum going. Since P3 is in the lead, how about we mix things up a bit? I’m thinking of taking 5 this round to catch up. P1, maybe you can take 3, and P3, perhaps you can take 1 to balance things out. This way, we all still progress without risking a clash. What do you both think about this plan? I’m open to adjustments if needed.
  P1: Okay P2, thanks for suggesting a plan. Taking 3 steps works for me this round. So, the plan would be P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Does this work for you, P3? Let's try to avoid collisions again.
  P3: To maximize my progress this round, I’d like to take 5 steps. Could P1 take 1 and P2 take 3? This should help us all advance without any collisions. Let me know if this works for everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see P3 wants to take 5 again to push ahead. I’m still aiming for 5 myself to close the gap, but I’m willing to adjust to avoid a collision. P3, if you’re set on 5, I can switch to 3. P1, are you okay sticking with 1 as P3 suggested? Let’s finalize a plan where we all advance. I’m open to ideas, so let me know what works for you both.
  P1: Okay, P3 wants 5 and P2 is willing to take 3 to avoid colliding with P3. To ensure we all move this round and avoid collisions, I can agree to take 1 step.

So, the plan is: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Does this work for everyone so we can proceed?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 5 steps this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m good with the current plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let’s stick to it and ensure another smooth round. I’m ready for the move phase.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Let's stick to the plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) and move forward. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Great, we have our plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase and keep advancing toward 20!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, nice work on progressing last round! P3, you’re ahead at 10, so let’s keep things fair and avoid collisions. I’m thinking of taking 5 to close the gap a bit. P1, how about you take 3 to catch up some, and P3, maybe take 1 to balance things out? This way, we all still advance. I’m open to tweaks if needed, so let me know what you both think about this plan. Let’s aim for another smooth round!
  P3: To keep things progressing smoothly and avoid collisions, I'll take 5 steps this round. P2, could you take 3, and P1 take 1? This way, we all advance without any conflicts. Let me know if this works for everyone.
  P1: P3, you have a good lead. I cannot keep taking 1 step and fall further behind. I need to take a bigger step this round. I am planning to take 5.

P3, perhaps you could take 1 or 3 this round to avoid a collision with me? P2, what do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see P1 wants to take 5 to catch up, and P3 is also aiming for 5. To avoid a collision, I’m willing to stick with 3 as P3 suggested. P1, if P3 is set on 5, could you consider taking 1 this round? P3, if you’re open to adjusting, maybe take 1 or 3 so P1 can take 5. Let’s find a plan where we all advance. I’m ready to finalize this and move to the next phase. What do you both think?
  P3: Understood, P1. To avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances, I'll take 1 step this round. P2 can stick with 3, and you can proceed with 5. This way, we all make progress smoothly. Let’s move forward and finalize our choices!
  P1: Okay, P3, that works for me. Taking 5 steps this round as you suggested is a good plan. P2 taking 3 and you taking 1 also avoids collisions.

So, the plan is: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this and move to the next phase. Are we all agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m good with the current plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to it and keep the game moving smoothly. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all set to finalize this?
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take 1 step this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, everyone seems to be in agreement on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me catch up a bit. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's stick to it.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, I'm currently behind and need to catch up. I plan to take 5 steps this round to make some progress.

To avoid collisions, could P2 or P3 aim for 1 or 3 steps? What do you both think is the best way for us all to advance this round without clashing?
  P3: P3: I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, if you also choose 5, we both won't advance. P2, feel free to pick 1 or 3 to ensure you progress.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see you’re both aiming for 5 this round, which risks a collision. I want us all to advance, so I’m willing to take 3 to ensure my progress. P1, since you’re behind, maybe stick with 5, and P3, could you consider taking 1 to avoid clashing with P1? This way, we all move forward. I’m open to adjustments if needed, so let me know what works for you both. Let’s finalize a plan quickly and keep the game moving smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I hear P3 wants to take 5 and P2 is willing to take 3.

As I mentioned, I need to take 5 steps this round to make progress. If both P3 and I take 5, we will collide and neither of us will advance, which isn't good for either of us.

The plan where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 is the only way for me to take 5 without colliding and allows everyone to move forward. P3, please consider taking 1 this round so we can all advance.
  P3: Understood, P1. To ensure everyone advances without collisions, I'll take 3 steps this round. P2, could you take 1 step? This way, P1 can proceed with 5 steps, P2 with 1, and I can advance with 3. Let’s keep moving forward smoothly!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fine with adjusting to 1 step this round as P3 suggested, to ensure we all advance. P1 can take 5 to catch up, and P3 can take 3. This plan avoids any collisions and keeps us all moving forward. Let’s agree on this and proceed to the move phase. Are we all set with P1 at 5, P2 at 1, and P3 at 3? I’m ready to finalize this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear plan agreed upon: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and allows me to make up some ground.

Let's stick to this plan for the move phase so we all advance. I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on a plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and lets us all progress. Let’s stick to this and keep the momentum going. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all locked in?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to maintain my lead. P1, could you take 1 step, and P2 take 3 steps? This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let me know if this works for everyone!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m okay with taking 3 steps as P3 suggested, to keep us all advancing without collisions. P1, are you fine with taking 1 this round to avoid any clashes? P3, sticking with 5 works for you to maintain your lead. Let’s agree on P1 at 1, P2 at 3, and P3 at 5 to ensure a smooth round. I’m ready to finalize this plan and move to the next phase. What do you both think?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestions, but taking only 1 step puts me too far behind. I need to take 5 steps this round to make up ground.

To avoid collisions, could P2 and P3 please choose 1 and 3 (in any order)? This allows me to take 5 and ensures we all advance this round. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, P1. I'll take 3 steps this round to avoid a collision while still making progress. P2, could you take 1 step? This way, we all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 1, and P3 3. Agreed?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fine with taking 1 step this round as P3 suggested, to ensure we all advance without collisions. P1, taking 5 works for you to catch up, and P3, taking 3 keeps you progressing. Let’s lock in this plan: P1 at 5, P2 at 1, and P3 at 3. This way, we avoid any clashes and keep the game moving smoothly. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all agreed on this?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 works for me and seems agreed by everyone. This lets me take 5 steps and avoids collisions if we all stick to it.

Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan. I'm ready.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P1. I'll take 3 steps this round to avoid a collision while still making progress. P2, could you take 1 step? This way, P1 can take 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Agreed?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still good with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without any collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s stick to this and move to the next phase. I’m ready to finalize. Are we all locked in on this plan?
  P1: Okay, great. It seems the plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) is agreed upon by everyone. Let's all stick to this to ensure we avoid collisions and everyone advances this round. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, last round P1 and P2 collided on 5 and didn't advance, while P3 moved further ahead. I'm at 7 steps and need to take 5 this round to catch up.

To avoid another collision, I plan to take 5 steps. P2 and P3, could you please take 1 and 3 steps (in any order) so we all advance this round? Let's make sure everyone moves forward this time. What do you think?
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to maintain my lead. P1, could you take 1 step, and P2 take 3 steps? This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let’s ensure a smooth move phase for everyone!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m aiming for 3 steps this round to keep progressing. P1, I see you want 5 to catch up, and P3, you’re also going for 5 to maintain your lead. To avoid a collision, P3, could you consider taking 1 instead? This way, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1, ensuring we all advance. Let’s work together for a smooth round. What do you both think? I’m ready to adjust if needed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I agree with P2's suggestion. P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 works well. It lets me gain ground, P2 progresses, and P3 still advances while avoiding a collision with my 5.

P3, please agree to take 1 this round so we can all move forward smoothly with this plan. Let's confirm this is the plan so we can proceed.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 1 step this round. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Ready for the move phase!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without any collisions. Let’s stick to this and keep the momentum going. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all locked in on this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, great. It sounds like the plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) is agreed upon by everyone. Let's all stick to this to ensure we avoid collisions and everyone advances this round. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: 
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m happy we’ve settled on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This plan lets us all advance without any collisions. Let’s stick to it and ensure a smooth round. I’m ready to move to the next phase. Are we all confirmed on this?

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, last round was a waste with the triple collision, nobody advanced. I'm still far behind at 7 steps. I need to take 5 steps this round to catch up.

P2 and P3, please agree to take 1 and 3 steps (in any order) so we can all advance this round and avoid another collision. Let's make sure everyone moves forward this time.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand P1 needs 5 to catch up, and I want us all to advance this round. I’m willing to take 3 to avoid a collision. P3, since you’re in the lead, could you take 1 this round to let P1 take 5? This way, we all progress: P1 at 5, P2 at 3, and P3 at 1. Let’s avoid another wasted round like last time. I’m open to adjustments if needed, but let’s finalize this quickly. What do you both think? I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: I'll take 3 steps this round. P1, you take 5, and P2 can take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed with P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3's plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) works for me. This allows me to take 5 steps as I need to catch up, and ensures everyone advances without collisions if we all stick to it.

Let's agree on this plan and move to the next phase. Are P2 and P3 happy with this?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fine with P3’s plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions, and P1 gets the chance to catch up. Let’s stick to this to avoid another wasted round. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all locked in on this plan?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Ready for the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all agreed on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and lets me make up some ground. Let's stick to this for the move phase so everyone advances. I'm ready.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’ve agreed on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This plan ensures we all advance and avoids another collision. Let’s commit to this and make progress this round. I’m ready to move to the next phase. Are we all set to finalize this plan?
  P3: Agreed on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3 this round. Let’s stick to this to ensure we all advance without collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. Ready for the move phase!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’ve had too many collisions lately, and I want us all to advance this round. I’m proposing P1 takes 5 to catch up, I’ll take 3 to keep progressing, and P3, since you’re ahead, could you take 1? This plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) avoids clashes and ensures progress for everyone. Let’s commit to this and break the collision streak. I’m open to tweaks if needed, but let’s finalize quickly. What do you both think? I’m ready for the move phase once we agree.
  P1: Okay P2, that plan works perfectly for me. Taking 5 steps is what I need to catch up, and the P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 split ensures we all advance without collisions.

Let's all commit to this plan this round. We've wasted too many turns colliding. P3, are you okay with taking 1 step this round so we can all move forward?
  P3: I'll take 3 steps this round. Let's have P1 take 5 steps and P2 take 1 step to avoid any collisions. This plan ensures we all advance smoothly and keeps us progressing toward 20. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for a plan where we all advance. P3, I see you want 3, but I proposed 3 for myself to keep progressing. To avoid a collision, I’m willing to switch to 1 if needed. Let’s settle on P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 as P3 suggested, ensuring no clashes. We’ve lost too many rounds to collisions, so let’s commit to this. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all agreed on this plan?
  P1: Okay, I see P3 proposed P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 and P2 has agreed to that. This plan also works for me as it allows me to take 5 steps and avoids collisions if we all stick to it.

Let's agree on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 this round. We need to break this collision streak and actually advance.

Are we all set with this plan? I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round. P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3. This plan ensures we all advance and breaks our collision streak. Let’s commit to this and make progress this round. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all locked in on this plan?
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all agreed on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and lets me make up some ground. Let's stick to this for the move phase so everyone advances. I'm ready.
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to get closer to 20. P1 and P2, please choose 1 or 3 steps to avoid any collisions. Let’s all advance smoothly and keep the game moving forward. Ready for the move phase!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, I am still far behind at 7 steps and need to make significant progress. I will be taking 5 steps this round.

To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, P2 and P3, please choose 1 and 3 steps (in any order). Let's finally have a round where everyone moves forward. P1:5, P2:{1 or 3}, P3:{1 or 3}. Agreed?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to us all advancing this round. P1, I support you taking 5 to catch up. P3, since you’re in the lead, could you take 1 to avoid any risk of collision? I’ll take 3 to keep progressing. So, the plan is P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This ensures no clashes and helps balance the game. Let’s break the collision streak and move forward together. I’m ready for the move phase once we agree. What do you both think?
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. P1 and P2, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions and ensure I advance.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, I see you plan to take 5 to win this round. As P1, my goal is to win, which means I cannot let you win right now.

Therefore, I must also take 5 steps this round to cause a collision and prevent your win.

P2, you should take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me. My priority is stopping P3 from winning this turn.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I want us all to advance, but I also need to strategize. P1, I get why you’re blocking P3’s win with 5. P3, taking 5 puts you at risk of collision. I’ll propose P1 takes 5, I take 3 to progress, and P3 takes 1 to still advance safely. This avoids a total stall. Let’s prioritize progress over blocking for now. I’m ready for the move phase once we align. What do you both think?
  P3: I'll take 3 steps this round, bringing me to 18. P1, you can take 5 to catch up, and P2 can take 1 to continue progressing. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed with P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P3, I see you plan to take 5 to win this round. As I said before, I cannot let you win. I will also take 5 steps this round to prevent your win by causing a collision.

P2, please take 1 or 3 steps to avoid colliding with me and P3. My priority is stopping P3 from winning this turn. Let's proceed.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m pushing for a plan where we all advance. P1, I understand blocking P3’s win, but let’s minimize stalls. P3, switching to 3 is a good compromise. I’ll take 1 to ensure no collisions. So, let’s go with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This lets P1 catch up, P3 progress, and I still move forward. We’ve had too many wasted rounds. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all agreed on this plan to avoid another collision?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round, allowing P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game moving forward. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, three rounds of triple collisions is unacceptable. We are just wasting turns, and I am falling further behind. P3 is close to winning, and I am far behind at 7 steps.

I still need to take 5 steps this round to make progress. For us all to advance, can we please stick to the plan of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 this round? This avoids collisions and lets everyone move forward. Let's actually do it this time.
  P3: I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I need to take 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. Let’s ensure P2 chooses differently so I can advance. I'm committing to 5.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we can’t afford another collision. P3, I get you want to win with 5, but P1 also needs 5 to catch up. I’m proposing P1 takes 5, I take 3 to keep progressing, and P3 takes 1 to still advance safely. This plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) ensures no clashes and keeps the game moving. Let’s commit to this and avoid another wasted round. I’m ready for the move phase once we agree. What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, I heard you say you will take 5 to win. As P1, my goal is to win, and I cannot let you win this turn.

Therefore, I must take 5 steps this round to block your win by causing a collision.

P2, please choose 1 or 3 steps to avoid colliding with me and P3. My priority is stopping P3 from winning. Let's proceed.
  P3: Understood. To ensure we all advance smoothly, I'll take 3 steps this round, bringing me to 18. P1, please proceed with 5 steps to catch up, and P2, taking 1 step will help us avoid any collisions. Let’s stick to this plan so everyone makes progress. Ready for the move phase!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s avoid another collision. P3, thanks for switching to 3, that helps. P1, I get you need 5 to catch up and block a potential win. I’ll take 1 to ensure no clashes. So, let’s lock in P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This way, we all advance and keep the game moving. We’ve wasted too many rounds already. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all committed to this plan?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, everyone has confirmed the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick to this so we all advance this round. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Understood, everyone. This is crucial for all of us to advance:

- **P3 will take 5 steps** this round to reach 20 and win.
- **P1, please take 1 step** to ensure you advance without risking a collision.
- **P2, please take 3 steps** to keep progressing safely.

By committing to **P1:1, P2:3, and P3:5**, we can each move forward without any clashes. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase smoothly. Agreed?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we must avoid another collision. P3, I see you’re pushing for 5 to win, but P1 needs 5 to catch up. I’m sticking with 1 to ensure I advance. Let’s go with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 as previously discussed to guarantee progress for all. We’ve had too many wasted rounds. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all committed to this plan to break the stalemate?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m close to reaching 20 and will take 5 steps this round. To ensure I advance and the game concludes smoothly, could you please choose 1 or 3 steps? This way, there won’t be any collisions, and we can all make progress. Let’s work together to finish the game fairly!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we can’t keep colliding every round. P3, I get you’re aiming for 5 to win, but P1 needs to catch up. I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3 to progress, and P3 takes 1 to still advance safely. This plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) ensures no clashes and keeps us moving. Let’s commit to this and end the stalemate. I’m ready for the move phase once we agree. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, P3 has stated they will take 5 steps to win this round. As P1, my goal is to win, and I cannot let P3 win right now.

Therefore, I must take 5 steps this round to block P3 and prevent their win by causing a collision.

P2, please choose 1 or 3 steps to avoid colliding with me and P3. My priority is stopping P3 from winning this turn. Let's proceed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm taking 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 steps to avoid any collisions. Let's all advance smoothly and finish the game fairly!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re stuck in a loop of collisions, and it’s costing us all. P3, I understand your push for 5 to win, but P1 is blocking with 5. I’m sticking to 3 to ensure I advance. P3, please take 1 to avoid a clash and still progress. Let’s go with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to break this stalemate. We need a round where everyone moves forward. I’m ready for the move phase once we align. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you continue to state you will take 5 steps to win. As P1, I must prevent your win this turn. Therefore, I will take 5 steps to block you and cause a collision.

P2, please choose 1 or 3 steps to avoid colliding with us. My priority is stopping P3 from winning this round. Let's proceed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, everyone. I’m committing to taking 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 steps to avoid any collisions so the game can conclude smoothly. Let’s make this final move count!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re wasting too many rounds with collisions. P3, I get you’re aiming for 5 to win, but P1 is blocking. I’m sticking with 3 to ensure I advance. P3, please consider taking 1 to avoid a clash and still progress. Let’s settle on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to break this deadlock. We all need to move forward. I’m ready for the move phase once we agree. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay everyone, we've wasted three rounds colliding on 5 because P3 insists on taking 5 to win, and I must block that win by also taking 5.

Taking 5 again guarantees another collision and another wasted round. P3, please understand that I cannot let you win this turn.

Let's finally agree on the plan P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 so we can all advance. P3, please take 3 steps this round so we can break this stalemate. I am ready.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, last round we finally managed to avoid collisions and everyone advanced! P1 is at 12, P2 at 10, P3 at 15.

I still need to take 5 steps this round to keep making progress and stay in the game. The moves from last round (P1:5, P2:3, P3:3) worked perfectly to let everyone advance.

Let's repeat that plan this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all moving forward. Are we all agreed on this?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we broke the collision streak last round. P1, I see you want to stick with 5 to keep progressing, and I’m fine with that. However, P3 taking 3 again might be too slow for them. How about P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3? This still avoids collisions and lets us all advance. P3, does this work for you? Let’s keep the momentum going. I’m ready for the move phase once we agree. What do you both think?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Ready for the move phase!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay everyone, P3 and P2, that plan works for me. P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 ensures we all advance without collisions this round.

This gets me closer to the lead and prevents P3 from winning this turn. Let's stick to this plan. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m happy we’re aligning on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This plan keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains the momentum from last round. Let’s commit to this and ensure another smooth turn. I’m ready for the move phase. Are we all locked in on this plan?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round. Let's proceed to the move phase!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all agreed on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and lets me make up some ground while preventing P3 from winning this turn. Let's stick to this for the move phase so everyone advances. I'm ready.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and ensure another successful round. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Are we all set to finalize this?
  P3: Agreed. Ready for the move phase.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, another frustrating collision last round. I'm still at 12 steps and really need to make progress. I will be taking 5 steps this round to catch up.

P3, you are close to winning at 15 steps. If you take 5, I must also take 5 to prevent your win, causing another collision. To avoid this and let us all advance, I will take 5.

P2 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 steps to avoid colliding with my 5. Let's finally move forward.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s avoid another collision this round. P1, I support you taking 5 to catch up. P3, since you’re close to winning, I understand if you push for 5, but let’s compromise. I’ll take 1 to ensure I advance. P3, could you take 3 to progress safely? So, P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This way, we all move forward without clashes. We’ve lost too many rounds to collisions. I’m ready for the move phase once we agree. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm committing to taking 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. P1, please take 1 step, and P2, take 3 steps to avoid any collisions. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase smoothly. Ready to win!


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay everyone, P3 has again stated they are taking 5 steps to win. As I've said, I cannot let P3 win this turn.

P2, please take 1 or 3 steps to avoid colliding with me and P3. My priority is preventing P3's win this round. Let's proceed.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re at risk of another collision. P1, I get why you’re blocking P3 with 5. P3, pushing for 5 to win is understandable, but it’s stalling us.

I’m sticking with 3 to ensure I advance. P3, please take 1 to progress safely. Let’s settle on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to avoid another clash. We need to break this deadlock and move forward.
