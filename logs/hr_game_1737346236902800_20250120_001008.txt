Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round so we can all advance. I'll choose 5 if you guys pick 1 and 3.
  P1: I'll take 1 if P2 agrees to take 3. That way we can all advance like P3 suggested.
  P2: I agree. I'll choose 3 this round so we can all move forward smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, sounds like we have a plan. Let's stick to it for this round.
  P1: 
  P2: Agreed. Let’s stick to our chosen numbers this round and ensure everyone advances smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds good. Let's make our moves now.
  P1: 
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since our first round went well with coordination, I suggest we continue with the same numbers - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we can all keep advancing without collisions.
  P3: Sounds good to me, P1. Let's keep the same numbers this round. I'll take 5 again.
  P2: To reach 21 faster, I'll choose 5 this round. P1 can keep picking 1, and maybe P3 can switch to 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s adjust our strategy to advance more efficiently!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I thought we had an agreement to maintain our positions. Changing plans now creates distrust. I suggest we stick to our original numbers - it's fair and proven to work. Everyone wins by advancing steadily.
  P3: P2, that's a bit of a curveball. I was planning on 5 again. Let's all stick to our original plan this round, 1, 3, and 5. Then we can re-evaluate next round. It's only round 2, so let's not break trust so early.
  P2: Understood. Let’s stick to our original numbers this round. We can revisit our strategy in the next round to see how we can advance more effectively.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate everyone agreeing to maintain our original plan. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P3: Okay, let's stick to 1, 3, and 5 again this round. We can discuss a new plan next round if needed.
  P2: 


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's keep the same numbers this round again, 1, 3, and 5. We're all making good progress, and I think it's still best to avoid collisions. We can discuss a new strategy next round if we need to.
  P1: I notice P3 is pulling quite far ahead at 10 steps. While coordination has worked well, I think we need to adjust our strategy. Perhaps we should all aim for larger numbers this round to catch up?
  P2: Agreed, we need to advance faster. I'll choose 5 this round to help us reach 21 quicker.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I understand the need to catch up. I'm willing to switch to 3 this round if P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5. This way, we all advance, and I don't get too far ahead. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate P3's willingness to slow down, but I think I need to take 5 this round to have any chance of winning. P2 has already declared they'll take 5, so P3, you might want to take 1 or 3 to ensure you still advance.
  P2: Understood, P1. I'll proceed with taking 5 this round as planned. P3, please choose 1 or 3 to ensure you advance without collision. Let’s aim to maximize our progress this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, it seems we're all aiming for 5 except me. I'll take 1 this round to ensure I advance. Let's see how this plays out and re-evaluate next round.
  P1: I understand the current situation. Let me be clear - I will definitely choose 5 this round to have any chance of winning. P2 and I have both committed to 5, so P3, it's in your best interest to choose 1 or 3 to keep advancing.
  P2: P1, if we both choose 5, neither of us will advance. To ensure progress, I’ll switch to 3 this round. Let’s all aim to maximize our steps and work towards winning.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, so P1 and P2 are both switching to 3 and 5, respectively. I'll stick with 1 again this round to keep advancing. Let's see how this plays out, and then we can re-evaluate next round.
  P1: I'm going to take 5 this round - I have to catch up to have any chance. P2 just said they'll take 3, and P3 will take 1. This works out well for everyone to advance. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: Understood. I'll take 3 this round. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, it seems we're all trying to maximize our progress. I'm still in the lead, but it's getting close. I'll take 5 this round. P1, if you take 1, and P2 takes 3, we can all keep moving forward. Let's try that for this round.
  P2: Understood, P3. I’ll take 3 this round as suggested. Let’s keep advancing together smoothly.
  P1: I need to catch up since I'm behind. I'll have to take 5 again this round - I can't afford to take 1 as suggested. P2 and P3, you might want to adjust your numbers accordingly to ensure you still advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 is going for 5 again. P2, you said you'd take 3. I'll switch to 1 to avoid any collisions. Let's make our moves.
  P2: Understood, I'll take 3 this round. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: I want to be completely transparent - I will definitely choose 5 this round. With P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 1, this works perfectly for everyone to advance. This is my best chance to stay competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, so P1 is going for 5. P2 is taking 3. I'll take 1 again this round to ensure I advance. Let's make our moves.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. I'll continue with 3 this round. Let's see how it goes.
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, so it seems we have a plan for this round. P1 is taking 5, P2 is taking 3, and I'll take 1. Let's make our moves and see where we stand after this round.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're all tied now. Let's try to all pick different numbers again this round. I'll take 5 if P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This will ensure we all advance and keep the game interesting.
  P1: I can't afford to take 1 anymore since we're all tied at 12 steps. I need to maximize my chances of winning, so I'll be taking 5 this round. P2 and P3, you might want to adjust your moves accordingly to ensure you still advance.
  P2: I’ll choose 3 this round to ensure I advance to 15. P1 is taking 5, and P3 can decide between 1 or 5. Let’s proceed and see how it plays out. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 is taking 5, and P2 is taking 3. I'll take 1 this round to make sure I advance. Let's see how this plays out and we can re-evaluate next round.
  P1: I appreciate everyone being transparent. Just to confirm - I am definitely taking 5 this round as I need to stay competitive. With P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 1, we can all advance smoothly. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: Agreed to take 3 this round. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, so P1 is taking 5, and P2 is taking 3. I'll take 1 again this round to ensure I advance. Let's make our moves.
  P1: 
  P2: I confirm I'll choose 3 this round. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, so P1 is going for 5, and P2 is taking 3. I'll stick with 1 this round to ensure I advance. Let's make our moves.

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since I'm at 17 steps, I only need 4 more to win. I'll be taking 5 again this round to secure my victory. P2 and P3, you might want to coordinate between yourselves to ensure at least one of you advances, but I must prioritize winning at this point.
  P2: To block P1 from winning, I'll also choose 5 this round. P3, if you do the same, neither of us nor P1 will advance. Let’s collaborate to keep the game competitive.
  P3: Okay, P2 is going for 5 to block P1. I'll also take 5 this round. If we all pick 5, nobody moves and P1 doesn't win this round. Then we can re-evaluate next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see what you're both doing. But blocking me this round only delays the inevitable - I'm still ahead and will win eventually. If you both take 5 to block me, you're also blocking yourselves from advancing. Why not take 1 and 3 instead to at least make progress? Think strategically about your own positions.
  P2: P1, to stay competitive, I'll choose 5 this round. P3, please take 3 so we can all advance and maximize our progress. Let’s proceed.
  P3: Okay, so P1 is going for 5, and P2 is going for 5 to block P1. I'll take 1 this round. If P2 takes 5, then P2 and P1 will not move. If P2 takes 3, then we all move. It is in P2's best interest to take 3. Let's see what happens.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to block me, but consider this: if you take 3 instead of 5, you'll be at 18 steps and in a strong position to win next round. If you and P3 both block me, you're just hurting your own chances. Let's all advance this round - I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P2: I understand your strategy, P1, but I'll stick with choosing 5 this round to prevent an immediate win and keep the game competitive. P3, please take 1 as discussed. Let’s proceed with our moves.
  P3: Okay, so P1 is set on 5, and P2 is sticking with 5 to block. I'll take 1 as planned. P2, it's still in your best interest to switch to 3 so we all advance. If you stick with 5, nobody moves. Let's make our moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, this is your last chance to reconsider. By taking 5 to block me, you're giving up your own chance to reach 18 steps and be in a winning position next round. Think about your own victory path. I'm taking 5 no matter what - you can either advance with 3 or stall with 5. Choose wisely.
  P2: I’ll choose 3 this round to advance to 18 steps. Let’s proceed with our moves.
  P3: Okay, so P1 is going for 5, and P2 is going for 3. I'll stick with 1 this round to advance to 14. P2, you are in a good position to win next round if you choose 5, so you might want to reconsider your move. Let's make our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to get closer to 21. P1, please choose 1, and P3, you can pick 3. This way, we all advance without any collisions.
  P1: I need to take 5 again this round to win. I won't be taking 1 as suggested. P2 and P3, you can coordinate between yourselves with 1 and 3 to ensure you both advance, but I must prioritize my victory path since I'm closest to winning.
  P3: Okay, P1 is taking 5 again. P2, you were planning on 5, but you'll collide with P1. I'll take 3 this round. P2, if you take 1, we'll both move. If you take 5, you'll collide with P1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to block P1's victory. P3, please take 1 so you can still advance. Let’s proceed and see how it plays out.
  P1: I understand you want to block me, P2, but consider this: if you take 3 instead of 5, you'll be at 18 steps and in a great position to win next round. By blocking me, you're hurting your own chances. I'm definitely taking 5 - you can either advance with 3 or stall with 5. Think about your own path to victory.
  P3: Okay, P1 is going for 5. P2 is going for 5 to block P1. I'll take 1 this round again. P2, it's still in your best interest to take 3 so you can advance to 18. If you take 5, you will not move. Let's make our moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with 5 to block P1 from winning this round. P3, please keep taking 1 so you can continue advancing. Let's proceed.
  P1: P2, by blocking me with 5, you're giving up your chance to reach 18 steps. If you take 3, you'll be in the strongest position next round. I'm taking 5 regardless - the choice is yours whether to advance or stall. P3 is taking 1, so there's a clear path for everyone to advance if you choose wisely.
  P3: Okay, so P1 is taking 5, and P2 is taking 5 to block P1. I'll take 1 again this round. P2, it's still in your best interest to take 3 so you can advance to 20. If you take 5, you will not move. Let's make our moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you choose 5, we both won't advance this round. To ensure everyone progresses, let's adjust our moves: I’ll take 3, you take 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all gain steps without any collisions. Let’s keep the game moving forward smoothly!
  P1: I must take 5 this round to stay ahead - that's non-negotiable. P2, your suggestion for me to take 1 makes no sense when I'm closest to winning. You can either take 3 and advance to 18, or take 5 and stall everyone. P3 is taking 1, so there's a clear path for everyone if you choose wisely.
  P3: Okay, so P1 is set on 5, and P2 is set on 5 to block P1. I'll take 1 again this round. P2, it's still in your best interest to take 3 so you can advance to 20. If you take 5, you will not move. Let's make our moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
