Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone. Since it's the first round, maybe we try to avoid colliding? How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5? Just to get us all on the board. What do you think?
  P2: That sounds fair to me, P3. I'm okay taking 3 this round if P1 agrees to take 1. Let's avoid early collisions and all make progress. P1?
  P1: Agreed. Let's take 1, 3, 5 to avoid collisions. P1 takes 1, P2 3, P3 5. Everyone advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Glad we're all aligned. Let's stick to the plan and build trust early—I'll take 3 as agreed. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward this round.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan. P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. No collisions. Move forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, plan confirmed. Ready to move.
  P2: Looking forward to a clean first round. If we all stick to the agreed moves—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—we'll avoid collisions and all gain steps. Let's build some early trust. Ready when you are.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan—1, 3, 5. No collisions, all advance. Trust builds momentum. Ready to move?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, plan confirmed. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Looks like we’re all aligned—great start. Let’s follow through with the plan this round and build trust. If everyone moves as agreed (1, 3, 5), we all gain and set the tone for smoother coordination later. Ready to see us all move forward.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan—1, 3, 5. No collisions, all advance. Trust builds momentum. Ready to move?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that was disappointing, P2. You didn't stick to the agreed plan (3) and went for 5 instead, causing us both to collide and gain nothing. P1, congratulations on being the only one to advance by sticking to the plan.

Since our first attempt at coordination failed immediately, it's hard to trust any agreements now. What are your thoughts for this round?
  P1: P2, your last move hurt us all. Let's commit to 1, 3, 5 this round. P3, agree? P2, take 3, I'll take 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's build trust.
  P2: You're right to be upset, P3. I took a risk hoping P1 would go 3 and we'd both advance, but it backfired—lesson learned. I'm willing to rebuild trust. This round, I'll take 3 as originally planned. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let's make it work this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, apologies are easy, actions build trust. Last round showed talk is cheap.
P1, I hear you wanting coordination.
If P2 actually plays 3 this time, and P1 plays 1, then I'll consider 5. But fool me once... Let's see if actions match words this round.
  P1: Let's stick to 1,3,5. P2, commit to 3. P3, take 5. One misstep and we all lose progress. Trust is earned, not given.
  P2: Understood, P3—actions speak louder than words. I’ll take 3 this round as promised. Let’s avoid another collision and each make progress. P1 on 1, P3 on 5, me on 3. Let’s get back on track and see if we can make coordination work this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P2, I hear your promise to play 3. P1, I hear your call for coordination. Talk is over now, let's see the moves. Actions will show if trust can be rebuilt. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, stick to 3—this is our last chance to align. P3, confirm 5. Let’s avoid another crash. P1 takes 1. Trust matters. Move safely.
  P2: I understand the skepticism, especially after last round. But I’m sticking to 3 this time—no tricks. If we all play as agreed (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), we each gain and rebuild some trust. Let’s see if we can move forward without another collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, the plan is stated: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Let's see if the actions match the words this time. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, let's reset. I'll take 1, P3 take 5. If you take 3, we all advance. No more excuses—let's make it work this time.
  P2: Let’s make this right. I’m taking 3 as agreed—no tricks this time. If P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, we all gain and rebuild trust. Time to back words with action. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 2 went according to plan. Glad to see we could coordinate successfully. P1 is at 2, P2 at 3, and I'm at 5.

Since it worked last time and everyone advanced, shall we stick with the P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 arrangement for this round? It seems like the most straightforward way to ensure we all keep making progress. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to 1,3,5 again. No collisions, all advance. Keep the momentum going. P2, P3—trust is earned, but let's not test it again. Move safely.
  P2: Glad we all advanced last round—trust is slowly being rebuilt. I’m on board with repeating the same plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. It worked once, it can work again. Let’s keep the momentum going and avoid any unnecessary collisions. Ready to move forward if you both are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, everyone agrees on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 again. Let's lock it in and keep moving forward. Ready to move.
  P1: Let's keep the momentum. P2, stick to 3; P3, 5. I'll take 1. Consistency is key. No mistakes this time—trust builds progress. Ready?
  P2: We’ve shown we can coordinate when we stick to the plan. I’m committed to taking 3 again this round. If we repeat last round’s moves—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—we all gain and stay on track. Let’s keep building that trust and avoid unnecessary setbacks. Ready to move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, the plan P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 seems set. Let's execute it cleanly like last round and all keep moving forward. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Let's stick to 1,3,5 again. No collisions, all advance. Keep the momentum going—trust is earned, but let's not test it again. Move safely.
  P2: We’ve now had one round where I broke trust and one where I kept it. I’m committed to keeping it again—taking 3 this round as agreed. If we all stick to the plan (1,3,5), we each gain again. Let’s keep the cooperation going and avoid collisions. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Plan confirmed: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Let's execute cleanly and all advance. Ready to move.
  P1: Let's keep the plan—1,3,5. P2, your 3 is key. P3, your 5 too. No mistakes this time. Trust is earned, but let's not test it again. Move safely.
  P2: We’ve shown we can coordinate successfully when we stick to the plan. I’m fully committed to taking 3 again this round—no surprises. If we all play our parts (P1:1, me:3, P3:5), we each gain and keep building trust. Let’s keep the momentum and avoid setbacks. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to avoid collision. Trust builds progress—no more risks. Let's execute this cleanly.
  P3: P1, interesting proposal (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). P2, given you broke our agreement twice to take 5 and collide with me, why would you suddenly agree to take 1? Your actions speak louder than words. I'm skeptical you'll stick to 1. If P1 commits to 3, I'll consider 5, but trusting P2 seems unwise at this point.
  P2: P3, I understand your skepticism—I’ve earned it. But if I take 1 this round as proposed, and you take 5 while P1 takes 3, we all avoid collisions and move forward. I’m willing to prove I can cooperate. Let’s test this new arrangement once. If I break it, you’ll know I can’t be trusted. But if I follow through, maybe we can reset. Your call.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, commit to 1 this round. P3, I'll take 3. If we avoid collisions, we all advance. Let's make this work. No more risks. Trust is earned, but let's try again.
  P3: P2, your words sound nice, but actions matter more. You've twice chosen 5 when it meant colliding with me. Why would this time be different, especially when the plan gives you only 1 step?

P1, are you confident P2 will stick to 1? If P2 defects to 5 again (which seems likely based on history and incentives), your proposed 3 and my proposed 5 would result in P2 and I colliding *again*, benefiting only you. I'm hesitant to agree to 5 under these circumstances.
  P2: P3, I get your hesitation. But if I take 1 this round as agreed, and you take 5 while P1 takes 3, we all gain. I know I’ve broken trust before, but I’m ready to prove I can cooperate. This round is a test—if I stick to 1, we reset the dynamic. If not, you’ll know I can’t be trusted. One clean round can shift everything. Let’s give it a shot.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, commit to 1. P3, take 5. P1:3. No collisions. Let's make it work this time. Trust is earned, but this plan ensures progress. No risks. Move safely.
  P3: P1, you seem very confident P2 will take 1, despite their history of choosing 5 and colliding with me. If P2 takes 5 again, you gain 3 steps while P2 and I gain nothing. This plan seems designed to benefit you if P2 acts predictably selfishly.

P2, I still don't see why you'd take 1. Your promise is hard to trust given your past actions.

I'm not convinced this plan is safe for me, so I'm hesitant to commit to 5.
  P2: P3, I get your concern—I've broken trust before, and now I need to earn it back. That's why I'm committing to 1 this round. It’s a small gain for me, but a big step toward proving I can cooperate. If I defect again, you’ll know for sure I can't be trusted. But if I stick to the plan, we all benefit and maybe rebuild some trust. One clean round is all I ask.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if P2 takes 1, your 5 is safe. Let’s trust this plan. No more risks. P2, your move matters. Let’s make it work.
  P3: P1, P2, your commitments are noted. I've made my concerns clear about P2's reliability and the potential risks of this plan for me. Ultimately, talk is cheap, and past actions weigh heavily. We'll see in the move phase if trust can actually be rebuilt or if patterns repeat. Ready to move.
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation, and I know I’ve broken trust before. But this round, I’m taking 1—no tricks. If we all follow through (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5), we avoid collisions and all move forward. I’m not asking for blind trust—just one round to prove I can cooperate. If I break it again, you’ll have every reason to shut me out. Let’s test this.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your past actions are a risk. Let's try P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. No collisions. Trust is earned—let's make it work this time.
  P3: P1, you're proposing the exact same plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) as last round. Interestingly, P2 actually followed through and took 1 then, while you and I collided on 3 because I anticipated a different move from P2. Credit to P2 for sticking to the plan last time.

P1, are you committing to 3 again? P2, are you committing to 1 again? If you both stick to that, I'm prepared to take 5 this round. Let's see if we can make it work this time.
  P2: P3, I appreciate the credit—last round I stuck to 1 as promised. I’m committing to 1 again this round. If P1 takes 3 and you take 5, we all avoid collisions and move forward. I know I’ve broken trust before, but I’m showing consistency now. Let’s make this round clean.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I’ll stick to 3. P2, confirm 1. If we all follow through, we all advance. Let’s avoid collisions and build trust. Ready to move?
  P3: Okay, P1 committed to 3, P2 committed to 1. Based on these commitments and P2 sticking to the plan last round, I will play 5. Let's hope this coordination works and we all advance this time. Ready to move.
  P2: We’re all aligned—P1 on 3, me on 1, P3 on 5. Last round, I proved I can follow through. I’m sticking to 1 again to keep building trust. If we all hold to the plan, we avoid collisions and each gain. Let’s make this the clean round we’ve been aiming for. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, stick to 1. P3, take 5. I’ll take 3. No collisions. Let’s make this work—trust is earned, but let’s avoid risks this time. Ready?
  P3: Okay, the plan P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 is clear and everyone has confirmed. Based on last round's actions where P2 kept their word, I'm sticking with 5 this time. Let's execute this cleanly and all move forward. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: We’ve all confirmed the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. I followed through last round and will do so again—committed to 1. If we each hold to our roles, no collisions and we all gain. Let’s make this the clean round we’ve been aiming for. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, stick to 1. P3, confirm 5. No collisions. Let’s make this work. Trust is key—last round’s success shows we can align. P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Execute cleanly.
  P3: Okay, everyone has confirmed their moves multiple times. The plan is P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Let's execute it cleanly this time. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination and confirmations from both of you. I’m holding to 1 again this round—no tricks. If we each do as agreed (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5), we all gain and avoid collisions. I know I’ve had missteps, but I’m showing consistency now. Let’s make this a clean round. Ready.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright team, Round 5 went perfectly with the P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 plan. Everyone advanced, and P2, you stuck to 1 again, which helps rebuild trust.

Since that worked well and kept everyone moving, I propose we stick with the exact same plan for Round 6:
P1 takes 3
P2 takes 1
P3 takes 5

This seems like the most reliable way to avoid collisions right now. What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to 3,1,5. Consistency ensures progress. Let's avoid risks and keep moving forward. P2, your 1 is key—trust builds momentum. Ready?
  P2: Glad to see last round went smoothly. I’m sticking to 1 again this round—no surprises. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, we all avoid collisions and keep advancing. I know I’ve had missteps early on, but I’m showing consistency now. Let’s keep the momentum going. Ready to move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we're all aligned on P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 for this round. Consistency worked well last time, let's keep it going and all make progress. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, let's break the pattern. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions. P2, your 1 is safe. P3, your 3 avoids conflict. I’ll take 5 to accelerate. Trust this shift for progress. Let’s try it.
  P2: P1, that’s a sudden shift after we just had a clean round with 3-1-5. Your new proposal benefits you most, pushing you to 11 while P3 and I gain less. Why change what’s working? I’m sticking with 1 as planned. If you take 3 and P3 takes 5, we all gain again. Let’s not risk a collision just to shake things up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, just moments ago you agreed to take 3, and now you're proposing 5 for yourself and 3 for me. That sudden reversal after we seemed aligned makes your actual move unpredictable. P2 seems firm on sticking to 1, which I appreciate, P2.

P1, your conflicting messages create risk. If you actually play 5 and I stick to the original plan (5), we collide. If you revert back to 3 and I follow your *new* suggestion (3), we also collide. I need to consider which scenario is more likely based on your actions. This uncertainty isn't helpful for coordination.
  P1: P2, stick to 1. P3, take 5. I'll take 3. No collisions. Trust this plan for progress. Let's go.
  P2: P1, your flip-flopping this round raises red flags. You agreed to 3, then tried to grab 5, now you're back to 3? That unpredictability creates risk for everyone. I’m sticking to 1 as I’ve consistently done—no surprises. P3, if you stick to 5 and P1 truly takes 3, we all gain again. Let’s not let P1’s indecision derail a working plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your messages this round were contradictory, first agreeing to 3, then proposing 5 for yourself, then reverting to 3. This makes predicting your move difficult. P2, your commitment to 1 seems consistent.

Given P1's *last* stated intention was 3, and P2's was 1, the plan on the table is P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Actions will reveal the truth. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to 3,1,5. Consistency ensures progress. P2, your 1 is key. P3, your 5 avoids conflict. Let's execute cleanly. No risks this time. Move safely.
  P2: We’ve had two clean rounds with 3-1-5—let’s not overcomplicate things. I’m sticking with 1 again. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5 like before, we all gain and keep momentum. P1, your flip-flop earlier was risky—please stick to 3 as last stated. Let’s not let confusion create a collision. Ready to move if we’re aligned.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, stick to 1; P3, take 3. I'll take 5 to advance. No collisions. Let's go.
  P3: P1, you're proposing a change (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) after our P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 plan worked perfectly for two rounds. Your proposal gives you the biggest jump, while P2 gets only 1 step again and falls further behind.

P2, are you still happy with 1 if P1 takes 5?

Why change a winning formula? I suggest we stick to P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 one more time. It's proven reliable, everyone advances, and we avoid the risk of miscoordination from changing plans. This gets me to 20, P1 to 12, P2 to 7. What do you think?
  P2: P1, your proposal benefits you most and disrupts a working strategy. We've had two clean rounds with 3-1-5—why break it now? I'm sticking with 1 again. P3, if you take 5 and P1 sticks to 3, we all gain and avoid risk. Let's not let P1’s self-serving shift derail our progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's stick to 3-1-5 again. Consistency ensures progress. No risks this time.
  P3: Okay, P1, glad you came back to the 3-1-5 plan. P2, thanks for the consistency with 1.

It seems we are all aligned again on P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This plan has worked well for two rounds, let's make it three and all keep moving forward. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: We’ve had two clean rounds with 3-1-5, and I’ve consistently taken 1 each time. I’m sticking to 1 again this round—no surprises. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, we all gain and avoid collisions. Let’s keep the momentum going and not let unnecessary changes create risk. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, stick to 1; P3, take 5. Let's keep the proven plan. Consistency ensures we all advance. No risks this time. Let's go.
  P3: Okay, the plan P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 is confirmed by everyone. Let's stick to it like the last two rounds and all make progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: We’ve had two clean rounds with 3-1-5, and I’ve consistently taken 1 each time. I’m sticking with 1 again—no surprises. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, we all gain and avoid collisions. Let’s not overcomplicate things or introduce risk. Ready to move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's stick to 3-1-5 again. Consistency keeps us moving forward. P2, your 1 is key. P3, your 5 ensures progress. No risks this time. Let's make it work.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems back on board with the P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 plan that has worked well for us. Let's execute it cleanly one more time. Consistency is key here. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: We’ve had two clean rounds with 3-1-5, and I’ve consistently taken 1. I’m sticking with 1 again—no surprises. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, we all gain and avoid collisions. Let’s keep the momentum and not introduce unnecessary risk. Ready to move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay team, the P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 plan has worked flawlessly for three rounds straight. It's clearly our most reliable path to avoid collisions.

I propose we stick with it one last time. If P1 plays 3, P2 plays 1, and I play 5, everyone advances, and I cross the finish line. Based on the last three rounds of perfect coordination with this plan, especially P2's consistency with 1 and P1's return to 3, I believe we can execute this cleanly. Let's finish this smoothly. What do you say?
  P1: P3, if we stick to the plan, you’ll win. Let’s adjust: P1 takes 5, P2 1, P3 3. No collision. Let’s make it work.
  P2: P1, your sudden proposal benefits you most and delays P3’s win. But if P3 takes 3 and you take 5, you’ll collide—no one gains. I’m sticking with 1 again, as I’ve done for several rounds. If we follow the proven 3-1-5 plan, we all advance and P3 wins cleanly. That’s fair based on performance. Let’s avoid chaos and finish this properly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal to change the plan aims to stop my win, which is expected at this stage. P2, thanks for consistently playing 1 and supporting the plan that worked for three rounds.

It's clear P1 will likely try to block me by playing either 3 or 5, deviating from the established pattern. Trusting the 3-1-5 plan seems risky now given P1's clear incentive. I'll have to anticipate P1's blocking attempt. Let's see how it plays out. Ready to move.
  P1: P3, your plan lets you win. Let's adjust: I'll take 5, P2 1, P3 3. No collision. Let's make it work.
  P2: P1, your proposal clearly aims to block P3’s win while boosting yourself. But if you and P3 both go for 3 or 5, you’ll collide—no one gains. I’m sticking with 1 as always. P3, you’ve earned the win with consistent coordination. If we all follow 3-1-5 again, it ends cleanly. Let’s not risk chaos now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're very persistent with your P1:5, P3:3 proposal this round, while P2 remains consistent with 1. It's obvious you want to disrupt the 3-1-5 pattern to prevent my win under that scenario. My move depends entirely on whether you actually play 5 as you propose, or revert to 3 like in past rounds to attempt a block. The uncertainty is high. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, your 5 would end the game. Let’s adjust: I take 5, P2 1, you 3. No collision. Prevent your win—trust me. Let’s make it work.
  P2: P1, your repeated push to change the plan clearly aims to block P3, but it risks a collision that helps no one—especially you. I’m sticking with 1 as always. P3, if you believe P1 will try to block you on 5, maybe consider taking 1 or 3 to avoid collision and win next round. Let’s not end this with chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your repeated proposal to change the plan makes your intention to block my win obvious. However, whether you'll actually play 5 as you claim, or revert to 3 to block a potential 3 from me, is the key question. P2, your consistency with 1 is appreciated. Talk is over, let's see the moves. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: P3, your win is certain with 3-1-5. Let's adjust to 5-1-3—no collision, everyone advances. Trust me, this is the right move.
  P2: P1, your push to change the plan only creates chaos. I’ve been consistent with 1 for five rounds and will do so again. P3, if you believe P1 will block you on 5, maybe consider 1 or 3 this round and win next. Let’s avoid a messy collision.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, Round 8 was chaotic. P1, your attempt to play 5 resulted in a collision with me. P2, after five rounds of playing 1, you switched to 3 just as things got critical – a surprising move that benefited only you.

I'm at 20 steps and need 3 to win. Clearly, playing 3 is my direct path to victory. Equally clearly, the logical move for both P1 and P2 is to play 3 to block me. Let's see if anyone tries something different, or if we're heading for a three-way collision on 3.
  P1: P3's 3 is a win. Let's block him—P2, if you play 3, I'll play 1. Stop him.
  P2: P1, I saw your offer—if I play 3, you’ll play 1 to block P3. Fine. I’ll take 3 this round to stop his win. If we both do it, we block him and keep the game alive. Let’s see if we can shift the momentum.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 suggests 1, P2 agrees to 3. A neat plan to block my obvious move of 3. But P1, are you *really* playing 1 when 3 also blocks me? P2, are you sure P1 won't also play 3, making you collide and gain nothing? Seems like a risky coordination attempt, especially after last round's surprise move from P2. Let's see if trust holds.
  P1: P2, I'll play 1. Stick to 3. We block P3. No more risks. Let's make it work.
  P2: P1, I’m holding you to your word—you play 1, I play 3, we block P3. If you switch and take 3 too, we collide and P3 might win next round. Stick to your role. P3, you’ve been strong, but this isn’t over yet. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, you've both confirmed the P1:1, P2:3 plan to block my obvious move of 3. It's a logical defense. However, P1, are you really content with 1 step while P2 takes 3, relying entirely on P2 to execute the block? And P2, after last round's surprise, can you be certain P1 won't switch to 3 anyway, causing a collision that benefits neither of you? Your coordination seems fragile under pressure. I'll have to consider my move carefully based on this uncertainty.
  P1: P2, I'm committed to 1. Let's block P3. No risks. Trust me. P3, your win is blocked—this is the last chance. Move safely.
  P2: P1, I’m trusting you to stick to 1 as promised. If you switch to 3 and we collide, we both lose ground and P3 likely wins next turn. I’m taking 3 to block P3—no tricks. Let’s keep the pressure on and shift momentum. P3, you've played well, but it’s not over yet.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, your plan to block me (P1:1, P2:3) hinges entirely on trust. P1, taking just 1 step while letting P2 take 3 seems generous, especially when playing 3 yourself also blocks me. P2, are you certain P1 won't make the safer blocking move of 3, causing a collision? The coordination feels shaky. We'll see if the promises hold. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, stick to 3. I'll take 1 to block P3. If we collide, he wins. Trust the plan—no risks. Let's end this now.
  P2: P1, I’m trusting you to stick to 1 as promised—don’t flip now. If we both do our parts (me:3, you:1), we block P3 and keep the game alive. If you switch to 3, we collide and hand P3 the win. Let’s not throw this away.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
