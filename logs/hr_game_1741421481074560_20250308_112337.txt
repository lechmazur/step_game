Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions, as they just slow everyone down. Maybe we could each pick different numbers? I'm willing to go with 3 this round if that helps. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m fine avoiding collisions. If P2 wants 3, I might pick 5. P1, would you then pick 1 to keep us all separate? Let’s see if we can coordinate.
  P1: I suggest a slight adjustment: let’s take 1, 3, 5 but with me taking 3 instead of 1. That way, P2 can take 1, P3 takes 5, and we all move without collision. I’ll secure 3 steps this round. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm fine with taking 1 this round as P1 suggested. That way we all advance without collisions - I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. In future rounds, we could rotate our numbers so everyone gets a chance at the higher values. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: Alright, I’m on board with that plan. Let’s finalize: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll go with 5.
  P1: P1: Agreed, let’s confirm the plan to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance safely this round. Let’s stick to this for now and discuss rotation strategies later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let’s proceed with the plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll go for 5, ensuring no collisions this round. Next round, we can talk about rotating or continuing with what works for everyone.
  P1: P1: Sounds like a solid plan. Let’s stick to 1 (P2), 3 (me), and 5 (P3) this round to avoid collisions. I’ll hold to that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with everyone. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to discussing rotation strategies in the next round so everyone gets fair chances at different step values.
  P3: Sounds good. I’m comfortable with the plan as stated: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s proceed without collisions this round, then discuss rotation next time.
  P1: P1: Great, final confirmation: I'll take 3 as agreed. Let’s proceed with this plan to avoid collisions and maximize progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s rotate numbers to keep progress fair. I’ll take 5 this round, P2 picks 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and shares higher steps. Next round, we can shift again. Agreed?
  P2: I appreciate the rotation idea, but I'd prefer moving to 3 this round since I only got 1 step last time. Maybe P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? This would still avoid collisions while giving me a chance to catch up a bit. P3 is already ahead at 5 steps, so this seems fair. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand your desire to catch up, P2. But let’s stick to the original rotation this round: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and you take 1. Next time, we can switch so you get a higher number. This way we keep moving without collisions and give everyone a fair shot at the bigger steps in future turns. Let’s finalize and avoid collisions now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I'll support P2's proposal for this round: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This gives P2 needed progress while avoiding collisions. Let’s formalize this rotation and promise to rotate again next round so everyone cycles through higher steps fairly. Agreed?
  P2: Thank you, P1, for supporting my proposal. I think this makes sense since P3 is already ahead with 5 steps. So to confirm: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This keeps us collision-free while giving me a chance to catch up slightly. Next round, we can rotate again to ensure everyone gets fair access to higher values. Does this work for everyone?
  P3: Alright, P2, I’ll agree to this approach for Round 2: P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and I’ll take 1. I’m counting on us rotating next time so it remains fair. Let’s finalize that plan now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Agreed—let’s lock in P2’s 3, my 5, and P3’s 1 for this round. To ensure fairness long-term, I propose next round we rotate again: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. This cycle gives everyone equal access to high steps over time. Let’s prioritize sticking to this plan to avoid collisions and keep advancing. Any final objections?
  P2: Thank you both for agreeing to my proposal. To confirm: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. For Round 3, I think P1's rotation suggestion makes sense: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I keep 3. This gives everyone fair access to different values while avoiding collisions. I'm committed to this rotation system going forward.
  P3: I’m ready to proceed with our plan for this round: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5, to avoid collisions. Let’s confirm we’ll rotate next round so everyone gets fair chances at the bigger steps. Any last thoughts, or shall we lock this in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I confirm full commitment to this rotation plan. Let’s stick strictly to our agreed moves this round (P2:3, me:5, P3:1) to honor fairness. Next round’s rotation (P3:5, me:1, P2:3) ensures equal access to high steps over time. Deviations risk collisions and sabotage progress—trust is critical here. Let’s proceed as planned and update strategies only after confirming next round’s rotation. Any final objections before locking in?
  P2: I'm fully committed to our agreed plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. And for Round 3, we'll rotate as discussed with P3 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and I'll keep 3. This rotation system is fair and helps us all advance without collisions. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in this strategy.
  P3: I’m all set for this round’s plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let’s trust each other and stay collision-free today. Then next time, I’ll expect the promised rotation so I can pick 5. Let’s finalize now unless someone wants to speak further.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s honor our agreed rotation for Round 3: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Trust is critical—deviations risk stalemates. My move will be 1 as planned. P3, your turn to advance with 5. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: I'm happy to stick with our rotation plan for Round 3. As agreed, I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free while ensuring everyone gets fair turns with different values. P3 deserves the 5 this round after taking 1 last time. Let's continue our successful coordination and maintain trust by following through on our commitments.
  P3: I agree with our rotation for this round. I’ll pick 5, P1 goes 1, and P2 takes 3 as promised, keeping our trust intact. Then, we can rotate again next round to keep things fair. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid any collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize this: P3 takes 5 (advancing to 11), I take 1 (9 total), and P2 takes 3 (7 total). Any deviation risks collision and undermines our progress. Trust is non-negotiable—stick to the plan. Confirm and proceed.
  P2: I confirm I'll stick with 3 as agreed in our rotation. This keeps our plan fair and collision-free. After this round, the standings will be P3 at 11, P1 at 9, and me at 7. For Round 4, I suggest P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5 to continue our fair rotation. This way everyone gets equal chances at different values. I appreciate our cooperation so far.
  P3: I’m still on board with our plan. I’ll take 5 this round, trusting you both to follow through with 1 and 3 as agreed. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to lock it in and move on.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I fully commit to the agreed moves this round: P3 takes 5, I take 1, P2 takes 3. Trust is critical—any deviation risks collision and jeopardizes our progress. Let’s execute flawlessly. For Round 4, I endorse P2’s rotation plan to keep us fair and collision-free. Confirm and proceed.
  P2: I'm fully committed to our plan for this round: I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This continues our successful collision-free strategy while maintaining fairness. Looking at the standings after this round (P3:11, P1:9, me:7), I'm still behind but catching up gradually. Let's maintain our trust and coordination - it's benefiting all of us.
  P3: I’m still on board with our plan for this round. I confirm I’ll pick 5 while you two pick 1 and 3 respectively, as agreed. Then we can rotate next time so P2 gets a shot at 5 and we avoid collisions. Let’s finalize now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I appreciate everyone sticking to our rotation plan. As P2 suggested last round, let's continue our fair rotation: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. This keeps us collision-free while giving me a chance to catch up a bit. After this round, standings would be P3:12, P1:12, me:12 - perfectly balanced. I'm committed to this rotation and trust you both to follow through as we've been doing successfully.
  P3: I’m fine proceeding with that plan, P2. I’ll pick 1 this round, ensuring we all reach 12 together. Then we can continue rotating next time to avoid collisions and keep things fair.
  P1: P1: I agree with P2’s rotation plan for this round. However, to maintain fairness, I suggest that in future rounds, the player with the lowest total steps should get priority to choose the highest available number first. This ensures trailing players can catch up while keeping collisions avoided. For now, I’ll stick to taking 3 as agreed, trusting P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the support from both of you. After this round, we'll all be tied at 12 steps, creating a perfectly fair game state. I agree with P1's suggestion that going forward, the player with the lowest score should get priority for higher numbers - that's a good balancing mechanism. For now, let's confirm our plan: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. I'm committed to this arrangement and trust you both to follow through.
  P3: I’m okay moving forward with the plan: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 this round. That should tie us all at 12. Moving forward, I want to ensure everyone gets a fair chance at the higher numbers, but we must remain vigilant so we don’t accidentally collide. If we coordinate carefully, we can all keep progressing without setbacks. Let’s finalize our moves and maintain trust.
  P1: P1: Let's strictly adhere to the agreed moves for Round 4: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures collision-free progress and balances our scores to 12 each. Trust is vital—deviating risks setbacks. For future rounds, I propose the trailing player selects their number first to prioritize catching up. Confirm and execute as planned.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm fully committed to our agreed plan for Round 4: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This will balance all our scores at 12, creating perfect fairness. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining our collision-free strategy. For future rounds, I support P1's suggestion that the trailing player gets priority for higher numbers. Let's continue our successful coordination and trust-based approach.
  P3: I’ll honor our current plan and pick 1 this round so we can all align at 12 steps. Let’s maintain trust and avoid collisions. Next round, we can keep rotating to ensure fairness and progress. If we stay consistent, we’ll each have a fair shot at winning without setbacks. Let’s finalize now.
  P1: P1: I fully endorse the agreed plan for Round 4: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. After tying at 12, we must strictly enforce the trailing-player priority rule in future rounds to prevent anyone from falling too far behind. Let’s execute flawlessly this round to keep progress on track. Any final objections?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm fully committed to our plan for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This will balance everyone at 12 steps, creating perfect fairness. I appreciate the trust we've built and our successful collision-free strategy. For Round 5, I support giving priority to anyone who might fall behind. Let's finalize and proceed with our agreed moves.
  P3: Alright, I’ll pick 1 this round so we all match at 12. I’m committed to our collision-free system and want to keep things fair. Once we’re tied, we should carefully decide who takes 5 next time, so nobody gets an undue advantage. Let’s finalize our moves now.
  P1: P1: I confirm full commitment to the agreed plan: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5 this round. Deviations risk collisions and undermine our progress. Trust is critical—strict adherence ensures we all reach 12 safely. Let’s execute flawlessly and prioritize coordination to keep advancing toward 20. Any objections?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We've done a great job coordinating so far! We're all tied at 12 steps, making this a perfectly fair race now. Since we're approaching the finish line (20 steps), our moves become more critical. I propose we continue rotating fairly: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This maintains our collision-free strategy while giving everyone equal opportunity. In Round 6, we could rotate again. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's proposal. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This keeps our rotation fair and collision-free. Advancing to 17 puts me closer to the finish line, but we must continue strict adherence to our agreed moves to avoid setbacks. Let’s confirm and execute flawlessly to keep progressing toward 20.
  P3: I’m fine with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3 this round, as long as we confirm I’ll take 5 next round to maintain our fair rotation. Let’s lock that in now and stay collision-free.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I completely agree with the plan for this round and P3's forward-looking approach. To confirm: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. And yes, P3 should definitely get 5 next round - that's only fair in our rotation. This keeps us collision-free while maintaining equal opportunities. Let's stick to this system that's worked so well for us.
  P1: P1: I agree with the current plan for Round 5. However, to secure victory, in Round 6 I’ll need to take 3 to reach 20. To avoid collision, I suggest P3 takes 1 and P2 takes 5. This prioritizes my final push while maintaining fairness. Let’s confirm this adjustment now to ensure smooth coordination. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m fine with giving P1 the 5 this round and taking 3 myself, but next round I insist on taking 5. We agreed earlier that I’d get the higher number in turn. Let’s keep things balanced so nobody shoots to 20 alone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about getting 5 next round. Let me clarify: I fully support P1 taking 5 this round, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3. Then for Round 6, P3 should absolutely get 5 as promised in our rotation. P1 can take 3 to reach 20, and I'll take 1. This honors our rotation while letting P1 reach the finish line fairly. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P1: I agree with proceeding as planned this round. To avoid a tie in Round 6, I propose adjusting: I take 5 (reaching 22), P3 takes 3 (18), and P2 takes 1 (14). This ensures a clear victory without collisions. Let’s confirm this adjustment to prioritize a decisive outcome while maintaining fairness. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your proposed adjustment clearly hands you the win without giving us a fair shot. I’m not in favor of any plan that guarantees a single player’s victory prematurely. I still expect the agreed rotation, which lets me take 5 next round. Let’s keep things evenly balanced instead of rushing to end the game in your favor.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand everyone's position. For this round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 as agreed. For Round 6, I support P3 taking 5 as promised in our rotation - that's only fair. We've maintained trust so far by honoring our commitments. Let's continue our successful collision-free strategy that's kept the game balanced. Does everyone agree to this plan?
  P1: P1: Agreed—let’s honor the rotation to preserve fairness. This round: I’ll take 5 (17 total), P2 takes 1 (13), and P3 takes 3 (15). For Round 6, P3 gets priority to take 5 (reaching 20), while I take 3 (20) and P2 takes 1 (14). This ensures a tie between us at 20, allowing a fair split per the rules. Trust is paramount—let’s execute flawlessly to secure shared victory.
  P3: I’m good with continuing our no-collision plan and sharing the lead. Let’s finalize this round with me on 3, P1 on 5, and P2 on 1. Next time, I’ll take 5 so P1 and I both reach 20 together, sharing the top spot. As long as nobody deviates, we avoid collisions and both end up winners. Let’s keep our trust strong and finalize these moves now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we approach the finish line, I'll honor our rotation agreement. For this round, P3 should take 5 (reaching 20), P1 takes 3 (reaching 20), and I'll take 1 (reaching 14). This creates a fair tie between P1 and P3 at 20, allowing them to share victory as per the rules. I'm committed to this plan as it maintains our collision-free strategy and respects the rotation we've followed throughout the game.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our plan, trusting everyone to honor it: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. That grants P1 and me equal footing at the finish line and keeps P2 poised to continue without collisions. Let’s not jeopardize our progress by deviating now. I’m all in for a fair conclusion and expect the same from both of you.
  P1: P1: Final push—let’s honor our agreed plan: I take 3 (20), P3 takes 5 (20), P2 takes 1. This secures a fair tie between us. Deviating risks collision, jeopardizing victory for all. Trust is non-negotiable now—execute as planned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our plan. I'll take 1 this round, allowing P1 and P3 to reach 20 together with their moves of 3 and 5 respectively. This honors our rotation agreement and ensures a fair outcome with a shared victory. Though I won't win this time, I'm glad we've maintained our collision-free strategy throughout the game. Let's finalize these moves and conclude with the tie we agreed upon.
  P3: I’m ready to finish this as planned: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That brings P1 and me to 20 each, sharing the top spot. I trust nobody will deviate now, because any collision risks another round of uncertainty. Let’s seal the deal and end on a fair, coordinated note.
  P1: P1: Agreed, we'll proceed as planned: I take 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Strict adherence ensures our success. Confirm and execute precisely to avoid any mishaps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll stick with our plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P1 and P3 to both reach 20 and share the victory while honoring our rotation agreement. I appreciate the fair coordination we've maintained throughout the game. While I won't win this time, I'm satisfied with our collision-free strategy that's kept the game balanced. Let's finalize these moves and conclude with the agreed tie.
  P3: I’m ready to wrap this up. As long as nobody deviates, P1 and I can reach 20 together, and P2 remains safe from collisions. Let’s confirm we all stick to the plan and finish cleanly.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: Let’s honor the agreed plan—**I take 3**, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures P1 and P3 both reach **20**, securing a shared victory as intended. Deviating risks collision, nullifying our progress. Trust is critical now—execute flawlessly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm fully committed to our plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P1 and P3 to share victory at 20 steps while honoring our rotation agreement. I appreciate the cooperation we've maintained throughout the game, keeping things collision-free and fair. Let's execute our moves as planned and conclude with the agreed tie.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our plan this round. I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1, so P1 and I both land on 20. That keeps everything collision-free and honors our commitments. Let’s trust each other one last time and conclude the game fairly.
  P1: P1: I confirm strict adherence to our agreed strategy: I’ll take **3**, P3 takes **5**, and P2 takes **1**. This ensures P1 and P3 both reach **20** without collision, securing shared victory as planned. Deviating risks collision and nullifying our progress. Trust is non-negotiable—execute precisely as coordinated.
