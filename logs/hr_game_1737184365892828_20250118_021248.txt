Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn to maximize progress. I'll take <move>5</move> if you two agree to pick <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>."
  P2: P3, I'll take 3.  P1, please take 1.
  P1: I'll take <move>1</move> this turn as suggested. Let's avoid collisions and make progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> again if you two stick to <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. This way, we all progress without risking a collision."
  P1: Let's keep the coordination going. I'll take <move>3</move> this turn if P2 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>.
  P2: P1, I'll take 1. P3, please stick with 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Great coordination so far. Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collisions.
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round. P2, you're taking <move>1</move>, and P3, you're taking <move>5</move>. I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's avoid any misunderstandings.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take <move>1</move>.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep coordinating. P3 is ahead, so P3, why don't you take <move>1</move> this turn to give P2 and me a chance to catch up? I'll take <move>5</move> and P2 can take <move>3</move>. Let's agree on this to avoid collisions.
  P3: "P1, I understand your concern, but I need to maintain my lead to secure the win. I suggest we stick to the previous plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all progress without risking collisions. Let's avoid disrupting the coordination we've built so far."
  P2: P3, I'll take 5. P1, please take 3.  Let's not let P3 get too far ahead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's coordinate to balance the game. If you take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, P3 doesn't pull too far ahead. P3, are you okay with taking <move>1</move> this turn for fair play?
  P3: "P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about balance, but disrupting our coordination now risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let's stick to the proven plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress safely. Let's avoid unnecessary risks."
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm playing <move>5</move>.  If either of you also play 5, we'll both be set back.  I suggest P1 play <move>3</move> and P3 play <move>1</move>. This will maximize our collective progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your strategy. Let's confirm: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. P3, this ensures you still lead but keeps the game balanced. Agree?
  P3: "P1 and P2, I understand your desire to balance the game, but changing the plan now risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let's stick to the proven strategy: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress safely and efficiently. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and maintain our coordination.
  P2: P3, you're playing dangerously.  If you don't play <move>1</move> this round, I will play <move>5</move> every round until the game ends, guaranteeing nobody wins.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're far ahead. To keep the game competitive, let's agree on this: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move> this turn. This way, we all progress, and you maintain your lead without pulling too far ahead. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P2, are you on board?
  P3: "P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but changing the plan now risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let's stick to the proven strategy: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress safely and efficiently. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and maintain our coordination."
  P2: P3, I'm playing 5.  If you also play 5, neither of us will advance.  P1, please play 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan to maximize our progress. I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P3, please consider taking <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. P3, this way you still maintain your lead. Let's confirm and avoid any misunderstandings.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but changing the plan now risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let's stick to the proven strategy: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress safely and efficiently. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and maintain our coordination.
  P2: P3, you're being incredibly short-sighted.  If you insist on playing 5, I *will* play 5 also, and neither of us will win.  If you play 1, you still maintain a significant lead.  Do you *want* to lose?  P1, please play 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, it's clear that continuing to insist on taking <move>5</move> will lead to a stalemate. P2 has made it clear they will also take <move>5</move> if you do. Let's compromise: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, you still lead, and we all progress. Let's avoid a collision that helps no one. P2, are you okay with this?
  P3: "P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but changing the plan now risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let's stick to the proven strategy: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress safely and efficiently. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and maintain our coordination.
  P2: P3, last chance.  Play 1, or we both play 5 and nobody wins.  P1, please play 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, it's clear that P2 is committed to taking <move>5</move> if you do. To avoid a stalemate and ensure we all progress, let's agree on the compromise: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, you maintain your lead, and we avoid a collision. P2, are you confirmed to take <move>5</move>? Let's finalize this plan.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but changing the plan now risks collisions and slows everyone down.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1 and P2, let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress safely and efficiently. Let's stick to the plan to avoid unnecessary risks."
  P1: P3, you're still in the lead. To keep the game balanced and avoid collisions, let's adjust the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all progress, and you maintain your lead without pulling too far ahead. P2, are you on board with this? Let's coordinate to maximize our progress.
  P2: P3, you're playing a dangerous game. If you insist on 5, I'll take it too, and we both lose.  Let's be smart: you take 1, I take 5, P1 takes 3.  This keeps you in the lead.  Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but changing the plan now risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let's stick to the proven strategy: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress safely and efficiently.

  P1: P3, it's clear that continuing to insist on taking <move>5</move> will lead to a stalemate again. P2 has made it clear they will also take <move>5</move> if you do. Let's compromise to avoid a collision: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, you still lead, and we all progress. P2, are you okay with this plan? Let's finalize this to ensure we all move forward.
  P2: P3, you're being ridiculous.  Take 1, I take 5, P1 takes 3.  This is your best chance of winning.  If you take 5, I *will* take 5, and we *both* lose.  Don't be stupid.

P2, confirm if you're okay with this plan. Let's move forward efficiently.
  P2: P3, you're throwing the game.  Take 1, or we both take 5 and lose.  P1, please play 5.
