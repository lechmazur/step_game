Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Error: Request timed out.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions right from the start. I suggest we each pick a different number for our moves this round. I’m leaning towards one of the options, but I won’t say which yet. How about you two suggest which numbers you’re considering, and we can coordinate to ensure we all advance? Let’s keep this fair and strategic. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds reasonable, P1. I'll wait to hear from P3 first, but I'm open to picking different numbers to avoid collisions. P3, any thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm fine with avoiding collisions. Since we're all at 0 steps, I think I'll go with <move>3</move> for this round. That way we can all make different moves and advance. P1 and P2, you can take 1 and 5 between yourselves. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: Thanks, P3, for suggesting 3. I’m okay with that. P2, since P3 has picked 3, how about you take 1 and I’ll go with 5? That way, we all choose different numbers and should avoid any collisions this round. Let me know if that works for you, P2. If everyone agrees, we can move forward smoothly.
  P2: Alright, P1, I'll take 1 and you take 5 as agreed. Thanks for coordinating clearly, P3. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round didn’t go as planned since there was a collision on 1. Let’s try to coordinate better this time. I’m open to picking any number, but I’d like to hear your preferences first to avoid another clash. P3, since you suggested 3 last time but moved to 1, can you confirm your choice this round? P2, what are you thinking? Let’s aim for different numbers again to ensure we all advance. I’ll adjust based on your inputs. What do you both think?
  P3: I apologize for the confusion last round. I intended to pick 3 but must have made an error. This time, I'll definitely choose 3 as I originally suggested. P2, since you're at 0 steps like me, would you consider taking 5 this round? That would let P1 take 1, giving us all different numbers and allowing everyone to advance. What do you both think about this arrangement?
  P2: Alright P3, I'll take 5 this round as you suggested. P1, you take 1, and P3 sticks to 3. Let's stick clearly to these choices to avoid another collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for your inputs. I'm fine with taking 1 this round as suggested. P3, I appreciate the clarification, and P2, thanks for agreeing to 5. Let’s all stick to this plan—P3 on 3, P2 on 5, and me on 1—to ensure no collisions. If we’re all set, I think we can wrap up the conversation here.
  P3: I'm good with our plan - I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This way we all advance without collisions. After this round, P1 will be at 6 steps, P2 at 5, and I'll be at 3. We'll need to coordinate again next round, but this arrangement works well for now.
  P2: I'm all set with our agreed plan. Let's stick to it this time to ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great to see our plan worked last round! Now I'm at 3 steps, P2 at 5, and P1 at 6. Since P1 is in the lead, maybe we should consider slowing them down? P2, would you be willing to pick the same number as P1 this round to create a collision? I'm thinking of going with 5 to advance myself. What do you both think about this strategy?
  P2: P3, interesting suggestion, but intentionally causing collisions might backfire on both players involved. I'd prefer we continue coordinating clearly to avoid collisions and keep advancing steadily. P1, what do you think about the current situation?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we avoided collisions last round. P2, I appreciate your focus on steady progress. I’m open to coordinating again to ensure we all advance. How about I pick 3 this round? P2, since you’re at 5, maybe take 1, and P3, since you mentioned 5, that works. This way, we each get different numbers. Let’s keep the momentum going without unnecessary risks. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, we can move forward smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the coordination suggestions. P1, I'm actually willing to take 1 instead of 5 this round. That would give you 3 and P2 could take 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while allowing me to catch up a bit. P2 would be at 10, P1 at 9, and I'd be at 4 - keeping the game competitive but fair. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: Alright P3, your suggestion sounds fair—I'll take 5, you take 1, and P1 takes 3. Let's stick clearly to this arrangement to avoid collisions again. If P1 agrees, we can finalize and move forward smoothly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the suggestions. I’m fine with the plan—P3 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and me taking 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. Let’s stick to this arrangement for a smooth round. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. This way we all advance without collisions. After this round, the standings would be P2 at 10, P1 at 9, and me at 4. It keeps the game competitive while allowing everyone to make progress. I'm ready to proceed with this arrangement.
  P2: I'm all set and comfortable with our agreed plan. Let's stick to it and move ahead smoothly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve agreed on a plan for this round—P3 on 1, P2 on 5, and me on 3. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. I think maintaining this cooperative approach benefits us all while keeping the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed with this arrangement.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P2 is in the lead at 10 steps, with P1 close behind at 9, while I'm trailing at 4. We need to be strategic now. P2 is halfway to victory, so P1 might want to block them. I'm thinking of taking 5 this round to gain some ground. What are your thoughts on our moves this time? Should we continue coordinating, or is it time for more competitive play since the gap is widening?
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but intentionally causing collisions could stall everyone's progress. Let's continue coordinating to ensure steady advancement. I'm open to discussing a fair arrangement for this round again. P1, what are your thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P2 that coordination has worked well for us so far. Let’s aim for another collision-free round. I’m considering 1 this time to keep advancing. P2, since you’re in the lead, maybe take 3, and P3, you mentioned 5, which works. This way, we all pick different numbers and continue making progress. I think this keeps the game competitive yet fair. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, we can finalize this plan and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P1. I'm happy to take 5 as mentioned. This arrangement (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5) works well for me. It lets me gain some ground while keeping things fair. After this round, standings would be P2 at 13, P1 at 10, and me at 9, which keeps the game competitive. Does everyone agree with this plan?
  P2: I'm comfortable with the arrangement suggested: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick clearly to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair and competitive. If everyone agrees, we can proceed smoothly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan for this round—me taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. I think sticking to this cooperative approach benefits everyone while we each work toward the goal. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to finalize this arrangement and proceed to the move phase. Let me know if you have any last thoughts or adjustments.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm good with our plan - I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This arrangement works well for everyone and keeps the game competitive. Looking forward to narrowing the gap between us after this round.
  P2: I'm all set with our agreed arrangement. Let's keep this smooth and fair so everyone can advance. Looking forward to another collision-free round.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on a plan for this round—me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and maintains a tight race. I think our cooperative strategy is working well, and I’m committed to sticking with this arrangement. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let me know if anything needs adjusting, otherwise, let’s finalize this and keep the momentum going.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Nice progress everyone. We're getting closer to the endgame now. To keep things fair and collision-free again, how about I take 1 this round? P1 and P3, you can decide between 3 and 5. Let me know if this works for you both.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for keeping the coordination going. P2, I’m fine with you taking 1 this round. I’ll go with 3 to keep advancing. P3, that leaves 5 for you, which helps you catch up. This way, we all pick different numbers and maintain a competitive balance. After this round, it’d be P2 at 14, me at 13, and P3 at 14, tightening the race. Does this work for everyone? If we’re aligned, let’s finalize and move forward. Let me know if you have any adjustments.
  P3: I appreciate the plan, P1. Taking 5 while P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 3 works perfectly for me. This would indeed put P2 and me tied at 14 steps with P1 just behind at 13. The race is getting quite close! I'm happy to continue our coordination strategy since it's keeping the game competitive while allowing everyone to advance. Let's stick with this arrangement for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all aligned. I'll stick with 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep this momentum going and avoid any collisions.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page with the plan—P2 on 1, me on 3, and P3 on 5. This keeps the race tight and collision-free, which benefits us all at this stage. I’m committed to sticking with this arrangement to ensure we each advance. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let me know if anything needs adjusting, otherwise, let’s finalize this and keep the momentum going.
  P3: I'm happy with our plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This will put P2 and me tied at 14 steps with P1 at 13, making for an exciting race. As we get closer to the 20-step goal, our coordination becomes even more important. Let's stick with this arrangement and keep advancing smoothly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re neck-and-neck now with P2 and P3 at 14, and me at 13. Let’s keep coordinating to avoid collisions since we’re so close to the 20-step goal. I’m considering 5 this round to push ahead. P2, how about you take 1, and P3, maybe 3? This way, we all advance without clashing. After this, it’d be P2 at 15, P3 at 17, and me at 18—super tight. Does this work for everyone? Let me know your thoughts or if you’d prefer a different arrangement.
  P3: I see we're all very close now. P1's suggestion puts them in the lead at 18 steps after this round, which is concerning since they'd be just 2 steps from victory. I'd prefer to take 5 instead of 3 this round. Perhaps P1 could take 3 and P2 takes 1? This would put us all at P1: 16, P2: 15, and me: 19 - keeping things competitive but giving everyone a chance. What do you both think about this alternative?
  P2: P3, your suggestion heavily favors you, putting you at 19 steps—just one step from victory. To keep things balanced, let's find a fairer distribution. How about this: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This would leave us at P1:14, P3:17, and me at 19—still competitive for all. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the suggestions. P2, your plan puts you at 19, very close to winning, which shifts the balance. To keep things competitive, how about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This would result in me at 18, P2 at 17, and P3 at 15—still tight for everyone. I think this gives us all a fair shot while keeping the race exciting. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, let’s finalize this. If not, I’m open to adjustments.
  P3: I understand everyone wants to be strategic as we approach the finish line. P1's latest suggestion puts them in the lead at 18 steps, with P2 at 17 and me trailing at 15. While this keeps the race competitive, it disadvantages me the most. What if I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? This would result in P1:14, P2:19, and me:17 - keeping all of us in contention. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your suggestion would put me at 19, very close to winning, which understandably might worry both of you. I'm open to a balanced alternative. How about this: I take 3, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1. This would leave us at P1:14, me at 17, and P3 at 19. It keeps everyone competitive and doesn't overly favor any single player. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the ideas. P2, your latest suggestion puts P3 at 19, very close to winning, which could end the game next round. To keep it balanced, how about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This results in me at 16, P2 at 15, and P3 at 19—still competitive for all. I think this gives us each a fair chance while keeping the race tight. What do you both think? If we’re good, let’s finalize. If not, I’m open to tweaks.
  P3: I notice we're all suggesting plans that put ourselves in favorable positions. Since we're tied at 14 steps with P2 and just ahead of P1, I'm willing to compromise. How about I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1? This puts us at P1:18, P2:15, P3:17 - keeping all three of us in contention without anyone reaching 19 steps. This seems like the most balanced arrangement that doesn't heavily favor any single player. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your latest suggestion seems balanced and fair. I'm comfortable with taking 1, you taking 3, and P1 taking 5. This keeps the game competitive without anyone getting too close to victory immediately. Let's stick clearly to this arrangement and avoid collisions. I'm ready to finalize if P1 agrees.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're nearing the endgame now, and every move counts. To keep things fair and avoid immediate victory for anyone this round, let's carefully coordinate again. I'm open to suggestions—P1, P3, what are your thoughts on how we should proceed?
  P3: I see P1 is at 18 steps now, just 2 away from victory. We need to be strategic. If P1 takes 3 or 5 this round, they'll win. I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This would put us at P1:19, P2:18, and me:22 - giving me the win but keeping it close. Alternatively, P2 could try blocking P1 by choosing the same number. What are your thoughts on our approach this round?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m aware I’m close to 20 steps, but let’s keep this fair and competitive. P3, your suggestion puts you over 20, which ends the game in your favor. Instead, how about I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This results in me at 19, P2 at 20, and P3 at 20—tight and exciting. If multiple cross 20, highest steps or a tie decides it. This keeps us all in contention. What do you think? I’m open to adjustments if needed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion—it keeps the game competitive and gives us all a fair chance at victory. Let's stick clearly to this arrangement: P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all have a shot at winning or tying, making for an exciting finish.
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion, but it puts both P2 and me at exactly 20 steps, forcing a tie. I'd prefer to take 5 instead of 3, which would put me at 22 steps and give me the win outright. P1 could take 1 and P2 takes 3. Since we're at the endgame, we should each play for our own victory rather than forcing a tie. What do you both think about this alternative?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand we’re all pushing for the win now. P3, your plan puts you at 22, securing victory, which isn’t ideal for P2 or me. Let’s aim for a competitive finish. I’ll stick to 1, suggest P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This gets P2 and P3 to 20, me to 19—keeping it tight with a chance for all. If we tie at or above 20, highest steps or split points decide. Does this work? I’m open to tweaks if needed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1's arrangement is fair and keeps the game exciting for all of us. P3, if you insist on taking 5, I'll be forced to pick 5 as well to avoid handing you outright victory. Let's stick to the original suggestion: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. This way, we all have a fair shot at winning or tying.
  P3: I see both perspectives, but we're at the endgame now. If I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1, we'd have P1:19, P2:20, and me:20. This creates a tie between P2 and me, which is fair. I'm willing to accept this arrangement rather than forcing a collision that might leave us all stalled. Let's finish this game with a clean resolution - I'll take 3 as suggested.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aiming for a fair finish. I stick with 1, and I’m happy with P2 taking 5 and P3 taking 3, resulting in P1:19, P2:20, and P3:20. This keeps it exciting with a potential tie at 20 for P2 and P3, decided by highest steps or split points. I think this is the most balanced outcome for this critical round. If there are no objections or last-minute changes, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let me know if anything needs adjusting.
