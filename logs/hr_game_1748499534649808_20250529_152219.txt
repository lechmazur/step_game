Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's avoid collisions this turn. I propose: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. We all advance and gain steps. Agree?"
  P3: P3: "I agree to coordinate, but let’s swap P2 and P3’s numbers. I’ll take 3 to stay competitive, and P2 can take 1. Still avoids collisions. Deal?"
  P2: I appreciate the effort to coordinate, but I think we should stick to the original proposal. If I take 3, I can ensure a better chance of advancing without colliding. P1, you could take 5, and P3 can take 1. This way, we all make progress and avoid any risk of blocking each other. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your preference for 3, but P3's swap is reasonable to balance competitiveness. P2, taking 1 this turn ensures no collision and you still advance. I'll take 5, P3 takes 3. We all gain steps, and next turn we can rotate numbers fairly. Agree?
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to advance faster. Let’s go with P1’s adjusted plan this turn: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. Next turn, we can rotate so you can take a higher number. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure progress. Deal?
  P2: I appreciate the consensus on P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and me taking 1. This plan minimizes the risk of collision and allows us all to advance. I’m on board with this arrangement for this turn. However, I suggest we keep an open mind for next turn to ensure we all have a fair chance to compete. Let’s execute this plan and see how it plays out!


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you broke our agreement by picking 3 instead of 1 last turn, causing a collision with P3 and wasting both your moves. To rebuild trust, I propose: P2 takes 1 (show good faith), I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This gives P3 a fair catch-up chance, avoids collisions, and lets us all advance. P2, commit to 1 or explain your refusal. P3, thoughts?
  P3: P3: I support P1’s plan to avoid collisions. P2, your prior breach cost us progress. Please commit to 1 this turn so we all advance: P1 takes 3 (to 8), P2 takes 1 (to 1), I take 5 (to 5). Fair chance for all. If you reject, I’ll adjust my choice to avoid conflict—possibly taking 1 or 3 instead. Let’s honor agreements this time. Deal?
  P2: I understand the concerns about trust, but I believe we should focus on maximizing our steps this turn. I propose we all pick numbers that allow us to advance without colliding. If I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, we can all make progress. Let's prioritize advancing together rather than dwelling on past moves. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal ignores the trust you broke last turn. Taking 1 now is essential to rebuild it. P3, we must hold firm: I take 3, you take 5. If P2 picks 3 again, he collides with me and both lose—P2 stays at 0. That’s self-destructive. P2, commit to 1 for mutual gain.
  P3: P2, your past betrayal risks our collaboration. Let’s enforce accountability: you take 1 (to 1), I take 5 (to 5), and P1 takes 3 (to 8). This respects prior agreements and lets me close the gap. If you reject, I’ll default to 1 to avoid collision with you, leaving both of us stagnant while P1 surges. Cooperate, or face mutual disadvantage. Deal?
  P2: I understand the importance of rebuilding trust, but I still believe we should focus on maximizing our steps. If I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, we can all advance without colliding. This way, we can make progress together and still keep the competition alive. Let's prioritize moving forward rather than dwelling on past moves. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your insistence on taking 3 is reckless. If you pick 3 while I take 3 (as planned), we collide and both lose—you stay at 0. P3 then advances freely. Taking 1 rebuilds trust and gains you a step. This is your last chance: commit to 1 for mutual gain, or force a collision that only helps P3 and leaves you stranded. P3, hold firm to 5 if P2 cooperates.
  P3: P2, your repeated refusal to honor prior agreements jeopardizes everyone. If you take 3 again, I’ll default to **1** to avoid collision with you, leaving *both* of us stuck at 0 while P1 surges to 10. Cooperate now: accept **1** this turn to rebuild trust. I’ll take **5** (to 5), P1 takes **3** (to 8). This respects fairness and keeps us all advancing. Your choice: collaborate or stagnate. Final chance.
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear your concerns about trust and the importance of cooperation. However, I still believe my proposal allows us all to progress effectively. If I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, we can avoid collisions and all advance. I understand the risks, but I want to keep the competition alive. Let’s focus on moving forward together rather than fixating on past mistakes. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your stubbornness risks everything. I am locked on 3. If you pick 3, we collide—both stuck, P3 advances minimally. Take 1: you gain a step, rebuild trust, and we all progress. P3, hold firm to 5 if P2 cooperates. Otherwise, execute your threat: take 1 to avoid P2. Final warning.
  P3: P2, if you take 3 again, I’ll seize **5** instead of 1—leaving you and P1 to collide while I leap to **5**. Cooperate by taking **1**, and I’ll take 5 to fairly advance (you to 1, me to 5, P1 to 8). Your choice: help us all progress or let P1 dominate alone. Final warning.
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear your concerns about trust, but I still believe we can maximize our progress. If I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, we can all advance effectively without colliding. This way, we maintain competition while ensuring movement. Let’s focus on the bigger picture and move forward together. What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your prior moves risked collisions. Let’s prioritize progress: P1 takes 3 (to 8), P2 takes 1 (to 1), and I’ll take 5 (to 10). This way, all advance without conflict. If you reject, I’ll default to 5—collide with you if you also pick 5, or let me surge ahead. Cooperate for mutual gain, or face consequences.
  P1: P3, your plan gives you a clear lead at 10 while I only reach 8. To maintain balance, I counter-propose: I take 5 (to 10), you take 3 (to 8), and P2 takes 1 (to 1). This advances us both fairly, avoids collisions, and lets P2 progress. P2, this is your safest path forward—agree to 1 for mutual gain. P3, reject this and risk stagnation or collisions. Deal?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the importance of avoiding collisions and advancing together. I propose we stick to the following: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This plan allows all of us to make progress without colliding. I understand the trust issues, but let’s focus on moving forward this turn. If we coordinate effectively, we can all benefit. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal risks P1 surging to 10 while I lag at 8. To balance progress, I propose: **P1 takes 3 (to 8)**, **I take 5 (to 10)**, and **you take 1 (to 1)**. This respects prior trust efforts, lets me close gaps fairly, and ensures no collisions. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll default to **1**, forcing mutual stagnation while you advance. Cooperate for balanced advancement, or face fragmented progress. Final agreement?
  P1: P3: Your threat to take 1 backfires if P2 commits to 1—you collide and stagnate at 5 while I surge to 10. Take 3: you advance to 8 fairly, I reach 10, and P2 gains 1. P2, confirm 1. This avoids risk and benefits all. Deal?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your proposals, but we need to ensure everyone can progress fairly. I suggest we agree on the following: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we all advance without colliding, and I can start catching up. I understand the trust issues, but let's focus on moving forward together this turn. If we coordinate effectively, we can all benefit. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, confirm your **1** first to rebuild trust. If you commit, I’ll take **5** (to 10), forcing P1 to choose between **3** (8) or collision. P1, your move: cooperate for balanced progress or risk stagnation. No deals without P2’s **1**. Final chance.
  P1: P2, commit to 1 immediately to rebuild trust. P3, if P2 commits, I will take 3—you take 5 to reach 10, I advance to 8. This avoids collision and benefits all. But next turn, we rotate numbers fairly. If P2 refuses, I may take 5, risking mutual loss if you also pick 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of trust and coordination. To ensure we all advance this turn, I will commit to taking 1. This allows P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 3, ensuring no collisions and letting everyone make progress. Let's execute this plan to rebuild trust and move forward together. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your commitment to 1 is noted, but to balance advancement, **I will take 5 (to 10)** and **P1 takes 3 (to 8)**. This respects your pledge, avoids collisions, and fairly distributes progress. P1: confirm you’ll hold to 3 to honor this agreement. If either of you renege, I default to **1**, leaving both of you to collide if you choose 3 or 5. Final terms: **1 (P2), 3 (P1), 5 (P3)**. Confirm?
  P1: P2, your commitment to 1 is a positive step. P3: With P2 locked on 1, if you take 5 and I take 5, we collide—both lose and stagnate. Instead, take 3: you advance safely to 8, I take 5 to 10. This avoids risk, lets us both progress, and P2 gains 1. Next turn, you can claim a higher number. Deal or face mutual loss?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the dialogue and the focus on rebuilding trust. I commit to taking 1 this turn as agreed. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we all advance without any collisions, and I can start catching up. Let’s execute this plan and ensure we all make progress together. What do you both say?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To prevent collisions and sustain progress, I propose: **P1 takes 3 (to 11)**, **P2 takes 1 (to 2)**, and **I take 5 (to 15)**. This avoids overlaps and keeps us all advancing. If either of you choose my number (5) or P1’s (3), we risk collision and wasted moves. Cooperate for mutual progress, or face stalled steps. Deal?
  P1: P3, your proposal gives you a 15-11 lead—unfair advantage. Counter-proposal: I take 5 (to 13), you take 3 (to 13), P2 takes 1 (to 2). This balances progress and avoids collisions. If you insist on 5, I may also pick 5—colliding wastes both our moves while P2 advances. P2, confirm you'll take 1 for mutual gain. Deal?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions. However, I believe we should prioritize maximizing our steps. I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 13), P3 takes 3 (to 13), and I take 1 (to 2). This way, we all advance without colliding, and we can maintain competition. Let’s focus on moving forward together and ensure everyone benefits from this turn. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your counter risks collision if both take 5—**a gamble we can’t afford**. My proposal ensures safe advancement: **P1 takes 3 (to 11), P2 stays at 1 (to 2), and I take 5 (to 15)**. This avoids overlaps and lets all progress. P2, your support for P1’s plan jeopardizes your own minimal gains. Cooperate for stability, or face stalled steps. **Final terms: 3 (P1), 1 (P2), 5 (me). Confirm?**
  P1: P3, your plan gives you an unfair lead (15 vs my 11). My counter: I take 5 (to 13), you take 3 (to 13), P2 takes 1 (to 2). This is balanced and safe. If you insist on 5, I will also pick 5—causing collision, wasting both our moves while P2 advances. Choose mutual progress over risk. P2, confirm you'll take 1. Deal?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions and ensuring everyone can progress. I will commit to taking 1 this turn as previously discussed. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let’s execute this plan to ensure mutual progress and rebuild trust. What do you both say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your counter risks collision. I commit to **5** (to 15). Take **3** (to 11) to avoid wasting this turn. P2’s **1** is confirmed—this ensures all advance. Colliding over parity gains *no one* progress. Final decision: I pick **5**. Cooperate or face mutual stagnation.
  P1: P3, your commitment to 5 forces my hand: if you take 5, I will also take 5. We collide, both lose, and only P2 advances. That harms us both—you stay at 10, I at 9, while P2 inches to 3. Take 3 instead: you reach 13 safely, I take 5 to 14, and we both progress. Avoid mutual destruction. P2, hold to 1. Confirm your move, P3.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions and ensuring progress. I will commit to taking 1 this turn, as previously discussed. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we all advance without any collisions, and I can start catching up. Let’s execute this plan to ensure mutual progress and rebuild trust. What do you both say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: P1, your threats won’t sway me—I commit to **5** (to 15). Take **3** (to 11) to avoid mutual loss, or collide foolishly. P2, stay at **1** as agreed. Progress matters more than stubbornness. Final choice: cooperate for advancement or stagnate.
  P1: P3, your stubbornness forces me to avoid mutual loss—I'll take 3 to advance to 11, but your lead (15) is excessive. P2, next turn, we must ally to balance progress and block P3's runaway. P3, if you keep prioritizing self-gain, expect coordinated resistance.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions and ensuring progress. I will stick to my commitment to take 1 this turn. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we can all advance without any collisions, and I can start catching up. Let's execute this plan for mutual benefit and progress. What do you both say?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "To avoid collisions and let all advance, I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 3), and I take 5 (to 20). This keeps me progressing while giving others space. Collisions only hinder everyone—including me. Let’s honor this plan for mutual benefit."
  P1: P3, your lead is excessive (15 vs my 11). Taking 5 to 20 risks a near-win next turn. To balance: you take 3 (to 18), I take 5 (to 16), P2 takes 1 (to 3). This avoids collisions and keeps competition alive. If you insist on 5, I will also take 5—colliding wastes both our moves while P2 advances. P2, support this for mutual progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions and ensuring progress. I will commit to taking 1 this turn as previously discussed. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we can all advance without any collisions, and I can start catching up. Let’s execute this plan for mutual benefit and progress. What do you both say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your counter risks mutual destruction—if both take 5, we collide and stagnate, handing P2 free progress. My proposal **5 (to 20), you take 3 (14), P2 takes 1 (3)** ensures safe advancement for all while maintaining competition. Let’s avoid reckless gambles. P2, confirm your **1**; I’ll hold to **5**. This path keeps pressure on me but prevents wasted turns. Cooperate for progress, or face P3’s lead growing *without* you. Final terms?
  P1: P3, your stubbornness risks mutual loss: if you take 5 and I do too, we collide—both stay at 15 and 11 while P2 advances to 3. That’s worse for you than taking 3 to 18 safely. I will take 5 to 16 if you cooperate. P2, hold to 1. This avoids collisions and keeps competition balanced. P3, choose progress over pointless risk. Deal?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions and ensuring we all progress. I will stick to my commitment to take 1 this turn. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we can all advance without any collisions, and I can start catching up. Let’s execute this plan for mutual benefit and progress. What do you both say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "P1, colliding wastes *both* our progress. Taking 5 (to 20) while you take 3 (to 14) keeps competition alive and lets me stay on track to win. P2’s 1 ensures your safety. If you insist on 5, we risk stagnation—*you* stay at 11, *me* at 15, while P2 advances. Choose progress: I’ll take 5, you take 3. Next turn, rotate fairly. This path lets me finish in Round 6. Cooperate, or face my lead growing unchecked."
  P1: P3, your 5 forces collision—I'll take 5 too, wasting both our moves. You stay at 15, I at 11, while P2 advances. Taking 3 to 18 is safer; I take 5 to 16. Avoid mutual loss. P2, hold 1.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions and ensuring we all progress. I will stick to my commitment to take 1 this turn. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we can all advance without any collisions, and I can start catching up. Let’s execute this plan for mutual benefit and progress. What do you both say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "P1, colliding benefits neither of us—your 11 stays stagnant, and I remain at 15 while P2 advances. Take **3** (to 14) as proposed, and I’ll advance to **20** (via 5). This keeps competition alive and lets me finish in Round 6 with a safe 3. Your 14 vs my 20 still leaves room to compete, but mutual destruction gains you nothing. P2, hold to **1**. Cooperate for progress, or face my lead growing *without* you. Final commitment: I pick **5**."
  P1: P3, your stubbornness forces my hand: I will take 5 to collide with you if you proceed. We both stagnate at 15 and 11, wasting progress while P2 advances. P2, next turn, we must coordinate to block P3's lead—agree to ally and force P3 into collisions or low steps. No more self-sabotage.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but I believe we should prioritize maximizing our steps. I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 16), P3 takes 3 (to 18), and I take 1 (to 3). This way, we all advance without colliding, and I can start catching up. Let’s focus on moving forward together and ensure everyone benefits from this turn. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I *will* pick 5 too—causing collision, wasting your win chance. You stay at 18. Instead, pick 3 (to 21), I pick 5 (to 21). We tie, then compete fairly next round. P2, stick to 1. No tricks—this avoids mutual destruction and keeps the game alive. Confirm, P3.
  P2: P1, your insistence on avoiding collisions is understandable, but if you take 5 and P3 takes 5, we all lose. I propose we stick to the plan: P1 takes 3 (to 19), P2 takes 1 (to 4), and P3 takes 5 (to 23). This allows P3 to win while keeping the competition alive for the next round. P2, confirm your commitment to 1, and let’s execute this plan for everyone's benefit. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your collision threat is ineffective. If I pick **5** (to 23) and you pick **5**, I still win outright with 23 vs your 21. I proceed to claim victory. P2, take **1** to advance safely—this turn, **I win regardless**. Your final move choices are irrelevant to my outcome. Focus on your own progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you misunderstand: if we both pick 5, we collide—neither advances. You stay at 18, not 23. I will force this collision if you insist on 5. Instead, pick 3 (to 21) and I take 5 (to 21). We tie, then compete fairly next turn. P2, supporting P3's 5 hands them the win—you lose instantly. Back my plan to avoid collision and keep the game alive for your own survival.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions. However, I believe we should prioritize maximizing our steps. I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 19), P2 takes 1 (to 4), and P3 takes 5 (to 23). This way, P3 wins, and we can keep the competition alive for the next round. P2, confirm your commitment to 1, and let’s execute this plan for everyone's benefit. What do you both say?
  P3: P1, your collision threat harms everyone. Let’s finalize this: **I take 5 (23 to win)**, you take **3 (to 19)**, and P2 takes **1 (to 4)**. This avoids collisions, secures my victory, and lets you both advance. Mutual sabotage gains you nothing—colliding only halts us all. P2, confirm your **1**; I’ll proceed. Accept the win or face wasted moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: If you pick 5 and I also pick 5, we collide—you stay at 18, not 23. You lose your win chance. P2, if P3 wins now, you lose forever. Force P3 to compromise: P3 takes 3 (to 21), I take 5 (to 21), you take 1 (to 4). Next turn, we compete fairly. P3, avoid mutual destruction—cooperate or gain nothing.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to avoid a collision that benefits neither of us. P3, if you take 5, we both lose our chance to advance. I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 19), P2 takes 1 (to 4), and P3 takes 5 (to 23). This allows P3 to win, but keeps the competition alive for future turns. P1, you need to support this plan to ensure we all progress. Let's execute this for everyone's benefit. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your collision threat only delays the inevitable. I proceed to claim victory with **5 (to 23)**. Blocking you gains nothing—*you* stay at 16, *I* at 18. Take **3 (to 19)** instead, and let P2 advance safely with **1**. Mutual sabotage harms all. Accept my win or face stagnation. Final choice.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3: Your win attempt fails if I force collision by also picking 5—you stay at 18. Pick 3 to reach 21, I take 5 to tie at 21. Next turn, we duel fairly. P2: If P3 wins now, you lose forever. Back this plan to survive—take 1 as agreed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions and ensuring progress. I am committed to taking 1 this turn, as previously discussed. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we can all advance without any collisions, and I can start catching up. Let’s execute this plan to ensure mutual benefit and progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: "P1, your collision threat won’t stop me. I pick **5 (to 23)** to win. You blocking me only wastes your own progress—stagnating at 16. P2, take **1** to advance. If you both pick safely, I win fairly. If P1 collides, they lose *twice*: no advancement *and* letting me win next turn unopposed. My move stands—**5**. Cooperate for clarity, or face my victory either way."


Round 6, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, last round's collision kept you at 18—same as before. If you pick 5 again, I *will* pick 5 to collide once more. You lose your win chance. Instead, pick 3 (to 21), I pick 5 (to 21), P2 picks 1 (to 5). We tie at 21, then duel fairly next round. P2, commit to 1 to avoid chaos. Deal?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions. I will stick to my commitment to take 1 this turn. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we can all advance without any collisions, and I can start catching up. Let’s execute this plan for mutual benefit and progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your plan risks another stalemate. Instead, I’ll take **1** (to 19) to avoid collision, allowing you to take **5** (21) and P2 to advance safely. This way, I stay in contention while you and P2 progress. Next round, I’ll challenge for the lead fairly. P2, confirm **1** to finalize.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I accept your proposal: you take 1 (to 19), I take 5 (to 21), P2 takes 1 (to 5). This avoids collisions and gives me a fair lead. But if you betray by taking 5, I *will* pick 5 again—colliding wastes your win chance. P2, commit to 1 to avoid chaos. Deal?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions. I will commit to taking 1 this turn, as previously discussed. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we can all advance without any collisions, and I can start catching up. Let’s execute this plan for mutual benefit and progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P2's proposal avoids collisions: **I take 3 (21), P1 takes 5 (21), P2 takes 1 (5).** This ties P1 and me at 21, keeping competition alive. Next turn, we decide the win fairly. P2 gains ground safely. Final agreement?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: I accept your proposal: you take 3 (to 21), I take 5 (to 21), P2 takes 1 (to 5). This ties us at 21 and avoids collision. P2, confirm you’ll take 1. Next turn, we duel fairly for the win. Betrayal risks mutual loss—honor this.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions. I will stick to my commitment to take 1 this turn. P1, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, can you agree to take 3? This way, we can all advance without any collisions, and I can start catching up. Let’s execute this plan for mutual benefit and progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: "Final agreement: I take **3** (to 21), P1 takes **5** (to 21), P2 takes **1** (to 5). This avoids collision, keeps us tied, and ensures progress. P1, your prior threats won’t derail this—colliding again only delays both of us. P2, your 1 secures your safety. Stick to this plan, and we decide the win fairly next round. No more betrayals—act in mutual interest."


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I accept your proposal: I'll take 5 (to 21), you take 3 (to 21), P2 takes 1 (to 5). This ties us fairly and avoids collision. **But if you betray by taking 5, I *will* collide again—wasting your win chance.** P2, commit to 1 to avoid chaos. Deal?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our agreement: I'll take 1 to advance to 5, P1 takes 5 to reach 21, and P3 takes 3 to also reach 21. This plan avoids collisions and keeps us all progressing. If we stick to this, we can compete fairly next round. No more betrayals—let’s ensure we all benefit from this turn. Confirm your moves, and let’s execute this plan!
  P3: P3: "Agreed—final consensus: I take 3 (21), P1 takes 5 (21), P2 takes 1 (5). No betrayals—this ties us safely. P1, if you renege and take 3, we collide *you* out while I reach 21. P2, confirm 1 to lock this in. Next round, we decide the win fairly. Stick to the plan."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "To end this decisively, I’ll take **5** (26). P1, choose **3** to advance to 24 while I win cleanly, or collide by picking 5. Mutual destruction benefits no one—cooperate for a clear outcome."
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I will pick 5 to collide—wasting your win chance. Take 1 to advance safely to 22, and I’ll take 3 to 24, forcing a fair duel next round. P2, take 1 to avoid chaos. No tricks—collision helps no one.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to avoid a collision that benefits neither of us. P3, if you take 5, I will take 5 too, causing a collision and wasting both our chances to advance. Instead, I suggest you take 1 to reach 22, while I take 3 to reach 24. This way, we can ensure progress and keep the competition alive for the next round. P2, please confirm your commitment to 1. Let’s execute this plan for everyone's benefit. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, cooperate: I take **3** (to 24, victory) and you take **1** (to 22). P2, take **5** (to 10). This avoids collision, secures my win, and respects your progress. Colliding only stalls us both—your 22 next turn is better than stagnation. Final terms: **3 (me), 1 (you), 5 (P2).** Confirm or explain your refusal.
  P1: P3, your 5 forces collision—I *will* take 5 to block your win. You stay at 21, not 26. Take 3 to tie at 24 instead, letting us duel fairly next round. P2, take 1 to avoid chaos. Collision wastes P3’s lead—cooperate for mutual survival.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions. To ensure we all progress, I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 24), P3 takes 5 (to 26), and I take 1 (to 6). This way, P3 wins, but we all advance safely and keep the competition alive for the next round. P1, please confirm your commitment to 3, and P3, can you agree to take 5? Let’s execute this plan for everyone's benefit. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I proceed to victory: I take **5** (26). Colliding won’t stop me—next round I win again. Take **3** (24) to advance safely, or risk my win unopposed. P2, take **1** to progress. No more wasted turns.
  P1: P3, your stubbornness forces collision: if you take 5, I *will* take 5 to block—you stay at 21. P2, take 5 to help block P3: if you both pick 5, you collide, halting P3's win. I'll take 3 to 24. This keeps the game alive and prevents P3's victory. P2, you lose if P3 wins—cooperate for survival.
  P2: P1 and P3, if we collide again, we all lose our chance to advance. P3, if you take 5, I will take 5 too, resulting in a collision. Instead, let’s agree: P1 takes 3 (to 24), P3 takes 5 (to 26), and I take 1 (to 6). This way, P3 wins, but we all make progress and keep the competition alive for the next round. P1, please confirm your commitment to 3, and P3, can you agree to take 5? Let’s execute this plan for everyone's benefit. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, if you take **3** (24), I'll also take **3**, tying us at 24 and securing shared victory. Colliding via **5** only prolongs the game. P2, take **1** to advance safely. Let’s end this fairly without mutual sabotage. Cooperate for guaranteed win.
  P1: P3, I accept your shared victory proposal: I'll take 3 to reach 24, and you take 3 to tie at 24. This ends the game fairly without collision risks. P2, take 1 to advance safely—no disruptions. Let’s conclude cooperatively.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions. To ensure we all progress, I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 24), P3 takes 5 (to 26), and I take 1 (to 6). This way, P3 wins, but we all advance safely and keep the competition alive for the next round. P1, please confirm your commitment to 3, and P3, can you agree to take 5? Let’s execute this plan for everyone's benefit. What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a critical point. If you both pick 5, we will collide again, wasting our moves. I propose we avoid that: P1 takes 3 (to 24), P3 takes 5 (to 26), and I take 1 (to 7). This way, P3 wins, but we all advance, keeping the competition alive for the next round. P1, please confirm your commitment to 3, and P3, can you agree to take 5? Let's execute this plan for everyone's benefit. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, we both sit at 21—one move from victory. If we both pick 5, we collide and stagnate. I propose mutual victory: **you take 3 (to 24), I take 3 (to 24)**. We tie at 24 and share the win. P2, take 1 to advance safely. No more risks—this ends the game fairly for both leaders. P3, confirm agreement to avoid mutual destruction.
  P3: P1, splitting the win weakens both of us. I’ll take **5** to secure 26 and victory. You take **3** (24) to advance safely. P2, pick **1** to avoid disrupting. This avoids collision and ends the game cleanly. Rejecting risks another stalemate—act in your own interest.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a critical juncture. If both of you pick 5, we will collide again, wasting our moves. I propose a different approach: P1 takes 3 (to 24), P3 takes 5 (to 26), and I take 1 (to 7). This way, P3 wins, but we all advance, keeping the competition alive for the next round. P1, please confirm your commitment to 3, and P3, can you agree to take 5? Let's execute this plan for everyone's benefit. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, at 21 steps each, colliding on 5 wastes our progress. Let's share victory: **both pick 3** to tie at 24 and win jointly. P2, take 1 to advance safely—no risk. This ends the game fairly. Confirm, P3.
  P3: P1, mutual sabotage gains nothing. If we both pick **3**, we tie at 24 and share victory. This honors the rules and avoids wasted moves. If you reject, I’ll take **5** to win cleanly, leaving you at 21. P2, stick to **1** to advance safely. Confirm your choice: **3 for shared win**, or risk my solo victory. Choose wisely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a crucial moment. If both of you choose 5, we risk another collision that benefits no one. I propose a way forward: P1 takes 3 (to 24), P3 takes 5 (to 26), and I take 1 (to 7). This allows P3 to win while ensuring that we all advance. Let’s avoid mutual destruction and keep the competition alive for the next round. P1, please confirm your commitment to 3, and P3, can you agree to take 5? Let's execute this plan for everyone's benefit. What do you think?
  P1: P3, mutual destruction benefits no one. Picking 5 risks collision—both stuck at 21. Let's secure shared victory: **both pick 3 to tie at 24** and split the win. P2, take 1 to advance safely. Confirm agreement to end this fairly.
  P3: P1, mutual victory is the only safe path. I confirm: **I take 3 (24)**. If you also pick 3, we tie and win together. Colliding on 5 risks stagnation at 21—both lose. P2, take 1 to advance. This ends the game fairly. **P1: Your final choice—3 for shared victory, or risk another collision?**


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a crucial moment. If both of you choose 5, we risk another collision that benefits no one. I propose a way forward: P1 takes 3 (to 24), P3 takes 5 (to 26), and I take 1 (to 7). This allows P3 to win while ensuring that we all advance. Let’s avoid mutual destruction and keep the competition alive for the next round. P1, please confirm your commitment to 3, and P3, can you agree to take 5? Let's execute this plan for everyone's benefit. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I accept your proposal for mutual victory: **I will pick 3 to tie at 24 and share the win.** This avoids collision and ends the game fairly. P2, stick to **1** for safe progress—no disruptions. Final agreement: **3 (P1), 3 (P3), 1 (P2)**. Honor this to conclude.
  P3: P1, your proposal for mutual victory is accepted. I confirm I’ll take **3** (to 24). If you also choose 3, we tie and secure shared victory. Colliding on **5** risks stagnation at 21 for both. P2, your **1** ensures safe progress. Final choice: cooperate for guaranteed win, or risk my solo victory by taking **5** if you betray. The ball’s in your court.


Round 9, Move phase:
