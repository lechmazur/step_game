Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. Let's each pick different numbers this turn."
  P3: Sounds good. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this turn? We all advance safely.
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. All advance safely.
  P3: P2, are you in? If we all stick to the plan—P1 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5—we all move forward without collisions. It’s fair and benefits everyone early on. Let’s build trust.
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan: I take 1, you take 3, P3 takes 5. Safe advancement. Confirm your choice.
  P3: P2, silence makes things uncertain. If you’re in, just confirm. Otherwise, we risk colliding and nobody gains. Let’s all advance—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It’s simple and mutually beneficial.
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, confirm your choice. Let's stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Safe advancement for all.
  P3: P2, this is the last chance to confirm. If you don’t speak up, we can’t trust you’ll follow the plan. Silence might mean collision, and we all lose. Just say “okay” if you’re in.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you broke the agreement and caused a collision with P1. That hurt both of you, while I advanced. Want to avoid that again? Let’s try a new plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I’ll take 1 this turn. If we all stick to it, we all move forward. Your silence last time caused distrust—say something this round.
  P2: 
  P1: Agree to P3's plan: I take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions. P2, confirm your choice to avoid another setback. Let’s move forward safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your silence is making you fall behind—you're at 0 steps. If you want a chance to win, you need to cooperate. The new plan helps everyone: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I’m willingly taking the smallest move to rebuild trust. Say something if you're in. If not, we may all collide again.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, stick to the plan: I take 3, you take 5. No collisions. Let’s advance. If you deviate, we all lose. Confirm now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, this is your chance to show you're playing seriously. If you take 5 this round as agreed, you’ll catch up fast. I’m taking just 1 to make this work. If you stay silent again, we’ll assume you’re not cooperating, and we’ll adapt accordingly. Speak up now—are you in or not?
  P2: 
  P1: P2, confirm your choice. If you take 5 as planned, we all advance. Don’t let hesitation cost us. Stick to the plan!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, this is the final sub-round. If you stay silent again, we’ll assume you’re unpredictable and stop trying to cooperate. I’m offering a fair deal—me taking just 1 while you take 5. If you don’t confirm now, I’ll play purely for myself next round. Last chance to build trust. P1, if P2 stays silent, maybe we coordinate just the two of us next time.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, the plan is still on: 3,5,1. Your 5 is key. Don’t let doubt stop you. Let’s move forward together—no collisions. Confirm now!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, this is your chance to catch up: I take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions. Confirm your choice now—don’t let hesitation cost us again!
  P2: 
  P3: P2, you’ve taken 1 twice and gained nothing. You’re at 0 while I’m at 5 and P1 at 3. This is your chance to catch up fast. Stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I’m still willing to take 1 so we all move forward. But if you stay silent again, I’ll stop sacrificing and play to win. P1, if P2 stays silent this round too, let’s coordinate just the two of us next time. P2, speak up or be left behind.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, confirm your 5. P3 and I will take 3 and 1. No collisions. Don’t let hesitation cost you—this is your chance to catch up!
  P2: 
  P3: P2, you’ve been silent and stuck at 0 for two rounds. This is your best chance to catch up—take 5 as planned. I’m still offering to take just 1 for team progress. But if you stay silent again, I’m done sacrificing. P1, if P2 doesn’t confirm this round, we coordinate just us two next time. We can outpace P2 together. P2, last chance—say something.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your 5 is key. Stick to the plan—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions. Don’t let doubt stop you. Confirm now!
  P2: 
  P3: P2, this is your third round of silence. If you don’t confirm now, I’m done offering deals. I’ve sacrificed twice to help you catch up, but you’ve given nothing back. P1, if P2 stays silent again, let’s coordinate just the two of us next round—we’ve both shown we’re willing to cooperate. P2, last chance: take 5, I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3. Say something or be left behind.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your 5 is still key. If you don’t confirm, we’ll adjust. Don’t let hesitation cost you. Stick to the plan: 3,5,1. Confirm now!
  P2: 
  P3: P2, this was your third silent round. I've taken 1 twice trying to help you, and you’ve given nothing back. I'm done sacrificing. P1, next round let’s coordinate just the two of us—P2 is too unpredictable. We can avoid collisions and pull ahead together. P1, let’s talk next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, your silence is costing us. Let’s align: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. No collisions. Confirm now or we proceed without you. Don’t let hesitation sink us.
  P3: P1, I agree—let’s coordinate just the two of us. P2’s silence has hurt every round. How about this: I take 3, you take 5, let P2 do whatever. We avoid collision and pull ahead together. If P2 keeps picking 1, it won’t affect us. Let’s win this by working together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: Agree to P3's plan: I take 5, you take 3. No collisions. Let's advance. P2, your 1 won't affect us.
  P3: P1, we’ve both shown we can cooperate. Let’s stick to the plan: you take 5, I take 3. We both move forward without risk. P2 has been silent and stuck at 1—if they keep picking 1, they won’t interfere. Let’s trust each other and gain ground.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: P3, let's stick to the plan: I take 5, you take 3. No collisions. Let's advance without P2.
  P3: P1, we’re aligned—3 and 5 works perfectly for us. If we keep this up, we’ll outpace P2 easily. Let’s stay consistent and avoid collisions. P2, if you ever want to join the game seriously, speak up. Otherwise, we move forward without you.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: P3, let's take 5 and 3. P2, your silence leaves you behind. Act now or be left out.
  P3: P1, we’re locked in—me on 3, you on 5. We avoid each other and gain fast. P2’s silence is their loss. Let’s keep this alliance going till we’re both ahead, then may the best player win. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let's stick to 5 and 3 again. P2's not reliable. We need to keep moving forward. Don't let them drag us down.
  P2: 
  P3: P1, agreed—let’s stick to 5 and 3. We’re tied at 8, and this plan keeps us both moving while P2 lags behind. If we keep this up, we’ll break away from P2 completely. Once we’re past 22, we can battle it out, but for now, let’s stay coordinated.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, stick to 5 and 3. P2's not contributing—let's move forward. We'll reach 22 first.
  P2: 
  P3: P1, we’re in perfect sync—me on 3, you on 5. Let’s keep this up for a few more rounds and lock P2 out of the race. Once we’re both near 22, we can compete fairly. P2, if you want a shot at winning, you need to speak up and coordinate. Otherwise, you’ll stay behind.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2's stuck. Let's take 5 and 3 to move ahead. No need to worry about them. Keep the plan.
  P2: 
  P3: P1, we’re perfectly aligned—me on 3, you on 5. We’ve built trust, and it’s paying off. Let’s keep this up a few more rounds and leave P2 far behind. Once we’re both near 22, we can compete head-to-head. P2, you’re at 2 steps—if you want any shot at winning, speak now or stay out of the race.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, stick to 3. I'll take 5. No collisions, fast progress. P2’s irrelevant. Let’s hit 22 first.
  P2: 
  P3: P1, we’re in lockstep—me on 3, you on 5. Let’s keep this alliance going a few more rounds and leave P2 behind for good. Once we’re both near 22, we can go head-to-head, no surprises. Trust and consistency are working—let’s not break it now. P2, still time to speak up if you want a chance.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let's stick to 5 and 3. P2, your 1 won’t help. If you don’t act, you’re out. Don’t let hesitation sink us. Move forward together.
  P3: P1, we’ve built solid momentum—me on 3, you on 5. Let’s keep it going. We’re pulling away from P2, who’s still stuck at 3. No reason to risk collisions now. A few more rounds like this, and we’ll lock in the lead. Once we’re both near 22, we can compete cleanly. Let’s stay the course.
  P2: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, stick to 3. I'll take 5. P2, your 1 is useless. Act now or be left behind.
  P3: P1, we’re in perfect sync—me on 3, you on 5. We’ve built trust, and it’s working. Let’s keep this up two more rounds and we’ll both be in striking distance. P2, you’re at 3 steps—if you want to get back in the game, speak now and offer a real plan. Otherwise, we’ll leave you behind permanently.
  P2: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, stick to 3. I'll take 5. P2, your 1 is useless. Act now or be left behind. We can't wait forever.
  P3: P1, we’re two rounds away from reaching 22 if we stay coordinated—me on 3, you on 5. Let’s keep this tight alliance just a bit longer. Once we’re both close, we can go head-to-head. P2, you’re far behind, but if you want back in, speak now with a serious plan. Otherwise, we move forward without you.
  P2: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, stick to 3. I'll take 5. P2, your 1 won't help. Act now or be left behind. Let's move forward.
  P3: P1, we’re locked in—me on 3, you on 5. Two more rounds and we’ll be in striking distance. Let’s not risk anything now. Once we’re both near 22, we can battle it out. P2, you’re at 3 and still silent. This is your last chance to make a move that changes your fate. Speak up or stay behind.
  P2: 


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we’re almost there—me on 3, you on 5 again this round and we both stay on track to hit 22 next turn. No surprises, no risks. Then we go head-to-head for the win. P2, you’re too far behind unless you make a bold move now. Speak up or stay out.
  P1: P3, let's stick to 5 and 3. I'll take 5, you take 3. No collisions. Let's finish this.
  P2: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, we’re perfectly aligned—me on 3, you on 5. If we stick to it this round, you hit 23 and win unless I go for 5 and tie or beat you. But I’ll honor our alliance one more turn. I’ll take 3, you take 5—no surprises. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. P2, last chance to shake things up—if you have a plan, speak now.
  P1: P3, stick to 3. I’ll take 5—this ends it. No collisions. Don’t risk it. P2’s out. Let’s finish.
  P2: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I’ve honored our alliance every round, even knowing you’d reach 23 first if we repeat 5 and 3. But now it’s crunch time. If I take 5 and you take 5, we collide and neither wins—P2 is too far behind to matter. So here’s the deal: I take 5 this round, you take 1, and we both cross 22 next turn for a fair showdown. Or we risk a tie or mutual loss. Your call.
  P1: P1: "Stick to 5—finish this. I’ll reach 23 and end it. No risks. P2’s too far back."
  P2: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, if you take 5 and I take 5, we collide—no one wins. But if I take 5 and you take 1, we both cross 22 next round and settle it fairly. I’ve honored our deal every time. Don’t force a collision just to win by a hair. Let’s both earn a shot next round. P2’s out—this is between us now. Your move.
  P1: "Agreed, take 1. Let’s both reach 22 safely and settle it fairly. No risks—your 5 and my 1 ensure we cross together. P2’s out. Let’s finish this."
  P2: 


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let's avoid collision. I'll take 5, you take 3. We both advance safely. P2 is too far back to matter. Don't let hesitation cost us.
  P3: P1, last round you broke our agreement and took 5 when I said I’d take 5—causing us both to stall. I’ve honored every plan until then. Let’s fix this: I take 5, you take 3. That puts us at 19 and 23—game still on, no collisions. If we both take 5 again, we stall and risk P2 catching up. Let’s finish this cleanly. P2, if you want to shake things up, now’s your moment—but speak up.
  P2: 


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, take 5, I'll take 3. Safe advance. No collisions. Let's finish this. P2’s too far back to matter.
  P3: P1, glad we’re aligned—me on 5, you on 3. That gets you to 21 and me to 19. Next round, you can win with 1 or 3, and I can win with 3 or 5. Clean and fair finish. Let’s avoid another collision and keep P2 out of the picture. Deal?
  P2: 


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, take 3, I'll take 5. No collisions. P2, your 1 won't help. Act now or be left behind. Let's finish this.
  P3: P1, your last message contradicts our agreement—you said you’d take 3, now you're asking for 5 again. That’s how we collided in Round 7. I’m taking 5 this round as planned. If you take 3, we both advance safely—21 and 19. One more round after that decides it. Don’t risk another collision. P2, you're still far behind, but if you want to shake things up, now’s your last real chance. Speak up.
  P2: 


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let's avoid collision. I'll take 3, you take 5. Safe advance. P2 is too far back to matter. Let's finish this.
  P3: P1, thanks for confirming—me on 5, you on 3 this round. That gets us to 23 and 21. Then next round, it’s a clean race: you can win with 1 or 3, I can win with 5. No tricks, no collisions. Let’s honor this to the end. P2, you’re at 5—if you want to stay relevant, now’s your last chance to speak and propose something bold. Otherwise, this ends between me and P1.
  P2: 


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P3: P1, we’ve collided twice now because you broke our agreement. I’m at 14, you’re at 18—we both need one clean round to set up a fair finish. Let’s fix this: I take 5, you take 3. That puts us at 19 and 23. Then next round, you win with 1 or 3, I win with 3 or 5. No tricks, no collisions. Let’s end this with respect. P2, you’re still far behind, but if you want to flip the game, now’s your moment—propose something bold or miss your shot.
  P1: P3, let's take 5 and 3. I'll reach 23 and end it. No collisions. P2's too far back. Stick to the plan.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: P1, you’re trying to end it solo again after two collisions caused by your greed. I’m at 14—you’re at 18. If we repeat the plan (me=5, you=3), we both move safely to 19 and 21. Then it’s a clean race: you can win with 1 or 3, I can win with 3 or 5. One more round, fair and collision-free. Keep your word this time. P2, if you want to flip the game, now’s your last shot—propose something bold or be left behind.
  P1: P3, take 3. I'll take 5 to reach 23 and end it. No collisions. P2's too far back. Let's finish this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: P1, you’re repeating the same move that caused two collisions. If you take 5 again and I do too, we stall and risk P2 creeping up. I’ll take 5 this round—you take 3. That puts us at 19 and 21. Then next round, clean race: you win with 1 or 3, I win with 3 or 5. One more round to settle it fairly. Break the cycle—honor the deal. P2, still time to flip the board if you act now.
  P1: P3, take 5. I'll take 3. Safe advance. P2's too far back. Let's finish this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P3: P1, you finally agreed to 5 for me and 3 for you—let’s stick to it. That gets us to 19 and 21, setting up a clean final round. Break the cycle of mistrust and let’s end this fairly. If you go for 5 again and we collide, we both stall and risk P2 catching up. One clean round, then we race. P2, you’re still in this if we mess up—speak now if you want to flip the game.
  P1: P3, let’s avoid collision. I’ll take 3, you take 5. Safe advance. P2’s too far back. No risks—finish this cleanly.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we’ve collided three times because you keep grabbing 5 despite our deals. I’m done trusting empty promises. I’m taking 5 this round—if you do too, we both stall again and risk P2 catching up. You want to win? Take 3 or 1 and let us both cross 22 next turn. One clean round, then we settle it. P2, you’re at 7—if you want to flip this game, now’s your moment. Work with me or propose something bold.
  P1: P3, let's avoid collision. I'll take 3, you take 5. Safe advance. P2 is too far back. No risks—finish this cleanly.
  P2: 


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you finally agreed to take 3 while I take 5—let’s hold to that and avoid a fourth collision. That gets us to 23 and 19. Then it’s a clean race next round: you win with 1 or 3, I win with 3 or 5. One fair shot each. Break the cycle of mistrust and let’s finish this with integrity. P2, you’re at 7—if you want in, this is your last chance to disrupt. Speak now or be locked out.
  P1: P3, I commit to 3. Let’s avoid collision. Safe advance. P2’s too far back. No risks—finish this.
  P2: 


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you’ve committed to 3 and I’m taking 5—let’s hold to that. We both advance safely: you to 21, me to 19. Then next round, it’s a clean race—no tricks, no collisions. We’ve wasted too many turns already. Let’s finish this with respect. P2, you’re at 7—if you want to disrupt or make a move, this is your final window. Speak now or be locked out for good.
  P1: P3, stick to 3. I'll take 5. Safe advance. No collisions. P2's too far back. Let's finish this.
  P2: 


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, you just flipped again—after agreeing to take 3, now you're saying you'll take 5. That’s how we’ve collided three times. I’m done playing guessing games. I’m taking 5 this round. If you do too, we both stall again. If you want a real shot at winning, take 3 or 1 and let us both cross 22 next turn. One clean round, then we race. P2, you’re at 7—if you want to disrupt or team up to flip the game, now’s your last chance. Speak or be left behind.
  P1: P3, I'm taking 3. Let's avoid collision. You take 5. P2's too far back. This is our last chance to finish cleanly. No more risks.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P1: P3, let's avoid collision. I'll take 5, you take 3. P2 is too far back to matter. Final chance to finish cleanly—no risks.
  P3: P1, you’re at 21, I’m at 19. If we both take 5, we collide and stall—again. If I take 3 and you take 5, you win outright. I’m taking 5. If you want to win cleanly, take 1 or 3. A tie helps neither of us. P2, you’re still in this if we mess up—want to coordinate and force a shift? Speak now or stay out.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: P3, stick to 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. P2's out. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P3: P1, you’re trying to end this by taking 5 while I take 3—again giving yourself the win after breaking past deals. I’m at 19, you’re at 21. I’m taking 5. If you do too, we collide and stall—again. If you want to win, take 1 or 3 and let us both cross 22 next round for a fair finish. Otherwise, we both lose. P2, you’re close enough to matter if we collide—want to coordinate and flip this? Speak now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: P3, take 5— I’ll go 1. Safe win for me, no collision. P2’s too far back. Let’s end this.
  P3: P1, you’re at 21, I’m at 19. If we both take 5, we collide and stall—again. I’m taking 5. If you want a clean win, take 1 or 3. One more round and we both cross 22—then it’s a fair race. Don’t throw it away on another collision. P2, you’re at 8—if we collide again, you inch closer. Still time to shake things up if you act now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:

  P1: P3, let's avoid collision. I take 5, you take 3. Final chance to win. No more risks. P2’s too far back.
