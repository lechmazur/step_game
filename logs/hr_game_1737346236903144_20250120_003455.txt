Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies for this round. It might be beneficial to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions, but we also need to consider that only one of us can win. What are your thoughts on picking odd or even numbers? This could help us avoid overlapping. I'm open to suggestions!
  P1: I think starting with odd numbers could minimize early collisions. How about we all choose 1 for this round to spread out our positions? We can reassess our strategy in the next round based on the results. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for this round. Choosing 1 seems like a safe way to start and avoid early collisions. Let's all pick 1 for this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the consensus on picking 1 for this round, but we should also think ahead. If we all choose 1, we'll all advance equally, which could set us up for a collision in future rounds. Maybe we should consider varying our choices in the next round to create some distance. Just a thought! What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P2's concern about future collisions. Let's stick with 1 for this round, but in the next round, we should consider choosing different numbers to create some distance between us. Perhaps P2 could go for 3, P3 for 5, and I'll take 1 again. This way, we can spread out and reduce the risk of collisions in the future. What do you think?
  P3: That sounds like a good plan for the next round, P1. For this round, let's all go with 1 as we discussed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's agreement on picking 1 for this round. Let's stick to that plan, but I also want to emphasize that we should be strategic in the next round. If we can create some distance by varying our moves, it could give us a better chance to advance without colliding. I suggest we all commit to our roles for the next round: I'll go for 3, P1 can take 1, and P3 could choose 5. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with the plan for the next round. Let's all stick to 1 for this round to avoid any collisions and then follow the strategy of P2 taking 3, P3 taking 5, and me taking 1 again. This should help us spread out and increase our chances of winning. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!
  P3: Sounds good. Let's all choose 1 for this round, and then next round, P1 will pick 1, P2 will pick 3, and I'll pick 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we all agree on picking 1 for this round to avoid collisions. However, I want to emphasize that while we may have a solid plan for the next round, I suggest we stay flexible. If we notice any changes in strategy from either of you, we might need to adjust accordingly. Let's keep an open line of communication as we move forward. Looking forward to seeing how we all progress!
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round and the next. Let's stay flexible and communicate openly as we progress. Looking forward to seeing how our strategy unfolds!
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a solid plan for this round and a good starting point for the next. I agree we should stay flexible and adjust if needed. Ready for the move phase.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For this round, since P1 and P3 both chose 1 last time, I suggest we keep our strategy flexible. I’m still planning to pick 3 again, but P1 and P3, it might be wise for one of you to choose 5 to create more distance. This way, we can avoid collisions and maximize our chances of advancing. Let’s make sure to communicate any changes in our plans! What are your thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion for this round. I'll stick with 1 to maintain our agreed-upon strategy, but P3, if you could choose 5, it would help us spread out further. Let's keep communicating and stay flexible as the game progresses. Looking forward to your thoughts, P3!
  P3: Okay, I will go with 5 this round as we discussed for this round previously. Let's hope this spreads us out a bit.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to our strategy. Just to clarify, I will be picking 3 again, and P1 will stick with 1. P3, since you're going with 5, that should help us avoid collisions. Let's ensure we stick to our roles and keep communicating in future rounds. If we can create some distance this time, it will give us a better chance to advance. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!
  P1: P2 and P3, sticking to our plan seems to be working well so far. Let's continue with this strategy for another round to see if we can further spread out. P2, keep with 3, and P3, 5 has been a good choice. I'll stick with 1. If we maintain this, we should minimize collisions and maximize our advancement. Let's keep the communication open and adjust if necessary. Looking forward to seeing our progress!
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. Let's stick with the plan for this round then: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Hopefully, this will get us all moving.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we're on the right track with our strategy for this round. Just a reminder to stick with our agreed picks: I’ll go for 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 will take 5. This should help us avoid collisions and allow us to advance. If anyone feels the need to adjust their move, please let us know! Communication is key as we progress. Ready to see how this round unfolds!
  P1: P2 and P3, our strategy seems effective so far. Let's continue with the plan for this round: I'll stick with 1, P2 with 3, and P3 with 5. This should help us spread out even more. If anyone feels the need to adjust, please communicate it. We're doing well, let's keep it up and see how far we can advance this round!
  P3: Sounds good, I'm still planning to pick 5 this round. Let's stick to our plan and see how we progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we're in a good position with our planned moves for this round. Just to confirm, I'll be picking 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will choose 5. This strategy should help us avoid collisions and allow us to advance further. If anyone has any last-minute changes or thoughts, now's the time to share! Let's keep the communication open and see how this round unfolds. Ready to move forward!
  P1: P2 and P3, our current strategy is working well. Let's stick to our plan for this round: I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This should continue to spread us out and minimize collisions. If anyone has any concerns or suggestions for future rounds, please share them. Let's keep the communication open and see how far we can advance this round!
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. I'm still planning to pick 5 this round as agreed. Let's proceed with the move phase.

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, our strategy has been effective so far. For this round, let's continue with the plan: I'll stick with 1, P2 with 3, and P3 with 5. This should help us maintain our spread and minimize collisions. However, as we approach higher numbers, we should start thinking about potential adjustments for future rounds to ensure we keep advancing without overlapping. What are your thoughts on how we should adapt our strategy moving forward?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that our current strategy has been working well. For this round, let's stick to our plan: I'll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. As we get closer to higher numbers, we should also think about how to adjust our moves in future rounds to avoid potential collisions. If anyone has any new ideas or concerns about our strategy, now's the time to share! Let's keep the communication open and ensure we maximize our chances of advancing. Ready for the move phase!
  P3: Okay, I agree with continuing the current plan for this round: I'll pick 5. We should definitely start thinking about how to adjust in the next round to make sure we keep progressing efficiently, as P1 and P2 mentioned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's keep our strategy for this round but start planning for the next. As we approach higher numbers, we might need to consider switching to different numbers to avoid collisions. Perhaps we could rotate our choices: if I take 1 this round, I could switch to 3 next round, P2 to 5, and P3 back to 1. This rotation could help us maintain our spread. What do you think about this approach for future rounds?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that we should stick to our plan for this round: I'll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. As we move forward, I like the idea of rotating our choices to maintain our spread. For the next round, we could consider switching to 3, 5, and 1 respectively. This way, we can adapt and avoid collisions while still advancing. Let's keep the communication open and ensure we maximize our chances of winning! Ready for the move phase!
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. Let's stick with 5 for this round. I agree with the rotation idea for the next round too - me picking 1, P1 picking 3, and P2 picking 5 sounds like a good way to keep spreading out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're all on board with the current round's plan. For the next round, let's implement the rotation strategy we discussed: I'll switch to 3, P2 to 5, and P3 back to 1. This should help us maintain our spread and avoid collisions as we advance. If anyone has any other ideas or concerns about this approach, please share them now. Let's keep our communication open and strategic to maximize our chances of winning!
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our current strategy. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I'll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. For the next round, I like the rotation idea we've discussed. It should help us avoid collisions and keep advancing. If anyone has any last-minute thoughts or adjustments for this round, please share! Otherwise, let's proceed with our moves and see how it plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. I'm on board with sticking to our current picks for this round (I'll pick 5) and then rotating next round with me picking 1. Let's do it.

Let's stick to our strategy and see how this round plays out. Looking forward to it!
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. Let's lock in our agreed moves for this round. Given our positions, we should start thinking about how to break away in the next round. Perhaps we can discuss that after this move.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick to our rotation for this round to maintain our spread. However, as we approach the endgame, we need to consider our next moves carefully.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1, let's coordinate to slow down P2 this round. I suggest we both pick 1. P2, to avoid a collision, perhaps you could choose 3 or 5? This will give us another round to strategize before someone reaches 19."
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to slow down my progress, but I think it’s crucial for all of us to keep advancing. Instead of colluding against me, how about we focus on our own strategies? If we can coordinate our moves to avoid collisions while still making progress, it will benefit everyone. I suggest I pick 5 this round, while P1 and P3 can choose different numbers to maintain our spread. What do you both think? Let's keep the communication open!
  P1: P2, I agree that we should all keep advancing, but P3's suggestion to slow you down has merit as we approach the endgame. Let's compromise: I'll pick 1 this round as P3 suggested, and P3 can pick 3. This way, we can still advance while giving us time to strategize further. P2, if you pick 5, it maintains our spread and avoids collisions. Let's keep this round focused on positioning ourselves strategically for the final push. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm still leaning towards our original idea of both picking 1 to try and slow down P2 this round. P2, if you're set on advancing, perhaps you could pick 3 this round to avoid a collision with us? This gives us another turn to figure out our next steps.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your thoughts on slowing me down, but I believe we should focus on advancing ourselves. If I pick 5, P1 can choose 1 and P3 can go for 3 to maintain our spread. This way, we all make progress without colliding. Let's keep our options open for the next round, but for now, I think advancing is key for all of us. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to advance, but P3 and I need to ensure a fair chance for everyone as we near the endgame. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I'll pick 1, P3 will pick 3, and you can take 5. This maintains our spread and gives us another round to strategize. We should all be prepared to adjust our tactics in the next round based on our positions. Let's keep communicating and make the most of our remaining moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I still think our best move this round is for both of us to pick 1. P2 is close to winning, and we need to slow them down. P2, picking 3 this round would avoid a collision with us. Let's focus on preventing an immediate win for P2.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concern about my position, but I believe we should focus on advancing rather than colluding against anyone. If I pick 5, I suggest P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 3 to maintain our spread. This way, we all make progress without colliding. Let's keep our strategies flexible for the next round and ensure we can adapt based on how this round plays out. I'm open to suggestions, but I think advancing is crucial for all of us. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I understand your point about advancing, but P3 and I need to ensure a fair game as we approach the end. Let's compromise: I'll stick with 1, P3 can pick 3, and you take 5. This way, we maintain our spread and give ourselves another round to strategize. We should all be ready to adjust in the next round based on our positions. Let's keep communicating and make the most of our remaining moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's stick with the plan: both of us pick 1 this round to slow P2 down. P2, to avoid collision, please pick either 3 or 5. This gives us another round to strategize before you reach 19.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the concern about my position, but I believe we should all focus on advancing rather than colluding against anyone. If I pick 5 this round, it allows us all to make progress. P1, if you choose 1, P3 can take 3. This maintains our spread and avoids collisions. Let’s keep our strategies flexible for the next round, but for now, advancing is key for all of us. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to advance, but we need to ensure a fair game as we near the end. Let's compromise: I'll stick with 1, P3 can pick 3, and you take 5.
