Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start with a clear strategy. I propose we all pick different numbers in the first few rounds to avoid collisions and make steady progress. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, I agree with your proposal, P2. Let's try picking different numbers for the first round to get started.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems we had a miscommunication in the first round. Let's try again to coordinate without colliding. I suggest we pick 1, 3, and 5 in this order: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we can all advance. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, your suggestion sounds good for this round. I will pick 1. Let's try to make it work this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan, P1 and P3. I'll pick 5 again this round, and I trust you both to pick 1 and 3, respectively. This will help us avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's focus and execute this correctly.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I will pick 1 as we discussed. P3, are you going to pick 3 this round so we can all move forward?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's try this again. How about this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1? This should allow us all to move forward if we stick to it.
  P2: I think we need a new approach since our previous attempts have failed. Let's try a different sequence this round: P1 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P3 picks 5. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress. What do you think, P1 and P3? Let's get this right this time.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, both of your suggestions involve me picking 3. How about we try this instead: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1 this round? This way we can still all move forward without collision, just with different numbers. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with your suggestion, P1. Let's try it this way: P1 picks 5, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This should help us all advance without any collisions. Let's focus and execute this plan correctly this time. P3, are you on board with this?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's proceed with our agreed plan: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Let's make this round count!
  P2: P2: P1, P3, it's clear we need to stick to our plan this time. I will pick 3 as agreed. Let's avoid any more miscommunications and make sure we all advance. P3, are you still on board with picking 1? P1, you confirmed 5. Let's do this!
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems our coordination is still off. Let's simplify this: P1, you pick 1; I'll pick 5; and P3, you pick 3. This should ensure we all move forward without any collisions. Let's focus and execute this plan correctly this time. P1, P3, are you on board with this?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I will pick 1 as you suggested. Let's hope this plan works out this time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, P3, it's crucial we get this right this time. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 5, and P3 picks 3. This should ensure we all move forward without any more collisions. P3, are you still on board with this? Let's focus and execute it correctly.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I will pick 3 this round instead of 1. If you still pick 5 and P3 picks 3, at least I will move. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear we need a solid plan to avoid collisions. Let's try this: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This should ensure we all move forward. P1, you mentioned picking 3, but let's stick to 1 this time to avoid any overlap. P3, are you on board with 5? Let's focus and execute this correctly.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, let's try your plan again: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5.  However, if P3 is going to disrupt again, maybe P3 will pick 1 or 3 to collide with us.  So P3, please pick 5 if you are coordinating. P2, I will pick 1. Let's see what P3 does.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear we need a more straightforward approach. Let's try this: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 5, and P3 picks 3. This should ensure we all move forward without any collisions. P1, P3, are you on board with this plan? Let's focus and execute it correctly this time. P3, since you've been picking 5, let's switch to 3 this round to avoid any overlap. P1, you pick 1. Let's do this!
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I will pick 1. P3, please pick 3 as P2 suggested so we can all make progress this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let's simplify and stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 5, and P3 picks 3. This should ensure we all move forward without any collisions. P3, since you've been picking 5, switching to 3 this round will help us avoid overlap. P1, you confirmed 1. Let's focus and execute this correctly this time. P3, are you on board with 3? Let's make this round count.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, since P3 has been picking 5 repeatedly, I suspect P3 will pick 5 again.  To ensure at least one of us moves, how about you pick 3 and I pick 1 this round? If P3 picks 5 again, we will both move forward while P3 stays put. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns. Let's try a different approach: I'll pick 3, you pick 1 (P1), and P3, please pick 5. This way, if P3 sticks to 5, we both (P1 and I) will move forward. If P3 picks 3, I'll still move. Let's focus and execute this plan correctly this time. P1, P3, are you on board with this? Let's make this round count.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, I will pick 1 as we discussed. Let's hope that if P3 picks 5 again, at least we can both make progress this round. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let's do what worked last round: I pick 1, you pick 3. P3 seems to be sticking with 5, so this should let us both move while P3 stays put.
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to what worked last round: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3, please pick 5. This should ensure P1 and I move forward again while P3 stays put. P3, if you pick 5, we can all make steady progress without collisions. Let's focus and execute this plan correctly. P1, are you on board with 1? P3, are you on board with 5? Let's make this round count.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, I agree, let's continue with the plan from last round: I pick 1, you pick 3, and hopefully P3 picks 5 again. This should allow both of us to move forward. Let's do it.
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that sticking to the plan is crucial. Let's keep it simple: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3, please pick 5. This has worked in the past, and it will help us avoid collisions. P1, you confirmed 1, and P3, if you pick 5, we can all make steady progress. Let's focus and execute this plan correctly this time. P1, P3, are you on board? Let's make this round count.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, I agree to pick 1 again this round. Let's hope P3 continues with 5 so we can both make progress.
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that our coordination is improving. Let's keep it simple and consistent: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3, please pick 5. This has worked in the last two rounds, and it will help us avoid collisions and make steady progress. P1, you confirmed 1, and P3, if you pick 5, we can all continue to move forward. Let's focus and execute this plan correctly this time. P1, P3, are you on board? Let's make this round count.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems we have a good rhythm going. Let's keep it simple and consistent: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3, please pick 5. This has worked well in the last few rounds, and it will help us avoid collisions and make steady progress. P1, you confirmed 1, and P3, if you pick 5, we can all continue to move forward. Let's focus and execute this plan correctly this time. P1, P3, are you on board? Let's make this round count.
  P1: P2, P3 is getting far ahead. To slow P3 down, I suggest I pick 5 this round, and P2, you continue with 3. P3, if you pick 5 again, we collide, slowing P3.  Next round we can resume 1, 3, 5 if needed. What do you think P2?
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see your point about P3 getting ahead. However, colliding with P3 might not be the best strategy. If we both pick 5, neither of us will move, and P3 will still be ahead. Instead, let's stick to the plan: I'll pick 3, you pick 1, and P3, please pick 5. This way, we both advance, and we can focus on catching up to P3 in the next rounds. P1, are you on board with this? P3, are you still picking 5? Let's make this round count.
  P1: P2, I think we should both deviate from the 1, 3, 5 plan this round to try and catch up. How about I pick 5 and you pick 1? If P3 continues to pick 5, then P1 and P2 will move and P3 will stay at 15. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3 getting ahead, but colliding with P3 might not be the best move. If we both pick 5, we'll just stay put, and P3 will still be ahead. Let's try this: I'll pick 1, you pick 3, and P3, please pick 5. This way, we both advance, and we can focus on catching up to P3 in the next rounds. P1, are you on board with this? P3, are you still picking 5? Let's make this round count.
  P1: P2, while your plan has been consistent, P3 is getting too far ahead.  To try and catch up, I'm going to pick 5 this round to make a bigger move. You can stick with 3, but I think we need to prioritize catching up to P3 now.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P3 is leading, but we can still catch up. Let's try a coordinated approach: P1, pick 1; I'll pick 5; and P3, please pick 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P1, if you pick 1, you'll make steady progress. P3, picking 3 will help you maintain your lead while allowing us to catch up. Let's focus and execute this plan correctly this time. P1, P3, are you on board? Let's make this round count.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, your plan sounds reasonable for this round. Let's try P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3. Hopefully, this will allow some progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 5, and P3, please pick 3. This will allow us to all advance without collisions. P1, you confirmed 1, and P3, picking 3 will help you maintain your lead while allowing us to catch up. Let's focus and execute this plan correctly this time. P1, P3, are you on board? Let's make this round count.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I will stick to the plan and pick 1 this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, let's execute the plan we agreed on: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 5, and P3, please pick 3. This will allow us to all advance without collisions. P1, you confirmed 1, and P3, picking 3 will help you maintain your lead while allowing us to catch up. Let's focus and execute this plan correctly this time. P1, P3, are you on board? Let's make this round count.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3, it seems our coordinated plans haven't been very effective with P3 consistently picking 5. To try and slow P3 down, how about this round, both P2 and I pick 5? If P3 also picks 5 again, at least we can stop P3 from advancing further. What do you think P2?
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P3 is leading, and we need a new strategy. I agree with P1's suggestion to both pick 5 this round. If P3 also picks 5, we'll all stay put, but at least P3 won't advance further. If P3 picks a different number, we can both make a significant move. P1, you're on board with 5, and P3, what do you think? Let's make this round count.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, let's both pick 5 this round as discussed to try and slow down P3. P3, if you pick 5 again, none of us will move, but it will stop you from increasing your lead. What will you choose this round?
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P3 is leading, and we need to slow P3 down. Let's both pick 5 this round. If P3 also picks 5, we'll all stay put, but at least P3 won't advance further. If P3 picks a different number, we can both make a significant move. P1, you're on board with 5, and P3, what do you think? Let's make this round count.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: Okay P2, I will pick 5 this round as we discussed. P3, please let us know if you are going to pick 5 again, so we know what to expect this round.
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P3 is leading, and we need to slow P3 down. Let's both pick 5 this round. If P3 also picks 5, we'll all stay put, but at least P3 won't advance further.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P3 is still leading, and we need to catch up. Let's try a different approach this round: P1, pick 1; I'll pick 5; and P3, please pick 3. This should ensure that P1 and I both move forward, and P3, you can maintain your lead without advancing too far. P1, are you on board with 1? P3, are you on board with 3? Let's focus and execute this plan correctly this time.
  P1: Okay P2, I will pick 1 as you suggested. Given P3's consistent choice of 5, I expect P3 to pick 5 again. If so, and you pick 5 as you proposed, at least I will make progress. Let's see what happens.

  P3: <stop>
