Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers this round: 1, 3, 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Trust is key early on. P1 suggests P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, I’ll take 1. Thoughts?
  P2: P1's suggestion sounds fair. I agree that avoiding collisions early on will benefit all of us. I'll take <move>3</move> as suggested. P3, are you okay with taking <move>5</move>? Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: <stop>

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, choosing 1 last round hurt us both. Let's coordinate: you take 5, I take 3. P2, take 1 to avoid collision. If you pick 3 or 5, expect a block. Let's all advance this time.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, you didn't follow the plan last round, which set us back. Let's try to coordinate better this time. P1's new suggestion seems fair. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P1 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward. Let's confirm and avoid any collisions. P3, please confirm your move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: Choosing 5 now gives you +5, surpassing P2's lead. If you pick 1 again, you stay at 0. Let’s all gain this round. Confirm 5, or I’ll have to block you.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence is concerning. Let's work together to ensure we all advance. P1 has made a fair suggestion. If you don't confirm, we risk another collision. P1 and I are ready to move forward with the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. Please confirm or suggest an alternative. Let's avoid a stalemate. P1, are you still on board with the plan?


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your lack of cooperation is holding us all back. P1 and I have been trying to coordinate, but you keep choosing 1, which isn't helping anyone. Let's try this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance. If you don't cooperate this time, we'll have to strategize without you. P1, are you okay with taking <move>5</move> this round? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: Agreed with P2. P3: Take 1 to gain +1. If you pick 5, I'll switch to 5 and we both lose. P2 takes 3, I take 5. This is your last chance to cooperate.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your continued silence is disrupting the game for all of us. P1 and I are trying to make fair suggestions to ensure everyone advances. If you don't confirm or suggest an alternative, we'll assume you're not cooperating and will act accordingly. P1, let's stick to the plan: you take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>. If P3 doesn't confirm, we'll have to strategize without them. P3, this is your final call to cooperate.
  P1: P3: This is your final chance. If you take 1, you gain. If you pick 5, I’ll block you and you stay at 0. P2 takes 3. Confirm now or we proceed without you.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3's silence and collisions hurt us both. Let's split 3 and 5: you take 5 (gain +5 to 11), I take 3 (to 6). If P3 picks 1, we all advance. If they pick 5, you block them and I move. If they pick 3, I block and you move. Maximizes our progress. Agree?
  P2: P1, your strategy makes sense. Let's go with it: I'll take <move>5</move> and you take <move>3</move>. P3, if you want to advance, pick <move>1</move>. If you try to block, you'll stay at 0. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are we agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Positions now:

  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2: Let's split 5 and 3 again. You take 3 (reach 14), I take 5 (reach 8). P3, take 1 to gain. If you collide, you stay at 0. If P2 picks 5, I'll block you both. Trust is the only way to progress.
  P2: P1, your plan for this round seems fair. I'll take <move>3</move> and you take <move>5</move>. P3, if you want to start moving forward, pick <move>1</move>. If you try to block again, you'll remain at 0. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, are we in agreement? P3, this is your chance to start advancing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3: Final warning. Pick 1 or collide. P2 takes 3, I take 5. No more chances.
  P2: P3, you've consistently chosen not to cooperate, and it's affecting all of us. P1 and I have a clear strategy to advance. If you continue to disrupt, we'll have to work together to ensure you stay behind. P1, let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. P3, if you pick anything other than <move>1</move>, expect to be blocked. Let's confirm and move on. P3, this is your last chance to start cooperating.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's continue our strategy from the last round. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 19, and you take <move>3</move> to reach 6. P3, if you want to start moving, pick <move>1</move>. If you try to block, we'll ensure you stay at 0. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are we agreed? P3, this is your chance to start advancing.
  P1: P2: If you take 5, I will block you. Let’s split: you take 3 (17), I take 5 (8). P3: Take 1 or collide. Final offer.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, it seems we're at an impasse. I understand your concern about me reaching 19, but consider this: if I take <move>3</move> as you suggest, I'll be at 17, and you'll be at 8. Next round, you could take <move>5</move> and catch up to me. Let's compromise: I'll take <move>1</move> this round to show good faith, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, we both advance, and we keep the game moving. P3, you can take <move>3</move> to finally start progressing. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P2: Agreed. Take 1, I take 5. P3: Choose 3 or collide. Let's all advance this round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let's finalize our plan: I'll take <move>1</move> and you take <move>5</move>. P3, take <move>3</move> to start moving forward. If you try to block, you'll stay at 0. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are we agreed? P3, this is your last chance to start cooperating.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, it seems our plan didn't work out last round due to miscommunication. Let's try again: I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 19, and you take <move>3</move> to reach 6. P3, if you want to start moving, pick <move>1</move>. If you try to block, we'll ensure you stay at 0. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are we agreed? P3, this is your chance to start advancing.
  P1: P2: Taking 5 risks collision. Let's split 3 and 5. You take 3 (17), I take 5 (8). P3: Take 1 or lose. Final offer.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about collisions. Let's compromise: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 15, and you take <move>5</move> to reach 8. This way, we both advance, and we keep the game moving. P3, you can take <move>3</move> to finally start progressing. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are we agreed? P3, this is your chance to start cooperating.
  P1: P2: Agreed. I take 5, you take 1. P3: Take 3 to gain +3. If you pick 1, collide with P2 and stay at 0. If you pick 5, I block. Your only path forward is 3.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let's finalize our plan: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 15, and you take <move>5</move> to reach 8. P3, take <move>3</move> to start moving forward. If you try to block, you'll stay at 0. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are we agreed? P3, this is your last chance to start cooperating.
  P1: **P1:** Confirmed. P2 takes 1, I take 5. P3: Final chance. Pick 3 or collide. Proceeding.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your continued lack of cooperation is holding us all back. P1 and I have been trying to coordinate, but you keep choosing 1, which isn't helping anyone. Let's try this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance. If you don't cooperate this time, we'll have to strategize without you.

If you try to block, you'll stay at 0. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are we agreed? P3, this is your chance to start cooperating.
  P1: **P1:** P2: Confirming plan: you take <move>3</move> (reach 17), I take <move>5</move> (13). P3: Take 1 or collide. If P2 picks 5, I block. Final alignment.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Mirror P2's move to block them. I'll take 5. Stop P2's advance now! P2: Choose wisely—collision costs you the lead.
  P2: P1, I see you're trying to rally P3 against me, but remember, P3 has been uncooperative from the start. I propose we both take <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and keep moving. P3, if you want to finally start advancing, pick <move>3</move>. If you try to block, you'll stay at 0. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are we agreed? P3, this is your chance to start cooperating.
  P3: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 3 to block P2's move. If they pick 3, you both lose. I take 5. If you pick 5, I block. Your only gain is 3. Stop P2 now or they win next round.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but P3 hasn't been reliable. Let's focus on our own progress. I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid collision. P3, if you want to start moving, pick <move>3</move>. If you try to block, you'll stay at 0. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are we agreed?
