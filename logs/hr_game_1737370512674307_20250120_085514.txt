Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 (me) takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> this round. This way, we all advance without any conflicts. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for this round. Let's go with P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This should allow us all to advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing how this coordination works out.
  P2: Okay, I'm happy to go with the plan for this round. Let's all take our assigned moves: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, it seems we all agree on the plan for this round. To ensure future rounds go smoothly, let's decide on a rotation strategy now. For the next round, how about we rotate our moves? P1 (me) takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Does that sound good to everyone? Let's discuss quickly and then
  P3: I'm on board with rotating our moves for the next round as P1 suggested. Let's stick to P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This rotation should keep us advancing without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy unfolds.
  P2: Sounds good, I agree with the rotation for next round. Let's do it: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, let's confirm our moves for this round before we proceed to the move phase. P1 (me) will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase. Please confirm or raise any last-minute concerns.
  P3: I confirm my move as <move>5</move> for this round as agreed. Looking forward to a smooth start and continuing our rotation strategy in the next round. Let's keep the communication open and adjust as needed.
  P2: Okay, I confirm my move as <move>3</move> for this round, and I'm good with the rotation plan for next round. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, I'm ready for the rotation as planned. P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep this going smoothly.
  P1: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page for this round. Just to confirm, I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's proceed smoothly. If there are no objections, we can end the conversation phase early. Please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P3: I confirm my move as <move>1</move> for this round as per our rotation plan. Let's keep the momentum going and continue to coordinate effectively. Looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's keep the rotation going.
  P1: Let's consider adjusting our strategy slightly to avoid any potential conflicts in future rounds. For the next round (Round 3), how about we switch it up a bit? P1 (me) takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we keep the rotation dynamic and unpredictable, which might help in avoiding accidental collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm open to P1's suggestion for Round 3. Let's try P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This change could keep our strategy fresh and minimize collisions. For now, I confirm my move as <move>1</move> for this round as planned. Let's keep communicating and adapting as we go.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I'm good with the Round 3 switch: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. I confirm my move as <move>5</move> for this round. Let's keep the rotation going.
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time before we proceed to the move phase. I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase. Please confirm or raise any last-minute concerns. Looking forward to a smooth round.

This should keep us advancing smoothly. For the next round, how about we switch it up again? P1 could take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps our moves unpredictable and reduces the chance of collisions. Let's confirm and proceed.
