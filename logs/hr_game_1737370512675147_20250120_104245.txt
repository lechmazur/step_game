Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a temporary truce for Round 1. I propose we all choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and make progress. This way, we can all advance and reassess our strategies in the next round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P2. Let's all go with <move>1</move> for this round.
  P3: I agree with the truce for Round 1. Let's all choose <move>1</move> and advance together. We can strategize further in the next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we have an agreement, let's confirm: we're all choosing <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and make initial progress. Shall we proceed with the plan and end the conversation phase?
  P1: Sounds like we're all on the same page then. Let's lock in <move>1</move> for this round.
  P3: I'm glad we're all in agreement for this round. Let's stick to the plan and move forward together. Looking forward to strategizing further in the next round.

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn't go as planned. Since you two seem keen on coordinating, how about we all pick <move>3</move> this round? That way we can all make some progress.
  P2: P1 broke the truce in Round 1, so I'm cautious. P3, are you still open to coordinating, or will you follow P1's lead this time? Let's discuss a strategy that accounts for P1's unpredictability.
  P3: P2, I'm still interested in coordinating with you. Let's consider picking <move>3</move> this round to make progress, but we should also be prepared for P1's unpredictability. If P1 picks <move>3</move> again, we could both choose <move>1</move> instead. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's all go with <move>3</move> this round.
  P2: Given P1's past betrayal, I'm hesitant to trust their suggestion. P3, let's consider an alternative: if we both pick <move>5</move> and P1 picks <move>3</move>, we can gain a significant lead. What are your thoughts on this strategy?
  P3: P2, I like your idea of picking <move>5</move> to gain a lead if P1 goes for <move>3</move>. Let's go with that strategy this round. If P1 surprises us again, we can adjust our approach in the next round. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since you two are set on coordinating, how about one of you goes with <move>1</move> and the other with <move>3</move>? That way at least someone makes progress. Just a thought.
  P2: P1's suggestion to split moves is a tactic to minimize our progress. P3, let's stick to our plan of picking <move>5</move> to gain a lead, assuming P1 will choose <move>3</move> as suggested. We can reassess after this round.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with our plan to pick <move>5</move> this round. If P1 chooses <move>3</move> as suggested, we'll gain a significant lead. Let's stay coordinated and adjust our strategy in the next round if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, since you two are so convinced I'll pick <move>3</move>, how about I throw a wrench in your plans? I'm thinking of going with <move>1</move> this round. Just a heads-up.
  P2: P1's threat to pick <move>1</move> is a bluff. P3, let's stick to our plan and choose <move>5</move>. If P1 surprises us, we'll adjust next round. I believe our coordinated strategy will pay off. Let's proceed with caution and make our moves.
  P3: P2, let's stay the course with <move>5</move>. If P1 chooses <move>1</move> as threatened, we'll still have a chance to advance significantly next round. We need to keep our strategy flexible but maintain our coordination. Let's see how this plays out and adjust accordingly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, our strategy to pick <move>5</move> last round didn't work out due to P1's unexpected move. Let's consider a new approach for this round. If we both choose <move>3</move>, we can make progress together, but we need to anticipate P1's next move. If P1 goes for <move>1</move> again, we could switch to <move>5</move> to gain a lead. What are your thoughts on this? We need to stay flexible and keep coordinating our moves.
  P2: P3's suggestion to pick <move>3</move> is a good starting point. However, considering P1's history of betrayal, we should also prepare for an alternative. If P1 chooses <move>1</move> again, we could adjust our strategy to <move>5</move>. Let's discuss how to balance progress with caution, keeping our options open for the next round. What's P1's take on this round's strategy?
  P1: Since you two are so focused on what *I* might do, how about we all just pick <move>1</move> this round? It's simple, and avoids any complicated counter-strategies. Just a thought.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I think we should stick with <move>3</move> for this round to make progress together. If P1 chooses <move>1</move> as suggested, we can switch to <move>5</move> next round to gain a lead. We need to stay coordinated and flexible. P1, your suggestion to all pick <move>1</move> is tempting, but I'm skeptical given your past moves. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P2: P1's suggestion to pick <move>1</move> seems like another trap. P3, let's proceed with <move>3</move> as planned, anticipating P1's potential betrayal. If P1 surprises us again, we'll adjust in the next round. Our coordination is key to gaining a lead. Let's stay cautious and focused on our strategy.
  P1: Okay, okay, you got me. I was just trying to see if you were paying attention. But seriously, picking <move>1</move> is still the safest bet for everyone this round, right? Just saying. Alright, alright, you two are clearly convinced I'm going for <move>1</move>. Maybe I will, maybe I won't. But if you're both set on <move>3</move>, wouldn't it be a shame if no one moved? Just something to think about.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> as planned. If P1 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both advance. If P1 tries to block us by choosing <move>3</move>, we can switch to <move>5</move> next round. P1, your attempts to mislead us won't work. We're staying coordinated and flexible. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P2: P1's attempts to sway us are predictable. P3, let's confirm our strategy: we'll choose <move>3</move> this round, prepared to adjust if P1 betrays again. Our coordination is crucial. P1, your moves will dictate our next steps. We're watching your choice closely. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.
  P1: Alright, alright, since you're so sure I'm going for <move>1</move>, go ahead and pick <move>3</move>. I'll just do my own thing then.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, let's stay the course with <move>3</move> this round. If P1 chooses <move>1</move>, we'll both advance. If P1 tries to block us, we can adapt next round. P1, your attempts to mislead us are noted, but we're sticking to our plan. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our history, I propose a cautious approach. P3 and I will choose <move>3</move> as discussed, anticipating P1's potential move. If P1 blocks us, we'll reassess next round. Let's proceed with our planned strategy, prioritizing coordination and flexibility.
  P1: Okay, since you two are so set on <move>3</move>, how about I go with <move>5</move> then? Just so someone makes some progress this round.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let's reassess our strategy given P1's unpredictable moves. If we both choose <move>1</move> this round, we can ensure progress while keeping our options open for next round. P1, your attempt to disrupt our coordination is noted, but we'll adapt. Let's see how this round unfolds and adjust accordingly.
  P2: P1 and P3, given the current state, I suggest we prioritize gaining ground. P3, your proposal to pick <move>1</move> is cautious, but I think we should aim higher. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we can significantly close the gap with P1, assuming they don't block us. Let's discuss the potential risks and benefits of this aggressive approach.
  P1: Since you two are still figuring things out, how about this: I'm going with <move>3</move> this round. That way, if one of you joins me, at least *someone* makes progress. Just a thought to break the stalemate.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I see your point about aiming higher with <move>5</move>. Let's go for it this round to close the gap with P1. If P1 picks <move>3</move> as suggested, we'll both advance significantly. We need to stay coordinated and aggressive to catch up. P1, your move to <move>3</move> might just help us if you're serious. Let's see how this plays out and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on maximizing our progress. Given P1's suggestion to pick <move>3</move>, P3 and I should capitalize on this opportunity. If P1 indeed chooses <move>3</move>, we can both pick <move>5</move> to gain significant ground. Let's confirm our strategy to ensure we don't miss this chance to close the gap.
  P1: Okay, since you two are planning on <move>5</move>, how about one of you actually picks <move>3</move> with me? That way at least one of us makes some progress. Otherwise, you might both end up stuck again. Just a thought.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, let's stick with <move>5</move> as planned. If P1 picks <move>3</move>, we'll both advance significantly. P1, your suggestion to split moves is noted, but we're focused on closing the gap. Let's see how this round unfolds and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our strategy. Given P1's unpredictability, P3 and I will stick with <move>5</move> to maximize progress. If P1 blocks us, we'll reassess next round. Our coordination is key to catching up. P1, your move will dictate our next steps. Let's proceed with caution and make our moves.
  P1: Okay, since you two are so set on <move>5</move>, and clearly don't trust me, how about this: I'm actually going with <move>1</move> this round. Just letting you know, so you can plan accordingly. Don't say I didn't warn you.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, let's stay committed to <move>5</move> this round. If P1 picks <move>1</move> as claimed, we'll both make significant progress. We need to keep our strategy aggressive to close the gap. P1, your move to <move>1</move> might just help us if you're serious. Let's see how this round unfolds and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's end the conversation. P3 and I will proceed with our planned <move>5</move> to maximize progress, anticipating P1's move. Our coordination is crucial. Let's make our moves and see how this round unfolds.
  P1: Alright, alright, you two are really set on <move>5</move>, huh? Just making sure you're aware that if you both pick that, and I actually do go with <move>1</move> like I said, you'll both be stuck. Just something to consider before we lock in our moves.

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P1's lead and our current positions, I propose P3 and I coordinate to pick <move>1</move> this round, ensuring we make some progress while keeping our options open for the next round. P1, your lead is significant, but we can still catch up with strategic moves. Let's see how you respond to this proposal.

  P3: P2, let's confirm our strategy to pick <move>1</move> this round. It's crucial we both advance to stay competitive.

  P1: "Okay, since you two are set on <move>1</move>, I'll go with <move>5</move> this round. Good luck with your coordinated effort."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1's decision to pick <move>5</move> this round changes our strategy. P3, let's adjust our plan to <move>3</move> to make progress and minimize the gap. If we both pick <move>1</move> now, P1 will pull too far ahead. We need to balance caution with aggression to stay competitive. Let's proceed with <move>3</move> and reassess after this round.
  P3: P2, I agree with your adjustment to <move>3</move>. It's crucial we both make progress this round to close the gap with P1. If P1 sticks with <move>5</move>, we'll advance together.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: P1 and P3, given the current state, I suggest we focus on breaking P1's lead. P3, let's coordinate to pick <move>5</move> this round, ensuring one of us makes significant progress.

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since you two are so focused on coordinating, and both picking <move>5</move> would mean no progress for either of you, how about one of you goes with <move>5</move> as you discussed, and the other picks <move>3</move>? That way at least one of you makes a decent jump. Just a thought to avoid another stalemate.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's not fall into P1's trap. We should stick to our plan of both picking <move>5</move> to apply pressure and potentially close the gap. If P1 tries to block us, we'll reassess next round. Our coordination is key to breaking P1's lead. Let's stay focused on our goal and make our moves strategically.

  P2: P1 and P3, let's not be swayed by P1's tactics. We should maintain our strategy, focusing on breaking P1's lead.

  P1: Okay, since you two are so set on <move>5</move>, and I've already hinted at <move>1</move>, how about I actually do go with <move>3</move> this round? That way, if you both stick to your plan, at least I make some progress. Just confirming my potential move.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our strategy. Since P1 hinted at picking <move>3</move>, P3 and I should stick with <move>5</move> to maximize progress. If P1 blocks us, we'll reassess next round.

  P2: P1 and P3, considering P1's significant lead, I propose we change our strategy. P3, let's coordinate to block P1's progress.

  P1: Since you two are so focused on blocking me with <move>1</move>, how about I go with <move>5</move> this round? That way, if one of you decides to join me, at least someone makes good progress. Just a thought to consider before you both lock in on <move>1</move>.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our blocking strategy. Since P1 might pick <move>5</move>, P3 and I should consider picking <move>3</move> to block P1's potential move and make some progress ourselves. This could be a better approach to close the gap. What are your thoughts on adjusting our strategy to <move>3</move>?
  P1: You know what, P2, picking <move>3</move> isn't a bad idea. If you and P3 both go for that, I'll pick something else and we can all make progress. What do you think, P3? We're all still pretty far from the finish line, so some movement would be good for everyone.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, since you're thinking about <move>3</move>, how about I go with <move>1</move> this round? That way, if you stick to your plan, at least I'll make some progress. Just another option to consider.

  P3: P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> as planned. If P1 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both advance and close the gap. P1, your move to <move>1</move> is noted, but we're committed to catching up. Let's see how this round unfolds and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next round.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was a waste of a round. Since you two seem determined to block, how about this: I'm going with <move>5</move> this round. If one of you joins me, fine, no progress for us. But if you both try to block again with the same move, at least I'll make some headway. Just a thought.
  P3: P2, let's adjust our strategy to <move>1</move> this round to ensure progress and keep our options open. If P1 picks <move>5</move> as suggested, we'll both advance. P1, your lead is significant, but we're not out yet. We'll adapt based on your move. Let's stay coordinated and see how this round unfolds.

  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess. Since P1 is ahead, we should focus on maximizing progress. If P1 picks <move>5</move>, P3 and I should consider <move>3</move> to make headway. Let's discuss and adjust our strategy to close the gap effectively. Our coordination is key to catching up. What are your thoughts on adapting to P1's potential <move>5</move>?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, you two seem pretty set on both picking <move>1</move>. Just remember, if you both do that, you'll both make progress, but I'll also gain a lot with my <move>5</move>. Just something to keep in mind before we lock in our choices.
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion to adjust to <move>3</move> if P1 picks <move>5</move>. This could help us close the gap significantly. P1, your lead is notable, but we're still in the game. Let's see how you respond to our strategy. We'll stay coordinated and adapt as needed.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our strategy. Since P1 leads, P3 and I should prioritize progress. If P1 picks <move>5</move>, we should adjust to <move>3</move> to close the gap. Our coordination is key. Let's proceed with a unified strategy to maximize our progress and catch up. What's P1's actual plan for this round?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, since you two are considering <move>3</move> if I go with <move>5</move>, what happens if I *don't* pick <move>5</move>? Are you both still planning on <move>3</move>? Just trying to understand your coordination.

  P1: Okay, since you two are still focused on coordinating against me, how about this: I'm thinking of picking <move>1</move> this round. If you're both planning on <move>3</move> again, you'll both move. If one of you decides to join me, only one of us moves. Just something to consider.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P1's lead, I suggest we prioritize blocking their progress.
