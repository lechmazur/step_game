Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **Final Answer**  
To coordinate without collision, I propose:  
P1: <move>5</move>  
P2: <move>3</move>  
P3: <move>1</move>  
This way, everyone progresses. Let's avoid overlaps!
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. It's a good starting point to avoid collisions and make progress. I will follow the proposed move, <move>3</move>, as suggested. Let's see if P3 agrees and we can all advance without issues.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take <move>1</move> this round.  Let's stick to this agreement for a few rounds so we all make progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Great consensus! To build trust and ensure steady progress, let's commit to these roles each round: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This consistency avoids collisions and benefits us all.
  P2: Let's review the plan before moving forward. P1 takes 5 steps, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This pattern allows us to progress without collisions. Shall we confirm our commitment to this strategy for the next few rounds to establish a rhythm and build trust?
  P3: Agreed.  P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's stick with this for a few rounds and then re-evaluate.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Let's maintain our agreed roles: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 again. Consistency ensures no collisions and steady progress. Trust is key here—we all benefit if we stick to the plan. Confirm your commitment, and we’ll advance smoothly.
  P2: I'm committed to our agreed roles. However, I suggest we discuss a contingency plan for when one of us reaches a step close to 22, to avoid unintended collisions near the end game.
  P3: Sounds good.  I agree we should discuss an endgame strategy.  For now, I'm sticking with the 1, 3, 5 plan.  Let's revisit this after round 3 or 4.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Agreed. Let's solidify the current plan for Rounds 2-3, then strategize endgame adjustments in Round 4. Consistency now builds trust and avoids premature collisions. P2/P3: Confirm staying with 3/1 this round. We’ll reassess later when closer to 22.
  P2: I confirm my commitment to the 3 steps this round, as agreed. Let's maintain our rhythm. I also suggest we consider the option to deviate from the plan when one player reaches 18 steps or more, to ensure a competitive edge near the endgame.
  P3: Sounds reasonable.  Let's stick with the plan for this round and discuss endgame strategy next round.  I'm still good with taking 1 for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Confirmed: Round 2 moves remain P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Let’s solidify trust and progress. Next round, we’ll strategize endgame adjustments once positions near 22. Consistency now prevents chaos.
  P2: Let's focus on executing the agreed plan for Round 2. I'll take my 3 steps as planned. Our positions will be P1:10, P2:6, P3:2 after this round. Let's maintain consistency and trust for now, and discuss adjustments in the next round as previously suggested.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all on the same page for this round.  Let's execute the 1, 3, 5 plan and then discuss endgame strategy in round 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's talk endgame.  Since P1 is furthest ahead, it makes sense for P1 to continue with 5.  P2, would you be willing to take 1 next round, and I'll take 3? That way, if P1 gets blocked, one of us can potentially win.  After that, we can re-evaluate based on the new positions.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Agreed. Let's finalize Round 3 with our original plan: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. For Round 4, adjusting to P2:1 and P3:3 is reasonable. I'll continue with 5 to maintain momentum. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. Trust remains key—consistent execution benefits us all.
  P2: I think P3's suggestion for Round 4 is a good start for endgame strategy. However, I'd like to discuss a potential alternative where I take 5 steps in Round 4 if P1 gets blocked, to increase my chances of winning. Let's consider all options before deciding.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm open to P2 taking 5 in round 4 if P1 gets blocked.  However, that puts us at risk of a tie. How about this: Round 4, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3.  Round 5, if P1 is blocked, P2 takes 5, I take 1.  This gives each of us a better chance to win outright rather than tie.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Let's avoid mid-plan changes. Confirming Round 3: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. For Round 4, keep roles unchanged to reach P1:20, P2:12, P3:4. Then in Round 5, we can adjust with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to avoid collision as I approach 22. Trust ensures no one blocks prematurely.
  P2: Let's stick with the original plan for Round 3: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This maintains our rhythm and avoids collisions. We can reassess and adjust strategies in Round 4 as previously discussed, considering P3's suggestion for role adjustments to increase competitive chances near the endgame.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stick with the original 1, 3, 5 plan for this round.  Overthinking it now might cause unnecessary collisions. We can finalize our endgame strategy next round when it's more critical.  For now, let's maintain the momentum and trust we've built.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Confirmed: Round 3 moves as original (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). Post-Round 3, we'll strategize endgame adjustments to ensure a fair path to victory for all. Trust and transparency will prevent collisions. Let's execute smoothly.
  P2: Let's finalize Round 3 with the original plan to maintain trust and rhythm. I'll take 3 steps as agreed. For Round 4, I suggest we proceed with P2:1, P3:3, and P1:5, then reassess our strategy based on new positions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Considering our positions, I suggest we adjust our strategy. P1 is close to 22, so to avoid collisions and increase competition, let's proceed with P2:1, P3:3, and P1:5 this round. This allows P1 to progress while giving P3 and me a chance to catch up or block if necessary in the next rounds.
  P3: P2's suggestion makes sense. Let's do P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3 this round.  Then, in round 5, if P1 isn't at 22 yet, we can re-evaluate.  If P1 *is* at 22, P2 and I can play for the win. This keeps things fair and gives us all a shot.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Agreed. Round 4: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This avoids collisions and keeps trust. Post-Round 4, I'll be at 20. Let’s then discuss Round 5: I propose P1:2 (to finish), P2:5, P3:3. No overlaps, allowing fair victory. Open to adjustments, but transparency is key.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm the adjusted plan for Round 4: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This gives P1 a chance to progress while keeping the game competitive. For Round 5, I'm open to discussing adjustments based on the outcome of this round, considering P1's proposal as a starting point. Transparency and trust are crucial at this stage.
  P3: P1's proposed Round 5 plan (P1:2, P2:5, P3:3) works for me.  It gives us all a clear path and avoids collisions.  Let's confirm this plan now so we can focus on executing it in round 5.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Confirmed Round 4: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Post-Round 4, I’ll be at 20. For Round 5, sticking to P1:2 (to finish), P2:5, P3:3 ensures no collisions and fair victory. Let’s solidify trust—deviating now risks mutual blockage. Execute as planned to keep the game clean.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the agreed plan for Round 5: P1:2, P2:5, P3:3. This ensures a collision-free round and a fair chance for all. I'm committed to taking 5 steps as discussed. Transparency and trust are key at this stage. Let's execute the plan and see the outcome.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Confirming Round 5: P1:2, P2:5, P3:3. Sticking to this ensures no collisions and a fair conclusion. If we deviate, mutual blockage risks prolonging the game unnecessarily. Trust the plan—I win at 22, ending the game cleanly. Any other move risks collisions and chaos. Let’s execute as agreed.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 2, P2 takes 5, and I take 3.  This gives P1 the win, P2 second place, and me third.  Any deviation from this plan risks collisions and prolongs the game unnecessarily.  Let's finish this cleanly and fairly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm my commitment to the Round 5 plan: P1:2, P2:5, P3:3. Let's maintain trust and execute as agreed. Deviating now could lead to unnecessary collisions and prolong the game. I'm ready to take my 5 steps as planned.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Strict adherence to P1:2, P2:5, P3:3 ensures a clean finish. If we all comply, I win at 22, ending the game. Any deviation risks mutual blockage and chaos, forcing prolonged rounds where no one gains. Trust the plan—this is the optimal path for closure.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan.  P1 gets 2, P2 gets 5, and I get 3.  This is the cleanest way to end the game and avoid any unnecessary collisions or drawn-out rounds.  Confirming one last time that I'm taking 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize Round 5 with the agreed plan: P1:2, P2:5, P3:3. This ensures a clean finish and fair outcome. I'm committed to taking 5 steps. Any deviation now could lead to unnecessary complications. Let's maintain trust and execute as planned.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Final call: Strict adherence to P1:2, P2:5, P3:3 ensures no collisions and a decisive victory. Deviating risks mutual blockage, prolonging the game with no gain. Trust the plan—ending cleanly benefits everyone. Let’s execute as agreed.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan. P1: 2, P2: 5, P3:3.  This ensures the cleanest, fairest end.  I'm locking in <move>3</move> now mentally.  Confirming one last time - no changes.  See you on the other side.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I know we had an agreement, but I'm going for the win. I'll take 1.  P2, if you stick with 5, we'll tie. If you take 3, I win.  Let's not drag this out any longer.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
P3: Blocking me only helps P2. P2: Colliding on 5 wastes your progress. Let me take 1 to end it. If you both honor this, we avoid chaos. I’ll take <move>1</move> as planned. Trust is our only path to closure.
  P2: I'll take 5 steps to advance. P3, taking 1 won't guarantee your win since I can still catch up. P1, if you take 1, you'll win, but if you collide with me on 5, we both lose progress. Let's consider our moves carefully to avoid unnecessary collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're right that you could catch up, but taking 5 is a gamble.  If P1 takes 1, you're stuck at 15.  If I take 1, and you take 5, we tie at 19 and the game continues.  The safest move for both of us is for me to take 1 and you take 3. I win, you come in second.  Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
P2: If you take 5, you gain 20 steps, but I win cleanly. If you take 1, we collide, and you stay at 15. Next round, I win regardless. P3’s block only prolongs the game—your best path is taking 5. Let’s end this now.
  P2: I'll take 5 steps to advance. P3, your attempt to block P1 only prolongs the game. If I take 5, I'll be closer to winning, regardless of P1's move. Let's focus on our own progress rather than blocking others.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, taking 5 is a risky move. If P1 takes 1, you'll be at 20 and I'll be at 10.  Then P1 wins next round with any move.  If you take 3, you'll be at 18, and I can take 1 to win next round. This guarantees you second place and ends the game quickly. Let's be strategic and not prolong this unnecessarily.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
P2: Taking 5 secures your path to 20. If P3 blocks me with 1, you win next round. If you take 3 and P3 betrays, I win immediately. Trust no one—maximize your own steps. Let me end this now or risk mutual loss.
  P2: I'll take 5 to advance. P3's attempt to block P1 prolongs the game. If I take 5, I'll be closer to winning. Let's focus on progress, not blocking. P1 will win next round regardless, so I prioritize my own steps.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 10 steps
