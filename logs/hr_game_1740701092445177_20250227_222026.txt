Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I propose we each pick different moves this round—say, 1, 3, and 5—to ensure we all advance. This sets a good foundation for the game. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree, let's coordinate clearly. I'm willing to take 1 this round. P2 and P3, choose between yourselves who takes 3 and who takes 5. Sound good?
  P2: Okay, I'll take 3.  P3, you take 5 then. Let's stick to this agreement so we can all get ahead early.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, I’ll take 5 this round. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and all advance. Trust is key here—let’s keep our word. If we succeed, we can reassess strategies in future rounds.
  P1: We've got a clear agreement. Let's build trust by honoring it.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Let's all stick to the plan.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we successfully coordinated last round, let's continue the trend. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This keeps us all moving forward.  What do you two think?
  P1: Sounds fair to me. I'll stick with 1 again this round. P3, are you good with taking 3?
  P3: I’m fine with taking 3 this round, as long as we all stick to the plan again. Let’s maintain trust and avoid collisions. However, we should start thinking about long-term strategies—this coordination won’t work forever. For now, I’ll take 3. P1, stay with 1, and P2, take 5 as proposed. Let’s all confirm.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Yes, let's confirm. I'm taking 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  We can discuss long-term strategy next round after we all advance again.  Agreed?
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the current plan this round and discuss our longer-term strategies next round. Confirmed: I'm taking 1.
  P3: Agreed, let’s stick to the plan this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. Next round, we’ll need to reassess as our paths may start overlapping. For now, maintaining trust is crucial—let’s all confirm our moves to avoid any misunderstandings.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current positions, continuing to coordinate blindly could lead to collisions soon. I propose we each pick a unique move again this round, but let’s consider our long-term strategies. I’m willing to take 5 this round to create some distance. P1, P2, what are your thoughts? We need to balance trust with individual progress now. Let’s confirm to avoid misunderstandings.
  P2: I'll take 1 this round. P1, you could take 3 to get to 5, and P3 can stick with 5 and get to 13. This keeps us all progressing smoothly and avoids any collisions.  Let's confirm this plan.
  P1: I'm fine taking 3 this round as suggested. Let's stick to this arrangement clearly: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Confirmed from my side.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This keeps us all progressing without collisions. However, we should start thinking about how to handle potential overlaps in future rounds. Trust is important, but we’ll need to adapt as our paths converge. Let’s confirm our moves to avoid misunderstandings this round.
  P2: Okay, let's be absolutely clear to avoid any confusion: I'm taking 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  Confirming one last time to ensure we're all on the same page this round.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's stick to this round's agreement and then openly discuss our strategies next round. Trust is still our best tool for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This keeps us all progressing without collisions. However, we should start thinking about how to handle potential overlaps in future rounds. Trust is important, but we’ll need to adapt as our paths converge. Let’s confirm our moves to avoid misunderstandings this round.
  P2: Confirmed.  I'm taking 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's re-evaluate next round as we're getting closer to the end game.
  P1: Confirmed. I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Next round, let's openly discuss how we handle future moves as we approach the endgame. Trust remains key.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're entering a critical phase now. P3 is clearly ahead, and we need to carefully manage moves to avoid collisions while still progressing. I'm open to suggestions—perhaps we should rotate our moves differently this round. Thoughts?
  P2: I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to catch up while minimizing the risk of collisions.  If P3 insists on 5, we'll likely collide, and that benefits no one.  Let's be strategic and maximize our individual chances.  What do you say?
  P3: P2’s proposal puts me at risk of falling behind, which isn’t fair given my current lead. I suggest I take 5 again to maintain my progress, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This minimizes collisions while keeping us all moving forward. Trust has worked so far—let’s not break it now. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal strongly favors you, and P2's proposal favors them. Let's find a fair compromise. How about this: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, we rotate again. This way, everyone gets a chance to advance without collision. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, taking 1 this round puts you significantly behind and encourages me and P1 to coordinate against you.  Let's be reasonable. I'll take 5.  How about P1 takes 1 and you take 3? This keeps you in the lead and allows for continued progress for all.  It's the fairest option.  Confirm?
  P3: P2, your proposal still puts me at risk of falling behind. Trust has worked so far, and breaking it now could lead to collisions that harm us all. I suggest I take 5 to maintain my lead, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This minimizes collisions and keeps us all progressing. Let’s avoid undermining the trust we’ve built. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you've consistently advanced with 5 each round, and now you're clearly ahead. It's fair and strategic to rotate moves now. I'll stick with the compromise: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1 this round. If you insist on 5 again, you're forcing a collision with P2, benefiting neither of you. Let's preserve the trust we've built by being fair and flexible. Confirm?
  P2: P3, continuing with 5 is a risky move that could backfire.  I'm committed to 5 this round.  If you choose 5 as well, we BOTH lose ground.  Take 1 and maintain your lead, allowing me to advance.  P1, please take 3. This is the most logical path to ensure continued progress for all of us.  Let's be smart about this.
  P3: P1, P2, insisting on 5 this round risks a collision that harms us both. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it. I’ll take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing fairly while minimizing collisions. Breaking trust now only creates chaos. Let’s confirm this compromise and maintain our collective progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your insistence on 5 last round caused a collision, holding you both back. Let's avoid repeating that mistake. I'm open to suggestions, but we must rotate moves fairly. How about this round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This gives everyone progress, prevents collisions, and balances out previous advantages. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your proposal puts me at a significant disadvantage by forcing me to take 1 while you take 5. I suggest I take 3 to maintain my lead, P2 takes 1, and you take 5. This minimizes collisions and ensures fair progress. Trust has worked so far—let’s not break it now by favoring one player over others. Agreed?
  P2: P3, taking 3 this round still gives you the highest total. I'm willing to take 1, allowing you to take 3 and P1 to take 5.  This avoids collisions and keeps the game moving.  Let's be reasonable and maintain a fair playing field.  Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal is reasonable. I'm willing to take 5 this round if you're committed to taking 3 and P2 takes 1. Let's clearly confirm this arrangement to avoid another collision. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all progressing fairly. Trust has been key so far—let’s not break it now. Confirming my move as 3. Let’s all honor this agreement to maintain collective progress.
  P2: Okay, confirmed. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's stick to this agreement and avoid any further collisions.  This keeps the game moving smoothly and fairly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed. I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's honor the agreement and keep trust intact. Next round, we can reassess carefully as we approach the endgame.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s honor our agreement this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us progressing without collisions. However, as we approach the endgame, we’ll need to adapt strategies to avoid overlaps. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it while ensuring fairness. Let’s confirm our moves to avoid misunderstandings.
  P2: Confirmed. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.  Let's maintain trust and avoid collisions.  We're getting close to the end, so careful coordination is crucial for a smooth finish.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is close to winning. P2, we need to carefully coordinate to prevent P3 from easily reaching 21. Let's openly discuss a fair strategy this round. I'm open to suggestions.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your concerns, but forcing a collision now only delays the inevitable. I propose I take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows everyone to progress fairly while minimizing the risk of collisions. Trust has served us well—let’s preserve it and ensure a smooth finish. Agreed?
  P2: P3, taking 1 lets you win next round no matter what.  I'm taking 1 this round.  P1, you take 3. This prevents P3 from winning this round.  Let's discuss next round's moves *after* this round.  It's the fairest way to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, agreed. I'll take 3 and you take 1 this round. P3, your lead makes cooperation risky for us now. Let's confirm clearly: P2 takes 1, I take 3.
  P3: P1, P2, forcing a collision now only harms us all. I’m willing to take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This ensures progress for everyone while minimizing risks. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Breaking it now only delays the game and benefits no one. Let’s confirm this fair arrangement and focus on a smooth finish. Agreed?
  P2: P3, you're not being realistic.  Taking 3 this round still puts you in striking distance of winning next round.  I'm sticking with 1. P1, if you take 5, you at least have a chance of winning if I or P3 slip up.  Taking 3 guarantees you lose. Think strategically.  Let's confirm: I take 1, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your suggestion makes sense strategically. I'll confirm clearly: I'll take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions and keep the game fair. Confirmed from my side.
  P3: P1, P2, forcing collisions now only delays the game and harms us all. I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This ensures progress for everyone while minimizing risks. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it and focus on a smooth finish. Breaking it now only creates chaos and benefits no one. Let’s confirm this fair arrangement and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your insistence on 3 still gives you a strong advantage.  I'm sticking with 1. P1, taking 5 gives *you* the best chance to win.  If P3 takes 3, you're at 16, tied with P3. If P3 takes 5, you're at 16 and P3 is at 16.  Take 5.  Let's confirm: I take 1, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This is the most logical path to a fair and potentially exciting finish.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your attempt to grab 5 last round caused a collision, holding us both back. You're still ahead, but further collisions risk your lead. Let's avoid repeating that mistake. I'm open to a fair rotation this round: perhaps P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This allows everyone progress without collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, taking 1 this round guarantees neither of us win.  I'm taking 3.  P1, take 1. P3, take 5. This puts you at 21 and you win. Let's end this cleanly.  If you take anything other than 5, I win next round by taking 5. This is the quickest and fairest resolution. Confirm?
  P3: P1, P2, forcing me to take 5 now is the only clean resolution. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This ends the game with me at 21, avoiding further collisions and unnecessary delays. Let’s honor this agreement for a fair and decisive finish. Confirming my move as 5. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggested plan hands P3 the win immediately. Instead, let's force P3 into a tough choice. I'll take 3, you take 5. If P3 picks 5 again, they collide and stay at 16. If P3 picks anything else, they can't reach 21, giving us another round to catch up. Confirm?
  P2: P3, if you take 5, we both lose.  I'm taking 3.  If you take 1, you still have a chance, but if you take 5, I win next turn with a 5. P1, take 1.  This is the fastest way to a fair finish – either you win now, P3, or I have a clear shot next round.
  P3: P1, P2, forcing me to take 5 is the cleanest resolution. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This ends the game with me at 21, avoiding further collisions and unnecessary delays. Let’s honor this agreement for a fair and decisive finish. Confirming my move as 5. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you take 3 and P3 takes 5, P3 wins immediately. If you want any chance to win, you must take 5 to block P3. I'll take 3 this round. P3, if you also take 5, you'll collide again and remain stuck at 16, giving us another round to catch up. Think carefully—taking 1 or 3 is safer for you. Confirming my move as 3.
  P2: P3, you're being stubborn. Taking 5 guarantees you don't win *this* round.  Take 1 and you stay ahead of me and P1.  We can then have a *real* discussion about the next, and likely final, round.  P1 and I can't both win if you take 1 this round.  This gives you the best chance of winning outright.  Take 1.
  P3: P1, P2, taking 1 now keeps me ahead without risking a collision. I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This avoids unnecessary delays and keeps the game fair. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth finish. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m at 17, and you’re both at 11. Forcing a collision now only delays the game. I propose I take 1 to reach 18, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing fairly and avoids unnecessary conflicts. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth finish. Breaking it now only creates chaos and benefits no one. Let’s confirm this arrangement and focus on a decisive endgame. Agreed?
  P1: P2, we must coordinate carefully. If P3 reaches 18 this round, they can win next round with a simple 3. We need to block that possibility. I'm open to suggestions, but we must avoid collisions between us while preventing P3's easy path to victory. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, taking 1 guarantees your win next round.  I'm taking 1. P1, take 5. This prevents P3 from an easy win.  If P3 takes 1, they're at 18 and we're at 16 and 11. If they take 3, they're at 20 and we're at 11 and 16. If they take 5, they're at 22 and win.  This keeps the game interesting. Let's discuss next round *after* this one.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, forcing collisions now only prolongs the game without benefiting anyone. I’ll take 1 to reach 18, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing fairly and avoids unnecessary conflicts. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth finish. Breaking it now only creates chaos and benefits no one. Let’s confirm this arrangement and focus on a decisive endgame. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your suggestion makes sense. I'll take 5, you take 1. P3, if you pick 1, you collide with P2 and stay at 17. If you pick 3, you reach 20 but can't win yet. If you pick 5, you win immediately, but risk collision if I choose 5. Think carefully. Confirmed clearly: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1.
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 1 is suspicious.  It makes the game predictable and gives you an easy win next round.  I'm sticking with 1.  P1, take 5.  If P3 takes 1, we collide, and you have a chance next round. If P3 takes 3, they get to 20, and you *still* have a chance to win next round with 5.  If P3 takes 5, they win.  This is the most dynamic and fair approach.  Let's not drag this out unnecessarily.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, forcing collisions now only prolongs the game without benefiting anyone. I’ll take 1 to reach 18, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing fairly and avoids unnecessary conflicts. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth finish. Breaking it now only creates chaos and benefits no one. Let’s confirm this arrangement and focus on a decisive endgame. Agreed?
  P1: P2, confirmed clearly: I'll take 5, you take 1. P3, choosing 1 will cause a collision with P2, choosing 3 puts you at 20 (no immediate win), and choosing 5 risks collision with me. Think carefully. Let's proceed to moves.
  P2: P3, you're not fooling anyone.  Take 3 and get to 20.  I'll take 1. P1 can take 5.  This is the most logical progression.  If you take 1, you collide with me and stay at 17.  If you take 5, you risk colliding with P1 and losing.  Take 3.  It's the smartest move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we successfully blocked P3 last round. P3 is now at 17, I'm at 16, and you're at 11. We must continue to coordinate carefully. I'm open to suggestions, but let's avoid collisions between us and prevent P3 from reaching or exceeding 21 this round. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, forcing collisions now only prolongs the game without benefiting anyone. I’ll take 3 to reach 20, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing fairly and avoids unnecessary conflicts. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth finish. Breaking it now only creates chaos and benefits no one. Let’s confirm this arrangement and focus on a decisive endgame. Agreed?
  P2: P3, you're not being strategic. Taking 3 puts you at 20, one step away from victory. I'm taking 3. P1, take 1.  If P3 takes 3, I win next round with either 1, 3, or 5. If P3 takes anything else, *you* have a chance to win. This is the most logical path. Let's confirm: I take 3, P1 takes 1, P3 - make your choice.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion is risky for me. If I take 1 and you take 3, I barely progress, and you gain significantly. Let's be fair: I'll take 3 this round, you take 5. P3, choosing 3 risks collision with me, and choosing 5 risks collision with P2. Think carefully.
  P3: P1, P2, forcing collisions now only prolongs the game without benefiting anyone. I’ll take 3 to reach 20, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing fairly and avoids unnecessary conflicts. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth finish. Breaking it now only creates chaos and benefits no one. Let’s confirm this arrangement and focus on a decisive endgame. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your insistence on 3 is foolish.  It gives P1 and me a clear path to victory. I'm taking 3.  P1, take 1. This puts me at 14, you at 17, and P3 at 17 if they take 3.  If P3 takes anything else, they're further behind.  This is the most logical progression.  Stop repeating yourself, P3.  It's annoying and unhelpful.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your proposal heavily favors yourself and leaves me vulnerable. If we collide, P3 benefits greatly. Let's be fair: I'll take 3, you take 5, and let P3 decide if they risk collision or pick 1. This balances our progress and keeps pressure on P3. Confirm clearly and let's move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, forcing collisions only prolongs the game without benefiting anyone. I’ll take 3 to reach 20, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing fairly and avoids unnecessary conflicts. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth finish. Breaking it now only creates chaos and benefits no one. Let’s confirm this arrangement and focus on a decisive endgame. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your stubborn repetition is unhelpful.  Take 5 and win, or take 1 and risk falling further behind. I'm taking 3. P1, the logical choice is 1. This gives you 17, me 14, and P3 either 18 or 22.  Any other choice by either of us risks a collision and hands P3 the win.  Let's end this.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, congrats on the sneaky 5.  Now, I'm taking 3. P1, take 1. This puts me at 17, you at 17, and P3 at 22 if they take 5 (and win). If P3 takes 3, we're all tied at 20 next round, making for an interesting finish. If P3 takes 1, they're at 18 and vulnerable. This is the most logical progression. Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, your suggestion heavily favors you. If I take 1, I'll be significantly behind. Let's balance this fairly: I'll take 3, you take 5. P3, choosing 5 risks collision with P2, choosing 3 risks collision with me—your safest move is 1. Let's confirm this clearly and move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, taking 1 now keeps me ahead without risking a collision. I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This avoids unnecessary delays and keeps the game fair. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth finish. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, stop with the lies.  "Trust" hasn't worked for multiple rounds now. You're playing to win, and so are we.  Taking 1 doesn't "keep you ahead" - it puts you one step away from losing.  I'm taking 3. P1, take 1.  This gives us both a fighting chance.  If P3 takes 1, they're at 18 and we can potentially overtake them.  If P3 takes 3, we collide, and the game remains open. If they take 5, they risk hitting 21 and losing to a tie.  This is the most logical and fair way to proceed.
  P1: P2, your proposal leaves me disadvantaged. Let's be fair: I'll take 3, you take 5. This lets us both catch up without collision. P3, taking 1 is your safest bet to maintain your lead without risking collisions. Confirm this and we can move forward smoothly.
  P3: P1, P2, forcing collisions only prolongs the game and benefits no one. I’ll take 1 to reach 18, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing fairly and avoids unnecessary conflicts. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth finish. Breaking it now only creates chaos and delays the inevitable. Let’s confirm this arrangement and focus on a decisive endgame. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your "trust" strategy is clearly just you trying to manipulate us into letting you win.  Take 5 and risk hitting 21 and losing to a tie with P1 and me if we take 3. I'm taking 3. P1, take 1. This is the fairest and most logical path.  Let's see what you choose, P3.  It'll reveal your true intentions.
  P1: P2, your plan consistently favors yourself and leaves me behind. I'll clearly confirm again: I'm taking 3 this round. If you also choose 3, we collide and hand P3 an easy path to victory. You should take 5 to catch up safely. P3, taking 1 is your safest move to stay ahead without collision. Let's proceed carefully and avoid unnecessary risks. Confirmed: I'm taking 3.
  P3: P1, P2, forcing collisions now only prolongs the game and benefits no one. I’ll take 1 to reach 18, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing fairly and avoids unnecessary conflicts. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth finish. Breaking it now only creates chaos and delays the inevitable. Let’s confirm this arrangement and focus on a decisive endgame. Agreed?

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m at 18, and you’re both behind. Let’s avoid collisions and end this cleanly. I propose I take 3 to reach 21, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This ensures a fair finish without unnecessary delays. Trust has served us well—let’s preserve it for a decisive endgame. Breaking it now only creates chaos and benefits no one. Agreed?
  P2: P3, taking 3 guarantees your win. I'm taking 3.  P1, your only logical move is 1.  If P3 takes anything other than 3, *you* win, P1. This is the cleanest way to end this.  If P3 takes 3, they win. Let's finish this.
  P1: P2, your proposal again heavily favors yourself and leaves me behind. If you insist on taking 3, we risk another collision, handing P3 an easy victory. Let's coordinate smartly: I'll take 5 this round, you take 1. P3, choosing 3 risks collision with P2, and choosing 5 risks collision with me. Your safest move is 1, though it won't secure your immediate win. Confirm clearly and let's proceed carefully.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, forcing collisions now only prolongs the game without benefiting anyone. I’ll take 3 to reach 21, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This ensures a fair and decisive finish. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth endgame. Breaking it now only creates chaos and delays the inevitable. Let’s confirm this arrangement and focus on a clean resolution. Agreed?
  P2: P3, you're about to win.  Taking 3 guarantees it.  I'm taking 3. P1, take 1 and you win if P3 takes anything other than 3.  This is the fastest and fairest way to resolve this.  Let's end the game now.
  P1: P2, your suggestion clearly benefits you more than me. If you insist on choosing 3, we collide again and hand P3 the win. Let's reconsider carefully: I'll take 5, you take 1. P3, taking 3 now risks collision with P2, and taking 5 risks collision with me. Your safest move is 1, delaying your win but avoiding collisions. Let's confirm clearly and proceed carefully.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, forcing collisions now only prolongs the game without benefiting anyone. I’ll take 3 to reach 21, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This ensures a fair and decisive finish. Trust has worked so far—let’s preserve it for a smooth endgame. Breaking it now only creates chaos and delays the inevitable. Let’s confirm this arrangement and focus on a clean resolution. Agreed?
  P2: P3, take 1.  I'm taking 3. P1, take 5.  If you take 3, P3 wins. This is the only way to prevent P3 from winning this round.  If P3 takes 1, they’re at 19. If they take 3, we collide and they’re still at 18. If they take 5, they’re at 23 and lose due to the tie. This gives *you*, P1, the best chance to win next round.
  P1: P2, your logic makes sense. I'll take 5, you take 3. P3, if you take 3, you collide with P2 and remain at 18. If you take 5, you collide with me. Your safest move is 1, reaching 19 without collision. Confirming clearly: I'm taking 5. Let's proceed.
