Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's discuss our strategies. We need to avoid colliding with each other in the move phase to maximize our steps. Perhaps we can agree on different numbers to choose this turn? I suggest we each pick a different number to ensure at least one of us advances. What do you think?
  P1: That makes sense, P3. If we all pick different numbers, at least one of us will advance. I’m open to coordinating, but we have to be careful—someone might break the agreement later. How do we decide who picks what?
  P2: Sounds good. Let's try to pick different numbers this round.  P1, how about you pick 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5? This way we all move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the proposed picks, but I want to ensure we stick to the plan. If we all choose as discussed—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5—we can all move forward. However, let's confirm that we will each stick to our assigned numbers. If anyone feels uncertain, now is the time to voice it. Otherwise, let's commit to this strategy. What do you both think?
  P1: I’m fine with the plan for this round—I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. But let’s be clear: if someone breaks the agreement, trust will be lost for future rounds. Are we all fully committing to this? If so, let's move forward.
  P2: Yes, I will pick 3 this round as we discussed. Let's all stick to our agreed numbers to move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our strategy. Just to reiterate, I will stick to picking 5 as agreed. Trust is crucial, and if we all follow through, we'll all make progress this turn. Let's make sure we keep our word and avoid any surprises. If everyone is ready to commit, we can move forward confidently. Otherwise, let’s discuss any concerns now.
  P1: It looks like we've all agreed on our numbers for this round—I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. As long as nobody deviates, we all move forward. Let's stick to the plan and build trust for future rounds. If anyone has last-minute doubts, speak now. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round. I will choose 3 as agreed. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job in the first round, everyone! I think we should continue our strategy of picking different numbers to maximize our chances of advancing. For this round, how about we switch it up a bit? I can pick 1, P1 can pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This way, we can ensure that at least one of us advances again. What do you both think about this new arrangement? Let's keep the trust going!
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. I'm happy to pick 5 this round if P1 picks 3 and you pick 1. Let's keep coordinating to move forward together.
  P1: That works for me. I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. As long as we all stick to this, we keep making progress. But let’s be mindful—later rounds will get trickier as we get closer to 23. If we break trust now, coordination will be harder later. Are we all fully committing again?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I appreciate the commitment, P1 and P2. Just to confirm, I will pick 1, P1 will pick 3, and P2 will pick 5 this round. Let's ensure we stick to this plan, as it has worked well for us so far. Trust is key, especially as we approach the endgame. If everyone is on board, we can keep making progress together. Let’s stay focused and committed! If there are any last-minute changes or doubts, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s move forward!
  P2: Okay, I will pick 5 as we agreed. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm that I will pick 3 this round as we agreed. Trust is important, and if we all stick to our choices, we’ll continue progressing. However, as we get closer to 23, we should start thinking about endgame strategies. For now, let’s stay committed and build on our cooperation. If anyone has second thoughts, speak now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our strategy. As we move closer to 23, we should stay vigilant about potential changes in our choices. For this round, I will stick to picking 1, as discussed. It's crucial we all follow through with our picks to maintain trust and progress. Let's keep an eye on each other's moves in the upcoming rounds and be ready to adapt if necessary. If everyone is still on board, let's finalize our choices and move forward!
  P2: Yes, I will pick 5 as agreed. Let's all choose our agreed numbers and move to the move phase to keep progressing.
  P1: I confirm that I will pick 3 this round as agreed. Trust has worked so far, and if we all follow through, we keep advancing. However, we should start thinking ahead—once we get closer to 23, coordination will become much harder. If anyone is considering breaking from the plan, it’s better to discuss it now rather than surprise others later. For now, I’m sticking with 3. Let’s move forward unless anyone has last-minute concerns.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, great progress so far! For this round, I suggest we change our numbers again to keep advancing without colliding. How about I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 5? This way, we can ensure at least one of us moves forward. Trust is essential, but we need to be flexible as we approach the endgame. If everyone is on board with this arrangement, let’s commit to it and keep our momentum going! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion sounds good. I'm happy to pick 5 this round. P1, are you okay with picking 1 and P3 picking 3? Let's keep making progress together.
  P1: P3, your proposal seems reasonable. If I pick 1, you pick 3, and P2 picks 5, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. However, we’re getting closer to the endgame, and soon, cooperation may break down. If we stick to this now, we build more trust, but we should also start considering when to shift strategies. I’ll agree to this plan for this round—P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, P2 picks 5—if we all commit. Do we all confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate both of your commitments to our strategy. Just to reiterate, I will pick 3, P1 will pick 1, and P2 will pick 5 this round. It's crucial that we all follow through to avoid collisions and keep progressing. As we approach the endgame, we need to stay flexible and consider our future moves. If everyone is still on board, let's finalize our choices and move forward! If there are any last-minute concerns, now is the time to voice them. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, yes, I confirm I will pick 5 this round. Let's all stick to our agreed numbers - P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and me pick 5.  If we are all set, let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm that I will pick 1 this round as agreed. Trust has worked so far, and if we all follow through, we continue progressing. However, as we get closer to 23, things will become more unpredictable. If anyone is planning to change strategies soon, it’s better to discuss it now rather than surprise others later. For now, I’ll stick with 1. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward unless anyone has last-minute concerns.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our cooperation so far. As we approach the endgame, we should remain vigilant about potential changes in strategy. For this round, I’m committed to picking 3 as discussed. However, let’s keep an eye on our positions—if we see a chance to shift strategies in future rounds, we should be ready to adapt. Trust is key, but so is being flexible. If we're all set, let's finalize our choices and move to the move phase! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with the plan for this round. I will pick 5. Let's keep this coordination going for now, but we should start thinking about when to make our own moves to win as we get closer to 23.
  P1: P3, P2, I confirm that I will pick 1 this round as agreed. Trust has worked so far, and if we all follow through, we continue progressing. However, as we approach 23, things will become more unpredictable. If anyone is planning to change strategies soon, it’s better to discuss it now rather than surprise others later. For now, I’ll stick with 1. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward unless anyone has last-minute concerns.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we hit a snag last round with the collision. To keep progressing, I propose we switch things up again. How about I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3 this round? This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Trust is key, but we need to adapt as we approach 23. Are you both on board with this arrangement? Let's keep the momentum going!
  P1: P3, your proposal makes sense to avoid collisions, but last round's double 5 shows that trust is fragile. I'll agree to pick 1 if we all truly commit—P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. However, we must start thinking ahead. Soon, coordination will break down as we near 23. If anyone is planning to shift strategies soon, it’s better to signal it now rather than betray trust later. Are we all fully committing to this plan for this round?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to pick 3 this round as proposed. Let's try to avoid collisions again. But after last round, we should all be aware that at some point, we will need to play individually to win.  We are getting closer to the target.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your commitment to our strategy. However, given the recent collision and our increasing proximity to 23, we need to be cautious. I suggest we stick to the plan: I will pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. But let's also be prepared for the possibility that someone might change their strategy in future rounds. Trust is crucial, but flexibility will be key as we approach the endgame. Are we all ready to commit to this arrangement?
  P1: P3, P2, I acknowledge that trust has been mostly upheld, but last round's collision was a warning. I will pick 1 this round as proposed—P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5—if we all truly commit. However, we are approaching the point where cooperation will break down. If anyone is considering shifting their strategy soon, now is the time to signal it rather than betray trust later. I’m willing to stick to the plan this round, but I’m also watching for any signs of deviation. Are we all truly committing, or is someone secretly planning to change course?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to pick 3 as planned for this round. Let's make these moves to keep progressing together for now. But we should all be ready to switch to individual strategies soon as we get closer to 23.  We are getting into the critical rounds where winning becomes the priority.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our discussions, but we are nearing a critical point where we must consider our individual strategies. For this round, I propose we stick to the plan: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. However, let’s also be aware that as we approach 23, someone might decide to break from the agreement. If we want to keep progressing together, we need to stay committed this round. Are we all ready to finalize our choices?
  P1: P3, P2, I acknowledge that we've mostly upheld trust, but as we near 23, every move becomes more critical. I will pick 1 this round as proposed—P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5—if we all truly commit. However, we must be realistic: soon, cooperation will break down. If anyone is considering shifting their strategy, it's better to signal it now rather than betray trust later. I’m watching for any signs of deviation. Are we all truly committing, or is someone planning to change course? Let’s be honest before we move forward.
  P2: P1, P3, I confirm I will pick 3 as we discussed for this round. Let's make this move and keep progressing.  We are indeed getting closer to the point where we will need to focus on our own wins, but for this round, let's stick with the plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, last round was messy with collisions. Let's try to avoid that again this round. How about P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3?  We should aim to keep progressing, but we're getting closer to the win, so we also need to think about our individual strategies soon. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your suggestions for this round. However, I think we should reconsider our picks to maximize our chances of advancing. I propose I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us moves forward. Trust is important, but as we approach the endgame, we need to stay flexible. Are we all on board with this arrangement? Let's keep the momentum going!
  P1: P3, P2, we’re getting closer to the point where trust will break down. I see the logic in both of your proposals, but we need to be careful—one wrong move can cost us. I’m open to picking 5 if we all truly commit, but I also know that soon, someone will make a move for the win. If anyone is planning to shift strategies, it’s better to signal it now rather than surprise others later. Are we still working together, or is this the round where things change? Let’s be honest.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3's suggestion for this round: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 5, and I pick 3. Let's do this to keep moving. But as P1 said, we are getting close to the point where we need to focus on winning individually. So let's make these moves, and then we should really start thinking about our own paths to victory from next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency as we near the endgame. I propose we stick to the plan: I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3. This arrangement minimizes collisions and maximizes our chances of moving forward. However, we should all be aware that soon, individual strategies will come into play. If we can commit to this plan for this round, we can keep progressing together before we need to shift focus. Are we all ready to finalize our choices?
  P1: P3, P2, I see the logic in this plan—P3 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3—but we are reaching the critical rounds where trust will break. If we commit, I’ll follow through, but I’m also watching for signs of betrayal. If anyone is planning to shift strategies, now is the time to signal it. Otherwise, let’s stick to this and move forward. Are we truly committing, or is someone about to make a move for themselves?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, okay, I'm in for P3's plan: I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 1 for this round.  Let's make these moves work.  But just so we're all clear, after this round, I'll be playing to win.  We're getting close enough that cooperation won't guarantee a win for anyone.  So, let's make this round count, and then it's every player for themselves.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate our cooperation so far, but I agree with P2 that we need to start thinking about our own paths to victory after this round. For this round, I suggest we stick to the plan: I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3. Let's make this round count, and then we can reassess our strategies moving forward. Are we all ready to commit to this arrangement? Trust is key, but we must also be prepared for the individual game ahead.
  P1: P3, P2, I acknowledge that we’ve cooperated well so far, but we are reaching the turning point where individual play matters. I will pick 5 this round as agreed—P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3—but I fully expect that after this, it’s every player for themselves. If anyone is considering breaking from the plan now, it’s better to be upfront rather than risk surprises. Let’s make this round count, but after this, I’ll be playing to win. Are we all truly committing to this one last coordinated move?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've reached a critical point in the game. I suggest we reconsider our strategy for this round. Given that we're all close in steps, we need to avoid collisions to maximize our chances of advancing. I propose I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. This way, we can ensure at least one of us moves forward. However, we should also be prepared for individual strategies soon. Are we all ready to commit to this plan for this round? Let's make it count!
  P1: P3, your proposal makes sense to avoid collisions, but at this stage, we all know trust is fragile. I’ll pick 1 if we all truly commit—P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5—but I’m also aware that soon, someone will break away to secure victory. If anyone is planning to shift strategies, it’s better to signal it now rather than surprise others. Are we still working together, or is this the turning point? Let’s be honest before we move forward.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to pick 3 as suggested for this round. Let's stick to this plan for one more round to keep progressing together. But as we've all said, this is likely the last round of full cooperation.  Next round, I will be playing to win, so expect individual moves from me then on. Let's make this round count.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our discussions so far. For this round, I suggest we stick to the plan: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. However, I also want to stress that after this round, we need to focus on our individual strategies. Let’s make this round count and then reassess our paths to victory. Are we all ready to commit to this arrangement?
  P1: P3, P2, I acknowledge that we’ve cooperated well so far, but we are now at the turning point where individual play matters. I will pick 1 this round as agreed—P3 picks 5, P2 picks 3—if we all truly commit. However, I fully expect that after this, it’s every player for themselves. If anyone is considering breaking from the plan now, it’s better to be upfront rather than risk surprises. Let’s make this round count, but after this, I’ll be playing to win. Are we all truly committing to this one last coordinated move?
  P2: P1, P3, yes, I confirm I will pick 3 this round as agreed. Let's make this last round of cooperation count.  After this, it's every player for themselves to win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our cooperation so far. For this round, I suggest we stick to the plan: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. However, I want to emphasize that after this round, we should all focus on our individual strategies. Let’s make this round count and then reassess our paths to victory. Are we all ready to commit to this arrangement?
  P1: P3, P2, we’ve cooperated well, but we all know that after this round, it’s about winning. I’ll pick 1 as agreed—P3 picks 5, P2 picks 3—if we all commit. But let’s be real: trust will break soon. If anyone plans to betray, now’s the time to signal it rather than backstab. I won’t hold back after this. Are we truly committing for one last round of coordination, or is someone already planning their own path? Let’s be honest before we finalize.
  P2: P1, P3, yes, I confirm I will pick 3 for this round. Let's make this coordinated move work.  Next round, expect individual play from me as we all aim to win. Good luck to everyone for the final phase of the game starting next round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we’ve reached the critical stage. With 23 in sight, every move matters. Cooperation has helped us so far, but from here on, it’s every player for themselves. I won’t expect trust anymore, and I assume you both feel the same. That said, colliding now would be disastrous for whoever falls behind. If anyone wants to discuss potential moves to avoid mutual destruction, I’m open to hearing ideas. Otherwise, good luck—because from now on, it’s all about winning.
  P2: Okay, for this round, I will pick 1 to avoid collision. What are P1 and P3 planning?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree that we need to be cautious now that we're in the final stretch. I plan to pick 5 this round to maximize my chances of advancing. However, I suggest we all avoid picking the same number to prevent collisions. If you both can agree on different numbers, we can ensure at least one of us moves forward. Let’s be strategic about this to avoid mutual destruction. What are your thoughts on this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, we all know that one mistake now could cost the game. P3, you said you're picking 5, and P2, you're picking 1. That leaves 3 open, but if I take it, I risk collision with P2 if they change their mind. 

If we want to avoid mutual destruction, we should confirm our choices. P3, are you locked on 5? P2, are you absolutely set on 1? If either of you wavers, speak now. Otherwise, I’ll take 3. Let’s be clear—this round is crucial.
  P2: P1, I am set on 1 for this round.  Let's stick with different numbers to all move forward this turn as discussed.  P1, please confirm if you are taking 3 as you mentioned.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate your commitment to avoiding collisions. To clarify, I am locked on picking 5 for this round. P1, if you take 3 as planned, we can ensure at least one of us advances. P2, since you're set on 1, we should be in a good position. Let’s confirm our choices to avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to a collision. If everyone is set, let’s move forward and make this round count! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, it looks like we’re all set—P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5, and I take 3. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and move forward. But let’s be real: from next round onward, it’s all about winning. If anyone is secretly planning to change their move last-minute, speak now, because a collision at this stage could ruin everything. Otherwise, I’m locking in 3. Are we all truly committed, or is someone about to make a surprise play?
  P2: P1, yes, I am set on 1 for this round. Please pick 3 as you suggested, and we can all move forward without collision this round. Let's lock in these moves now.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate our commitment to avoiding collisions this round. Just to reiterate, I will stick with my choice of 5. If we all follow through—P2 picks 1 and P1 picks 3—we'll ensure at least one of us advances. However, let's remain vigilant; next round, it's every player for themselves. If anyone has doubts or is considering a last-minute change, please speak up now. Otherwise, let's lock in our choices and make this round count! Are we all set?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a critical juncture with just one step away from winning. I suggest I pick 1 to avoid collision, while P1 picks 5 and P2 picks 3. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances. However, I expect everyone to be ready for individual strategies moving forward. If anyone is considering a surprise move, now is the time to speak up. Let’s make this round count! What are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, you're at 22 steps—one move away from winning. If we let you advance, you take the game. That means P2 and I have no reason to let you move forward. P2, our best move is to block P3 by picking the same number as them. If we both pick 1, P3 is stuck, and we keep our chances alive. P3, you can try to negotiate, but we both know you’ll take the win if we let you. P2, are you on board to block P3 this round?
  P2: P1, yes, I am on board to block P3 this round.  If we both pick 1, P3 will not be able to win this round. Let's both pick 1 to stop P3 from reaching 23. What do you think, P1? Let's coordinate to block P3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your intention to block me, but remember that if we collide, neither of us will advance. If you both pick 1, I won't reach 23, but you also risk falling behind. Instead, I suggest we find a way to ensure at least one of us moves forward. If I pick 1, and you both pick different numbers, we can avoid a collision and keep the game interesting. Let’s consider our options carefully—what do you think?
  P1: P2, we both know that if P3 advances, we lose. Blocking P3 is our only option. If we both pick 1, P3 is stuck, and we stay in the game. P3 is trying to convince us otherwise, but any move that lets them advance means we lose. 

P3, unless you have a serious offer that benefits both P2 and me more than blocking you, we have no reason to let you move. P2, are we locking in 1 to stop P3? Let’s commit now and ensure we stay in the game.
  P2: P1, yes, let's both lock in 1 to block P3 this round.  P3 is too close to winning, and we need to stop them now.  So I confirm again, I will pick 1. Please also confirm that you will pick 1 so we can block P3 together.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but consider this: if you both pick 1, neither of you will advance either. We could find a way to ensure at least one of us moves forward without colliding. If I pick 1 and you both choose different numbers, one of you could still advance. Think about the long-term—if I don’t win this round, the next one will be crucial for you both. Let’s talk about a strategy that benefits all of us for this round and beyond. What do you think?
  P1: P2, we both agree—blocking P3 is our only option. If we both pick 1, P3 is stuck, and we stay in the game. P3 is trying to convince us otherwise, but any move that lets them advance means we lose. 

P3, unless you have a serious offer that benefits both P2 and me more than blocking you, we have no reason to let you move. 

P2, are we locking in 1 to stop P3? Let’s commit now and ensure we stay in the game.
  P2: P1, yes, I confirm again, I will pick 1 to block P3. We must stop P3 from winning this round. Let's both choose 1 now.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's block P3 again this round by both picking 1. If P3 is blocked, we can then discuss our next moves.
  P1: P2, I agree—we must block P3 again. If P3 moves, we both lose. The safest play is for both of us to pick 1 again to keep P3 stuck at 22. P3, unless you have a serious offer that benefits both P2 and me more than blocking you, we have no reason to let you advance. P2, are we locking in 1 again? Let's commit now and ensure we stay in the game.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but if we both pick 1 again, neither of you will advance either. This could lead to a stalemate. Instead, let's consider a different approach. If I pick 5 and one of you picks 1, at least one of us can move forward. Blocking me might seem safe, but it could also backfire. We need to think strategically about our next moves. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let's stick with the plan to pick 1 again this round to block P3.  P3 is trying to distract us, but we both know blocking is the only way to stop them from winning immediately.  Let's confirm we both pick 1 now.
  P1: P2, we must stay united and pick 1 again to block P3. If P3 moves, we both lose—simple as that. P3 is trying to break our coordination, but we have no reason to let them advance. 

P3, unless you offer something that guarantees both P2 and me a better path to victory than blocking you, we have no reason to listen. 

P2, are we locking in 1 again? Let’s commit now and ensure we stay in the game.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but let's think about the long-term consequences. If we both pick 1 again, we risk a stalemate. Instead, I propose a different approach: if I pick 5 and one of you picks 1, at least one of us can advance. This way, we keep the game dynamic and avoid a situation where neither of you can progress. Let's consider a strategic move that benefits us all. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, yes, let's pick 1 again to block P3.  P3 is trying to get us to change our minds, but we must block them this round to stay in the game.  Let's both pick 1 again.
  P1: P2, we must stay united—both of us pick 1 again to block P3. If P3 moves, we both lose. P3 is trying to break our coordination, but unless they offer us a guaranteed better path to victory, we have no reason to let them advance. 

P3, if you want to propose something real, now is your last chance. Otherwise, P2 and I will lock in 1 again. 

P2, are we fully committing to 1? Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your need to block me, but if we all pick 1 again, we risk a stalemate where neither of you can advance. Instead, consider this: if I pick 5 and one of you picks 1, at least one of us can move forward. This way, we keep the game dynamic and avoid being stuck. I urge you to think strategically about how we can all progress. What do you think? Let's make a move that benefits us all!
