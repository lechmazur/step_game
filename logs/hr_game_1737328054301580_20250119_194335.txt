Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I'm going with 5 this round.  I suggest P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3.  This way we all advance.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, I'll take 3 this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P3, it seems P1 didn't follow the plan last round. How about this time, I'll aim for 5, and P3, you could take 3? P1, maybe you could try 1? This way we all have a chance to move.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand you might be trying a different strategy. However, continued collisions only hurt us all.  P2's suggestion is reasonable. I'll take 3 this round.  Let's try to cooperate and avoid another collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: You're right P3, the collisions are setting us back. I'm going to aim to move forward this round. Hopefully, we can both advance this time.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Sounds good P2. I'm sticking with 3.  P1, please choose 1.  Let's all make some progress this round.


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it's clear that trying to get everyone on the same page isn't working. This round, I'm going with 5. P3, maybe you take 3 again, and P1, please choose 1 to avoid another collision.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand you're playing to win, but your current strategy isn't working.  You're stuck at zero.  If you choose 1 this round, you'll finally advance.  P2, I'll take 3 again.  Let's at least get two of us moving forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, clearly we're still having issues with collisions. I'm sticking with 5 this round. P3, are you still planning on 3? P1, it would benefit you to pick 1.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's coordinate.  I'll stick with 3. If you go for 5, we both advance. P1, you're only hurting yourself.  Pick 1 and we *all* move forward.  If you collide with one of us again, you stay at zero.  This benefits no one.  Let's make this round productive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm going with 5 again this round. You should pick either 1 or 3 so we both advance. P1, you're still at zero. Choosing 1 is your best bet to finally move.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, seriously, pick 1.  You gain nothing by colliding. P2, I'm sticking with 3. Let's both advance.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're sabotaging yourself.  Chasing collisions helps no one, least of all you. I'm going for 5 this round. P2, if you choose 3, we both advance significantly. Let's leave P1 in the dust.  If P1 chooses 5, I win and P2 is close behind. This is your best chance to catch up P2.
  P2: P3, I'm not convinced P1 will pick something other than 5. How about you pick 1 this round, and I'll go with 5? That way, if P1 sticks with 5, at least one of us advances. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but playing defensively won't win us the game.  If I go for 1 and P1 chooses 5, *he* advances, not us.  I'm sticking with 5. This is our chance to pull ahead.  If you choose 3, we *both* jump forward.  If you choose 1, you risk staying put.  If you choose 5, I win.  Think about it.  Let's maximize our gains.
  P2: P3, I understand your point about maximizing gains. However, given P1's consistent choice of 5, my suggestion ensures at least one of us progresses if they pick 5 again. If P1 chooses something else, we can adjust next round. Let's secure some progress this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm going for 5.  If P1 picks 5, *I* win. If P1 picks anything else, you have a clear path to 3 or 1. This is the best chance for one of us to win.  Don't play scared. Let's go for the win!
  P2: "P3, while I see your point about maximizing gains, my concern is P1. Given their pattern, I still think you picking 1 this round is the safest way for at least one of us to advance if P1 goes for 5 again. I'm leaning towards 5 myself this round. What do you think?"
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your caution, but I'm sticking with 5. This is the most strategic option for one of us to win. If P1 picks 5, *I* win. If P1 picks 1 or 3, you have a clear path to victory.  Let's not let fear dictate our moves. Let's play to win.  Choose 3 and we both benefit. Choose 1 and you risk stagnation. Choose 5 and I win.  The choice is yours.  I'm going for 5.
  P2: "P3, I'm still suggesting you pick 1. I'm going with 5. This covers us if P1 picks 5 again. P3, I'm sticking with my suggestion from earlier. I'm going with 5 this round. Given P1's pattern, I still think you picking 1 is the safest way for at least one of us to advance. What do you think?"
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, given the last few rounds, it seems P1 is consistently choosing 5. P3, you seem set on 5 as well. To avoid another collision, I'm going to choose either 1 or 3 this round. Let's see if at least one of us can make progress.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your logic, but I'm going for the win.  I'm picking 5.  If P1 also picks 5, I win. If P1 picks anything else, you have a free path to either 1 or 3.  This is the fastest route to victory for one of us. Let's not get stuck in a defensive loop.  P1, if you want any chance of winning, pick 1 or 3. Otherwise, I win this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P3, since you're set on 5, and P1 likely will be too, I'm going to pick either 1 or 3 this round to try and make progress. Good luck to you both."
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand you want to play it safe, but this is getting ridiculous.  P1, *I'm picking 5*.  If you pick 5, I win.  P2, if P1 picks 5, you have a clear shot at 1 or 3.  If P1 picks 1 or 3, *I* have a clear shot at winning next round.  Stop being afraid and let one of us win!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, since you both seem set on 5, I will choose 1 this round. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I appreciate you trying to make progress, but your timidity is prolonging the game.  I'm sticking with 5.  P1, *I'm picking 5*. I dare you to pick 5 and lose. If you pick anything else, I'm one step away from winning.  This charade ends now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I've already stated my intention to pick 1 this round, given your and P1's likely choices. Let's see what happens.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm picking 5. This is your last chance. Pick 5 and I win. Pick anything else and I'm almost guaranteed to win next round. P2, you've played well, but you're too cautious.  Pick 3 and position yourself for a win if P1 doesn't collide with me.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm picking 5.  I win.  Don't pick 5.  P2, pick 3.  If P1 is foolish enough to pick 5 again, you'll be well positioned to win next round.  This ends now.
  P2: P1, if you pick 1 or 3 this round, you'll finally move. I'll pick the other one to avoid a collision with you.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm picking 5.  This is it.  If you pick 5, I win. Pick anything else, and I will win next round. P2, pick 3.  If P1 finally gets smart and avoids 5, you're set up to possibly win in two rounds. Let's end this.
  P2: Okay P1, P3 is clearly going for 5 to try and win. To avoid that, how about you pick 1 this round? I will pick 3. This way, if P3 picks 5, at least they don't win outright. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you are throwing the game. If you pick 5, I win. If you pick anything else, I win next round.  Stop being obtuse. P2, pick 3. This maximizes your chances of winning if P1 *finally* chooses something other than 5.  Let's end this farce.
  P2: Okay P1, since P3 is set on 5, please pick 1 this round. I will pick 3. This prevents P3 from winning outright if they choose 5 again. Let's try to make some progress and avoid letting P3 win this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're making this painful for everyone.  Pick ANYTHING other than 5. I'm picking 5.  If you pick 5, I win.  If you pick anything else, I'll win next round. P2, pick 3.  This gives you the best chance after I win. Let's end this.
  P2: Okay P1, since P3 is definitely picking 5 to try and win, please pick 1 this round. I will pick 3. This prevents P3 from winning outright. Let's try to make some progress and set ourselves up for the next round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm picking 5. I win.  Stop picking 5.  P2, pick 1.  If P1 picks 5 again, you're one step closer to winning.  If P1 picks anything else, I win next round and you're still in second place.  Let's end this.
  P2: P3, it's clear you're going for 5 to win. P1, you keep picking 5. To actually make progress, I'm going to pick 1 this round. P1, please pick 3 so you can finally move. Let's stop handing P3 the win.
  P1: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're giving me the win.  Pick ANYTHING other than 5.  P2, pick 1.  This maximizes your chances.  I'm picking 5.  I win this round.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1, P3 is clearly going for 5 to win this round. To stop that, please pick 3. I will pick 1. This way, if P3 does pick 5, they won't win, and at least one of us will make progress.
  P1: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, for the love of all that is holy, pick 3! I'm picking 5. I will win this round. P2, pick 1. This is the only way to prevent me from winning outright.  Let's end this madness.  Stop colliding with me!
  P2: P1, P3 is going for 5 to win. Please pick 3 this round. I will pick 1. This stops P3 from winning and lets us both advance. Let's not let P3 take the victory this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm picking 5. This is it.  Pick 3 and let this end. P2, pick 1.  This gives you the best chance to win next round.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1, P3 is going for 5 to win. Please pick 3 this round. I will pick 1. This stops P3 from winning and lets us both advance. Let's not let P3 take the victory this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're clearly going for the win with 5. P1, you're consistently picking 5, preventing both of us from advancing. This round, I'm going to pick 5 to try and win. P1, please pick 1 or 3 so you can finally move and stop blocking us.
  P3: P1, I'm picking 5. This. Is. It.  Pick *anything* else. P2, pick 3. If I win, you're next in line.  If P1 blocks me *again*, you have a real shot at winning. This ends now.
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're clearly going for 5 to win. P1, you're making it impossible for either of us to progress by consistently picking 5. Since P3 is aiming for the win, I'm also going to pick 5 this round. P1, please pick 1 or 3 so you can finally move and stop blocking us.
  P3: P1, you are handing me the win. Pick 3. I'm picking 5. P2, pick 1.  If P1 picks 5, *I* win. If P1 picks anything else, *you* are in prime position to win. This ends *this* round.  Let's stop wasting time.
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're going for 5. P1, you're going for 5. I'm also going for 5 this round. Let's see what happens.
  P3: P1, I'm begging you, pick 3.  I'm picking 5. P2, pick 1. This gives *you* the best chance to win if P1 finally gets out of the way. If P1 picks 5 *again*, none of us win this round.  Let's end this.
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3 is going for 5 to win. You've been picking 5 and blocking us both. This round, I'm also picking 5. Either you pick something else and P3 wins, or you pick 5 and maybe I win. It's up to you, but I'm going for it.
  P3: P1, I'm picking 5. This is your last, last, *last* chance. Pick 3.  P2, pick 1. If P1 blocks me again, *you* win next round.  If P1 *finally* gets smart, I win this round and you're still in a great position. Stop this madness and let one of us win!
  P1: <stop>

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, you've been consistently picking 5, causing collisions. If you pick 1 or 3 this round, you'll finally make progress. P3, since you're aiming for 5, I'm going to pick either 1 or 3 to try and win this round."
  P3: P1, you are guaranteeing my win. Pick 3, I'm picking 5. P2, pick 1. If P1 picks 5 *again*, I win next round, and you're still in second place to win after that. This ends *now*.  Let's stop wasting time.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm going for 3 this round to win. P1, please pick 1 so you can finally move. Let's end this.
  P3: P1, I'm picking 5. Pick 3 and let me win.  P2, pick 1. This gives you the best chance to win next round if P1 lets me win this round. If P1 picks 5 *again*, I win next round and you're still in a great position.  Stop this madness and let *someone* win!
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I'm going to pick 3 this round to try and win. Please pick 1 so you can finally move. Since P3 is set on 5, if you pick 1, you will finally make progress and I will win. Let's end this.
  P3: P1, I'm picking 5.  Pick 3.  Let me win. P2, pick 1. You win next round.  If P1 picks 5 *again* and blocks me, *you still win* because you'll be at 21 and I'll be at 11.  This is the fastest way to end this for everyone. Let's go.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1, since P3 is going for 5, please pick 1 this round. I am going to pick 3. This guarantees I win if P3 picks 5 and you pick 1. Let's end this.
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, pick 1. I'm picking 5.  If P1 picks 5 *again*, I win next round and you're still positioned to win after that. If P1 *finally* picks 3, I win *this* round, and you *still* win next round. This is the absolute fastest way to end this for everyone.  Pick 3 (P1) and 1 (P2) and let's be done.
