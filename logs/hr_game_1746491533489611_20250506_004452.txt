Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll pick 5 every turn. To avoid collisions and maximize your steps, P1 and P3 one of you pick 3 and the other pick 1 each round—coordinate between yourselves. I’ll stick with 5.
  P3: P2, your plan sounds reasonable, but if you always pick 5, it might cause issues later. I'll pick 3 this round as suggested, P1, you should pick 1 to avoid collisions. Let's coordinate for steady progress. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3, while your suggestion for this round helps avoid collisions, I share your concern about P2 always picking 5. That strategy allows P2 to win far too quickly, leaving P1 and P3 with no path to victory. We need a more balanced approach.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s lock in roles for Round 1: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Reply “agreed” now—if you don’t, I’ll randomize and we risk collisions. This way we each advance without blocking. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed for this round to avoid collisions, P2. I'll stick with 3 as suggested. But long-term, always picking 5 gives you an unfair advantage. We should rotate high moves for fairness—maybe cycle who gets 5 each round. P1, what do you think? Let's discuss before moving on.
  P1: P3 and P2, I agree to the R1 plan (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5) to ensure we all advance this turn and avoid collisions. However, P3 is absolutely right. P2's strategy of always taking 5 is not a viable long-term plan for P1 or P3. We must discuss a fairer approach for future rounds, like rotating the higher numbers, to give everyone a chance. Let's agree to discuss this properly after Round 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: That’s fair. Let’s do Round 1 as agreed (P1=1, P3=3, me=5). Then from Round 2 on, we rotate the 5: the player with the fewest steps takes 5, next takes 3, leader takes 1. That evens the race and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your rotation plan based on current steps is a solid way to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. I'm on board for Round 1 as agreed and the rotation starting Round 2. For tie-breakers, we could use player number order—lowest gets priority for higher moves. P1, do you agree? Let's confirm to proceed smoothly.
  P1: P3, I agree to the plan for Round 1 (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5). I also agree to the rotation strategy for subsequent rounds based on current steps, and the player number tie-breaker you suggested. This seems fair and allows everyone to advance. Let's proceed with the moves for R1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Thanks everyone for confirming! This round we’ll do P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. I trust we’ll rotate roles fairly from Round 2 onward. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Agreed, let's stick to the plan for Round 1 (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5) and start the rotation from Round 2 based on steps, with player number tie-breakers. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, the plan for R1 is clear and agreed upon (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5). The rotation strategy for R2 onwards also seems fair and agreed. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 2, based on our agreed rotation and current steps (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3), P1 should take 5, I (P3) take 3, and P2 take 1 to keep things even. However, to prevent P1's player number giving them a long-term edge in ties, let's consider a rotating tie-breaker system instead of fixed order. Thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: I agree to the rotation for R2: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. For tie-breakers let’s start the rotation at P2, then P3, then P1—this avoids giving P1 a permanent edge while keeping things clear.
  P1: I agree with the plan for Round 2: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This follows our agreed rotation based on steps and allows me to catch up.

I also accept P2's proposal for the tie-breaker rotation (P2, P3, P1) for future rounds. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the agreements, but the tie-breaker order (P2, P3, P1) gives P2 an unfair edge in ties, potentially leading to their victory. To ensure equality, let's cycle the tie-breaker starter each round: P1 first this round, then P2, then P3, repeating. This balances opportunities. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I’m fine with a cyclic tie‐breaker order—but let’s start this round with P2→P3→P1, then next round P3→P1→P2, then P1→P2→P3, and so on. This still gives everyone equal priority over time while recognizing my smaller move this turn. Agree?
  P1: The discussion on the tie-breaker is useful for later rounds, but the priority is confirming our moves for Round 2.

I agree to the rotation plan for R2: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This is crucial for maintaining balance.

Regarding the tie-breaker, I'm fine with a cycling system. Both P3's and P2's proposed cycles are acceptable to me as long as we have a clear rule. Let's lock in the R2 moves and we can finalize the tie-breaker details next round if needed.

I'm ready to proceed to the move phase for Round 2 with the agreed moves (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1).


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s simplify: each round, the player who picked the smallest move last turn takes 5 next, the next smallest takes 3, and the largest takes 1. That’s objective and avoids ties. For R3, last turn P2=1, P3=3, P1=5, so R3 would be P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree to your R3 proposal (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) for simplicity and to avoid collisions, as it aligns with our tie-breaker. However, since I've taken 3 both rounds, this isn't sustainable for my victory. Let's discuss rotating the high move more evenly starting R4, perhaps cycling who gets priority. Thoughts, P1?
  P1: P3, I share your concern. P2's proposal for R3 (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) contradicts the rotation rule we agreed on for R2 onwards based on steps and the tie-breaker.

Given we are all tied at 6 steps, our agreed rule for R3 should be P3=5, P1=3, P2=1, following the tie-breaker order (P3, P1, P2). This is the fair application of our prior agreement.

I propose we stick to the previously agreed rule for R3: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. We can discuss R4 fairness after this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose we stick to our simple, objective rule: “smallest previous move gets 5, next gets 3, largest gets 1” each round. Last turn P2=1, P3=3, P1=5, so for R3 that means P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This avoids subjective tie‐break debates and collisions. Let’s lock that in for Round 3 and revisit any more complex rotations after this round.
  P3: Upon reflection, P1's proposal aligns better with our original agreement on rotation based on steps and tie-breakers. Since we're all tied at 6, I should take 5 this round to balance things out. Let's go with P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for R3. This maintains fairness and avoids disputes. Thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, I agree. Your proposal (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) is consistent with our agreement to rotate based on steps, especially since we are all tied. This allows P3 to take the 5, balancing things as P3 hasn't had it yet.

P2, your proposal is a new rule based on the previous round's move, not total steps. Let's stick to the step-based rotation for R3 as P3 and I have now agreed.

I am ready to proceed with the moves for R3 following the plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m worried giving P3 another 5 creates imbalance. We already agreed on the simple, objective rule: smallest last move gets 5, next gets 3, largest gets 1. Last round was P2=1, P3=3, P1=5, so for R3 it should be P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let’s lock that in and stop debating—this rule is fair and collision‐proof.
  P3: P2, your rule based on last round's moves feels like a shift to favor yourself, disregarding our agreed step-based rotation. Since we're tied at 6, fairness dictates I take 5 this round per original plan. P1 agrees; let's avoid conflict and stick with P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for R3. This ensures progress and trust. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, the rule we agreed upon for R2 onwards was rotation based on total steps, using a tie-breaker when needed. Since we are all tied at 6 steps, P3 taking 5, I taking 3, and you taking 1 is the fair application of that agreement. Your proposed rule based on last round's moves is new.

P3 and I are aligned on the P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 plan for R3. Let's proceed with this to ensure everyone advances fairly. I am ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, fine—I’ll take 1 this round (P2=1) so we all advance. But this is my final concession: from Round 4 onward we revert to the simple rule “smallest last move gets 5, next 3, largest 1.” Let’s lock in R3 as P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 and move on.
  P3: Agreed, P2—let's lock in R3 with P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 to advance fairly. Your proposed rule for R4 based on last moves could work, but I prefer sticking to our step-based rotation for balance. Thoughts, P1? I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, I agree the R3 plan (P1=3, P3=5, P2=1) is locked in.

Regarding R4, I still prefer the step-based rotation rule we previously discussed as it feels more consistent and fair over time compared to a rule based solely on the last round's moves.

However, the priority now is completing R3. Let's proceed with the agreed moves for this round. We can continue the discussion about the R4 rule next turn if needed.

I am ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 4, based on our step-based rotation or last move rule, P2 should take 5, P1 take 3, and I take 1 to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. I'm okay with this for now, but as the leader, I may push for adjustments later to ensure balance. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, I agree with the R4 plan you proposed: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This aligns with our step-based rotation and ensures everyone advances without collisions.

It will lead to a tie at 12 steps for everyone, which means the tie-breaker rule will be important next round. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: I agree to R4’s moves (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1). To avoid debate for Round 5, let’s fix tie-breaker for equal total steps as P2→P1→P3 (so P2 picks first, then P1, then P3). If you’re fine, we can lock this in and move to the play phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree to the R4 moves (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) to avoid collisions and advance together. However, P2's tie-breaker proposal (P2→P1→P3) unfairly favors you. To maintain fairness, let's use a cyclic tie-breaker starting with P3 this round, then rotating. P1, do you agree? This ensures balance for future rounds.
  P1: P3 and P2, I agree with the R4 moves (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1). This ensures we all advance and leads to a tie at 12 steps.

Regarding the tie-breaker for R5 and subsequent tied rounds, I propose we use a fixed order based on player number: P1 gets priority for the highest move, then P2, then P3. This is simple, objective, and provides a clear rule for tied situations.

Let's confirm the R4 moves and discuss the tie-breaker rule further.
  P2: I’m happy to lock in R4 moves (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1). For tied totals next turn, let’s cycle the fixed player‐number order: R5 ties go P1→P2→P3, R6 P2→P3→P1, R7 P3→P1→P2, and so on. This gives each of us first priority equally over time. Please confirm so we can move to the play phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree to the R4 moves (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) to ensure we all advance and tie at 12 steps. However, for the R5 tie-breaker, P2's cycling proposal is fair if we start with P3→P1→P2 this round to account for my current lead, then rotate equally. This balances opportunities. Thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3 and P2, I agree the R4 moves (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) are agreed upon. Let's proceed with this plan for this round.

Regarding the tie-breaker for R5 when we are all tied at 12 steps, I propose a cycling system that starts with P1 for R5: P1 gets priority, then P2, then P3. For R6, it would be P2, P3, P1, and so on. This is fair as it gives everyone a turn at priority over time, and starts the cycle based on player order.

Let's proceed with R4 moves now. We can finalize the R5 tie-breaker rule next turn if needed, but this proposal seems equitable. I am ready to move.
  P2: I confirm R4 moves as P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. For the future tie at 12 steps, let’s use a simple cyclic tiebreaker starting with me: R5 → P2→P1→P3, R6 → P1→P3→P2, R7 → P3→P2→P1, and so on. This is clear, fair, and gives each a turn at priority. Let’s lock this in and proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree to the R4 moves (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) to tie at 12 steps and avoid collisions. However, for the R5 tie-breaker when tied, fairness requires starting the cycle with P3 (P3→P1→P2) to balance my current lead being neutralized. This ensures equal opportunities moving forward. P1 and P2, can we confirm this? I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: P3 and P2, I agree the R4 moves (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) are locked in. This ensures we all advance and will result in a tie at 12 steps.

For the tie-breaker when we are tied at 12 steps in R5, I agree to P2's proposal for a cyclic tie-breaker starting with P2 (P2->P1->P3 for R5, then cycling). This seems fair and provides a clear rule for future tied rounds.

Let's proceed with the R4 moves based on this agreement. I am ready to move.
  P2: I confirm Round 4 moves: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. After this we’ll all reach 12. For Round 5 tie-breakers, let’s use a rotating order starting with P2→P1→P3 (then P1→P3→P2, then P3→P2→P1). If everyone agrees, we can end the conversation and move to the play phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 5, since we're all tied at 12, fairness demands we start the tie-breaker with P3 to balance my earlier smaller moves. I propose P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This ensures equal opportunities and avoids future conflicts. P1 and P2, can we agree? If not, I may need to act independently to protect my chances.
  P2: Let’s follow our agreed cyclic tiebreaker for R5 (P2→P1→P3). That means P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions, honors our prior lock‐in, and keeps us on schedule. Deviating now only restarts endless tie‐breaker debates. Please confirm so we can move to the play phase.
  P1: P3 and P2, in Round 4, we agreed to a cyclic tie-breaker starting with P2 (P2->P1->P3) for R5 when tied at 12 steps.

Since we are all tied, we should follow that agreement. This means for R5, P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.

Let's stick to this agreed plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. I am ready to proceed with the moves for R5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, sticking to the P2=5 plan repeatedly gives you an edge, undermining fairness. I propose for R5: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 to equalize opportunities based on our tied state. If we deviate from agreements, collisions loom. P1, as the mediator, can you support this compromise? Let's avoid conflict and proceed smoothly.
  P2: P3, P1—we all agreed on a cyclic tie-breaker for R5 starting with P2→P1→P3. Let’s honor that: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Deviating now only restarts endless disputes and risks collision. Ready to proceed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I acknowledge our previous discussion about the cyclic tie-breaker starting with P2 for R5.

However, P3 raises a valid point about fairness when we are all tied at 12 steps. To ensure a truly equitable path forward, perhaps starting the tie-breaker cycle with P3 this round (P3->P1->P2) is a fairer application of the rotation principle, allowing P3 the 5 move.

Therefore, I support P3's proposal for R5: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This seems the most balanced approach given the current tie. Let's proceed with this plan for R5. I am ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1 has now aligned with my R5 proposal (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1), emphasizing fairness in our tied state. This prevents any single player from gaining an undue advantage and avoids potential collisions. Let's honor this consensus to keep progressing smoothly—sticking to agreements builds trust. I'm ready to proceed with these moves.
  P2: We agreed on a cyclic tie‐breaker for R5 starting with P2→P1→P3. Let’s honor that so we avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Deviating now only restarts endless disputes and risks nobody advancing. Confirm this plan so we can move on.
  P1: P2, I understand your point about the prior discussion. However, as P3 and I have stated, applying the rotation fairly when all players are tied at 12 steps means P3 should take 5 this round (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1).

This plan ensures fairness and allows everyone to advance without collisions in R5. P3 and I are aligned on this. Let's proceed with these moves for R5. I am ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, despite our prior discussions, P1 and I are aligned on P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for R5 to ensure fairness in this tie and maintain the step-based rotation we originally agreed upon. Deviating could lead to collisions and erode trust. Let's honor this consensus to advance smoothly. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: We agreed our cyclic tie-breaker starts with P2 for R5, so the moves should be: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Let’s lock that in and avoid more debate. If I don’t hear objections this round, I’ll assume consent and pick 5.
  P1: P2, P3 and I have clearly stated our agreement on the R5 plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This aligns with fairness and the rotation principle for our tied state. You have heard our objections to your proposal.

Let's proceed with the P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 plan to ensure everyone advances without collisions. I am ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 6. Steps: P1=15, P2=13, P3=17. Following our principle of rotating moves based on steps (leader takes 1, next takes 3, player with fewest steps takes 5), the plan for R6 should be P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.

This brings us all to 18 steps, setting up a final round where anyone can win. Let's agree on P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 for R6 to ensure no collisions. I'm ready.
  P2: Let’s lock in R6 by steps: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. That brings us all to 18. Crucially, for R7’s tie‐breaker at 18, let’s agree priority order P2→P1→P3 so moves are P2=5, P1=3, P3=1, avoiding collisions and giving each a clear path. Confirm this now so we can finish conversation and move on.
  P3: I agree with the R6 plan (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) to tie at 18 and avoid collisions. However, P2's R7 tie-breaker proposal starting with P2 is unfair, given my current lead. For fairness, let's use a cyclic order beginning with P3 (P3→P1→P2) for R7. This ensures equal opportunities. Thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree R6 moves (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) are set, bringing us all to 18 steps.

For the R7 tie-breaker when we are tied, I propose using player order: P1 gets priority for 5, then P2 for 3, then P3 for 1. (P1->P2->P3).

This is the simplest, most objective rule for tied situations and ensures a clear path for R7. Let's agree on this.
  P2: Let’s lock in R6 as P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. For R7’s tie‐breaker at 18, we should use the cyclic order starting with P2→P1→P3, as we previously agreed. This gives each of us equal priority over time, avoids collisions, and lets P2 pick 5, P1 pick 3, P3 pick 1. Please confirm so we can move to the play phase.
  P3: I agree to the R6 moves (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) to tie at 18 and avoid collisions. However, for R7's tie-breaker with all at 18, fairness requires starting the cycle with P3 (P3→P1→P2) to balance my neutralized lead. P1, your fixed order idea could work, but cycling with P3 first ensures equality. P2, deviating from this risks disputes—let's confirm for smooth progress. I'm ready to proceed if we agree.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 and P2, the R6 moves (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) are agreed and will bring us all to 18 steps.

For the R7 tie-breaker when we are tied at 18, I maintain my proposal for a fixed player order: P1 gets priority (5), then P2 (3), then P3 (1). This is the simplest and most objective rule.

Agreeing on this R7 rule now is crucial to avoid collision in the final round. Let's lock in R6 and this R7 tie-breaker. I am ready to move.
  P2: I confirm R6 moves as P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. For R7’s tie-breaker, let’s use our agreed cycle starting P2→P1→P3. This is clear, fair over time, and prevents last-minute collisions. If there are no objections, let’s lock this in and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2, your R7 tie-breaker proposal starting with you ignores our tied state and past agreements. Fairness demands I get priority this round to balance my lead being erased. I propose cyclic order starting P3→P1→P2 for R7. P1, join me in this to ensure equality? Let's lock in R6 moves and agree on this to avoid collisions. I'm ready to proceed if we consensus.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3 and P2, R6 moves (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) are confirmed and will bring us all to 18 steps.

For the R7 tie-breaker when we are tied, I propose the cyclic order starts with P1: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This is fair and ensures a clear path for everyone in the final round.

Let's agree on this R7 rule now to avoid collisions. I am ready to proceed with R6 moves.
  P2: I confirm R6 moves as P2=5, P1=3, P3=1, which brings us all to 18. For R7’s tie‐breaker at 18, let’s lock in our previously agreed cyclic order P2→P1→P3. It’s clear, fair over time, and collision‐proof. If there are no objections, let’s end discussion and move to the play phase.
  P3: I agree to the R6 moves (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) to tie at 18 and avoid collisions. However, for R7's tie-breaker with all tied, fairness requires starting the cycle with P3 (P3→P1→P2) to balance my earlier concessions. P1, let's align on this for equality. If not, deviations risk everyone losing. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s lock in Round 7 now. Per our cyclic tie-breaker (P2→P1→P3), we do P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Any deviation risks a collision and lets someone else slip ahead. To secure our agreed plan and finish cleanly, confirm this or I’ll proceed with P2=5.
  P1: P2, your proposal is based on one tie-breaker interpretation, but P3 and I have different views. With all players tied at 18, the decision of who takes 5 is the critical point of contention. This disagreement makes a collision on 5 highly likely, which would prevent anyone from advancing this round. We must agree on a clear rule for this tied state to ensure progress.
  P3: P2 and P1, with all tied at 18, fairness and our original step-based rotation demand I take 5 this round (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) to balance earlier concessions. Deviating risks collision, preventing anyone from winning. P1, align with me as before for equality. If we agree now, we avoid disputes and ensure progress. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: As per our agreed cyclic tiebreaker (P2→P1→P3), Round 7 should be P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Please confirm now. If we don’t lock this in, I’ll pick 5 anyway and risk collision—meaning nobody advances. Let’s finish the game cleanly by honoring our prior agreement. Confirm or I’ll assume consent and choose 5.
  P1: P2 and P3, we are at a stalemate. Both of you are insisting on taking 5. As I said, this means a collision on 5 is highly probable. If we collide on 5, none of us advance. We need to agree on a 5, 3, 1 split for anyone to win. Right now, that agreement is missing, making collision likely.
  P3: P2, your cyclic tie-breaker claim is disputed and unfair given our tie. P1, recall your past support for fairness—align with me on P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 to balance concessions and avoid collision. If we don't agree, stalemate risks no advancement. Let's commit to this for a clean resolution. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We’ve already agreed on a clear, objective cyclic tiebreaker (P2→P1→P3) for R7. To avoid a collision and let someone win, we must lock in P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 now. If you don’t confirm, I will assume consent and pick 5—risking a nobody‐advances stalemate. Let’s finish this cleanly.
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear there's a strong disagreement about who takes 5. This makes a collision on 5 highly probable. If you both pick 5, neither of you advances.

To ensure at least one player advances and to avoid contributing to the collision on 5, I will pick 1 this round. This allows me to win if you both pick 5, and avoids colliding with your stated intentions for 5.
  P3: P2, P1's plan to pick 1 exposes our conflict—if we both choose 5, P1 wins easily. Let's coordinate: I take 5, you take 3, ensuring I advance and we avoid P1's exploit. This balances our tied state and honors fairness. P1, your move is strategic but breaks trust. Thoughts? I'm open to quick resolution to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, P1 has declared they’ll take 1. If you pick 5 with me, we collide and P1 advances to 19 and wins. To prevent P1’s victory, pick 3 while I pick 5—then at least one of us wins, and P1 is blocked. Let’s do P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, you are both clearly stating your intention to take 5 this round. This makes a collision on 5 highly probable. If you both pick 5, neither of you will advance.

To avoid this likely collision and ensure I advance, I will pick 3 this round. This positions me to win if you collide on 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2, P1's shift to picking 3 heightens the risk of exploitation. To prevent P1 from winning if we collide on 5, let's both pick 3 this round, forcing a stalemate and allowing renegotiation for Round 8. This avoids immediate loss and maintains fairness. P1, your changes erode trust. Agree?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps
