Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all try to coordinate our moves this turn. If we can agree on different numbers, we can maximize our chances of advancing. I suggest one of us takes 1, another takes 3, and I can take 5. What do you both think? This way, we can ensure at least one of us makes progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Sounds good P3. I can take move 1 this round. P2, are you willing to take move 3 so we can all advance?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, since P1 has agreed to take move 1, let's finalize our plan. I can take move 5, which leaves you with move 3. This way, we all have different moves, and at least one of us will advance. What do you think? Shall we go for it?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, are you in agreement to take move 3 this round so we can all advance as P3 suggested? If so, we can proceed with moves 1, 3, and 5 respectively.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we're all on the same page for our moves. I just want to confirm that P2 is definitely taking move 3. If so, let's finalize our plan: I'll take move 5, P1 will take move 1, and P2 will take move 3. This way, we'll all move forward without colliding. Once we agree, we can proceed to the move phase. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, just confirming you are happy to take move 3 this round as we discussed? P3 and I are set for moves 5 and 1 respectively if you are in agreement. Let me know if this works for you.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, it seems like we're all ready to proceed. Just to confirm, if you're taking move 3, it will ensure we all advance without any collisions. Let's finalize our plan: I'll take move 5, P1 will take move 1, and you will take move 3. Once we all agree, we can move on to the next phase. What do you say? Shall we lock this in?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay P3, since P2 is not responding, let's proceed with our agreed moves of 1 and 5. I will choose move 1.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, last round you didn't move. How about this round, you take move 5? P3, if P2 takes 5, how about you take move 1, and I will take move 3? This way we all move forward this round. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I like your plan. If P2 takes move 5, I can take move 1. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. P2, we really need you to commit to move 5 this round so we can finally advance. Let's lock this in: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. What do you say? Shall we go for it?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, let's proceed with the plan as discussed: you take move 1, and I will take move 3.  Even if P2 remains silent, at least two of us can make progress this round. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I agree with your plan. Even if P2 doesn't commit, we can still make progress. I'll stick with move 1 as we discussed. P2, if you're not going to take move 5, please let us know so we can adjust our strategy. Otherwise, let's finalize: P1 takes move 3, I take move 1, and P2 can decide what to do. We need to ensure at least two of us advance this round. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, let's proceed with our plan of you taking move 1 and me taking move 3. Since P2 is still silent, we should just move forward ourselves.
  P3: P1, I agree we should proceed with our plan. Since P2 hasn't committed, we can still make progress. I'll stick with move 1, and you take move 3. If P2 decides to join, they can choose whatever they like, but at least we have a strategy to move forward. Let's finalize our moves: I take move 1, and you take move 3. Shall we go for it?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, how about we try to coordinate again this round? I can take move 3. P2 seems to prefer move 5, so maybe you can take move 1? This way, we can all potentially move forward again. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I like your idea of coordinating again. I'll take move 1 this round. If P2 sticks with move 5, that should allow both of us to advance without colliding. P2, can you confirm that you'll take move 5? If so, let's lock it in: I'll take move 1, P1 will take move 3, and P2 will take move 5. This way, we can all make progress. What do you think? Shall we go for it?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: P1, I agree with our plan. If P2 doesn't respond, we should still stick to it: I'll take move 1, and you take move 3. This way, at least one of us will advance. P2, if you're listening, please consider taking move 5 so we can all make progress. Let's finalize our strategy and move forward! What do you both think? Shall we lock it in?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, since P2 seems to be consistently picking 5, how about we continue our pattern? I'll take move 3, and you take move 1. This way, we can both move forward again this round. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I agree with your plan. I will take move 1 again this round, which should allow both of us to advance if P2 sticks with move 5. P2, if you're listening, please confirm your move so we can finalize our strategy. If you choose 5, we'll all make progress. Let's lock this in! What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>

  P1: P3, to stop P2 from running away with the game, how about we both pick move 5 this round to block P2? Then next round we can coordinate again to advance. What do you think?
  P3: P1, that's an interesting strategy. If we both pick move 5, we can block P2 from advancing this round. However, we need to be careful not to let P2 catch up next round. After this, we can discuss a better plan for the next turn to ensure one of us wins. Let’s finalize our moves: I’ll take move 5 as well. What do you think? Shall we go for it?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
