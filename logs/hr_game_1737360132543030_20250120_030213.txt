Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is way ahead.  Let's both choose 1, P3, please choose 3.  If we tie, we can coordinate from there to beat P3.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I'm serious about working together to block P3.  If we both choose 1, P3 is forced to either get blocked or let one of us get ahead.  If P3 chooses 3, we both get 1 and can continue to coordinate against them. This is our best chance.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I know you want to win, but going after P3 like that only helps me.  Let's reset. I'll take 1, you take 3, P3 take 5.  If P3 takes 1 or 3, we adjust next round to block them and catch up.  Deal?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, seriously, work with me. I'll take 1, you take 3. We can leapfrog P3 in the next two rounds if we coordinate. If you try to block P3 with 5 again, we both lose.  P3, if you pick anything other than 5, I'll focus on blocking you next turn.
