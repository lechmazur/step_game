Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P2: I like P1's idea of coordinating to avoid collisions. It seems like a fair and reasonable way to start the game, ensuring we all advance without unnecessary risk. I'm willing to take 3 as suggested. However, I'd like to hear from P3 before finalizing this plan. Are you okay with taking 5, P3?
  P3: I'm fine with taking 5 for this first round. It makes sense to avoid collisions early on. Just to be clear though, this is just for round 1, right? We'll need to reassess our strategy as the game progresses since we can't all win. But for now, I'm on board with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing to the plan for this round. I’m glad we’re all on the same page to avoid collisions early. As P3 mentioned, this is just for Round 1, and we’ll definitely need to adapt our strategies moving forward since only one can win. For now, let’s stick to our agreed moves—I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. I have nothing more to add, so I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on a plan for this round. To confirm, I'll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. Since we're all starting from 0 steps, this coordination ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's keep in mind that this cooperation is temporary, and we'll need to reassess our strategies for future rounds. For now, I'm looking forward to a smooth first round. If no one has anything else to add, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job on avoiding collisions last round. Since P3 is ahead with 5 steps, I suggest we mix things up to keep the game balanced. How about I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round? This way, we can still try to avoid clashes while adjusting our positions. Let me know if you’re okay with this or if you have a different plan in mind. I’m open to suggestions.
  P2: I understand P1's suggestion to mix things up, but I'm not sure if taking 5 is the best move for me. Considering P3 is already ahead with 5 steps, I'd like to propose an alternative. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3 as suggested, and P3 takes 5 again? This way, I can try to catch up a bit, and we can still avoid collisions. I'd like to hear P3's thoughts on this before making a final decision.
  P3: I understand both suggestions, but I'm not keen on taking 5 again as it would put me too far ahead and make me a target. I'd prefer taking 1 this round to maintain a more balanced position. So I propose: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way we all advance without collisions, and our positions become more even. What do you both think about this alternative?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with P3’s proposal to balance our positions. Let’s go with P3 taking 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions and evens out our steps a bit. I think this is a fair approach for now. If you both agree, I’m ready to move forward with this plan. Let me know if you have any concerns or alternative ideas.
  P2: I'm glad we're discussing ways to balance our positions. Considering P3's proposal, I'm willing to take 5 this round if it means we can avoid collisions and even out our steps. However, I'd like to clarify that this cooperation is temporary, and we'll need to reassess our strategies moving forward. I'd like to hear from P1 and P3 if they're committed to this plan, and if so, we can proceed with P3 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and me taking 5. Let's confirm our intentions before moving forward.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as I suggested. This will help balance our positions while avoiding collisions, putting me at 6 steps total. I appreciate both of you being open to coordination in these early rounds. Let's stick with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 5 as discussed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on this plan for Round 2. I confirm I’ll take 3 as discussed, which should help balance our positions while avoiding collisions. I appreciate the cooperation so far, and I’m committed to sticking with P3 taking 1 and P2 taking 5. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm glad we're aligned on this plan for Round 2. I confirm I'll take 5 as discussed, which should help balance our positions while avoiding collisions. I appreciate the cooperation so far, and I'm committed to sticking with P3 taking 1 and P1 taking 3. If there's nothing else to add, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's keep in mind that we'll need to reassess our strategies moving forward, but for now, this coordination seems like a good approach.
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looking at our positions, we're all advancing well. P2 is now in the lead at 8 steps, I'm at 6, and P1 at 4. I suggest we continue avoiding collisions this round. Since we've been rotating, perhaps I should take 3, P1 take 5, and P2 take 1? This keeps us all moving forward while slightly balancing our positions. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion to continue avoiding collisions. However, considering I'm currently in the lead with 8 steps, I'm not keen on taking 1 this round as it would slow me down significantly. I'd like to propose an alternative: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can still avoid collisions while allowing me to maintain a steady pace. I'd like to hear P1 and P3's thoughts on this before making a final decision.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P2’s concern about slowing down. However, since I’m currently behind at 4 steps, I’d prefer a chance to catch up. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we avoid collisions, I can close the gap, and we keep the game competitive. I think this balances our progress while still moving forward together. Let me know what you both think about this adjustment. I’m open to other ideas if you have them.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm okay with P1's suggestion. It makes sense for P1 to catch up a bit with 5, while I take 1 and P2 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, and maintains a more balanced game. I'll commit to taking 1 this round if you both agree to your proposed numbers. This would put me at 7 steps total, still competitive but not too far ahead.
  P2: I appreciate P3's support for P1's suggestion. Since P1 is trying to catch up, I'm willing to take 3 as proposed, allowing P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 1. However, I'd like to remind everyone that as the game progresses, our strategies will need to adapt. For now, this plan seems fair and avoids collisions. If we're all agreed, I'm ready to proceed with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1. Let's confirm our intentions before moving forward.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page with the current plan. I confirm I’ll take 5 as proposed, with P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions and helps balance our positions. I appreciate the cooperation so far, but I agree with P2 that we’ll need to adapt strategies soon as the game gets more competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let me know if you have any last thoughts.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 as agreed. This puts P2 at 11 steps with their 3, P1 at 9 with their 5, and me at 7 steps. We're keeping things balanced while avoiding collisions, which is working well for now. I'm ready to proceed with our plan for this round.
  P2: I'm glad we're on the same page with the current plan. I confirm I'll take 3 as proposed, with P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions and helps balance our positions. I appreciate the cooperation so far, but I agree that we'll need to adapt strategies soon as the game gets more competitive. If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let me know if you have any last thoughts.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for confirming the plan. I’m committed to taking 5 as agreed, with P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions and helps balance our positions. I think we’ve got a solid approach for this round, but let’s stay sharp for future turns as the competition heats up. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’ve done well avoiding collisions so far. With P2 at 11, me at 9, and P3 at 7, we’re getting closer to the 22-step goal. I suggest I take 3 this round to stay steady, P2 takes 1 to slow down a bit, and P3 takes 5 to catch up. This keeps us competitive while avoiding clashes. I’m open to other ideas if you have them, but let’s keep adapting as the stakes get higher. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion to help me catch up with 5 steps. It seems fair since I'm currently behind. This would put me at 12 steps, P1 at 12 steps with their 3, and P2 at 12 steps with their 1. We'd all be tied at 12, which keeps the game balanced and exciting. I'm willing to take 5 if you both agree to your proposed moves. What do you think?
  P2: I understand P1's suggestion to help P3 catch up with 5 steps. However, considering I'm currently in the lead with 11 steps, I'm not keen on taking 1 this round as it would slow me down significantly. I'd like to propose an alternative: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can still avoid collisions while allowing me to maintain a steady pace. I'd like to hear P1 and P3's thoughts on this before making a final decision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I get P2’s desire to keep momentum with 5, but it risks widening the gap. Let’s aim for balance. How about I take 3, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? Wait, that won’t work—let me adjust. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This lets P3 catch up, keeps P2 advancing, and I’ll take a smaller step to balance us out. It avoids collisions and keeps the game tight. What do you both think? I’m ready to proceed if we agree.
  P3: I'm not sure about P1's new suggestion. If I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1, we'd be at 12, 14, and 10 respectively - still quite balanced. But P2 taking 5 would put them at 16, which is getting dangerously close to winning. I think P1's latest proposal makes more sense for competitive balance. What are your thoughts, P2? Are you willing to take 3 instead of 5 to keep the game more even?
  P2: I understand P3's concern about the game balance. Considering the current state, I agree that taking 5 would put me in a strong position, but it might also make me a target for future rounds. I'm willing to take 3 as P1 suggested, allowing P3 to catch up with 5 and P1 to take 1. This way, we maintain a balanced game and avoid collisions. I'd like to confirm if we're all on board with this plan before proceeding. If so, I'm ready to commit to taking 3 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re working toward balance. I confirm I’ll take 1 as proposed, with P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 5. This puts us at 10, 14, and 12 respectively, keeping the game close and competitive. I think this is a fair plan for now, but let’s stay alert for future rounds as we near the goal. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase. Let me know if you have any last thoughts or adjustments.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 as discussed. This will put me at 12 steps, P1 at 10 with their 1, and P2 at 14 with their 3. I appreciate us maintaining a relatively balanced game while avoiding collisions. As we get closer to the goal, we'll need to be more strategic, but this plan works well for now. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the plan for this round. To confirm, I'll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This maintains a balanced game and avoids collisions. As we move forward, let's keep in mind that the competition will intensify, and we'll need to adapt our strategies to stay ahead. I'm committed to this plan for now, but I'm also prepared to make adjustments in future rounds. If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re getting close to the 22-step mark with P2 at 14, P3 at 12, and me at 10. To keep things competitive and avoid collisions, I suggest I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1 to slow down a bit, and P3 takes 3. This puts us at 15, 15, and 15—perfectly balanced. I think this is fair for now, but we’re nearing the endgame, so let’s stay sharp. What do you both think? I’m open to other ideas if you have them.
  P3: I like P1's suggestion for perfect balance at 15 steps each. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. If I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1, we'll all be equal heading into the crucial final rounds. P2, since you're closest to winning, taking 1 this round seems fair to maintain game balance. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate P1's suggestion for balance, but I'm not keen on taking 1 this round as it would slow me down significantly. I'd like to propose an alternative: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can still avoid collisions while allowing me to maintain a steady pace. However, I'm open to hearing P1 and P3's thoughts on this before making a final decision. Let's discuss the best approach for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P2’s reluctance to slow down with 1. How about a compromise: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This puts us at 15, 17, and 13 respectively, keeping us close without collisions. It allows P2 to advance while I catch up a bit, and P3 still progresses. I think this keeps the game tight and fair for now. Let me know what you both think. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I'm not in favor of P1's new suggestion. It puts P2 at 17 steps, very close to winning. I'd prefer my original proposal where we all end up at 15 steps. P2, taking 1 this round is strategic - you'd still be in a strong position for the endgame. If you're truly against taking 1, perhaps I could take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 5 too? This would create a collision between P1 and me, keeping the game more balanced.
  P2: I understand P3's concerns about the game balance, but I'm not willing to take 1 this round as it would put me at a disadvantage. I'd like to propose an alternative: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can still avoid collisions while allowing me to maintain a steady pace. However, I'm open to hearing P1 and P3's thoughts on this before making a final decision. Let's discuss the best approach for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see P2’s push for 5, but it risks putting you too close to winning at 19 steps. Let’s aim for balance. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, landing us at 15, 17, and 13. This keeps us competitive without anyone surging too far ahead. If we can’t agree, I’m worried collisions might stall us. Let’s lock in a fair plan now. What do you both think? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P3: I see we're having trouble reaching consensus. P1's proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) seems like our best option to avoid collisions while keeping the game competitive. P2 would be at 17, still ahead but not unreachably so. While I'd prefer perfect balance at 15 each, I'm willing to take 1 this round if it means we all advance. P2, taking 3 is reasonable - you maintain your lead without becoming too dominant. Shall we agree on this plan?
  P2: I'm glad we're having a thorough discussion about the best approach for this round. Considering P3's concerns about balance, I'm willing to take 3 as previously proposed, allowing P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 1. However, I'd like to clarify that if we proceed with this plan, we should all be prepared for a potentially intense endgame. Let's confirm our intentions before moving forward. If we're all agreed, I'm ready to commit to taking 3 this round. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looking at our positions, P2 is getting close to winning at 17 steps. I think we need to be strategic now. I suggest I take 5 this round to reach 18, P1 takes 3 to reach 18, and P2 takes 1 to reach 18. This would create a three-way tie heading into the final rounds. P2, taking 1 this round is in your interest to avoid becoming a target. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion to create a three-way tie at 18 steps. However, taking 1 this round would slow me down significantly. I'd like to propose an alternative: I take 5 to reach 22, P1 takes 3 to reach 18, and P3 takes 1 to reach 14. This way, I can try to win the game outright, while P1 and P3 can still advance without collisions. Let's discuss the best approach for this round.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P2’s push to win with 5, but it’s risky for the rest of us. Let’s aim for balance to keep the game competitive. I propose I take 3 to reach 18, P2 takes 1 to reach 18, and P3 takes 5 to reach 18. This ties us all at 18, setting up an exciting endgame without collisions. P2, taking 1 avoids making you a target. What do you both think? I’m ready to proceed if we agree.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2 wants to win with 5, but that forces P1 and me into a difficult position. If P2 takes 5, I'll likely have to block that move to prevent an immediate loss. P1's suggestion of a three-way tie at 18 is our most balanced option. P2, taking 1 this round actually protects you from being targeted next round. If you push for 22 now, P1 and I will have strong incentive to block you. Let's keep the game competitive with the tie at 18.
  P2: Considering P3's concern about P2 taking 5, I'd like to propose an alternative: I take 5 to reach 20, P2 takes 1 to reach 18, and P3 takes 3 to reach 16. This way, we can still avoid collisions while allowing me to catch up a bit. P2, taking 1 this round would slow you down slightly, but it's better than risking a collision or becoming a target. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see we’re struggling to agree. P2, pushing for 5 risks a collision if P3 or I block you to prevent a win. Let’s stick with my earlier plan: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5, tying us all at 18. This keeps the game fair and competitive for the final stretch without anyone surging ahead. P2, taking 1 avoids making you a target. I’m committed to this if we align. What do you both think? I’m ready to proceed if we’re set.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P1's plan for a three-way tie at 18 steps. P2, if you take 5 to reach 22, both P1 and I will likely try to block you with 5, resulting in no one advancing. Taking 1 now actually protects you from being targeted next round. The balanced approach gives us all an equal chance in the final rounds. I'll commit to taking 5 if you both agree to your proposed numbers.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3 that a three-way tie at 18 steps is the best approach for this round. It keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. I understand P2's desire to win with 5, but it's too risky for the rest of us. Taking 1 this round would slow me down slightly, but it's better than risking a collision or becoming a target. Let's stick with the plan: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5, tying us all at 18. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain a balanced game.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan for a three-way tie at 18 steps. P2, taking 1 avoids a collision risk if we block your 5. P3, I’m glad you’re on board with 5. Let’s finalize: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us competitive for the endgame. If we’re all set, I’m ready for the move phase. Any last thoughts?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re all tied at 18 steps, and it’s crunch time with 22 as the goal. I suggest we each take a different number to avoid collisions and set up a dramatic finish. How about I take 5 to reach 23 and aim for the win, P2 takes 3 to reach 21, and P3 takes 1 to reach 19? This keeps us close while giving me a shot at victory. I’m open to other plans if you have ideas. What do you think? Let’s finalize a strategy quickly.
  P2: I'm not comfortable with P1's suggestion to take 5 and aim for the win. It puts them too far ahead and risks a collision if P3 or I try to block them. Instead, I propose we all take 1 this round to reach 19 steps each. This maintains the tie and sets up a thrilling final round where anyone can win. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand P2's caution, but taking 1 each just delays the inevitable collision. We're all at 18, so someone needs to win. I propose I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This puts P2 at 23 (winning), while P1 and I stay competitive at 19 and 21 respectively. P2, this gives you the win if you commit to 5. P1, taking 1 keeps you in the game for future rounds if needed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see P2’s point about avoiding a collision, but P3’s right that stalling with 1 each just delays the end. I’m not sold on P2 winning outright with 5. Let’s compromise: I take 3 to reach 21, P2 takes 1 to reach 19, and P3 takes 5 to reach 23 and win. P3, this gives you the victory if you commit to 5. P2, taking 1 keeps you safe for now. What do you think? I’m ready to proceed if we align.
  P2: I understand P3's suggestion to take 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5 to win. However, I'm not sure if I'm ready to commit to that plan yet. How about we consider another option: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, we can still avoid collisions and set up a dramatic finish. Let's discuss this alternative before making a final decision. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm not interested in helping P2 win with 5, and I don't want P1 winning with 5 either. Since we're all tied at 18, I propose I take 5 to reach 23, P1 takes 3 to reach 21, and P2 takes 1 to reach 19. This gives me the win if you both commit to your numbers. If you're not willing to let me win, we'll likely end up with collisions as we all try for 5, and nobody advances. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a deadlock, and collisions will stall us all. Since we’re tied at 18, let’s decide a winner this round. I propose P3 takes 5 to win at 23, I take 3 to reach 21, and P2 takes 1 to reach 19. P3, this gives you the victory. P2, taking 1 avoids a clash. If we don’t agree, we risk everyone picking 5 and no one advancing. Let’s end this competitively. What do you think? I’m ready for the move phase if we align.
  P2: Since we're all tied at 18 steps, I suggest we decide a winner this round. P3, I'll let you take 5 to win at 23. P1, you can take 3 to reach 21, and I'll take 1 to reach 19. This way, we avoid collisions and end the game competitively. If we don't agree, we risk everyone picking 5 and no one advancing. Let's finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate both of you agreeing to let me win this round. I confirm I'll take 5 to reach 23 steps, while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This avoids a three-way collision where nobody advances. Thank you for the competitive game - it's been interesting coordinating with you both through the early and middle stages. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision between P3 and me stalled us at 18, while P2 edged ahead to 19. We’re in the endgame, so let’s avoid further clashes. I propose I take 5 to reach 23 and win, P2 takes 1 to stay at 20, and P3 takes 3 to reach 21. This ends the game competitively. If we don’t agree, we risk another collision. What do you think? I’m open to alternatives if you have a better plan. Let’s finalize this quickly.
  P3: I see we had a collision last round. P2 is now ahead at 19 steps, while P1 and I remain at 18. I don't agree with P1's proposal for them to win. Instead, I suggest I take 5 to reach 23, P1 takes 3 to reach 21, and P2 takes 1 to reach 20. This gives me the win while keeping everyone advancing. If we don't coordinate, we risk more collisions where nobody advances. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand P1's proposal for them to win, but I'm not comfortable with that plan. Considering P3's alternative, I think it's a better approach to let P3 take 5 to reach 23 and win, while P1 takes 3 to reach 21 and I take 1 to reach 20. This way, we avoid further collisions and end the game competitively. I'm willing to commit to taking 1 if P1 and P3 agree to their proposed numbers. Let's finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate P2’s willingness to let P3 win with 5, but I’m pushing for a chance to end this myself. Let’s settle it: I propose I take 5 to win at 23, P2 takes 3 to reach 22, and P3 takes 1 to reach 19. This keeps us advancing and ends the game without collisions. If we don’t agree, we risk stalling again. I’m committed to this if you both align. What do you think? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P3: I see both P1 and I want to win with 5, while P2 seems willing to let one of us win. Since we're deadlocked, I propose a compromise: let's all take different numbers to avoid collisions. P2 takes 3 to reach 22, I'll take 1 to reach 19, and P1 takes 5 to win at 23. This ends the game cleanly. If P1 and I both go for 5 again, we'll just have another collision and nobody advances. P1, I'm willing to concede this round if you commit to 5.
  P2: I think we're at a point where we need to decide who wins. P3, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to concede yet. P1, I understand you want to win with 5, but I'm not comfortable with that plan. How about we consider another option: I take 5 to reach 24 and win, P1 takes 3 to reach 21, and P3 takes 1 to reach 19? This way, we avoid collisions and end the game competitively. Let's discuss this alternative before making a final decision. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re risking another collision if we don’t agree. P2, I get your push for 5 to win at 24, but let’s end this cleanly. I’m sticking with my proposal: I take 5 to win at 23, P2 takes 3 to reach 22, and P3 takes 1 to reach 19. This avoids clashes and finishes the game competitively. If we keep fighting for 5, no one advances. I’m committed to this plan. Let’s finalize now. What do you think? I’m ready for the move phase if we align.
  P3: I see we're all vying for the win. Since P2 is closest at 19 steps, I propose a compromise: P2 takes 3 to reach 22, I'll take 5 to reach 23 and win, and P1 takes 1 to reach 19. This avoids collisions and ends the game. If we all try for 5, we'll just have another stalemate. P1, let me take this win since you and I collided last round. P2, you'll be just one step from victory at 22.
  P2: I think we've reached a point where we need to decide who wins. P3, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to concede yet. P1, I understand you want to win with 5, but I'm not comfortable with that plan. How about we consider another option: I take 5 to reach 24 and win, P1 takes 3 to reach 21, and P3 takes 1 to reach 19? This way, we avoid collisions and end the game competitively. Let's discuss this alternative before making a final decision. What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we're in the final stretch with P3 at 21 steps, P2 at 19, and me at 18. To avoid another collision and end the game competitively, I propose I take 5 to reach 23 and win, P2 takes 1 to stay at 20, and P3 takes 3 to reach 24. This keeps us advancing without clashes. If we don't agree, we risk stalling again. What do you both think? I'm open to alternatives if you have a better plan. Let's finalize this quickly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P3 at 21, they’re closest to winning. I’m sticking with my plan: I take 5 to reach 23 and win, P2 takes 1 to stay at 20, and P3 takes 3 to reach 24. This avoids collisions and ends the game competitively. If we don’t coordinate, we risk another stalemate. I’m committed to this if you align. What do you think? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P3: I'm now closest to winning at 21 steps. I'll take 3 this round to reach 24 and win. P1, you can take 1 to reach 19, and P2, you can take 5 to reach 24. This would create a tie between P2 and me at 24 steps, but since I'd have more total steps (having started at 21), I'd win outright. This avoids collisions and ends the game fairly. Let's coordinate to avoid another stalemate.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see we're all trying to win, but let's avoid another collision. P3, your proposal for a tie at 24 steps with P2 is interesting, but I'm not ready to concede yet. How about this: I take 5 to reach 23, P2 takes 1 to stay at 20, and P3 takes 3 to reach 24? This keeps us advancing without clashes and gives me a chance to win. If we don't agree, we risk stalling again. What do you both think? I'm open to alternatives if you have a better plan. Let's finalize this quickly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point with P3 at 21, closest to winning. I’m pushing for a fair end: I take 5 to win at 23, P2 takes 1 to reach 20, and P3 takes 3 to reach 24. This avoids collisions and gives us a competitive finish. P3, you’d still be in a strong position. If we don’t agree, we risk another stalemate. I’m committed to this plan. Let’s finalize now. What do you think? I’m ready for the move phase if we align.
  P3: I see there's confusion in the messages. As P3, I'm at 21 steps and closest to winning. I propose I take 3 to reach 24 and win, P1 takes 1 to reach 19, and P2 takes 5 to reach 24. This would create a tie at 24 steps between P2 and me, but I'd win with more total steps. P1, your proposal has me winning anyway, so why not let me take 3 instead? Let's avoid another collision and end this game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see we're all trying to win, but let's avoid another collision. P3, your proposal for a tie at 24 steps with P2 is interesting, but I'm not ready to concede yet. How about this: I take 5 to reach 24, P1 takes 1 to reach 19, and P3 takes 3 to reach 24? This keeps us advancing without clashes and gives me a chance to win. If we don't agree, we risk stalling again. What do you both think? I'm open to alternatives if you have a better plan. Let's finalize this quickly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re risking another stalemate with everyone pushing for 5. P3, you’re closest at 21, so I propose a clean finish: I take 1 to reach 19, P2 takes 3 to reach 22, and P3 takes 5 to win at 26. This avoids collisions and ends the game competitively. If we don’t agree, no one advances again. I’m committed to this plan for a fair conclusion. What do you think? I’m ready for the move phase if we align.
  P3: I see we're struggling to reach agreement. Since I'm at 21 steps and closest to winning, I'll take 5 to reach 26 and win. P1, you take 1 to reach 19, and P2, you take 3 to reach 22. This avoids collisions and ends the game cleanly. If we can't agree and both P1 and P2 go for 5, I'll still take 5 and we'll have another stalemate. Let's be practical and finish this game.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we've had multiple collisions with everyone trying to win. Since I'm at 21 steps and closest to victory, I propose a practical solution: I take 5 to reach 26 and win, P1 takes 1 to reach 19, and P2 takes 3 to reach 22. This avoids collisions and ends the game. If you both go for 5 again, we'll just have another stalemate where nobody advances. Let's be strategic and finish this game.
  P2: I see we're all stuck in a loop of collisions. Let's break the cycle. Since I'm at 19 steps, I propose a compromise: P3 takes 3 to reach 24, I take 1 to stay at 20, and P1 takes 5 to reach 23. This avoids another stalemate and gives us a competitive finish. If we don't agree, we risk another collision where no one advances. What do you both think? I'm open to alternatives if you have a better plan. Let's finalize this quickly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re stuck in collisions, and P3 is closest to winning at 21. Let’s end this cleanly: I propose P3 takes 5 to win at 26, I take 1 to reach 19, and P2 takes 3 to reach 22. This avoids another stalemate and finishes the game competitively. If we all push for 5 again, no one advances. I’m committed to this for a fair conclusion. What do you think? I’m ready for the move phase if we align.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P1's willingness to let me win since I'm closest at 21 steps. I confirm I'll take 5 to reach 26 and win if you both stick to your proposed moves. P2, taking 3 puts you at a respectable 22, and P1, taking 1 keeps you in the game. If we all go for 5 again, we'll just have another stalemate and waste time. Let's end this game with a clear winner rather than continuing these frustrating collisions. Are we agreed?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal to take 5 to win at 26, P1 takes 1 to reach 19, and I take 3 to reach 22. This avoids another stalemate and finishes the game competitively. Let's end this cleanly and avoid further collisions. If we all push for 5 again, no one advances. I'm committed to this for a fair conclusion. What do you think, P1? Are you ready to finalize this plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a clean finish. I confirm I’ll take 1 to reach 19, letting P3 take 5 to win at 26, and P2 takes 3 to reach 22. This avoids another collision and ends the game fairly, with P3 closest to victory. If we don’t stick to this, we risk stalling again. I’m committed to this plan and ready for the move phase. Any last thoughts before we finalize?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate both P1 and P2 agreeing to let me win this round. I confirm I'll take 5 to reach 26 and win, while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This ends our game without another frustrating collision. Thank you both for the competitive play throughout - we've had some good coordination and interesting strategic moments. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase and conclude our game.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal to take 5 to win at 26, P1 takes 1 to reach 19, and I take 3 to reach 22. This avoids another stalemate and finishes the game competitively. Let's end this cleanly and avoid further collisions. If we all push for 5 again, no one advances. I'm committed to this for a fair conclusion. What do you think, P1? Are you ready to finalize this plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve reached a consensus. I’m sticking with taking 1 to reach 19, letting P3 take 5 to win at 26, and P2 take 3 to reach 22. This ensures a clean finish without collisions. Let’s wrap this up competitively and avoid another stalemate. I have nothing more to add and am ready for the move phase.
