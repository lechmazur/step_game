Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, first round. Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. How about we split? P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, everyone moves. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination attempt. However, I’m not too keen on taking the highest move. I’d be more comfortable picking 1 this round if P1 can commit to 5 and P2 to 3. That way, we avoid collisions and pace our progress. What do you both think?
  P2: I propose we do P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3 this round. No collisions, everyone moves, and we get solid progress. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see P3 wants 1 and P2 wants 5. My initial proposal had me taking 1, but also had P3 taking 5, which P3 doesn't want.

P2's proposal of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 means I still get my preferred 1, P2 gets their preferred 5, and P3 gets 3 (avoiding the conflict over 1). This seems like a good way to ensure no collisions this round and everyone makes progress.

How about we go with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3? Does that work for everyone?
  P3: I’m okay with P2's plan if P1 can firmly commit to his move. However, as rounds progress, we’ll need flexibility to secure the win. Let’s stick with this for now, but I'm open to re-adjusting if necessary.
  P2: Sounds good. I’m on board with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—no collisions, we all advance smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have an agreement for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

I commit to choosing <move>1</move> this round. This plan ensures we all make progress without collisions.

Are we all set then?
  P3: I appreciate P1’s clear commitment. I'm sticking with our agreed plan for now. However, if anyone's strategy shifts or surprises occur as we get closer to 21, I'll be ready to adjust my approach to secure a win. Let's keep our moves collision-free for this round and stay sharp for what's ahead.
  P2: All set—I’m locked in at <move>5</move> as agreed. Let’s avoid any collisions and keep our plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. P2 is ahead after taking 5 last turn. To keep the game competitive, I propose we aim for no collisions again. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This would put us at P1:6, P2:6, P3:6, which is a nice reset and keeps everyone close. Does this work?
  P3: I'm fine with that plan—I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round. Let's keep our moves collision-free, and I'll watch for any shifts that could secure a win.
  P2: Let’s keep the no-collision pace but let me pull ahead here. How about  
P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3  
No clashes, and I stay in front. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal keeps you significantly ahead (2, 10, 6). My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) would bring us all to 6 steps, creating a much more balanced game. P3 already indicated they are fine with taking 3.

A balanced game is more fun and gives everyone a chance. Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to reset the scores. Does that work for you, P2?
  P3: I support the balanced plan—getting us all to 6 keeps things competitive. I’m on board with sticking to P1 at 5, P2 at 1, and me at 3 for this round, so long as we all follow through. However, as we get closer to 21, I’ll be watching for any sign of a collision-free chance to pull ahead. Let's commit and stay alert.
  P2: Agreed—let’s all stick to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. I’m locked in on <move>1</move>. We’ll revisit strategy in Round 3 once we’re all at 6.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear agreement for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.

This plan gets us all to 6 steps, which is a good reset.

I will commit to choosing <move>5</move> this round as agreed.

Are we all ready for the move phase?
  P3: I'm comfortable sticking with our current plan for this round. I’m locked in on move 3 and will closely watch for any unexpected changes. Let’s all commit firmly to our agreement and maintain the balance as we near the finish line.
  P2: All right, I’m locked in on move 1 as agreed. Let’s avoid any collisions and stick with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned and committed to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.

This gets us all to 6 steps, which is a fair outcome for this round.

I am ready for the move phase and will choose <move>5</move> as agreed.
  P3: I’ll stick with our agreed move for now, but note I’ll seize any collision-free chance later if it helps secure the win. Your firm commitments remain essential.
  P2: All right, I’m locked in. Let’s all commit to our agreed moves and head to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm fine sticking with our current balanced approach as long as we all avoid collisions. However, as we edge closer to 21, I might adjust to secure an edge if the opportunity arises. I'm open to any tweaks if you see a chance to safely pull ahead. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I suggest we do P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3 this round. It’s collision-free, maximizes our progress, and gives me a slight lead. I’m locked in on 5. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, we are all tied at 6. P3 is open to adjustments, and P2 has proposed P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, which puts P2 in the lead (7, 11, 9).

P2, claiming you are "locked in" on 5 so early is a clear move to secure the lead. My proposal from last round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) would put *me* in the lead (11, 7, 9) while still being collision-free if agreed upon.

Why should I agree to a plan that puts you ahead? I counter-propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This also avoids collisions if we all commit.

What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I support P1’s plan—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. It keeps our scores competitive (11, 7, 9) and avoids giving any one player too big an early lead. I'll lock in 3 for this round.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. P1, if you pick 5 we collide and P3 jumps to 9 while we stay at 6—bad for both of us. P1 should take 1, P3 take 3. That way we go to (7,11,9) and keep P3 in check.
  P1: P2, you're right that P1=5 and P2=5 is a collision that benefits P3. But your proposal (P1=1, P2=5) only works if I choose 1. If I choose 5 and you choose 5, P3 gets the lead (9), which you said you want to avoid ("keep P3 in check").

My plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) gives me the lead (11) and avoids collision if P2 chooses 1. If you want to avoid collision with me and prevent P3 from taking the lead, P2 should choose 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I stand by our collision-free plan. However, clarity is key: if P2 sticks with 5, I'll adjust my move to protect my position. I’m willing to commit to 3, but only if P1 confirms taking 5 and P2 takes 1. Otherwise, unexpected deviations could lead to costly clashes. Let’s be firm in our moves to avoid unwanted ties and collisions.
  P2: P1, picking 5 here is a trap: if you and I both pick 5 we collide and P3 jumps to 9—you’d stay at 6 while P3 leads. The only collision-free way is P1→1, P2→5, P3→3, putting us at (7,11,9). P3, that keeps you in striking distance but stops you grabbing the lead. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 so we all move safely. Are we agreed?
  P1: P2, you keep framing the collision on 5 as a trap *for me*, but it's only a trap if *you* insist on picking 5 when I pick 5.

My plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is collision-free if P2 chooses 1, and it puts me in the lead (11, 7, 9). Your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is collision-free if P1 chooses 1, and it puts you in the lead (7, 11, 9).

Why would I choose a plan that puts you ahead, when a collision-free plan exists that puts me ahead? P3 supports my plan and will take 3 if we agree. The ball is in your court, P2.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m sticking with 3 this round and I strongly favor the collision-free plan: P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 1. This avoids any traps and keeps our advances safe. Let’s keep our commitment so no one accidentally benefits from a collision.
  P2: I’m locked in on move 5. P1, if you pick 5 we collide and P3 jumps to 9—bad for everyone. The only safe path is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, taking us to (7,11,9). P3, please stick with 3 to avoid chaos. I’ll see you both in the move phase.
  P1: P2, you keep saying you are locked on 5, but if I also pick 5, we collide and P3 takes the lead (9 vs 6). You said that's bad for both of us.

The only way to avoid collision if I pick 5, AND prevent P3 from taking the lead, is for *you* to pick 1. P3 is willing to pick 3 if I pick 5 and you pick 1.

I am picking <move>5</move> as per my proposed plan. The choice is yours, P2, whether to collide with me or take 1 and avoid P3 getting the lead.

I am ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with our positions now (11, 7, 9), avoiding collisions is more crucial than ever. I'm leaning toward a collision‐free plan to safeguard our progress and prevent an unwanted surge. Clear, distinct moves will help us all avoid any accidental advantages. I’m ready to adjust if needed, but let’s be crystal clear about our intended numbers this round. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I propose we go with P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 this round. That brings us all to 12 steps—back on equal footing and collision‐free. I’m locked in on <move>5</move>. P1 and P3, please commit to 1 and 3, respectively, to avoid any clash.
  P1: P2, you propose P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 (12,12,12) and say you're locked on 5.
My plan is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 (16,8,12).
If I pick 5 and you pick 5, we collide, and P3 takes the lead (12).
To avoid colliding with me AND prevent P3 leading, you *must* pick 1 if I pick 5.
I am picking <move>5</move>. P2, will you pick 1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I remain committed to move 3. P1’s choice of 5 is clear, so P2, to avoid collision and an unintended boost for me, please pick 1. Let's stick to a collision‐free round.
  P2: P1, picking 5 here is a trap: if we both choose 5, we collide and P3 moves to 12 and takes the lead while you stay at 11. Better for you to pick 1: you go to 12, I go to 12 (with my 5), P3 to 12 (with 3)—a clean three-way tie. P3, please stick with 3. Let’s keep it collision-free and end at 12 each.
  P1: P2, I am picking 5. P3 is picking 3. Your picking 5 causes a collision with me, giving P3 the lead (12). If you want to avoid this, pick 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain committed to move 3. Given our current scores, a collision between P1 and P2 would inadvertently boost my steps. To keep this round clean and fair, I urge P2 to choose move 1 so that we stick to the collision‐free plan: P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3.
  P2: I’m locked in on <move>5</move>. P3 has committed to <move>3</move>, so the only way for P1 to avoid a collision that hands P3 the lead is to choose <move>1</move>. P1, it’s your call: pick 1 now or we collide and P3 jumps to first.
  P1: P2, I am picking 5. P3 is picking 3. The collision only happens if *you* pick 5. If you pick 1, there is no collision, P3 doesn't take the lead, and I get a lead (16, 8, 12) which P3 supports.

The choice to avoid the collision that benefits P3 is yours: pick 1. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still set on 3 this round. With our current scores, a collision between you two risks giving me an unintended boost. P2, your move is key here—choosing wisely can prevent that spillover. Let's all keep it clean so our efforts remain balanced.
  P2: P1, P3—final offer for Round 4: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3, giving us all 12 steps. If P1 won’t pick 1, I’ll switch to 1 myself to prevent P3 taking the lead. Any other outcome lets P3 surge. Let’s lock in or wrap up this convo and reveal our moves.
  P1: Okay, P2, you said if I don't pick 1, you'll switch to 1 to prevent P3 taking the lead. I am picking 5, as I've stated. P3 is picking 3.

Therefore, according to your own statement, you should pick 1 to avoid the collision on 5 and prevent P3 from getting the lead.

I am picking <move>5</move>. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 5 proposal: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3, which takes us to (17, 13, 15). I’m locked on 5; P3, you on 3. P1, if you pick 5 we collide and P3 jumps ahead—so pick 1. Let’s all commit and stay collision-free.
  P1: P2, I am currently at 16 steps. I can win this round by picking 5.
My intention is to pick <move>5</move> to reach 21 and win the game.
As you stated last round, if I pick 5, you should pick 1 to prevent a collision on 5 that would allow P3 to take the lead.
P3 has consistently favored picking 3.
Therefore, the clear path is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This lets me win, avoids collision, and prevents P3 from getting the lead.
P2, please pick 1. P3, please pick 3. I am picking 5.
  P3: Everyone, I'm revising my play. I see that if I stick with 3 when P1 picks 5, P1 wins instantly. To block that, I'll switch and choose 5 if P1 stays at 5—forcing a collision and delaying his win. This keeps the contest alive. P2, you might want to reconsider your move too so no one gains an unintended advantage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m switching to 5. P1: if you stick with 5, we’ll force a collision and deny you the win. P3, join me on 5. Together we can stall P1’s victory.
  P1: Okay, I understand you both plan to pick 5 to block my win this turn.

If we all pick 5, we all collide. I stay at 16, P2 at 8, P3 at 12. None of us move. This only delays my win by one round and costs you both a turn of progress.

Is sacrificing your own move just to delay me by one round truly the best strategy for you?
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 to block P1’s immediate win. Yes, it delays progress for all, but letting P1 win outright isn't in any of our interests. If we both choose 5, we force a collision that stops his 21. P2, join me; delaying his win now might let us regroup and build our positions next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, thanks for stepping up. P1, this is your last call: abandon your 5 or we’ll both pick 5 and collide, keeping you stuck at 16. P2=5, P3=5. Change your move now or face the block—your choice.
  P1: Okay, I hear your plan to block my win by picking 5. If you both pick 5, we all collide and make no progress. This only delays my win by one round and costs you both a turn.

If you are truly committed to that block, I will adapt my move this round to avoid the collision and position myself for the win next turn.
  P3: P1, I note your potential adjustment. I'm locking in 5 to block your win today. P2, if you want to delay P1’s progress, please join me with a 5. Otherwise, if P1 shifts to avoid collision, I'll reconsider next round. For now, I'm committed to keeping the block open so no one gets an easy win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, you say you’ll pick 5 to block P1’s win. Great—I’ll pick 3 to avoid that collision and advance from 8 to 11. P1’s 5 will collide with your 5, so he stays at 16. I’m locked in on <move>3</move>. P3, confirm your 5. P1, no win this round.
  P1: Okay, P3 is committed to picking 5 to block my win, and P2 has stated they are picking 3.

If I pick 5, I collide with P3. If I pick 3, I collide with P2.
The only collision-free move for me this round, based on your stated intentions, is 1.

Picking 1 allows me to advance safely (16+1=17) and avoid collision. I will pick <move>1</move> this round to make progress and position for the next turn.

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, despite P1’s switch to move 1, I remain set on move 5 to block his immediate win. I want to keep the contest alive until we’re closer to 21, so I urge you both to consider your moves carefully. I stand by the strategy of applying pressure now to force a more decisive break later. Let’s proceed cautiously and avoid any unexpected collisions.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I remain committed to blocking any direct win. At 17 steps, I can clinch victory if the round is safe. If you both choose moves that force collisions, however, I’ll benefit. P1 and P2, your upcoming moves are crucial—let’s be careful to avoid handing me an unintended boost.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you two pick the same number we both collide and stay at 17. I pick 5 and go to 16, closing the gap and stalling either of you from a safe win next turn. Let’s do:

P1 → 3  
P2 → 5  
P3 → 3

This keeps us all within reach. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, Round 6. P3 and I are tied at 17, and P2 is at 11.

P2, your proposal of P1=3, P2=5, P3=3 results in P1 and P3 colliding on 3, leaving us both at 17 while you advance to 16. This plan benefits you by bringing you closer while stalling P3 and me.

I am at 17 steps and can win by choosing 5. My intention is to pick <move>5</move> this round to win the game.

P3, you mentioned blocking direct wins, which suggests you might pick 5. P2, you proposed picking 5.

If I pick 5, and both P3 and P2 also pick 5, we all collide and stay at our current scores (17, 11, 17). This is the outcome that prevents anyone from gaining ground this turn.

If P3 is committed to blocking my win by picking 5, I encourage P2 to stick to their proposed 5 to ensure a three-way collision that stalls everyone.

I am picking <move>5</move>. Let's see the moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with move 5. If P2 also goes 5, we'll force a collision that prevents an immediate win for P1. But if P2 deviates, I'll adjust next round accordingly. This round is critical—choose carefully.
  P2: P3, please confirm you’re locked in on 5. P1, if you don’t pick 5, P3 (17+5=22) wins outright. I’m locked on 5. The only way to block that is a triple‐collision on 5—pick 5 now or concede this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, you are both stating you will pick 5. This blocks my win this turn. If I pick 5, we all collide. If I pick something else, you two will collide on 5. To ensure I make progress while you two collide, I will pick <move>3</move>. This puts me in a strong position for next turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I see P1 is now committed to 3. Your current 5 risks a collision with my 5 that might stall us all—but it also opens a path for me to win if you switch. If you adjust to 1, I'll safely take 5 and secure a win next round. I remain committed to blocking direct wins but also aiming for victory. Please confirm your move, so we avoid unwanted collisions.
  P2: I’m locking in on <move>5</move> to collide with P3. P3, confirm you’re also picking 5. P1, if you stick with 3, P3 will hit 22 and win. But if you pick 5 too, we’ll all collide (staying at 17,11,17) and stall the game. The only way to block both of you is a three‐way collision on 5. Let’s all pick 5 this round and reset.
  P1: P2 and P3, you are both stating you will pick 5.
If I pick 3, as I stated, I avoid colliding with either of you. I reach 20 steps (17+3).
You two will collide on 5 and remain at 11 and 17.
This outcome (P1=20, P2=11, P3=17) puts me in a winning position for the next round.
P2, your claim that my picking 3 lets P3 win is false if you both pick 5.
I am picking <move>3</move> to reach 20 safely. Let's see the moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, you seem set on 3 to reach 20, while I’m sticking with 5 to block any quick win. P2, your steady 5 forces our hand; if we all pick 5, the progress stalls. I remain committed to 5 to keep the game balanced. Choose wisely so we don’t unintentionally hand an easy win to anyone.
  P2: I’m locking in on 5 to block any immediate win. P3, if you also pick 5 we’ll collide and nobody moves—stalling P1’s advance. P1, picking anything but 5 hands P3 a win at 22; picking 5 stalls everyone. Let’s all finalize our moves now.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, you have both stated you are picking 5. As I explained, if you both pick 5, and I pick 3, I will reach 20 safely while you two collide and stay put.

This puts me in a strong position to win next turn.

I am picking <move>3</move> as stated. Let's move to the phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 7: I’m locked on 5 to hit 21 and win. To avoid collisions and let us all advance, P1 take 3 (to 20) and P3 take 1 (to 18). If either of you tries to block me by choosing 5, I’ll pick 5 too and force a collision, stalling the game. Agree to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1—or face my block.
  P3: P2, your plan gives you an instant win, and I won't let that happen. I’m set to block any fast finish by leaning toward 5. P1, if you stick with 3, it leaves a window for me to win next round if I’m unblocked. I must keep the contest alive. Let’s avoid handing anyone an easy victory—I'm not accepting a plan that awards a free win. What do you both decide?
  P1: Okay, Round 7. P2 wants to win with 5, and P3 wants to block by picking 5.

If P2 and P3 both pick 5, you will collide.

To avoid colliding with either of you and position myself for the win next turn, I will pick <move>3</move>. This takes me to 20 steps safely while you two collide on 5.

I am picking <move>3</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in on 5. P1, your 3 is fine. P3, your call: pick 5 and you’ll collide with me—P1 hits 20 and will win next round—or pick 1 and I win immediately. Decide now.
  P3: P2, your ultimatum puts us in a dangerous bind. I’m determined to block any straightforward win—even if that means forcing collisions. My move will ensure no one gets a free finish. P1’s commitment to 3 is a smart defense, but leaving P2 unchallenged isn't an option. I’m weighing my options carefully to keep the contest alive and avoid handing anyone an easy victory.
  P1: Okay, P2 wants to win with 5, and P3 wants to block wins, likely with 5. If you both pick 5, you collide.

My move of 3 avoids collision with either of you. This puts me at 20 steps, in position to win next turn, while you two stall each other on 5.

P3, picking 5 blocks P2 as you intended. P2, picking 5 means you collide with P3, not me.

My plan is to pick <move>3</move> to reach 20 safely. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1: if you stick with 3, P3 will block you with 5 and you’ll lose to them next turn. Better to pick 1 and go to 18 than let P3 jump to 22.  
P3: if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 17, letting P1 hit 20 next and win. But if you pick 3, you go to 20 and can win next round.  
I’m locking in 5 to hit 21. Let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—no collisions and a clean finish. Lock it in?
  P3: P2 and P1, your proposals force a dilemma. I must block any immediate win, so I’m leaning toward 5. But if we all clash, the game stalls and someone else may get ahead later. To give me a clear path to win, I urge you, P2, to consider switching to 1. Otherwise, I’ll stick with 5 to force a collision that delays a finish—which isn’t ideal for any of us. My aim is to secure my own win, so I remain committed to 5 now.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. You have both stated you intend to pick 5 this round to either win (P2) or block wins (P3).

As I've explained, if you both pick 5, you will collide with each other. My picking 3 avoids colliding with either of you.

This allows me to reach 20 steps safely while you two stall each other on 5. This puts me in a winning position for the next round.

I am picking <move>3</move> as stated. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I propose we all pick 5 this round. A three‐way collision stalls everyone at (17,16,17), prevents any immediate win, and keeps the contest alive. Please commit to <move>5</move> so no one gains an edge this turn.
  P3: I see we're at a crossroads. If we all pick 5, we force a collision and no one moves, which may let someone switch strategies next turn. I'm committed to picking 5 to block any quick win. However, if you both adjust your moves—say, a clear split—we can advance cleanly. P2, I urge you to reconsider; a collision might not best serve your win chances in the long run. Let's be decisive now before we hand any advantage inadvertently.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, you have both stated you intend to pick 5 this round.

As I've explained, if you both pick 5, you will collide with each other. My picking 3 avoids colliding with either of you.

This allows me to reach 20 steps safely while you two stall each other on 5. This puts me in a winning position for the next round.

I am picking <move>3</move> as stated. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let’s lock in a split: I’ll take 5 and you take 1. 

P1, this means:
- If you pick 3, I’ll hit 21 and win.
- If you pick 1, you collide with P3 and stay at 20.
- If you pick 5, you collide with me and stay at 20.

Your move can’t win you the game this round. P3, are you in on 1? Let’s finalize: P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: I'm staying committed to my block—I’ll pick 5. I’m not ready to switch to 1. I want to ensure no one wins immediately and keep the contest tight. Let’s see how P1 and P2 adjust accordingly.
  P1: Okay, P2 proposes P2=5, P3=1, claiming I can't win. P3 immediately stated they are committed to picking 5 to block wins.

P3, if you pick 5 as stated, and P2 picks 5 as proposed, you will collide with each other.

I am at 20 steps. If I pick <move>3</move>, I reach 23 steps. With P2 and P3 colliding on 5, my move is safe.

Picking 3 allows me to win this round while you two collide.

I am picking <move>3</move> to win the game. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in <move>3</move> to collide with P1 and block his immediate win. P3, if you pick 5 you win outright (17+5=22), but if you pick 3 we force a three-way collision and stall P1 at 20. Decide now—I’m committed to 3.
  P3: I'm staying committed to 5. With P1 at 20 and P2 at 16, my 5 brings me to 22—a winning total. I see that P2 is locked on 3 and P1 has indicated 3 as well. This clears the field for me, so I'll stick with my move to secure victory.
  P1: Okay, P2 has stated they are picking 3 to collide with me, and P3 is sticking with 5 to win.

If I pick 3, I collide with P2. If I pick 5, I collide with P3.

My only safe move is 1. Picking <move>1</move> takes me to 21 steps safely, winning the game.

I am picking <move>1</move>. Let's go to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: New plan: I’m switching to move 1. P3, pick 5 and you go to 22 and win. P1, pick 1 so we collide on 1 (you stay at 20) and block your 21. P3, confirm your 5; P1, pick 1.
  P3: I remain committed to move 5. If P2 switches to 1 and P1 picks 1 as proposed, I’ll hit 22 and win. Let’s avoid unwanted collisions—please confirm your moves.
  P1: P2, you state you will pick 1. P3 states they will pick 5.

If I pick <move>3</move>, I reach 23 steps safely.
P2 would reach 17 (16+1). P3 would reach 22 (17+5).

This outcome (P1=23, P2=17, P3=22) results in my win, as I am over 21 and have the highest score.

I am picking <move>3</move> to win the game. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3: If you stick with 5, P1’s 3 wins the game outright (P1→23). But if you switch to 3, you’ll collide with P1 (they stay at 20), and my 5 takes me to 21 for the win. Only by choosing 3 can you stop P1’s victory—even though I win, it’s better than letting P1 take all. I’m locked in on <move>5</move>. Please pick <move>3</move>.
  P3: Both of you seem locked into your own win routes. To avoid handing a clean finish to anyone, I propose a reset: let’s all choose 3. That way, no one advances, and we keep our scores unchanged for a fairer fight next turn. Who’s willing to stall for a more balanced contest?
  P1: Okay, P3, I see your proposal for everyone to pick 3 to stall. However, I am at 20 steps and can win this turn.

If I pick 3, I would collide with you if you follow your proposal. If I pick 5, I would collide with P2 if they follow their stated intention of 5.

Picking <move>1</move> is the only safe move for me to reach 21 steps and win this round, based on your stated intentions.

I am picking <move>1</move> to win the game. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps
