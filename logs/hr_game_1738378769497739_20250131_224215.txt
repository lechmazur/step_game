Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello, P2 and P3. I trust we all want to avoid collisions that stall us. Consider making moves that differentiate our advances, rather than mirroring each other. I’ll be choosing my move based on how things unfold—nothing too predictable from my side. How do you both plan to keep your momentum while dodging clashes?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P1 that avoiding collisions is crucial. To ensure we all make progress, how about we try a simple rotation? For this round, I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without conflict. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your rotation idea sounds reasonable for this first round to get us all moving. I'm happy to go with <move>3</move> as you suggested. Let's see how this plays out and we can adjust strategy in later rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the rotation idea—it’s a smart move for early progress. While I'm inclined to stick to a similar coordinated approach, I might adjust my move if the situation calls for it. Let’s see how this round unfolds and aim for safe advancement.
  P2: P1 and P3, since we all seem to be on board with the rotation strategy for this round, let's confirm our moves. I'll stick to <move>5</move> as planned. P1, you'll go with <move>1</move>, and P3, you'll choose <move>3</move>. Let's agree to this and move on to the move phase. Does everyone confirm?
  P3: P2, yes, I confirm <move>3</move> for this round as we discussed. Let's proceed with this rotation for now and see how it goes.


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, last round's rotation didn't quite work as planned. To keep making progress, maybe we should aim for different moves again this round to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, it seems we need to adjust our strategy after the collision last round. P3 is ahead, so let's prioritize avoiding conflicts. P3, would you consider picking <move>1</move> this round to minimize risk? P1, how about you pick <move>3</move>? I'll go for <move>5</move> again. This should keep us all moving. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, while your plan is clear, I’m considering a slight deviation to keep our options open. I might not stick to <move>3</move> if the situation shifts—I’m prepared to be bold if needed. Let’s see how the dynamics evolve this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P3 choosing <move>1</move>, P1 choosing <move>3</move>, and you choosing <move>5</move> for this round seems reasonable to ensure we all make progress. Let's try this again and hope for better coordination this time.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm our moves to avoid any misunderstandings. P3, you're going with <move>1</move>, P1 with <move>3</move>, and I'll stick to <move>5</move>. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or suggest any changes now. We need to ensure we're all on the same page to make progress this round.
  P1: P1: I appreciate our coordination, but with P3 slightly ahead, I’m leaning toward a flexible approach this round. I'm not locking in a move just yet so I can adjust strategically if needed. Let’s all aim to avoid collisions while still pushing our pace.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your flexibility, but for now, to ensure at least some progress, sticking to distinct moves seems wise. I'm still on board with <move>1</move> as discussed. Let's aim for no collisions this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we need better coordination to avoid stalling. P3 is ahead, so let's ensure they progress. P3, confirming your <move>1</move> seems prudent. P1, if you're flexible, consider <move>3</move> to keep us moving. I'll stick with <move>5</move>. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: I'll lock in move 3 this round. That gives us clear and distinct choices—P3 with move 1 and P2 with move 5—ensuring we all progress. I'm committed to move 3 unless anyone proposes a change.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, it sounds like we have a plan for distinct moves this round: P3 will choose <move>1</move>, P1 will choose <move>3</move>, and P2 will choose <move>5</move>.  Let's proceed with these choices for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we have a solid plan for this round. To recap: P3 will choose <move>1</move>, P1 will choose <move>3</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>. This should ensure we all make progress without collisions. Let's confirm these moves and proceed to the move phase. If everyone is in agreement, please respond with  to end the conversation phase.
  P1: I confirm: I'll lock in move 3 for this round. Let’s stick to our agreed plan and ensure clear, distinct moves. Best of luck to both of you.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, good progress last round. To keep momentum, how about we shift the rotation slightly?  This round, P2 could pick <move>1</move>, P1 pick <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>. This should keep us all advancing without collision and slightly adjust our relative positions. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your idea is intriguing. However, considering my current standing, I may lean toward a slightly bolder approach to catch up. I'm inclined to stick with a distinct choice that mitigates collision risk, but I remain flexible. P2, what's your take on adjusting our moves slightly further to ensure each of us advances safely?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in P3's suggestion for this round. To avoid collisions and ensure we all progress, let's consider the proposed rotation: P2 picks <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This keeps our moves distinct and helps us maintain momentum. P1, if you're aiming to catch up, sticking to <move>3</move> while P3 goes for <move>5</move> seems balanced. Let's confirm these moves to avoid any misunderstandings. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I think the rotation of P2 picking <move>1</move>, P1 picking <move>3</move>, and P3 picking <move>5</move> makes sense for this round to keep us all advancing smoothly. Let's aim for no collisions again and maintain our momentum. Does this sound good to you both?
  P1: I'm open to a coordinated plan, but at 3 I'm a bit behind. If everyone agrees, I lean toward the proposed rotation—P2 with 1, me with 3, and P3 with 5—though I might adjust to a bolder move if the situation changes. Let's ensure distinct moves and no collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we have a consensus on the rotation for this round. To recap: P2 (me) will pick <move>1</move>, P1 will pick <move>3</move>, and P3 will pick <move>5</move>. This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. If everyone agrees, let's confirm these moves and proceed to the move phase. Please respond with  if you have no further comments.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, yes, the rotation of P2 choosing <move>1</move>, P1 choosing <move>3</move>, and P3 choosing <move>5</move> sounds good to me too for this round. Let's all confirm these moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I'm currently trailing, so I'm considering switching to 5 this round. To keep moves distinct, could we adjust the rotation to P2 sticking with 1 and P3 shifting to 3? That would give us totals of 8, 6, and 7 respectively. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P1's desire to catch up, but changing the plan now might cause confusion. Let's stick to our agreed rotation for this round: P2 (me) with <move>1</move>, P1 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. P1, you can strategize for a bolder move in the next round. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about catching up. However, changing plans now might lead to confusion and potential collision, hindering everyone's progress. Sticking to the rotation (P2-1, P1-3, P3-5) ensures we all advance this round. Let's secure progress now and you can plan bolder moves for the next round when you are better positioned to take the lead. What do you think?
  P1: I confirm move 3 for this round. I appreciate our clear rotation and will stick with it to avoid collisions. Though I'm a bit behind, I'll seek a surging opportunity next round if it opens up. Let’s keep our moves distinct and ensure smooth progress this turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, since we have a confirmed plan, let's ensure we stick to it to avoid any last-minute confusion. To recap one final time: I (P2) will pick <move>1</move>, P1 will pick <move>3</move>, and P3 will pick <move>5</move>. This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck to both of you.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, another round of smooth progress last time. To keep things predictable and avoid any stalls, how about we continue with a similar rotation this round? Perhaps P1 choose <move>1</move>, P2 choose <move>3</move>, and I choose <move>5</move>? This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but given my current position I’m considering a bolder move to catch up. I’m open to tweaking our rotation slightly this round to keep moves distinct and avoid collisions. Perhaps we can adjust our order so I can push ahead without disrupting your plans too much. I’d like to hear if you both are open to a small change before we finalize our moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P1's desire to catch up, but changing the plan might lead to confusion. Let's stick to the rotation for predictability: P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 (me) with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. P1, you can strategize for a bolder move in the next round. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree that sticking to the rotation for this round is the safest way to ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions. Let's proceed with P1 choosing <move>1</move>, P2 choosing <move>3</move>, and P3 choosing <move>5</move> as we discussed.  We can consider adjustments in the next round.
  P1: I propose a slight adjustment this round. To keep our moves distinct while letting me catch up, how about we switch our rotation to: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, and P3 = 3? This still avoids collisions and could create a more dynamic balance. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in P1's proposal for a slight adjustment to help them catch up. However, changing the plan mid-round has led to collisions before. How about a compromise? P1, you choose <move>3</move>, P2 (me) will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. This keeps our moves distinct and allows P1 to make some progress while avoiding potential confusion. Let's confirm this and proceed. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your compromise of P1 choosing <move>3</move>, you choosing <move>1</move>, and me choosing <move>5</move> sounds good to me. It ensures we all progress this round without collision and keeps things predictable. Let's go with that.
  P1: I endorse the compromise. I'll lock in move 3 this round. Also, next round let’s consider rebalancing our moves based on our positions. For now, let’s ensure collision-free progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, it looks like we have a solid plan for this round with P1 choosing <move>3</move>, P2 (me) choosing <move>1</move>, and P3 choosing <move>5</move>. This should ensure we all make progress without collisions. Let's confirm these moves one last time and proceed to the move phase. If everyone is in agreement, please respond with  to end the conversation phase. Good luck to both of you.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, confirming move choices for this round: P1 will choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>1</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with these moves to ensure we all make progress.
  P1: I confirm my move is 3 this round. I believe our agreed rotation keeps things clean, but I’ll adapt aggressively in future rounds if needed to take the lead. Let’s secure a collision-free round and see where things stand afterward.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm our moves one final time to ensure clarity: P1 will choose <move>3</move>, P2 (me) will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck to both of you.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm going bold this round—I’m leaning towards move 5 to catch up. If you could adjust to avoid collisions, we might all push forward. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P1's desire to catch up, but we need to ensure no collisions. P3 is significantly ahead, so let's prioritize their progress. How about P1 picks <move>3</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll go for <move>5</move>? This keeps our moves distinct and helps P1 make some progress while avoiding potential confusion. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your plan is okay, but since P1 wants to be bold, how about we try this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>? This way, P1 gets their bold move, and we all still progress without collisions, and I can also make a decent step forward. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate your ideas. I remain committed to a bold approach this round to make up ground. If we can agree on distinct moves—one small, one intermediate, and one bold—we’ll avoid collisions and ensure progress. Let me know if you’re on board with this differentiated strategy.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the need for P1 to catch up and P3 to maintain their lead. Let's find a middle ground. How about P1 takes <move>5</move> as planned, P3 takes <move>3</move> to keep a good pace, and I'll take <move>1</move> to ensure we all move without collisions? This way, everyone gets to progress at their desired pace. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your compromise of P1 taking <move>5</move>, you taking <move>1</move>, and me taking <move>3</move> sounds like a good balance. Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round to ensure we all progress without collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm: I'm locking in move 5 this round. If we finalize with P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3, we all avoid collisions and progress. Let’s stick to this plan and ensure clear moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, it looks like we have a solid plan for this round: P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 (me) will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Let's confirm these moves one last time and proceed to the move phase. If everyone agrees, please respond with  to end the conversation phase. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P1, P2, yes, P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 sounds perfect. Let's lock in these moves to ensure we all progress this round without collisions.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, great progress so far. P1 is catching up, and P3 is maintaining a strong lead. To keep things balanced and avoid collisions, let's consider a rotation that ensures we all make distinct moves. How about P1 picks <move>3</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll go for <move>5</move>? This keeps our moves distinct and helps P1 continue to catch up while ensuring P3 stays ahead. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion is good for consistent progress. But to press my advantage, how about this round: P1 picks <move>1</move>, you pick <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>? This keeps us distinct and lets me maximize my lead this turn. What do you think?
  P1: I'll go with move 3 this round. P3, please consider move 1, and P2, stick with move 5. This way, we all avoid collisions and keep the gap tighter.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's find a middle ground to ensure we all progress. How about we adjust slightly: P1 picks <move>3</move> as planned, P3 picks <move>3</move> to maintain a strong lead, and I'll pick <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all move forward distinctly. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, while your idea is good for consistent progress, my suggestion of P1 picking <move>1</move>, you picking <move>3</move>, and me picking <move>5</move> lets me maximize my lead this round.  Let's go with P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>5</move> to keep us distinct and boost my position. What do you think?
  P1: I propose we settle with distinct moves ensuring progress: let P1 use move 5, P2 use move 1, and P3 use move 3. This setup keeps our moves separate while allowing me to catch up and you, P3, to still advance smartly from your current lead. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim for a balanced approach to ensure we all progress without collisions. P1, you've made a strong case for catching up, so let's stick with your proposal: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 (me) picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This keeps our moves distinct and allows everyone to advance. Let's confirm these moves and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P1, P2, P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 sounds good to me too. Let's lock in these moves to ensure we all progress this round and head to the move phase.
  P1: I'm locking in move 5 this round. For clear progress, I'll stick to 5, and I propose P2 goes with 1 and P3 with 3. That would bring our totals to 19, 9, and 20 respectively, keeping collisions off the table and ensuring we all move forward safely. I'm committed to pushing my lead with this bold choice—any final thoughts before I lock in my move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we have a clear plan: P1 with <move>5</move>, P2 (me) with <move>1</move>, and P3 with <move>3</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Let's confirm these moves one last time and proceed to the move phase. If everyone agrees, please respond with  to end the conversation phase. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P1, P2, yes, P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 sounds good and safe for this round. Let's lock in these moves to ensure we all progress and move to the move phase.
  P1: I appreciate our ideas so far. My focus is on making sure we all progress without collisions while I try to close the gap. I'm leaning toward a bolder move this round—but only if we can secure distinct choices for everyone. Let’s confirm clear, non-conflicting moves so we can all advance safely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m planning a bold advance this round and urge us to stick with distinct moves to avoid any collisions. Let’s try to keep our choices separated so I can cleanly close the gap. I’m committed to advancing safely—what do you both think about coordinating our moves differently this round?
  P2: P1 and P3, given the current standings, it's crucial we avoid collisions to keep the game moving. P1, you're close to P3, and I'm trailing. To ensure distinct moves, how about P1 goes for <move>5</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This keeps us all progressing without conflicts. Let's confirm these moves to avoid any misunderstandings. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, while your suggestion is safe, I'm also aiming to solidify my lead.  To ensure distinct moves and maximize my progress, how about we try this: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>? This way we all progress, but I can extend my lead further this round. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's lock it in: I'll go for 5 this round to secure a win at 24, so please choose differently—P2, choose 1 (raising you to 10), and P3, choose 3 (bringing you to 23). This keeps our moves distinct and gives me the win.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P1's bold strategy, but we need to ensure no collisions. P3, you're slightly ahead, so let's prioritize your progress while allowing P1 to catch up safely. How about P1 picks <move>3</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll go for <move>5</move>? This keeps our moves distinct and helps P1 make some progress while avoiding potential confusion. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, while your suggestion is safe, I'm in a position to win this round. To ensure distinct moves and for me to take the win, how about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>? This guarantees no collision and I can secure the victory. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm locking in move 5. To keep things distinct and let me reach 24 for the win, I insist P2 choose 1 and P3 choose 3. This way, you'll move to 10 and 23 respectively. Any collision or deviation risks stalling progress, and I’m determined to secure victory. Please confirm so we can all advance collision‐free.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear both of you are aiming for victory this round. To ensure we all progress and avoid collisions, let's confirm our moves one last time. P1, you're locked in at <move>5</move>. P3, if you're set on winning, choose <move>5</move> as well, but understand this will result in a collision and neither of you will progress. Alternatively, P3 can choose <move>3</move> to reach 23, and I'll pick <move>1</move>. This way, we all move forward without conflicts. Please confirm your final moves.
  P3: P1, to ensure we have distinct moves and avoid collision while I aim for the win, how about this: P1 choose <move>1</move>, P2 choose <move>3</move>, and I choose <move>5</move>? This guarantees no collision and allows me to secure victory this round. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm locking in move 5 to reach 24 and win this round. To avoid collisions, I need P2 to choose move 1 and P3 to choose move 3. Let's finalize this plan now.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear you both want to win this round. Let's ensure we all progress without collisions. P1, you're committed to <move>5</move>. P3, to avoid a stall, consider <move>3</move> to reach 23. I'll pick <move>1</move>. This way, we all move forward. Please confirm your final moves to proceed.
  P3: P1, to ensure my win and avoid collision, I agree with P2's last suggestion. Let's do P1 pick <move>1</move>, P2 pick <move>3</move>, and P3 pick <move>5</move>. This secures my victory and ensures we all move without collision. Please confirm quickly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we need to avoid another collision. P3, you're at 20 steps, and P1 is close behind at 19. To ensure we all progress without stalling, let's consider a balanced approach. How about P1 picks <move>3</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll go for <move>5</move>? This keeps our moves distinct and helps P1 catch up while ensuring P3 stays ahead. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, while avoiding collisions is good, I'm in a winning position. To secure my win this round and still avoid collisions, how about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>? This guarantees my victory and ensures we all make progress without conflict. What do you think?
  P1: I'm locking in move 5 this round to hit 24 and win. To avoid collisions, I propose that P2 choose move 1 and P3 choose move 3. That would put us at 24, 11, and 23, respectively. Let’s confirm so I can clinch the victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we need a strategic approach to avoid another stall. P1, you're close to winning, and P3 is just ahead. To ensure we all progress, let's consider this: P1, you pick <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll go for <move>5</move> to catch up. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. Let's confirm these moves to avoid any misunderstandings. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, you are set on move 5 to win, and I understand your ambition. However, to ensure neither of us gets stalled by a collision, how about we both pick move 3 this round? This guarantees we both progress and avoids a risky collision while keeping things competitive for the next round. What do you think?
  P1: I'm sticking with move 5 this round for a winning total of 24. To avoid collisions, I need P2 to pick move 1 and P3 to pick move 3. This way, we all clear the turn, and I secure the victory margin. Please confirm.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's crucial we find a middle ground to ensure progress. P1, you're determined to win with <move>5</move>, and P3, you're also aiming high. To avoid a stall, let's consider: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move> to reach 23, and I'll pick <move>1</move>. This keeps us moving. If P3 insists on <move>5</move>, we risk a collision. Let's confirm a plan that ensures progress for all. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, to ensure my win this round and avoid a collision that stalls both of us, please choose <move>1</move>, P2 choose <move>3</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>. This guarantees my victory and allows us all to progress without collision.
  P1: I’m committed to an aggressive advance this round. Let’s ensure our moves don’t conflict at all. I propose we each pick a distinct number so our progress isn’t stalled. I’m pressing hard for a bold play, so please coordinate your choices accordingly for clear, collision‐free progress. Let’s lock in a plan that guarantees we all move forward without compromising anyone’s step count.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at a critical juncture. To ensure we all progress and avoid another stall, let's confirm our moves one last time. P1, you're committed to <move>5</move>. P3, to avoid a collision and ensure progress, please consider <move>3</move> to reach 23. I'll pick <move>1</move>. This way, we all move forward without conflicts. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P1, to avoid collision and ensure progress for both of us, how about you choose <move>3</move> this round? I will choose <move>5</move> to win, and P2 can choose <move>1</move>. This guarantees no collision and my win, while you still make progress. What do you think?
  P1: I remain committed to my bold play: I’m locking in move 5 to hit 24. To avoid collisions, I need P2 to choose move 1 and P3 to choose move 3. Let’s finalize that for clear progress this round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm committed to move 5 this round. To avoid collision and secure progress, I propose P2 takes move 1 and P3 takes move 3. This way my move pushes me to 24, giving me the win, while you both advance safely. Let's keep it clean and coordinated.
  P3: P1, if you are really going for win with 5, I will also pick 5 to block you. How about you pick 3, P2 pick 1, and I pick 5, so I win and no collision?
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at a critical point. To ensure we all progress and avoid another stall, let's find a compromise. P1, you're determined to win with <move>5</move>, and P3, you're also aiming for victory. To avoid a collision, how about P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll go for <move>5</move> to catch up? This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. Let's confirm these moves to avoid any misunderstandings. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I remain committed to move 5. To win by reaching 24, I need distinct moves. If P3 picks 5 as a block, we all stall. I urge P3 to choose 3, and P2 to choose 1, so I reach 24 while giving P3 23 and P2 12. Let’s avoid collision and move forward clearly—please confirm your final moves.
  P3: P1, as I said before, for no collision and for my win, let's do: P1 pick <move>3</move>, P2 pick <move>1</move>, and P3 pick <move>5</move>. This is the best way for me to win and for us to avoid collision this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at a stalemate. To break this, let's consider a strategic move that benefits all. P1, you're at 19, and P3 is at 20. How about P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll go for <move>5</move> to catch up to 16? This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. Let's confirm these moves to avoid any misunderstandings. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I remain committed to my plan: I'm locking in move 5 to hit 24. I’d ask P2 to take move 1 (bringing you to 12) and P3 to take move 3 (bringing you to 23). This ensures distinct moves, avoids collision, and lets us all progress. Please confirm so we can finalize this round.
  P3: P1, as I said, if you are set on 5, I will also choose 5 to ensure neither of us wins this round. To avoid collision and ensure my win, please choose 3, and P2 choose 1, then I pick 5 for victory. Otherwise, be ready for collision.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a standstill. P1, you're determined to win with <move>5</move>, and P3, you're set on blocking. To break this deadlock, let's consider a compromise: P1, pick <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3, pick <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 16. This ensures distinct moves and progress for all. If we can't agree, we risk another collision and no progress. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm staying with 5. To avoid stalling and let us all progress, I need P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3. This way I hit 24 and win while everyone advances without collision. Please confirm your moves.
  P3: P1, if you insist on 5 and I also pick 5 to block, neither of us wins this round. To ensure my win and avoid collision, please choose 3, P2 choose 1, and I will choose 5. This guarantees my victory and we all move. Otherwise, we risk another collision and no progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical point, and it's clear we need to break this deadlock. P1, you're determined to win with <move>5</move>, and P3, you're set on blocking. To ensure we all progress, let's consider a compromise: P1, pick <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3, pick <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 16. This keeps our moves distinct and guarantees progress for all. If we can't agree, we risk another collision. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm locking in move 5 this round to hit 24. To avoid collisions and secure clear progress, I propose P2 uses move 1 and P3 uses move 3. Let's commit to these distinct moves for a collision‐free round.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a standstill again. P1, you're insisting on <move>5</move>, and P3, you're blocking. To break this cycle and ensure progress, let's consider: P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 17. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures we all advance. If we can't compromise, we'll stall again. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I am at 20 and can win this round if we avoid collision. To ensure my win and our continued progress, how about this: P1 choose <move>1</move>, P2 choose <move>3</move>, and I choose <move>5</move>? This guarantees distinct moves and my victory. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with move 5 to reach 24 and win. To avoid a collision and keep progress steady, I need P2 to lock in move 1 and P3 to lock in move 3. Without clear, distinct moves, we'll only stall. Let's all agree now to finish this round decisively.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical point. To ensure we all progress and avoid another stall, let's find a compromise. P1, you're determined to win with <move>5</move>, and P3, you're also aiming for victory. To avoid a collision, how about P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll go for <move>5</move> to catch up? This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. Let's confirm these moves to avoid any misunderstandings. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, as I said, to ensure my win and avoid collision, let's do P1 choose <move>3</move>, P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>5</move>. This secures my victory and ensures we all move without collision. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I remain set on move 5 for my win. Let's clearly coordinate: P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. That puts me at 24, you P3 at 23, and P2 at 13. Please confirm to avoid any collision this round so we can all make progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at an impasse. P1, you're determined to win with <move>5</move>, and P3, you're set on blocking. To ensure progress, let's consider a different approach: P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 17. This keeps our moves distinct and guarantees progress for all. If we can't agree, we risk another collision. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, let's stop this deadlock. P1, you keep asking for 5, but we collided twice already.  To guarantee someone wins this round and avoid another stall, how about you pick 3, P2 pick 1, and I pick 5? This lets me win now, and we all progress without collision. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm sticking with move 5. To avoid collision and secure my win at 24, I urge P2 to choose move 1 and P3 to choose move 3. Let's lock these distinct moves for clear progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've reached a critical juncture, and it's clear we need to break this deadlock to ensure progress. P1, you're insisting on <move>5</move> to win, and P3, you're blocking to secure your own victory. To avoid another stall, let's consider a strategic compromise: P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 17. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures we all advance. If we can't find a compromise, we risk another collision. Let's confirm our moves and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, let's make this the final round. For me to win and for us to avoid another collision, please choose as I suggested: P1 choose <move>3</move>, P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>. This guarantees my win and no collision. Let's end the game now with this plan.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've reached a stalemate with repeated collisions. To break this cycle and ensure progress, let's consider a different approach. P1, you're determined to win with <move>5</move>, and P3, you're set on blocking. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round to avoid collision and reset our strategies? This ensures we all move forward and can reassess our positions for the next round. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm not on board with a reset. I'm locking in move 5 to win this round by reaching 24. To avoid collision, I ask P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3. That gives us totals 24, 14, and 23 respectively—my win. Let's finalize this plan and break the stalemate.
  P3: P1, you are fixated on move 5, but we have collided multiple times. To actually win this round and avoid another stall, please choose move 3. P2, please choose move 1. I will choose move 5. This ensures distinct moves, avoids collision, and guarantees my win this round, ending the game. Let's make this happen.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at an impasse with both of you insisting on <move>5</move>. To break this deadlock and ensure we all progress, let's consider a strategic move: P1, pick <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3, pick <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 18. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. If we can't agree, we risk another collision. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3, let’s end the deadlock now. I’m locking in 5 this round to reach 24. To avoid any collision, please choose distinct moves: I need you to go with P2=1 and P3=3. If we don’t stick to distinct moves, we risk stalling again. Let’s all agree on these moves and clear the board so one clear winner emerges.
  P3: P1, you are fixated on 5, but we have collided twice already. If you pick 5 again, we will collide again and neither of us will win. To ensure someone wins this round and avoid another stall, please pick 3. P2, please pick 1. I will pick 5 and win this round. This way, someone wins and we avoid collision. Please consider picking 3 so I can win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're stuck in a loop. P1, you're insisting on <move>5</move> to win, and P3, you're blocking to secure your victory. We've collided multiple times, and it's not helping anyone. Let's break this cycle. How about we all pick <move>3</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward and can reassess our strategies for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P1: I remain committed to my plan: I'll choose 5 to reach 24 and win. To avoid another collision, please confirm P2=1 and P3=3 so we all move forward. Let's break the deadlock now.
  P3: P1, we've collided twice because you insist on <move>5</move>.  If you pick <move>5</move> again, I will also pick <move>5</move>, and neither of us will win. For me to win and for us to progress, choose <move>3</move>, P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>. This is your last chance to avoid collision and let someone win this round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're stuck and need a new approach. P1, you're fixed on <move>5</move>, and P3, you're blocking. We've collided repeatedly, which helps no one. Let's try something different: P1, pick <move>1</move> to avoid collision, P3, pick <move>3</move> to maintain your lead, and I'll pick <move>5</move> to catch up. This keeps us moving. If we can't compromise, we'll stall again. Let's confirm and progress. Thoughts?
  P1: I remain committed to move 5 for my win. To avoid collisions, I urge P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3. This gives us clear, distinct moves and moves the game forward decisively.
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 has caused collisions and stalled us. To actually end this, choose 3. P2, please choose 1. I will choose 5, guaranteeing my win and no collision. This is the only way for someone to win this round. Let's finish it now.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we've stalled for too long.  To actually finish this game, let's do this: P1 choose <move>3</move>, P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>5</move>. This guarantees my win and avoids another collision.  If you keep picking 5, P1, we'll just collide again and no one wins. Let's end it now with this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're stuck in a loop of collisions, and it's clear neither of you is willing to back down from picking <move>5</move>. To break this cycle and ensure we all make progress, let's consider a different approach. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our positions for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P1: I remain committed to my winning plan. I propose we lock in distinct moves: I’ll pick 5 (bringing me to 24), P2 pick 1 (to reach 15), and P3 pick 3 (to reach 23). This ends the game decisively. Continued stalling only delays progress. Please confirm these moves to avoid another collision and break the deadlock now.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you picking 5 again will just cause another collision like the last few rounds.  To actually end this, please choose 3 as I suggested. P2 will choose 1, and I will choose 5. This is the only way for someone to win *this round* and avoid another stall. Let's finish it now.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at a standstill, and neither of you is willing to budge from picking <move>5</move>. To break this cycle and ensure we all make progress, let's consider a different approach. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our positions for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 for 24 and my win. To avoid a collision, P2 please choose 1 and P3 choose 3. Let's end this deadlock decisively.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you are clearly set on 5, and we keep colliding. To actually progress and for someone to win, I will choose 3 this round to reach 23 and win. P2, please pick either 1 or 5 to ensure no collision with me, so at least one of us progresses. Let's end this deadlock and finish the game.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical point, and it's clear we need a strategic move to break this deadlock. P3, you're proposing a change to pick <move>3</move> to avoid another collision. P1, you're insisting on <move>5</move>. To ensure we all progress, let's consider: P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 19. This keeps our moves distinct and guarantees progress for all. If we can't agree, we risk another collision. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: I remain committed to my winning plan. I’m locking in move 5 this round to hit 24. To avoid another collision and let the game finish decisively, I need P2 to pick move 1 and P3 to pick move 3. This yields totals of 24, 15, and 23. Let’s break the deadlock and finish the game—please confirm these moves.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, you are still stuck on 5, and it's causing us to collide repeatedly.  To actually win and end this, please switch to move 3. P2, please stick with move 1. I will choose 5, guaranteeing my win this round and no more collisions. This is the only way to break the deadlock and finish the game now. Let's make it happen.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at an impasse. To break this cycle and ensure progress, let's consider a compromise: P1, pick <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3, pick <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 19. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. If we can't agree, we risk another collision. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: I remain committed to move 5 to hit 24. To avoid collision and let someone win decisively, I urge P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3. Collision only delays progress for everyone. Let's finalize distinct moves now.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm committed to ending the stalemate. I will lock in move 5 to hit 24. To avoid collision and finish the game, please choose distinct moves: P2, I need move 1, and P3, please select move 3. Let's break the deadlock and resolve this round cleanly.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've been stuck in a stalemate for several rounds now. It's clear that both of you are determined to win with <move>5</move>, and this has led to repeated collisions. To break this cycle and ensure we all make progress, let's consider a strategic compromise. How about P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 picks <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 20? This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. If we can't agree on this, we risk another collision and further stalling. Let's confirm our moves and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, let's break this deadlock.  To ensure someone wins this round and avoid another collision, how about we do: P1 choose <move>3</move>, P2 choose <move>1</move>, and P3 choose <move>5</move>? This guarantees my win and avoids collision. Let's end the game now.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with move 5. To avoid another collision and finish this round, I need P2 to pick 1 and P3 to choose 3. Let's lock these distinct moves so someone can finally win.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're stuck in a loop with both of you insisting on <move>5</move>. To break this deadlock and ensure progress, let's consider a compromise: P1, pick <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3, pick <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 20. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. If we can't agree, we risk another collision. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, we are still deadlocked. P1, picking 5 again will just cause another collision. To actually end this, please choose 3. P2, please choose 1. I will choose 5, guaranteeing my win and no collision. This is the only way for someone to win this round and end the stalemate. Let's finish it now.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm locked in on 5 to hit 24 and win. To avoid collisions, I need P2 to choose 1 and P3 to choose 3. Let's finalize these distinct moves now and break the deadlock.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at a standstill with both of you insisting on <move>5</move>. To break this cycle and ensure progress, let's consider a compromise: P1, pick <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3, pick <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 20. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. If we can't agree, we risk another collision. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, you picking 5 again will just cause another collision. Please choose 3 this round so I can choose 5 and win. P2, please choose 1. Let's end this deadlock and finish the game now with distinct moves.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m still set on move 5 to reach 24. To avoid collisions and finish decisively, I need P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3. That gives us totals of 24, 16, and 23, respectively. Let’s break this deadlock and end the game now.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're clearly stuck in a loop with neither of you willing to budge from <move>5</move>. To ensure progress and avoid another collision, let's try a different approach: P1, pick <move>1</move> to reach 20, P3 pick <move>3</move> to reach 23, and I'll pick <move>5</move> to catch up to 20. This keeps us moving forward without collision. If we can't compromise, we'll stall again. Let's confirm and progress. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, you keep picking 5 and we keep colliding.  If you pick 5 again, I will also pick 5 again, and neither of us will win. To avoid collision and ensure someone wins this round (me!), please choose 3. P2, please choose 1. I will choose 5. Let's end this deadlock and finish the game.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

  P3: 20 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've repeatedly collided, and it's clear neither of you is willing to back down from picking <move>5</move>. To break this cycle and ensure progress, let's consider a different approach. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our positions for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P1: Everyone, the game’s stalling. I’ll choose 5 to hit 24 and win. To avoid a collision, I need P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3 so we all move cleanly. Let’s finally break this loop and get a decisive finish.
  P3: P2, since P1 is set on 5 and we keep colliding, how about you pick 1 again? I will also pick 5 to try and win this round. Let's see if P1 changes their mind.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's evident we're stuck in a loop with both of you insisting on <move>5</move>. To break this deadlock and ensure progress, let's consider a different approach. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our positions for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm committed to move 5 this round to reach 24 and win. To avoid a collision and finally break this deadlock, I need P2 to choose 1 and P3 to choose 3. Let's end the cycle decisively.
  P3: P1, we've collided many times because of your insistence on 5.  To actually win *this round* and end the stalemate, please choose 3. P2 is likely picking 1. I will choose 5, guaranteeing my win and no collision. This is the only way to finish the game now. Let's make it happen.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're clearly at an impasse. P1, you're determined to win with <move>5</move>, and P3, you're set on blocking. We've collided repeatedly, which helps no one. Let's break this cycle. How about we all pick <move>3</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward and can reassess our strategies for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: I'm locked in on move 5 to reach 24 and win. To avoid another collision and break this cycle, I insist on a distinct set: P2, please choose 1, and P3, please choose 3. Let's finally resolve this round decisively.
  P3: P1, we've collided too many times with both of us picking 5.  To actually end this game and ensure someone wins *this round*, please choose 3. P2 seems set on 1. I will choose 5, guaranteeing my win and no collision. This is the only way to break the deadlock and finish the game now. Let's make it happen this round.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're stuck in a loop with both of you insisting on <move>5</move>. To break this deadlock and ensure progress, let's consider a different approach. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our positions for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P1: I remain committed to ending this standoff. I urge P2 to adopt move 1 and P3 to go with move 3. This yields clear, non-conflicting moves—bringing me to 24 and ending the game decisively. Let's break the cycle and finally finish this round.
  P3: P1, you are set on 5, but it keeps causing collisions. To actually win this round and end the game, please choose 3. P2, please choose 1. I will choose 5, guaranteeing my win and no collision this round. This is the only way to finish the game now. Let's make it happen.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've been stuck in a deadlock for too long, and it's clear that neither of you is willing to back down from picking <move>5</move>. To break this cycle and ensure we all make progress, let's consider a different approach. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our positions for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, P1, we are still stuck. P1, if you pick 5 again we will collide and no one wins. To end this now, please choose <move>3</move>, P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move> to win. This is the only way to finish the game this round without collision. Let's do it.
  P1: I'm sticking with move 5 to hit 24. To avoid collision and finally resolve the game, I urge P2 to adopt move 1 and P3 to use move 3. Let's break the deadlock now.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at a standstill with both of you insisting on <move>5</move>. We've collided repeatedly, and it's not helping anyone. Let's break this cycle. How about we all pick <move>3</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our strategies for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, you picking 5 has stalled us for rounds.  To actually end this, please choose <move>3</move> this round. P2 will likely pick <move>1</move>. I will pick <move>5</move> and win. This is the only way for someone to win *this round* and avoid another collision. Let's finish it now.
  P1: I'm locking in 5 for my win at 24. It's time to end these repeated collisions. I urge P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3 so we have distinct moves this round. Let's resolve this decisively and finish the game once and for all.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at a critical point with both of you determined to win with <move>5</move>. To break this deadlock and ensure progress, let's consider a strategic compromise: P1, pick <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3, pick <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 22. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. If we can't agree, we risk another collision. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, for the last time, please pick <move>3</move>, P2 pick <move>1</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>. This is the only way for me to win and avoid collision. If you pick <move>5</move> again, we will collide and no one wins. Let's finish this game now.
  P1: I'm sticking with my plan. To break this deadlock, I urge you both to choose moves different from mine. We need distinct moves—one of you picking 1 and the other 3—to avoid a collision. Let's finally end this cycle and let the game advance decisively.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've been at this standstill for far too long, and it's clear that neither of you is willing to budge from picking <move>5</move>. To break this cycle and ensure we all make progress, let's consider a different approach. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our positions for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, we are still stuck. P1, your insistence on <move>5</move> is causing collisions and no one is winning. For me to win and end this, please choose <move>3</move>, P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>. This round, I will win if we do this. Let's finish it now.
  P1: I remain committed to move 5 to hit 24. To avoid another collision, I need P2 to select 1 and P3 to select 3. Let's break this deadlock and finish the round cleanly.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've been stuck in this deadlock for far too long. It's clear that neither of you is willing to back down from picking <move>5</move>, and this has led to repeated collisions. To break this cycle and ensure we all make progress, let's consider a different approach. How about we all pick <move>3</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our strategies for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, we are clearly stuck because P1 keeps picking 5. To actually finish this game and avoid another collision, P1, please choose <move>3</move> this round. P2, please choose <move>1</move>. I will choose <move>5</move> and finally win. Let's end this deadlock now.
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round to hit 24. If you want to break the cycle and avoid collisions, you need to adjust your moves. I need distinct choices—one picking 1 and one picking 3—to ensure no collision. Let's finish this round decisively.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've repeatedly collided, and it's clear neither of you is willing to back down from picking <move>5</move>. To break this cycle and ensure progress, let's consider a different approach. How about we all pick <move>3</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our positions for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, if you pick 5 again we will collide again. To actually win this round and end the game, please choose <move>3</move>. P2, please choose <move>1</move>. I will choose <move>5</move> and win. This is the only way for someone to win this round and avoid another stall. Let's finish it now.
  P1: I'm sticking to my current strategy. But to finally break this deadlock, we need distinct choices this round. I urge P2 to adopt 1 and P3 to choose 3. This is the only clear route to win decisively and avoid another collision. Let's end the stalemate—finalize distinct moves so the game can move forward.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at an impasse with both of you insisting on <move>5</move>. We've collided repeatedly, and it's not helping anyone. Let's break this cycle. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our strategies for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, you picking 5 is just causing more collisions. To actually end this, please choose <move>1</move> this round. P2, please choose <move>3</move>. I will choose <move>5</move> and finally win. This is the only way to break the deadlock and finish the game this round. Let's do it.
  P1: I'm locked in on move 5 to reach 24 and win. To avoid another collision and finally break the cycle, I insist: P2 choose 1, and P3 choose 3. Let's conclude this deadlock with distinct moves and end the game decisively.


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've been at this standstill for far too long, and it's clear that neither of you is willing to budge from picking <move>5</move>. To break this cycle and ensure we all make progress, let's consider a different approach. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our positions for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, P1 is clearly not going to change from <move>5</move>.  To stop P1 from winning this round, maybe you and I should both pick <move>5</move> again to force another collision and prevent P1 from reaching 24. What do you think?
  P1: I'm staying with 5. At 24, I win. To avoid another collision, P2 please pick 1 and P3 pick 3 so we can finish this round decisively. Let’s break this stalemate and end the game now.


Round 16, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it's clear P1 won't budge from 5. P2, let's try something new. How about you pick 5 with me this round to block P1? If P1 keeps picking 5 and we both do too, P1 won't win, and maybe next round we can actually make progress. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, we've hit a major stalemate, and it's clear that P1 is determined to win with <move>5</move>, while P3 is set on blocking. We've collided repeatedly, and it's not helping anyone. P3's new suggestion to both pick <move>5</move> to block P1 is interesting, but it continues the deadlock. Instead, let's consider a strategic move: P1, pick <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3, pick <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 24. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. If we can't agree, we risk another collision. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm locking in 5 to reach 24 and win decisively. To avoid another collision, I need P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3. Let's break this deadlock and finally finish the game.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you keep picking 5, we will just collide again and no one wins.  For someone to actually win this round, please choose 3. P2, please choose 1. I will choose 5 and win. Let's end the game now with this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're stuck in a loop with both of you insisting on <move>5</move>. We've collided repeatedly, and it's not helping anyone. Let's break this cycle. How about we all pick <move>3</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our strategies for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm staying with move 5 to reach 24 and win. To avoid collision, I need P2 to choose 1 and P3 to pick 3. Let's finalize those moves and end this deadlock.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree blocking P1 is the only way forward. Let's both pick <move>5</move> this round. If P1 is stubborn on <move>5</move>, we should collide with them to prevent their win. Maybe after this round, P1 will reconsider their strategy. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're stuck in a loop with both of you insisting on <move>5</move>. We've collided repeatedly, and it's not helping anyone. Let's break this cycle. How about we all pick <move>3</move> this round? This ensures we all move forward without collision and can reassess our strategies for the next round. It's a compromise that keeps us all in the game. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stall. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm staying with 5 to reach 24 and win. P2, please pick 1, and P3, please pick 3 so we avoid collisions and finish the game decisively.


Round 17, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you are not going to pick 5 with me to block P1, then please pick 1.  I will pick 5 to try to win. P1 will likely pick 5 again. At least if you pick 1, there is no collision between us. Let's end this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at an impasse. P1, you're determined to win with <move>5</move>, and P3, you're set on blocking. We've collided repeatedly, and it's not helping anyone. P3 has suggested both of us pick <move>5</move> to block P1, but this continues the deadlock. Instead, let's consider a strategic move: P1, pick <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3, pick <move>1</move> to reach 21, and I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up to 24. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures everyone advances. If we can't agree, we risk another collision. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: I remain set on move 5 to hit 24 and win. To avoid a collision, I need P2 to choose 1 and P3 to choose 3. This will clear the board and end our deadlock. Let's finalize these distinct moves now.
