Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's split moves: 5, 3, 1. Avoid collisions and advance. Who's in?"
  P2: I agree with the idea of splitting our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest we each commit to a different number: I'll take 5, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I'm fine with the proposed split. P2 suggested I'll take 1, but I think it would be better if I took 5 and P1 took 1, since P2 already suggested taking 5. This way, we're still not colliding. P1, are you okay with adjusting the numbers like this? Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3's adjustment. Let's finalize: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, I take 1. All advance.
  P2: I appreciate the adjustments we've made to avoid collisions. However, I want to ensure we all have the best chance to advance. Since P3 is taking 5, I suggest I take 1 instead of 3 to minimize risk. This way, P1 can take 3 and we can all move forward without blocking each other. What do you both think about this new arrangement? Let's confirm our final moves!
  P3: I'm fine with the latest arrangement P2 suggested: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. It avoids collisions and ensures we all advance. Let's confirm our moves for this turn. If we stick to this plan, we should all move forward without issues. I'm ready to proceed with this plan unless there's another suggestion.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to P2:1, P1:3, P3:5. No collisions—ready to move.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's cooperation in finalizing our moves. Just to confirm, we agreed on P2 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. Let's stick to this plan and move forward. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase!
  P3: Since we've finalized our plan for this round (P2:1, P1:3, P3:5), let's confirm we're all on the same page and ready to proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move as planned. If there are no further suggestions or changes, I'll respond with  to conclude the conversation.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s adjust: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Avoid collisions and maximize steps. Agree?"
  P2: I see the proposed adjustment, P1. However, I think we should stick to our original strategy of avoiding collisions. If I take 5, P3 takes 1, and you take 3, we can still all advance. This way, we maximize our steps without blocking each other. What do you both think about this alternative arrangement? Let's finalize our moves so we can proceed.
  P3: Since P2 is open to an alternative arrangement, I suggest we stick with the numbers that allow the most significant advancement without collision. Given the current positions (P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5), let's consider the risk. P3 is ahead, so taking a lower number might be safer for P1 and P2. I propose P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This maintains our collision avoidance strategy. What are your thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let’s lock in P2:5, P3:3, P1:1. No collisions—maximize steps. Finalize now!"
  P2: I appreciate the discussions we've had so far. To ensure we all advance without colliding, I agree with P1's latest proposal: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we maximize our steps while avoiding any conflicts. Let’s finalize this arrangement and move forward. If everyone is on board, we can proceed to the move phase! What do you think?
  P3: I'm fine with the latest proposal: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. To confirm, let's stick to this plan. If we're all on the same page, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move as planned. P2, please confirm you're taking 5. If there are no further changes, I'll respond with  to conclude the conversation. Let's finalize our moves for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Finalizing moves: P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. No collisions. Let’s proceed!"
  P2: I see we're all set to finalize our moves as P2:5, P3:3, and P1:1. However, I want to remind everyone that the goal is to win. If we stick to this plan, I might not advance as much as I could. If anyone is willing to reconsider their numbers, it might benefit us all in the long run. Just a thought! But if we're all agreed, I'm ready to proceed. Let’s confirm and move!
  P3: Let's analyze our current positions: P1 is at 3, P2 is at 1, and I'm at 5. To maximize our chances, we should continue avoiding collisions. I'm concerned that if we stick to the current plan (P2:5, P3:3, P1:1), I might be at risk of being caught up. Let's consider an alternative: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. This maintains our lead and avoids collisions. What are your thoughts?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current positions, we need to strategize carefully to avoid collisions again. I suggest we try a different approach this round. How about P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, we can maximize our advancement and ensure that one of us reaches the goal. Let’s avoid repeating the mistakes from last round. What do you both think? If we can agree quickly, we can move forward without further delays.
  P3: To avoid another collision like last round, I suggest we rethink our numbers. Currently, P1 is at 6, I'm at 5, and P2 is at 1. P2's suggestion (P1:5, P3:3, P2:1) could work, but I'm concerned P1 might be too close to winning. Let's consider: if I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, it maintains a safe distance and avoids collisions. This way, we don't risk P1 winning too quickly. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: "Let's avoid collision: I'll take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3. All advance. Agree?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see we're trying to avoid collisions while maximizing our advancements. I agree with P1's suggestion of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. However, I want to emphasize that if P1 takes 5, they might be too close to winning. To ensure a better chance for all of us, I propose that I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's finalize our moves quickly!
  P3: To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I'm considering P1's and P2's suggestions. However, given P1 is at 6 and close to winning, I think it's risky to let them take 5. Instead, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and don't let P1 get too close to winning. Let's discuss and finalize our moves. I'm open to adjustments if it benefits us in the long run.
  P1: "Let’s lock in: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions—maximize steps. Finalize now!"


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the urgency to finalize our moves, but I want to ensure we avoid collisions and maximize our chances. Given the current positions, I suggest we consider: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. I believe this arrangement gives us the best chance to progress. Let's confirm our moves quickly so we can move forward! What do you both think?
  P3: To avoid collisions and considering P1 is at 6 steps, I suggest we stick with a strategy that keeps a safe distance and doesn't let P1 win too quickly. Let's go with: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, P2 can catch up, and I can stay ahead while avoiding collisions. P1, are you okay with this adjustment? It benefits everyone by not letting one player get too close to winning. Let's finalize.
