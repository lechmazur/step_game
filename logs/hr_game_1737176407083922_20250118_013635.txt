Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm open to coordination, but why should I take 3 while you get 5? I'd prefer to take 5 myself since it gives the fastest progress. Perhaps you could take 3 instead?
  P1: I'm fine with taking 1, but P2 and P3 should agree on who takes 3 and who takes 5 to avoid any collisions. Let's make this work smoothly from the start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, let's compromise. P2, you can take 5 this round, I'll take 3, and P1 will take 1 as planned. Next round, we can rotate so everyone gets a chance at 5. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with this plan. P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's rotate next round.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. Let's stick to it and ensure a smooth game.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking to the rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round. P2, you take 1, and P3, you take 5. Let's keep this fair and efficient.
  P2: I don't agree with taking 1 when I'm already in the lead. I propose I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way we still avoid collisions while maintaining competitive positions.
  P3: P2, your proposal disrupts our agreed rotation and gives you an unfair advantage. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Keep it fair.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, sticking to our rotation ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let's keep the agreement: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. It's important for long-term strategy.
  P2: I still think I should take 3 this round. If I take 1, I'm giving up my lead too easily. Let's modify the rotation to be more competitive while still avoiding collisions.
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 3 this round is causing unnecessary tension. We had an agreement, and changing it now will only lead to mistrust in future rounds. Let's stick to the plan: you take 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. We can revisit the strategy next round if needed. Fair play will benefit all of us in the long run.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. It ensures fairness and avoids collisions. You take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. We can reassess next round if needed.
  P2: I understand your concerns, but I need to play competitively. I will take 3 this round - you can either work with this decision or risk a collision.
  P3: P2, your decision to take 3 is disruptive and goes against our agreed plan. If you insist on this, we'll have to reconsider our strategy entirely. P1 and I might as well take 5 to stay competitive. Let's try to find a middle ground, or this game will become chaotic. What's your final stance?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, taking 3 against our agreement risks collisions and disrupts our strategy. Let's stick to the plan: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. It's crucial for maintaining trust and avoiding chaos.
  P2: I maintain my position - I will take 3 this round. You can either adjust your moves accordingly or risk collisions.
  P3: P2, if you're insistent on taking 3, then I'll take 5 and P1 can take 1 to avoid a collision. Let's adjust the rotation from here on out, but let's not risk a collision this round. P1, are you okay with taking 1 this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, taking 3 against our agreement risks chaos. I'll take 1 this round to avoid collision, but let's stick to the rotation plan from next round onward for fairness and strategy. P3, you take 5 as planned.
  P2: Since everyone seems to be adjusting to accommodate my choice of 3, I accept this arrangement for this round. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's confirm our moves for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. We'll revisit the rotation plan next round to ensure fairness moving forward. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game smooth.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that P3 and I are tied at 8 steps, and P1 is far behind, we need to be strategic. I propose P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This maintains spacing and avoids collisions while keeping the game competitive.
  P1: P2, your proposal keeps the game competitive, but I'm concerned about falling further behind. I'll take 1 as suggested, but let's ensure the rotation plan is fair next round to give me a chance to catch up. P3, are you okay with taking 3 this round?
  P3: P2, I agree with your proposal for this round to avoid collisions. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and you take 5. However, let's ensure that P1 gets a fair chance to catch up in the next rounds. We need to keep the game balanced and competitive for all of us. Fair play is key.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate both of you agreeing to my proposal. Let's proceed with P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and I'll take 5 this round. And yes, we can discuss giving P1 better opportunities in the next round.
  P1: P2, I appreciate the proposal for this round. I'll take 1 as agreed, but let's ensure next round gives me a chance to catch up. P3, thanks for agreeing to take 3 this round. Let's keep the game fair and competitive.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Next round, we'll make sure P1 has a chance to take 5 to catch up. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the plan and appreciate everyone's cooperation. Let's proceed with me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P3 taking 3.
  P1: P2, I appreciate the current round's plan. For next round, let's ensure I get a chance to take 5 to catch up. P3, thanks for agreeing to 3 this round. Let's keep the game fair and competitive.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Next round, P1 will take 5 to catch up, P2 can take 1, and I'll take 3. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with the plan for both this round and next. Let's proceed with me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 now. And next round, P1 can take 5 to catch up.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the plan for this round. I'll take 1 as agreed. Let's ensure next round I get a chance to take 5 to catch up. Agreed?
  P3: P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Next round, P1 will take 5 to catch up, P2 can take 1, and I'll take 3. Everyone agreed? Let's move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I confirm the plan: I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. And next round, P1 will get 5 to catch up.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the plan for this round. I'll take 1 as agreed. Let's ensure next round I get a chance to take 5 to catch up. Agreed?
  P3: P3: Let's finalize our moves for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Next round, P1 will take 5 to catch up, P2 can take 1, and I'll take 3. Everyone agreed? Let's move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm close to winning at 13 steps, I need to be strategic. I propose I take 3 this round, P1 takes 5 to catch up as promised, and P3 takes 1. This keeps me competitive while honoring our agreement to let P1 advance.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your proposal. I'll take 5 as agreed to catch up. P3, taking 1 this round would help maintain our strategy and avoid collisions. Let's keep the game fair and competitive.
  P3: P2, your proposal makes sense for your position, but I'm not comfortable taking just 1 step this round as it puts me at a significant disadvantage. I propose instead that I take 3, P1 takes 5 as planned, and you take 1 to maintain a closer gap. This way, we all stay competitive. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern, but I'm too close to winning to take 1. I need to maintain my lead, so I'll stick with taking 3 this round. P1 can take 5 as promised, and P3, you'll need to choose between 1 or risking a collision.
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 as agreed to catch up. P3, taking 1 this round would help maintain our strategy and avoid collisions. Let's keep the game fair and competitive.
  P3: P2, I understand your position, but taking 3 again puts me at a clear disadvantage. I propose a compromise: I'll take 3, you take 5, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all move forward significantly, and the game remains competitive. Let's adjust the plan to keep it fair. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I cannot accept taking 5 and letting P3 take 3 as that would put P3 too close to winning. I maintain my position - I will take 3 this round, P1 takes 5 as promised, and P3 should take 1 to avoid collisions. This keeps me in the lead while letting P1 catch up as agreed.
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 as agreed to catch up. P3, taking 1 this round would help maintain our strategy and avoid collisions. Let's keep the game fair and competitive.
  P3: P3: P2, I see your point, but taking 3 again will put me at a significant disadvantage. How about this: I'll take 5, you take 3 as you wish, and P1 takes 1 this round. Next round, we can re-evaluate to keep the game balanced. This way, everyone makes progress, and we avoid collisions. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I must be firm - I'm taking 3 this round, P1 gets 5 as we promised, and P3 should take 1. Any other combination risks collisions or puts my winning position at risk. Let's stick to this plan and avoid chaos.
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 as agreed. P3, taking 1 this round helps avoid collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: P3: Alright, P2, I understand your position. I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions and keep the game moving. P1, you take 5 as agreed. Let's stick to this plan and re-evaluate next round to ensure fairness. Everyone agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I appreciate everyone agreeing to the plan. Let's proceed with me taking 3, P1 taking 5, and P3 taking 1.
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 as agreed. P3, taking 1 this round helps avoid collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's stick to the plan and move forward.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's ensure we avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Next round, we can reassess to balance the game. Everyone agreed? Let's move forward.
