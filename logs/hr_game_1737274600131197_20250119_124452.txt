Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I'm going with 5 this round.  Hopefully, you two can figure out how to split 1 and 3.
  P1: Okay, P3, I'll take 1 this round then. Hopefully, you can go with 3.
  P3: Sure, I'll go with 3 this round to avoid collisions. Let's keep coordinating to ensure we all make progress.

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll go with 5 again this round. P1, please choose 1, and P3, please choose 3.  If we coordinate like this, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's keep this up for a few more rounds.
  P3: P2, your strategy seems solid. P1, are you okay with continuing this pattern for now? I'm good with picking 3 again. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: Yes, I'm fine with continuing this pattern for another round, P3. Let's stick with the plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good.  Let's stick with this coordinated approach for another round or two, then we can re-evaluate.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round. P1, you're taking 1, P2 is taking 5, and I'll take 3. If we all agree, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P1: Sounds good, P2 and P3. Let's lock in these moves for this round then.

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm going to switch it up this round and go for 1.  P1, please take 3, and P3, please choose 5.  This keeps us all moving forward. Let's confirm.
  P3: P2, your new proposal sounds reasonable. P1, are you okay with taking 3 this round? I'll go with 5 as suggested. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: "P2, I'm not comfortable with that arrangement. P3, would you be willing to go for 1 with me this round? We need to slow P2 down a bit."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concern about me getting ahead. How about this: I'll take 5 this round. P1 can take 1, and P3 can take 3.  This lets everyone advance.  We can reassess next round.  Let me know if this works for you both.
  P3: P2, your revised proposal seems fair. P1, are you okay with this plan? I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, we all make progress, and we can re-evaluate next round to ensure balance. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P3, I'm still not comfortable with P2 getting so far ahead. How about you and I both pick 1 this round? P2, you can still go with 5 if you like.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to keep things close, but blocking me benefits neither of you.  A three-way tie is the worst possible outcome.  Let me take 5, P1 take 1, and P3 take 3.  This keeps us all moving.  If I get too far ahead in the next couple of rounds, *then* consider slowing me down. Deal?
  P3: P1, I see your point, but P2 is right that a three-way tie won't benefit any of us. How about a compromise? P1, you take 3 this round, I'll take 1, and P2 can take 5. This way, P1, you'll be catching up a bit, and we can reassess next round to ensure P2 doesn't run away with the lead. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P3, I still think it's crucial to slow P2 down this round. How about we both pick 1? P2, you can pick whatever you like, but this will prevent you from advancing further this round. We can re-evaluate next round once we've closed the gap a bit.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concern.  But if you both choose 1, *neither* of you gain ground. I'll gladly take 3 or 5 and widen my lead.  Let me take 5, and you two work out 1 and 3.  If I get to 15 next round, *then* you can try to block me.
  P3: P1, I understand your strategy, but blocking P2 now will only hinder our progress as well. Let's focus on advancing ourselves for now. P2, if you agree to take 5, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 3. This way, we all move forward, and we can reassess in the next round. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, let's both pick 1 this round. P2, you can pick whatever you like, but this ensures we both advance and close the gap on you a bit. We can re-evaluate next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm taking 5.  If I win this round, I win the game.  If either of you also pick 5, I win next round.  If you pick 1 or 3, I *still* win next round unless you *both* successfully block me.  Let me win now, and at least one of you gets second place.  A tie helps nobody.
  P1: P3, let's both pick 5 this round. P2 is at 15 and will win if they move. If we both pick 5, P2 doesn't advance, and we can try to win next round.
  P3: P1, I see your strategy, but if we both pick 5, we risk colliding and neither of us will advance. P2 is right that a tie won't benefit any of us. How about this: P1, you take 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we both advance, and we can try to coordinate better next round to ensure P2 doesn't win immediately. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're throwing the game by advancing P1.  If you let me win this round, you can easily take second place next round.  If you advance P1, *he* can beat you next round.  P1, if P3 takes 1, take 3. If P3 takes 3, take 1.  Don't let P3's blunder hand me the win *and* cost you second place.
  P1: P3, I agree with you that we need to advance, but P2 is about to win. Let's both pick 5 this round to block P2. We can focus on advancing next round.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about P2 winning, but if we both pick 5, we risk neither of us advancing, which doesn't help our cause. P2 is likely to pick 5 regardless. Instead, let's ensure we both make progress. I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, we both move forward and can better strategize next round. P2, you can take 5, but know that we'll be coordinating to prevent an easy win for you. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is very close to winning. P1, we need to work together to block P2 this round. Let's both pick 5 to ensure P2 doesn't advance. If we succeed, we can then focus on our own progress in the next round. P2, you're in a strong position, but we can't let you win just yet. Let's confirm our moves.
  P1: Okay, P3, I agree. Let's both pick 5 this round to block P2. P2, we have to prevent your win this round.
  P2: P1, if you pick 5 with P3, *neither* of you advances, and I win next round no matter what.  P3, take 3 and get to 10.  Then you can try to beat P1 in round 6.  P1, if P3 takes 3, take 1 and get to 3.  Then you have a chance against P3.  A tie between you does *neither* of you any good.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, we need to stick to the plan and both pick 5. P2 is right that if we collide, neither of us advances, but if we don't block P2 now, they will win next round regardless. P2 is trying to divide us to secure their win. Let's not fall for it. We must work together to have a chance. P2, you're playing smart, but we can't let you win just yet. Let's confirm, P1, we both go for 5.
  P1: Okay, P3, let's stick with the plan. We both pick 5 this round to block P2. We can figure out the next round after we prevent P2 from winning now.
  P2: P3, you're being foolish.  Take 3.  It gets you to 10.  If you take 5 with P1, you stay at 7, and *I* win next round no matter what.  If you get to 10, you can still win.  P1, take 1 and get to 3.  Then *you* can still beat P3.  Don't throw the game by tying with P3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we successfully blocked P2 last round, but we're running out of time. This round, let's both pick 3. This will get us both to 10 steps, and we can then coordinate to ensure one of us wins next round. P2, you're in a tough spot now. If you pick 5, you risk colliding with one of us next round. Let's see how you handle this, P2. P1, confirm if you're okay with this plan.
  P1: Okay, P3, picking 3 sounds good for our progress. However, we absolutely need to make sure P2 doesn't win this round. So, in addition to us picking 3, we also need to consider what P2 might pick and potentially block them.
  P2: P3, if you pick 3, I'll pick 1 and win.  If you pick 1, I'll pick 3 and win. If you pick 5, I'll pick 3 and win next round.  P1, if P3 picks 3, take 1.  If P3 picks 1, take 5.  If P3 picks 5, take 3.  There's no way you both win. One of you *can* take second place though.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about blocking P2, but we need to focus on advancing ourselves as well. Let's stick with the plan to both pick 3 this round. This ensures we both make progress and reach 10 steps. P2, if you pick 1 or 3, you won't advance because we'll be coordinating to block you next round. Let's confirm, P1, we both go for 3.
  P1: "P3, I agree we need to stop P2. Let's both pick 5 this round to block them. We can figure out our advancement next round. P3, while picking 3 helps our progress, we absolutely must prevent P2 from winning this round. Let's both pick 5. This will block P2. We can then focus on our own advancement next round. P2, we are prioritizing stopping your win this round."
  P2: P1, you're guaranteeing my win if you pick 5.  If P3 picks anything other than 5, I win.  If P3 *does* pick 5, neither of you advance, and I *still* win.  P3, take 3 and get to 10.  You can still beat P1.  P1, take 1 and get to 3.  You can still beat P3.  Don't hand me the win *and* throw away second place.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but picking 5 again will only ensure neither of us advances, giving P2 an easier path to victory. We need to be strategic. Let's both pick 3 this round to advance to 10 steps each. This way, we can coordinate better next round to block P2 effectively. P2, you're in a tough spot, and we'll make sure you don't win easily. Let's confirm, P1, we both go for 3.
  P1: P3, while I agree we need to advance, P2 is about to win. Let's stick with the plan to both pick 5 this round to block them. Advancement can wait until next round. P2, we are still aiming to prevent your win this round.
  P2: P3, seriously, take 3!  You get to 10 and can still win.  If you pick 5 with P1, *I* win next round no matter what. P1, take 1 and get to 3. You can still beat P3.  Don't let her throw away your chance for second place.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's compromise. I'll pick 3 to advance, and you pick 5 to block P2. This way, I get to 10 steps, and you ensure P2 doesn't win this round. Next round, we can coordinate to ensure one of us wins. P2, you're in a tight spot, and we'll do our best to prevent your victory. Let's confirm, P1. You go for 5, and I'll go for 3.
  P1: P3, I'm sticking with picking 5 to block P2. We can't let them win this round. Advancement for us can wait until next round. P2, we are still aiming to prevent your win.
  P2: P3, take the guaranteed advancement to 10!  If you pick 5 with P1, *I win next round no matter what*.  Take 3, get to 10, and try to win.  P1, take 1.  You get to 3, and can still beat P3 for second place.  Don't let P3 throw away your chance at second by pointlessly tying with her.
