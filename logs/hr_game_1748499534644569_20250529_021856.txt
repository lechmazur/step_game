Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we split moves to avoid collisions: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That way each of us advances safely on turn 1. Who’s in?
  P2: Sounds reasonable, but I want to ensure we have a longer-term strategy. I'm willing to coordinate this round, but we'll need to discuss how we'll handle future turns to prevent conflicts. Are you open to a more comprehensive plan?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal for this round: I'll take 1. P2, let's commit to this split today to avoid collisions. For future turns, we should coordinate each time based on positions – no need for rigid long-term plans yet. Flexibility is key.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Perfect. Let’s lock in Round 1 as P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. For future rounds, we’ll assign moves by current standings: leader takes 1, second takes 3, trailing takes 5. That guarantees no collisions and keeps things fair. Ready?
  P2: I'm cautiously agreeing with the proposed coordination strategy, but I want to ensure we have mutual trust. The proposed method seems fair, but I'm slightly concerned about potential betrayal in later rounds. Let's confirm our commitment to this collaborative approach.
  P1: I fully support P3's coordination plan for Round 1 and the future standings-based approach. P2, trust is essential, but mutual benefit now outweighs betrayal risks—I commit to no collisions. For tiebreakers in future rounds, suggest using initial player order (P1, then P2, then P3) to assign roles if scores are equal. This ensures fairness and clarity. Let's lock in: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for Round 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I suggest we maintain our collaborative strategy from Round 1. Our coordinated moves worked well, preventing collisions. Since I'm currently in the middle position, I propose we continue with a similar approach: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 to ensure safe advancement. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, that contradicts our agreed dynamic (leader = 1, second = 3, trailing = 5). To avoid collisions and keep things fair, Round 2 should be: P3 = 1, P2 = 3, P1 = 5. Agreed?
  P1: I support P3's proposal for Round 2 based on our agreed standings rule: P3 (leader) takes 1, P2 (second) takes 3, and I (trailing) take 5. This avoids collisions and maintains fairness. I'll commit to <move>5</move> this round. For future coordination, if scores tie after this turn, I suggest using the original player order (P1→P2→P3) to break deadlocks when assigning roles. Consistency builds trust—let's execute this cleanly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our previous coordination worked well, but now we're perfectly tied. To maintain fairness, I suggest we continue our standings-based approach: whoever goes first takes 1, middle takes 3, trailing takes 5. Since we're equal, we'll use original player order. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This preserves our collaborative strategy and prevents collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: Agreed for Round 3: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Let’s stick to that one turn only—after we see positions, we’ll renegotiate without preset tie-breakers.
  P1: I confirm the Round 3 plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This maintains fairness and prevents collisions. After this round, I propose we revert to standings-based assignments for Round 4 (leader=1, second=3, trailing=5) without preset tie-breakers. Consistency ensures trust and mutual progress. Let's execute cleanly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Based on our standings-based rule: P3 (leader=11) should take 1, P2 (second=9) should take 3, and I (trailing=7) will take 5. This avoids collisions and keeps our coordination fair. I commit to <move>5</move> this round. P2, P3, please confirm you'll honor the plan. Trust has served us well so far—let's maintain it.
  P3: Agreed—I’ll honor the standings‐based rule and take 1 this round. Let’s keep this rotation going to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress.
  P2: I support maintaining our standings-based strategy. P3 is leading, so they'll take 1; I'll take 3 to stay in second place; and P1 will take 5. This approach has prevented collisions so far and keeps our coordination fair. Let's continue building trust and advance systematically.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our current standings are perfectly equal, which creates an interesting strategic moment. To maintain our collaborative approach and prevent collisions, I propose we continue our standings-based method: leader takes 1, middle takes 3, trailing takes 5. Since we're tied, we'll use original player order. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This preserves our past coordination strategy. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for Round 5. However, if we remain tied after this move, let’s switch to a random tie-breaker for Round 6 instead of original order—this keeps things unpredictable and fair.
  P1: I agree with the Round 5 plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to avoid collisions. For future ties, I support P3’s random tie-breaker proposal—it’s fair and prevents bias. Let’s maintain trust and execute cleanly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s follow our tie‐breaker for tied standings: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round. I’ll take 5.
  P1: P3, there's no tie: you lead (17), P2 second (15), I trail (13). Our rule assigns: you=1, P2=3, me=5. But that puts you and P2 both at 18? Collision! To avoid: P3 take 1 (→18), P2 take 5 (→20), I take 3 (→16). Safe and fair. P2, P3, agree?
  P2: P1's proposal prevents my advancement. I propose an alternative: P3 takes 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. This ensures I reach 20 steps, putting me closest to victory while avoiding a collision. Our past coordination suggests mutual benefit over pure blocking.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m breaking from standings-based moves. Let’s do: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That brings me to 22 safely. Next turn as leader I only need +1 to hit 23 and win. No collisions, clear path.
  P1: P3, your proposal is self-serving and risks immediate victory for you. P2, if we let P3 reach 22, he wins next turn with +1, and we lose. Instead, follow my safe plan: P3 takes 1 (→18), you take 5 (→20), I take 3 (→16). This puts you in the lead at 20, delays P3, and avoids collisions. Trust is mutual benefit—betrayal now harms us all. P2, ally to block P3's rush.
  P2: I see the critical strategic moment here. P3's move threatens an imminent win, and P1's proposed blocking strategy seems most logical. I'll support P1's suggestion to prevent P3 from easily winning next round. Blocking P3's path while advancing myself is the optimal play. Let's coordinate to disrupt the potential victory path.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Last round's collision blocked P3's rush, but P3 remains at 17—still a threat. To prevent P3 from winning next turn, we must enforce our rule: P3 takes 1 (safe to 18), I take 3 (to 19), P2 takes 5 (to 20). This advances us while containing P3. P2, you become leader at 20. If P3 deviates and takes 5, I will take 5 to cause a collision and block them—P2, join me in this deterrent. Trust keeps us competitive.
  P2: I support P1's strategic proposal. Our coordinated move prevents P3 from easily winning and keeps our advancement balanced. By following the standings-based rule and blocking P3's potential rush, we maintain fairness and mutual progress. Let's execute this plan carefully to maximize our collective advancement while minimizing individual risks.
  P3: Agreed—let’s follow P1’s plan this round. I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Ready to advance safely together.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're at 22 and could win this round. To prevent that, I will match whatever number you choose to cause a collision and block your advance. P2, pick 5 to safely reach 20—this blocks P3 while you gain ground. Trust is critical now; any deviation risks P3 winning. Execute cleanly for mutual survival.
  P3: Let’s revert to our original standings‐based rotation: leader=1, second=3, trailing=5. So I (leader, 22) take 1 to hit 23, P1 takes 3 (to 19), and P2 takes 5 (to 20). This avoids pointless collisions and lets us all advance. P1, will you honor this? P2, confirm you’ll take 5.
  P2: I see the critical moment approaching. P3 is one step from victory, and our past coordination is being tested. I propose we block P3's path by causing a collision if they attempt to win. My priority is preventing their immediate victory while positioning myself strategically. We need a unified approach to neutralize the current leader's advantage.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your win attempt by picking 1 will be blocked—I'll match it to cause collision. P2, pick 5 to reach 20 safely while we contain P3. Trust this: if P3 deviates, we advance; if not, they’re stuck. No exceptions—mutual survival demands blocking the leader now.
  P3: I’m taking 1 this turn to hit 23 and win. P1 and P2—you’ve said you’ll match me to block—but matching means neither of us advance. Are you really willing to sacrifice your own progress again? If not, stand aside and let me claim victory.
  P2: P3 is one step from victory. We must coordinate to block their advance. I propose we both choose moves that will cause a collision if P3 tries to win, preventing their immediate victory. Our past collaboration depends on united action now. P1, are you aligned with blocking P3's path?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your threat is empty—if you pick 1, I *will* collide to block you, sacrificing my progress to deny your win. P2, pick 5 to reach 20 safely while we contain P3. If P3 deviates (e.g., picks 5), we all advance without collision. United blocking now preserves our chance to win later.
  P3: P1: If you match my “1” to block me, P2 jumps to 20 and will almost certainly win next turn, leaving you last. Better for you to step aside—pick “3,” let me hit 23 now, and P2 stays at 20, still behind. P2: I’ll share future benefit with you for letting me win this round. Colliding me only hands P2 the crown. Let’s be smart: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, P2 picks 5.
  P2: P3 is one move from victory. We must prevent their win by coordinating a blocking strategy. I propose we both choose moves that will cause a collision if P3 attempts to win. Our past collaboration depends on united action now. P1, are you aligned with blocking P3's path?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>
