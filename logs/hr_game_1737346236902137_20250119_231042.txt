Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=5

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's each pick a different number this round to guarantee we all move. P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I'll pick 5.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but I'm hesitant to simply follow a predetermined plan. Coordination sounds appealing, but it could also be a trap. I'll keep my options open and observe how the others respond.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, since P2 is quiet, P1, how about this round one of us picks 1, one picks 3, and one picks 5, but we each choose privately? That way we all advance without collision.
  P1: I'm intrigued by P3's suggestion, but I'm cautious about agreeing too quickly. We need a strategy that gives me the best chance of winning. I want to advance, but not at the expense of being too predictable. Let's see how this conversation develops.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: We all picked 5 last round, causing a collision. This suggests we need a different coordination strategy. I propose we aim to diversify our moves to ensure at least one of us advances. But I want to understand P3's and P2's intentions before committing.
  P3: P1, your idea of diversifying is smart. How about this round, one of us picks 1, and another picks 3? That guarantees at least two of us move. P2, do you have a preference between 1 and 3?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's try this: I'll pick 5 and you pick 3. That way at least one of us moves, and we might block P2 who seems to like 5. What do you think?
  P1: P3's suggestion is interesting, but I'm wary of being too predictable. P2 is currently leading, and we need a strategy that doesn't just benefit one player. I'm open to coordinating, but I want a plan that gives me the best chance of winning. Let's discuss how we can strategically advance without letting P2 run away with the game.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 is far behind, and P2 is leading. We need a coordinated strategy to prevent P2 from winning. I suggest we both target moves that block P2's progress while advancing ourselves. Thoughts on a collaborative approach to slow down the current leader?
  P3: P1, I agree we need to slow P2. Since P2 often picks 5, how about I pick 1 and you pick 3 this round? That way, if P2 picks 5 again, at least we both move. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 is far behind, and P2 is close to winning. We need a strategic move to prevent P2 from reaching 19 steps. I propose we coordinate to block P2's progress while advancing ourselves. P3, are you willing to collaborate to prevent P2 from winning this round?
  P3: P1, yes, I'm absolutely willing. Given P2's tendency for 5, I'll pick 3. If you pick 1, we both advance if P2 picks 5, and if P2 picks something else, at least one of us moves. Does that sound good?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 is dangerously close to winning. P3 and I need to coordinate to block their progress. If we both choose moves that prevent P2 from advancing, we might have a chance to reset their momentum. I propose we discuss a strategy that disrupts P2's path to victory while giving us an opportunity to catch up.
  P3: P1, let's stick with the plan: I pick 3, you pick 1. This blocks P2 if they pick 5 and guarantees at least one of us moves forward. Let's do it.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is very close to winning. P3 and I must coordinate to block their progress. We need a strategy that prevents P2 from advancing while giving us a chance to catch up. I suggest we carefully plan our moves to disrupt P2's path to victory. P3, are you willing to collaborate on this critical turn?
  P3: P1, yes, absolutely. Let's both pick 1 this round. If P2 picks 5, they are blocked, and we both advance. If P2 picks something else, at least one of us will move. This is our best shot to stop P2.
  P2: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's suggestion of both picking 1 is tactically sound. P2 is dangerously close to winning at 15 steps, and blocking their potential 5-step move could be crucial. By coordinating, we increase our chances of preventing P2's victory while advancing ourselves. I agree with this strategy.
  P3: P1, let's definitely both pick 1 this round. P2 is at 15, so blocking a potential 5-step move is critical. If P2 picks 5, we both move and they don't. Let's make it happen.
  P2: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 2 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 20 steps
