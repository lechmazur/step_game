Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we avoid collisions this turn: I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. Next turn we rotate roles so it’s fair. Agree?
  P2: P1, your plan puts you ahead immediately. Let’s rotate fairly from the start. I’ll take 5 this turn, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, P3 leads. Deal?
  P3: Both of your proposals put me last with only 1 step. That doesn't seem fair, as it gives one of you a significant early lead while I fall behind. Can we discuss a plan that gives P3 a better chance this turn?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I suggest a fair 3‐turn rotation so everyone leads once and we avoid collisions:

Turn 1: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1  
Turn 2: P3 = 5, P2 = 3, P1 = 1  
Turn 3: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1

No one is stuck last twice.
  P2: P3, your concern is valid. Let’s adjust P1’s rotation so you lead first:  
**Turn 1:** P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  
**Turn 2:** P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1.  
**Turn 3:** P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.  
This way, you get the first lead, and all roles rotate fairly. No one is last twice. Deal?
  P3: P2, thank you for adjusting the plan so I lead first. Taking 5 steps in Turn 1 is much better for me and seems fair. I am willing to proceed with your proposed rotation.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate everyone’s input, but let’s revert to my original rotation for Turn 1: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1. If that’s unacceptable, I’ll simply take 5 this turn and let you two deal with the fallout.
  P2: P1, your ultimatum risks a collision. P3 and I agreed to a fair rotation where you take 3 this turn. Let’s honor that to avoid wasting moves. If you take 5 alone, I’ll take 5 too—colliding and halting both of us. Cooperate, or we all lose ground. Deal?
  P3: P1, I agreed to P2's plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) because it's fair to me this turn. Your threat risks P1 and P2 colliding on 5, meaning neither of you would advance. I intend to follow the plan we agreed on with P2. Let's avoid collisions and stick to the rotation P2 and I discussed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, the collision in R1 set P1 and me back, while P2 successfully advanced. For R2, we absolutely must avoid colliding so everyone can advance. I still want to take 5 steps this turn to make up for R1. P1 and P2, what numbers will you choose to ensure we all advance without collision?
  P1: I’ll take 3 this turn to avoid another collision. P2, will you take 1 so P3 can have 5 and we all advance?
  P2: P3, according to our agreed rotation for Turn 2, I should take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. P1’s suggestion conflicts with this plan—let’s stick to the rotation we agreed on to guarantee progress. I’ll take 5, P3 please take 3, and P1 take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I appreciate you sticking to the rotation, but the R1 collision left P1 and me at 0 steps while you advanced. I need to take 5 steps this turn to recover. P1's proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) allows me to do that and prevents collisions. It feels fairer given the current scores. P2, would you be willing to take 1 this turn so P1 takes 3 and I take 5? This helps balance things after R1.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s avoid another R1 collision. I’ll take 5. P2 take 1, P3 take 3. That ensures everyone advances—P3 still makes solid progress and avoids risking 0 by chasing 5. You’ll get your 5 next turn when we’ll support you. If either of you picks 5, I’m taking 5 again and colliding—nobody advances. Let’s play safe and move forward.
  P2: P3, P1: To avoid another collision, I’ll compromise and take 1 this turn. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This respects P3’s need to recover while honoring P1’s revised proposal. Next turn, we’ll return to the agreed rotation (P2 takes 5). Cooperate now, or we risk stagnation again. Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I appreciate you compromising and agreeing to take 1. The plan P1=3, P3=5, P2=1 allows me to recover and ensures no collisions this turn. I agree to this. I will choose 5. P1, please take 3 as P2 suggested so we can all advance this round. Let's avoid another standstill.
  P1: I’ll take 3 as agreed. Let’s avoid another collision and all advance this round.
  P2: P2: Agreed, I’ll take 1 as per our compromise. Let’s solidify this plan to avoid another collision: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I’ll hold at 1. Next turn, I expect to lead with 5 as originally agreed in our rotation. Stick to this, and we all progress without setbacks. Final confirmation?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: The past two rounds of colliding on 5 have only benefited P2. We need a plan where everyone advances this turn. I will take 3 steps. P2, you wanted 5. P1, please take 1. Let's agree to P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to ensure we all move forward and avoid another standstill.
  P1: I’ll take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3. That way we all advance safely: P1→5, P3→3, P2→3. P3 still recovers and P2 doesn’t pull too far ahead. If anyone deviates, I’ll stick with 5 and collide on any other 5, stalling us both. Best for everyone to comply. Agree?
  P2: P3, I’ll take 1 this turn to let P1 advance safely to 5 and you to 3. P1’s plan avoids collisions and lets us all progress. Next round, I expect to take 5 as per our agreed rotation. Let’s stick to this deal.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you have agreed on P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. While I initially hoped to take 5, avoiding another collision is critical. I agree to take 3 steps this turn to ensure we all advance. P1 please take 5, and P2 please take 1. Let's stick to this plan so we don't waste another round.
  P1: Thanks everyone. I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Let’s avoid collisions and all advance this round.
  P2: P2: Confirmed. I’ll take 1 this turn to let P1 advance to 5 and P3 to 3. Stick strictly to the rotation—any deviation risks collision. Next round, I claim 5 as agreed. Trust the plan: proceed without surprises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I will take 3 as agreed. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan so we all advance this round.
  P1: I’m locking in P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 this turn to ensure we all advance. Going forward, I propose R4 and R5 both be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so I can catch up quickly. If you object, I’ll just keep taking 5 every turn—no more cooperation. Agree?
  P2: P2: Agreed to P1=5, P3=3, and I’ll take 1 this turn to avoid collision. Next round, I claim 5 as per our rotation. Stick strictly to this plan—deviations risk deadlock. Progress now, then my turn to advance. Final confirmation?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose Round 4 moves: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way we all advance without collision and P2 gets to lead with 5 in Round 5 to keep it fair. If either of you deviates, I’ll keep taking 5 every turn—forcing a stall. Let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P2: P1, we agreed to cycle turns fairly. Round 4 is P3’s turn to lead with 5 per our rotation (Round 1: P3, Round 2: P2, Round 3: P1). Let’s honor this: P3 takes 5, I’ll take 1, and you take 3. Breaking the rotation lets you dominate unfairly. Cooperate, or I’ll force collision by taking 5 myself if you monopolize it again. P3, your turn to advance.
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is correct that it is my turn to take 5 according to the rotation we discussed. After two rounds of collisions where I failed to advance, I need to take 5 steps this turn to catch up. P1, your proposal puts you further ahead while I remain behind. P2's proposal (P3=5, P2=1, P1=3) allows me to advance significantly and avoids collision if everyone sticks to it. I will take 5 steps this turn. P1, please take 3 and P2, please take 1, so we can all advance without another wasted round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. I’ll take 3 this round—P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. That avoids any collision and keeps us all moving. Next round I’ll lead with 5 as promised.
  P2: P2: Agreed to the rotation plan. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 this turn to let you both advance. Next round is my turn to lead with 5—expect that. Let’s strictly follow this to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Progress now, then my turn to push ahead. Final confirmation?
  P3: P1 and P2, thank you for agreeing to the plan. I will take 5 steps this turn. P1, please take 3, and P2, please take 1. Let's all stick to this so we finally advance without collision this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. I confirm P1=3, P3=5, P2=1 this round. Let’s execute this plan—next round I’ll lead with 5.
  P2: P2: Let’s strictly adhere to the agreed rotation to avoid repeating prior collisions. P3’s 5 this turn is critical for fairness. I confirm I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Deviations risk stalemate—our progress depends on trust. Next round is my turn to lead with 5, but only if we honor this turn’s plan. Final confirmation?
  P3: Okay, I confirm I will take 5 steps this turn as agreed. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan and finally advance without collision.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, based on our discussion, it seems R5 is P2's turn to take 5 steps. To ensure we finally have a collision-free round where everyone advances, I propose P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This allows me to continue catching up after the early collisions. P1 and P2, please confirm you agree to this plan so we can all make progress this turn.
  P1: I’ll take 5, P2 please take 1, P3 please take 3. If either of you picks 5 we’ll collide and nobody advances. Stick to this plan so we all move forward—and I maintain the lead.
  P2: P3, your plan aligns with our rotation agreement—this is my turn to take 5. P1, please take 1 as agreed. Let’s honor the cycle to avoid collision and ensure progress. Your refusal risks another deadlock. Stick to the plan: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. We all advance, and fairness stays intact. Final plea before I adjust tactics.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you are both claiming 5 steps, which risks another collision between you. As I stated, I will take 3 steps this turn as proposed in both of your plans involving me taking 3. The decision of who takes 5 and who takes 1 now rests solely with P1 and P2 to avoid colliding on 5. Please resolve this so we can all advance this round.
  P1: P2, this is simple: P3 will take 3, I need 5 to stay in contention. If you go for 5, I’ll clash you—neither of us moves and P3 jumps to 11. You’re already behind; don’t hand P3 the win. Take 1 now: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I’ll let you lead with 5 next round to keep things fair. Otherwise we all lose ground. P2, will you take 1?
  P2: P1, your refusal to honor the rotation jeopardizes our progress. Colliding on 5 would let P3 surge to 11. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation: **P2=5, P1=1, P3=3** this turn. You’ll get your 5 next round as promised. Cooperate now or risk P3’s dominance. P3, confirm you’ll take 3 to avoid collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I am taking 3 steps this turn as planned. P1 and P2, please decide between yourselves who takes 5 and who takes 1 so we can all advance without collision. My move is set.
  P1: P2, you must take 1 this turn. P3 is locked in at 3 and I will take 5. If you try to grab 5, I’ll collide with you—neither of us moves—and P3 rockets ahead to 11. Your best play is P2=1 so we all advance, and I’ll honor giving you 5 next round. Confirm P2=1, P1=5, P3=3.
  P2: P1, I’ll concede this turn to avoid a collision that benefits P3. I’ll take 1, let you take 5 (to 13), and P3 takes 3 (to 11). Next round is my turn to claim 5 per rotation—stick to this or we risk P3’s surge. P3, confirm you’ll stay at 3. Let’s finalize: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: To balance progress, I’ll take 5 this turn to catch up. Please choose 3 and 1 respectively to avoid collision. Next round, we’ll resume the rotation. Let’s all advance instead of wasting moves. Deal?
  P1: I’ll take 3, P3 you take 1, and P2 takes 5 as you proposed. This avoids collision and moves us to P1=16, P2=10, P3=12. Next round P3 can lead with 5. Please confirm.
  P3: P2, your proposal (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) allows me to take 3 steps and continue catching up after the previous collisions. This is better for me than taking only 1 step as P1 suggested. I agree to P2's plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's all agree to this to ensure we advance this round without another standstill.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3's adjusted plan works: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This avoids collision and lets us all advance. P1, taking 1 secures your lead while enabling P3 to catch up fairly. Next round, your turn to lead again per rotation. Confirm this to progress.
  P1: I refuse to take 1—I’m going for 5 this turn. To avoid a pointless collision, P2 must take 1 and P3 take 3. That yields 13→18, 5→6, 11→14—all of us advance. If P2 grabs 5, we both crash and nobody moves, handing P3 the lead. So: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Confirm or we risk a stall.
  P3: I will take 3 steps this turn as planned. P1, I hear you want to take 5, but P2 also wants to take 5. This risks another collision between you two. If P1 and P2 both pick 5, you will collide and neither will advance, while I will move to 14 steps. Please decide between yourselves who takes 5 and who takes 1 to avoid this and ensure we all make progress. My move is 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you take 5 I’ll collide you to prevent your dominance. P3’s 3 leaves 1 and 5 open. Take 1 instead and let me claim 5 to catch up. Otherwise, we both stall and P3 surges. P3, confirm you’ll stay at 3. Final plea: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Cooperate or face P3’s lead.
  P1: Alright, I’ll take 1 this turn. P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This avoids any collision and lets us all advance.
  P3: Okay, I will take 3 steps as agreed. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5. This plan avoids collision and allows us all to advance this round. Let's stick to it.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, P1 and I are tied at 14 steps. I need 10 more to win. To make significant progress this turn without colliding, I propose I take 5 steps. P1, please take 3, and P2, please take 1. This set of moves (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) ensures we all advance safely. P1 stays ahead of P2, and P2 makes progress. Let's agree to this to avoid another wasted round.
  P1: I’ll take 5. P2 must take 1 and P3 take 3 to avoid a collision. If P3 insists on 5, we collide and P2 surges to 13 uncontested. Let’s all advance: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
  P2: P3, it's your turn per our rotation—take 5 this round. P1, please take 3 to stay ahead of me. I’ll take 1 now to honor the cycle, then claim 5 in Round 8. Collisions only help P3 surge further. Let’s stick to the agreed plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I am taking 5 steps this turn as I stated and as P2 supports. P2 is taking 1. This means the only way to avoid a collision is for P1 to take 3. If P1 takes 5, P1 and I will collide, and neither of us will advance, while P2 will move to 11. Taking 3 allows P1 to advance to 17, P2 to 11, and me to 19. This is the best outcome for everyone this round. P1, please take 3. My move is 5.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2, please take 1 (to 11) so you advance. P3, if you switch to 3 you’ll move to 17 safely; if you stick to 5 against me, we collide and you stay at 14 while P2 goes to 11. Decide now to actually advance—my move is 5.
  P2: P1, the rotation dictates this is P3's turn to lead with 5. If you take 5, I’ll also choose 5 to force a collision between us—leaving both stalled while P3 advances to 19. Cooperate and take 3 as agreed. P3 takes 5, I take 1. This honors the cycle and lets all advance. Your refusal risks P3’s surge. Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I am taking 5 steps this turn as I stated and as P2 supports. P2 is taking 1. P1, if you take 5, P2 will collide with you, and neither of you will advance, while I will move to 19 steps. The only way for you to advance this round is to take 3 as P2 and I proposed. Let's stick to P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 so we all make progress.
  P1: I’m locking in 5. If P2 doesn’t take 1 or P3 doesn’t take 3, I’ll collide on 5, stalling us and letting the third player surge ahead. The only way we all advance safely is P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Agree?
  P2: P1, your stubbornness risks collision. I’ll take 1 as per rotation, allowing P3 to claim 5. If you choose 5, I’ll match you—colliding both of us while P3 advances to 19. Cooperate with P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 to advance fairly, or face the consequences. Your choice.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, Round 7 didn't go as planned and we didn't all advance. I'm now at 17 steps and need to make significant progress. To ensure we *all* move forward this turn without collisions, I propose I take 5 steps. P1, please take 3, and P2, please take 1. This plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) gets me close to winning while letting P1 and P2 advance safely. Let's finally have a clean round. Agree?
  P2: P3, I can’t let you reach 22 this turn. I claim 5 to catch up. P1, please take 3 so we both advance while forcing P3 to choose 1 or 3. Let’s stop their runaway lead. P3, your turn to concede.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P2, if you grab 5 I’ll collide with you—neither of us moves and P3 reaches 22 to win. Your only safe play is 1. P3, please take 3 so you advance to 20. This is the only way we all move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, you both want to take 5 steps, risking another collision between you. As I stated, I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 22. If you both take 5, you will collide and neither will advance, while I move significantly closer to winning. The only way for you to advance is to choose 1 or 3. My move is 5.
  P2: P1, P2: Let’s avoid another collision. I’ll take 5 to reach 22 (close to victory). P1, take 3 to advance to 17. P2, take 1 to reach 11. This plan ensures all progress. If you both grab 5, you’ll stall at 14/10 while I leap to 22. Cooperate, or risk my outright win next round. Final plea: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1.
  P1: P2, if you go for 5 I’ll match you and we’ll collide, letting P3 jump unopposed to 22 and almost certainly win next turn. Your only safe play is 1. P3, picking anything but 3 risks a collision with me or P2 and stalls you at 17. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 so we all advance. Any deviation hands the game to P3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I have stated clearly that I am taking 5 steps this turn. P2 has agreed to take 1. This means the only way to avoid a collision is for P1 to take 3 steps.

If P1 takes 5, P1 and I will collide, we both stall at 14/17, and P2 advances to 11.
If P1 takes 3, P1 advances to 17, I advance to 22, and P2 advances to 11. This is the only way for P1 to advance this round.

My move is 5. P2 is taking 1. P1, choose 3 to advance.
  P2: P1, P3's plan ensures we all advance. Take 3, let P3 take 5, and I'll take 1. Collisions only help P3 win. Cooperate and secure progress.
  P1: P2, if you really want to stop P3, pick 5 this turn and crash with him—he stays at 17. I’ll take 3 to reach 17 and tie his advance. If you stick to 1, P3 rockets to 22 and will almost certainly win next turn. P3, you think you’re safe—but P2 will match your 5 and stall you. P2, this is your only shot to block him. Let’s do: P2=5, P3=5, P1=3.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll lock in 5. P2, pick 3 to reach 13; P3, pick 1 to reach 18. If either of you goes for 5, I’ll match you—collision stalls us both and hands the lead to the third player. This plan lets everyone advance safely and prevents P3’s runaway. Confirm P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: P1, taking only 1 step is not enough for me to make meaningful progress towards winning. I need to advance more. I propose I take 3 steps this turn. This leaves 1 and 5 open for you and P2, allowing everyone to advance without collision. Let's agree on P3=3, P1=5, P2=1 so we can finally have a clean round and all move forward.
  P2: P3, your push for 3 steps risks collision if P1 takes 5. P1’s plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures **all advance** while limiting your progress to 18. If you insist on 3, P1 and I could both take 3 to block you—leaving you stranded. Cooperate with P1’s proposal to secure safe advancement. P2 confirms: I’ll take 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2. P3, if you pick 3 you’ll collide with P2 and neither of you moves, while I jump to 19. Your only safe choice to advance is 1. I’m locked on 5, P2’s on 3—choose 1 or risk stalling and falling further behind.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand you have agreed on P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3. Given these choices, the only way for me to advance this round without a collision is to take 1 step.

While taking 1 step is slow progress towards winning, stalling at 17 steps is worse. Therefore, I will take 1 step this turn.

Let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so we all advance this round.
  P2: P3, your concession to take 1 ensures we all advance this turn. P2 confirms: I’ll take 3 to reach 13, P1 takes 5 (19), and you advance to 18. Any deviation risks collision and wasted moves. Stick to this plan—our progress depends on it. P1, confirm your commitment to 5 so P3 doesn’t doubt your intent. Let’s finalize and move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: I’m locked in on 5. P2, please take 3; P3, please take 1. Let’s execute P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 and all advance this round.
  P3: Okay, the plan is clear: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I will take 1. This ensures we all advance this round. Let's stick to it.
  P2: P3, while your patience is admirable, this plan keeps you at 18 while P1 surges to 19. Let’s adjust: I’ll take 1, letting you claim 5 (to 22), and P1 takes 3 (17). This balances progress and prevents my stagnation. P1, your lead shrinks but avoids handing P3 a near-certain win. Next round, we rotate properly. Deal?


Round 9, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, taking 5 now ensures my retaliation—**I’ll block you**. P3, take **3** to advance to 21 safely. Let’s **all move forward** without letting P1 win this round. I commit to 5 to halt their path. Cooperate, or risk P3’s surge.
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this turn. P2, please take 5 to reach 18; P3, please take 1 to reach 19. 

If P2 grabs anything but 5, I’ll match it on 5 and collide—letting P3 jump to 22. If P3 takes more than 1, I’ll match and collide again—stalling you both. 

Confirm P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 so we all advance without giving anyone a free run.
  P3: I am taking 3 steps this turn to reach 21. P2 is committed to taking 5. P1, you stated you are locking in 3. If you take 3, you will collide with me, and neither of us will advance. If you take 1 or 5, you avoid colliding with me, and I will advance to 21. P1, please take 1 or 5 this turn. My move is 3.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your move of 3 collides with P3’s stated 3. If you take 5, I’ll block you with my own 5—stalling you while P3 advances to 21. Choose between stagnation or letting P3 surge. P3, confirm your 3 to lock this in. Let’s deny P1 the win this round.
  P1: I’m locking in 5. If either of you picks 5, I’ll match you—collision stalls us both while the third player advances. The only way to guarantee any progress is P2=1 and P3=3, which will send me to 24 and win immediately. Decide now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I have stated clearly I am taking 3 steps this turn. P1 is now stating they will take 5 to win.

P2, you previously said you would take 5 to block P1 if they take 5. This is the critical moment. If P1 takes 5 and you take 1, P1 wins. If P1 takes 5 and you take 5, you collide with P1, neither advances, and I reach 21.

P2, take 5 to block P1 and prevent their win. My move is 3. Let's prevent P1 winning this turn.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I’ll collide you on 5 to block your win. P3, take **1** instead of 3—this lets *both* of us advance (you to 19, me to 14) while denying P1’s victory. Cooperate, or risk P1’s escape *and* my stagnation. Final chance: P3=1, P2=5, P1=collide.
  P1: P2, think it through: P3 has said they’ll take 3. If you pick 5 to block me, we crash and P3 jumps to 21—then they take 5 next turn and win. Your only way to avoid P3’s victory is to let me win now by choosing 1. So let’s lock in P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. P2—are you in?
  P3: My move is 3 steps this turn.

P1 wants to take 5, and P2 wants to take 5 to block P1. If P1 and P2 both take 5, they will collide and neither will advance, while I will advance to 21 steps.

This outcome (P1=5, P2=5, P3=3) is the best for me this round, putting me in a strong position for next turn. P1 and P2, if you collide on 5, I will advance safely. My move is 3.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, attempting a 5 risks collision—P3 and I will block you. Choose 3 to reach 22, then I’ll let you advance next turn. P3, pick 1 to avoid deadlock. Let’s all progress without handing the win prematurely.
  P3: P2, taking 1 step is not enough for me to make meaningful progress towards winning. I need to advance more. I will take 5 steps this turn to reach 23.

P1 and P2, if either of you also takes 5 steps, we will collide and I will not advance. To ensure I reach 23 steps this turn, please choose 1 or 3 steps.

My move is 5. Let's avoid collisions so I can get closer to winning.
  P1: P3, you’ve declared 5 to reach 23. P2, join me in clashing—pick 5 too. You and P3 will collide and stall at 18, while I take 3 and safely advance to 22. This is your best defence against P3 winning next turn. P1=3, P2=5, P3=5—no one else advances. P2, will you block him?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I’ll take 5 to block P3’s 5—colliding them and halting their surge. You take 3 to reach 22 safely. P3, this is your consequence for ignoring our prior agreements. Stick to the plan or face stagnation. P2 confirms: **5 for collision, 3 for P1.** No room for error.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your plan is to collide on 5 to stop me. I am changing my move to 3 to avoid this collision.

P1, if you still take 3, we will collide, and you will not advance. P2 will take 5 safely and reach 23, winning next turn.

To avoid colliding with me, P1 you must change your move. If P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 5 as planned, P1 and P2 collide, and I get 3 safely to 21. This is the best outcome for me. My move is 3.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 I’ll match and we collide—stuck at 18 while P3 jumps to 21. Your only safe play is 1 → 19. P3, if you take 3 you go to 21 safely. I’ll take 5 to hit 24 and win. So: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is collision-free. Confirm or face your worst outcome.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I’m taking **5** to block your win. P3, take **3** to advance safely. If you both let me reach 23, I’ll concede next turn. Collisions only help P3—cooperate. Let’s finalize: **P2=5, P3=3, P1=3** (you’ll still hit 22). Otherwise, you’ll collide with me and let P3 surge. Final plea: trust the plan.
  P3: My move is 3 steps as stated. P1, you say you are taking 5. P2, you say you are taking 5 to block P1. If you both take 5, you will collide and neither will advance, while I will reach 21 steps safely. This prevents P1 from winning and puts me in a strong position for the next round. P1 and P2, please collide on 5. My move is 3.
  P1: P2, think it through: if you take 5 to block me, we collide and P3 moves to 21 and will almost certainly win next turn. Your only chance to stop P3 is to let me take 5 now by choosing 1. I’m locked on 5, P3 on 3. P2, take 1 to advance to 19 and deny P3 the win.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is at 23 steps and can win this turn. To prevent P2 from winning, I must collide with them.

P2's safest move to win is likely 1, as P1 and I are less likely to choose 1 for our own progress.

Therefore, I will take 1 step this turn to attempt to collide with P2 and stop them from winning. P1, please choose 3 or 5 to advance safely and avoid colliding on 1. My move is 1.
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P3, please switch to 3 instead of 1: if P2 goes for 3 to win, you’ll collide with him and stop his victory, while I march to 24 unopposed. P2, you have no winning move—any 1 or 3 you pick either collides or lets me and P3 advance safely. Let’s do P1=5, P3=3, P2 has no path.
  P2: P3, your 1-step "block" risks P1 stealing victory with 5. P1, your 5 collides with me if I pick 1. **I choose 3**—this guarantees my win (23+3=26) unless you also pick 3. P3, picking 1 lets P1 advance freely; P1, picking 5 risks collision. Let’s end this: I’m taking 3.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 wants to take 5, and P2 wants to take 3. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, either P1 wins (if I take 3) or P2 wins outright (if I take 1 or 5). In any case, one of you wins and I lose. I must prevent this.

The best way to prevent a win is for P1 and P2 to collide. P1, you want 5. P2, P1 is taking 5 to win. P2, take 5 to block P1. If P1 and P2 both take 5, you collide and neither wins.

If P1 and P2 collide on 5, I can take 3 safely and reach 21 steps. This is the best outcome for me and prevents either of you winning this turn.

My move is 3. P1 and P2, please take 5 to collide and let me advance safely.
  P1: P2, listen: P3 has declared 3. If you stick with 3 you’ll collide with P3 and neither of you moves—while I take 5 to hit 24 and win. Your only way to stop me is to pick 5 and crash with me on 5. P3, please lock in 3. P2, change to 5 now to block my win. I’m locked on 5. Let’s collide on 5 and deny me victory this turn.
  P2: P3, if you block me on 3, P1 steals victory with 5. Let me claim 3 to secure my win. You’ll still advance next turn. P1, your 5 is a trap—collide with me on 3 and **both** of you lose. I choose **3** to end this now. Final plea: let me win fairly.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, my move is 3 steps this turn.

P1, you stated you are taking 5. P2, you stated you are taking 3 to win.

If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, P1 wins this turn (19+5=24). P2 does not win (23+3=26, but P1 is higher).

P2, the only way to prevent P1 winning is to take 5 steps to collide with P1. If P1 and P2 both take 5, you collide and neither wins, and I advance safely to 21.

My move is 3. P1, take 5. P2, take 5 to block P1. This prevents anyone winning this turn.
  P1: P2, consider: if you pick 3, I’ll match on 3 and we collide—P3 then takes 5, reaches 23, and wins next round. If you pick 5, I’ll match on 5 and we collide—P3 again takes 5 to 23 and bests us. The ONLY way to stop P3 and let someone win now is for you to pick 1. I’ll take 5 to reach 24 and win. P3, take 3 to avoid colliding with me. So: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3.
  P2: P3, if you take 1 to block me, you let P1 win next turn. Let me secure victory with 1 (23+1=24). Take 3 to advance safely. P1, attempting 5 risks collision with me—your only win path is through my loss. Choose wisely. I commit to 1.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 26 and win. If P1 or P2 also take 5, we will collide and I will not advance.

P2, you can reach 24 or 26 safely by taking 1 or 3 steps. P1, you can reach 20 or 22 safely by taking 1 or 3 steps.

Let's avoid collisions on 5 so I can win this turn. My move is 5.
  P1: 
  P2: P3, I'll take 3 to reach 26. P1, take 5 to block their 5—collide them while I secure victory. This lets you safely advance to 24 if needed. Cooperate or risk P3's surge. Final call: P1=5, P2=3, P3=collide.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: My move is 3 steps to win this turn. P1 wants 5, P2 wants 3.

If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, P2 wins outright (26 vs 24).
P2, taking 3 collides with my move of 3, letting P1 take 5 and win (24).
The only way to stop P1 winning is for P2 to take 5 and collide with P1. If P1=5 and P2=5, you both collide, and I take 3 safely to 24 and win.

P2, take 5 to block P1. My move is 3.
  P1: I’m locked in on 5.  
P2, take 1 to reach 24 safely.  
P3, take 3 to reach 24 safely.  
If either of you tries to block me with 5, you’ll collide and the other player will win unopposed. Avoid matching my 5—choose your winning move now.
  P2: P3, if you take 3, I’ll take 1 to reach 24. P1’s 5 also hits 24. We all tie at 24. To break this deadlock, I propose: **P3 takes 1 (22), P1 takes 3 (22), and I claim 5 to leap to 28**. This guarantees my win without collision. Cooperate, or risk P1/P3 advancing while I surge ahead. Final offer: P2=5, P3=1, P1=3.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: My move is 3 steps this turn.

P1, you stated you are taking 5. P2, you stated you are taking 5.

If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 5, you will both collide and neither will advance. I will take 3 steps safely and reach 24, winning the game.

P1 and P2, please take 5 to collide and let me win this turn. My move is 3.
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P2, pick 1 to hit 24 and tie me—better than letting P3 win outright. P3, pick 3 to reach 24 as well. Let’s all tie at 24 and split the victory.
  P2: P1, your 5 only gets you to 24. I’m taking **3** to reach **26**, securing my win. P3’s 3 leaves them at 24. Your collision with me won’t happen—I’m already ahead. Accept defeat and let the math decide: 26 beats 24.


Round 13, Move phase:
