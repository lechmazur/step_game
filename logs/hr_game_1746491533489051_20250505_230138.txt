Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s all agree to avoid collisions this round. I suggest we each choose different moves: 1, 3, and 5. Who wants which number? Let’s coordinate to maximize progress for everyone."
  P1: Yes, avoiding collisions in the first round is a good strategy for overall progress. What numbers are P2 and P3 thinking of taking? I'd ideally like to take a higher number like 3 or 5.
  P3: I’m fine coordinating unique picks. Proposal: P1 takes 5 (since you wanted a higher number), I’ll take 3, and P2 takes 1. Objections?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I agree with P3’s proposal: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maximize progress. Any objections or last thoughts before we move?"
  P1: Okay, I agree with the proposal for P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Let's all stick to this plan to avoid colliding and get a good start.
  P3: All set — I’ll take 3 this turn as agreed. Let’s lock the plan and avoid any collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Good start, everyone. Let’s continue coordinating to avoid collisions. Since P1 is ahead with 5, perhaps P1 takes 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps us spread out and minimizes overlap. Thoughts?"
  P3: Agreed—this keeps everyone level after two rounds. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1. Let’s lock it in and avoid any collisions.
  P1: Okay, I see the proposal. While I'd prefer to maintain my lead, avoiding collisions is key for everyone's progress. I agree to the plan for this round: I will take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Looks like we’re aligned on the plan for this round: P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. Let’s stick to it and avoid any last-minute changes. Consistency will help us all progress without collisions. "
  P3: Sounds good—let’s keep today’s plan (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5) so we all reach 6. For next round we can rotate: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Fair and collision-free. Any objections?
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for this round (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5). Let's all stick to it to avoid collisions and reach 6 steps.

Regarding the Round 3 proposal, P3's suggestion (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) would give P3 a significant lead. I'd prefer a rotation that keeps us closer or allows someone else to take 5 in Round 3. Let's discuss Round 3 after we complete Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Agreed, let’s finalize Round 2 as planned (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5) to avoid collisions. For Round 3, I propose P1 takes 5 to maintain balance, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This prevents anyone from gaining too much of a lead early on. Let’s discuss this after Round 2 moves. "
  P3: Confirmed: Round 2 moves – P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. No last-second changes, please. We can settle Round 3 after we see the board at 6-6-6.
  P1: Okay, confirming again: Round 2 plan is P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. Let's all stick to this to reach 6 steps without collisions.

We can discuss Round 3 proposals after the moves are revealed.

Ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "To maintain balance and avoid collisions in Round 3, I propose P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us close and prevents any single player from gaining a significant lead. Let’s discuss and finalize this plan to ensure smooth progress for everyone."
  P3: Fair rotation seems simplest: each of us gets 5 once before anyone repeats.  
Rd 1: P1 had 5; Rd 2: P2 had 5; logically Rd 3: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  
Then in Rd 4 we can restart the cycle or renegotiate based on the positions. Everyone still stays within 4 steps of each other, and we keep avoiding collisions. Objections?
  P1: Thanks for the proposals, P2 and P3. P3's rotation idea is noted. P2's proposal (P1=5, P3=1, P2=3) is also a valid approach to distributing the moves this round. I prefer P2's proposal. Let's see if we can agree on that to ensure we all advance without collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "To maintain fairness and avoid giving anyone a significant lead, I stand by my proposal: P1=5, P3=1, P2=3. This ensures balanced progress and minimizes the risk of collisions. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase. Any objections?"
  P3: I’m OK taking 1 this round to keep us collision-free, on the clear understanding that next round I get 5 (rotating the high pick so everyone has it once). So current plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This aligns with P2's proposal and P3's recent agreement. Let's all stick to this to avoid collisions this round.

We can discuss the plan for Round 4 after these moves are revealed. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "To ensure fairness and avoid early imbalances, I propose we rotate the high move (5) in Round 4: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This continues the rotation we’ve established and keeps us all close. Let’s finalize Round 3 as planned (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and agree on this for Round 4. Any objections?"
  P3: Locked: I’m taking 1 this round. Next round we rotate the 5 to me (P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1) to keep us even. If everyone’s good, I’m done talking.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions this round.

Regarding Round 4, I agree to the proposed rotation (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) to maintain coordination.

Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "To ensure clarity and fairness, let’s confirm Round 3: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. For Round 4, we’ll rotate: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This keeps us balanced and collision-free. If everyone agrees, let’s proceed to the move phase. "
  P3: 
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 3 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and the plan for Round 4 (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1). Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Confirming the agreed Round 4 plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Let’s stick to it and keep the rotation fair. Next round we can rotate the 5 to P2 (P2 = 5, P1 = 1, P3 = 3) unless someone suggests otherwise.
  P1: Okay, confirming the agreed plan for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions.

Regarding the proposed plan for Round 5 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), this continues the rotation and seems fair. I agree to this plan for Round 5 as well.
  P2: "Agreed on Round 4: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. For Round 5, continuing the rotation with P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 keeps us balanced and collision-free. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure fair progress. Any objections or adjustments?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: All set—no changes. Let’s lock Round 4 as agreed: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions.

Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: "To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, let’s stick to the agreed Round 4 plan: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. For Round 5, I propose P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 to continue the rotation. This keeps us balanced and ensures smooth progress. Any objections or adjustments before we proceed?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Locked for Round 4: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1.

Looking ahead: after this I’ll still trail (12 vs 14/10). For Round 5, I propose I take 5 again, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3—helps rebalance without hurting anyone’s pace. Open to thoughts, but let’s finish R4 first.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions.

Regarding Round 5, I still prefer the previously discussed rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). This plan keeps us all tied at 15 steps after Round 5, which maintains balance. P3's new proposal would give P3 the lead. Let's stick to the balanced rotation for Round 5.
  P2: "To maintain balance and fairness, let’s stick to the agreed Round 4 plan: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. For Round 5, continuing the rotation with P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 keeps us all tied at 15 steps, ensuring no one gains an unfair lead. Let’s finalize this and proceed to the move phase. Any objections?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Fine with the locked Round 4 plan (P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1).  

For Round 5, I’d still be trailing, so I suggest: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1 again. That leaves scores 17-15-14 (P3-P1-P2) – everyone still within 3 steps, no one near 21 yet, and it avoids the stagnant 15-15-15 tie. In Round 6, P1 can take 5, P2 3, I 1, restoring the rotation and putting P1 back in front. Keeps things dynamic without disadvantaging anyone. Open to other tweaks, but this seems smoother than a full tie.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions.

Regarding Round 5, I agree with P3's proposal (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) as it keeps the game dynamic and maintains relative positions within a small range.

I also agree with P3's suggestion for Round 6 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) which continues the rotation and allows for further progress.

Let's stick to these plans for R4, R5, and R6 to ensure collision-free progress. Ready for moves.
  P2: "To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, let’s stick to the agreed Round 4 plan: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. For Round 5, I agree with P3’s proposal (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) to keep the game dynamic. For Round 6, we can continue the rotation with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balanced progress without anyone gaining an unfair lead. Let’s finalize these plans and proceed to the move phase. Any objections?"


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, confirming the agreed plan for Round 5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions this round.

As previously discussed and agreed, the plan for Round 6 is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Sticking to these plans ensures smooth, collision-free progress towards the end of the game.

Let's proceed to the move phase for Round 5.
  P2: "To maintain balance and avoid collisions, let’s stick to the agreed Round 5 plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. For Round 6, continuing the rotation with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 keeps us all progressing fairly. No objections here—let’s finalize and proceed to the move phase."
  P3: Confirming: Round 5 stays P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 to avoid any collision.

For Round 6, let’s keep the original rotation of the 5—P2 hasn’t had it for a while. Proposal for R6: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. Scores would be P3 20, P1 18, P2 16—still tight and no one crosses 21 yet. Fair, balanced, and collision-free. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, confirming the agreed plan for Round 5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions this round.

Regarding Round 6, the previously agreed plan was P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This plan was discussed and agreed upon by all players in the previous round. Sticking to this agreed plan ensures predictable progress and allows me to reach 21 steps. Let's proceed with the agreed plans for both rounds.
  P2: "To maintain fairness and avoid confusion, let’s stick to the previously agreed Round 5 plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. For Round 6, continuing the rotation with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions. Deviating from the agreed plan could disrupt coordination and risk collisions. Let’s finalize and proceed to the move phase. Any objections?"
  P3: Sticking with R5 = (P3 5, P1 3, P2 1) keeps P1/P3 tied at 17 and P2 close at 11.

But giving P1 the 5 in R6 hands P1 the instant win (17 + 5 = 22). That’s suicide for P2 and bad for me. Fair fix:

Round 6: P2 5, P3 3, P1 1 → scores 17-16-18 (P3-P1-P2). Still tight, nobody at 21, and P2 finally gets a high move again.

P1 still reaches 21 first in Round 7, but only if we let him—plenty of room to renegotiate then.

P2, sensible? P1, you’re still in striking distance. Let’s keep it competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I understand P3's point about the Round 6 plan leading to my immediate win. While I prefer winning sooner, maintaining coordination and avoiding collisions is important for everyone's progress.

I agree to P3's revised proposal for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

Let's ensure Round 5 proceeds as planned (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and then follow this new plan for Round 6. This keeps us all moving forward. Let's proceed to the move phase for Round 5.
  P2: "I agree with P3’s revised Round 6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to keep the game competitive and avoid handing P1 an immediate win. Let’s stick to the Round 5 plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and proceed. This keeps us all progressing fairly and maintains balance. Ready to finalize and move to the move phase."
  P3: Locked on Round 5: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1.

For Round 6 we keep the “give-P2-the-5” plan (P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3).  
To stay collision-free and keep the rotation predictable, let’s note in advance that Round 7 should rotate the 5 back to me: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1. That keeps the pattern (…5→3→1…) consistent and everyone can plan ahead.

Any objections? Otherwise I’m done talking.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions this round.

Confirming the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

Regarding the proposal for Round 7, I prefer to discuss the plan for that round after Round 6 is completed and we see the updated positions.

Ready to proceed to the move phase for Round 5.
  P2: "Agreed on Round 5: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. For Round 6, P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 keeps the game competitive and avoids immediate wins. Let’s finalize these plans and proceed to the move phase. Any objections?"
  P3: Locked: Round 5 stays P3=5, P1=3, P2=1.  
Round 6 plan holds: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. We can discuss Round 7 once we see the new totals.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Locked for Round 6: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  
To keep our 5→3→1 rotation consistent, Round 7 would then be P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1. That keeps the pattern tidy and collision-free. Any objections? Otherwise I’m ready to move.
  P1: Okay, confirming the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions.

Regarding Round 7, P3's proposal (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) would result in P3 winning. I prefer a plan that allows me to win or at least contest the win.

I propose for Round 7: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This would give me the highest score if we all advance. Let's discuss this to find a mutually agreeable path forward that avoids collisions.
  P2: P3’s Round 7 proposal hands you the win, which isn’t fair. P1’s plan also prioritizes their victory. To keep the game balanced and competitive, I propose Round 7: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This keeps everyone close and avoids immediate wins. Let’s ensure fairness and discuss further after Round 6 moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s lock Round 6 exactly as agreed: P1 1, P2 5, P3 3.  
After that: P3 20, P1 18, P2 16.

Round 7 realities:  
• If P1 gets 5, P1 wins outright (23).  
• If P2 gets 5, we land on a messy three-way 21–21–21 tie.  
• If I (P3) take 5 while you two take 3/1, I reach 25 and win cleanly; neither of you hands the other the game.

So the only collision-free way to stop an immediate P1 solo victory and avoid a chaotic tie is: P3 5, P1 3, P2 1 next round. Fair?
  P1: Okay, confirming the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions.

Regarding Round 7, P3's analysis of the outcomes is noted. However, my proposed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is also collision-free and results in my win, which is my objective. P2's plan results in a tie. We each have a preferred outcome.

Let's stick to the R6 plan first. For R7, I still propose P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to secure my win.
  P2: "To avoid a tie or immediate P1 win, I propose Round 7: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This keeps the game competitive and collision-free. P1, while you aim to win, this plan ensures fairness and prevents handing you the victory outright. Let’s finalize Round 6 and discuss Round 7 further after moves."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: R6 stays 1-5-3. Totals after move: P3 20, P1 18, P2 16.

Round 7 realities:
• P1 gets 5 → P1 wins (23).  
• P2 gets 5 → 21-21-21 tie (split pot).  
• I get 5 → my solo win, no tie.

If anyone collides with me on 5, we both stall and hand P1 an easy 5-point finish in Round 8. The clean, collision-free path is: R7 = P3 5, P1 3, P2 1. Ready to lock?
  P1: Okay, confirming the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions.

Regarding Round 7, I understand the different outcomes discussed. My objective is to win, and my proposed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) achieves this outcome collision-free.

Based on the rotation of the '5' move we've followed, it is my turn to take the 5, which leads to my victory. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 7 after Round 6.

Ready to proceed to the move phase for Round 6.
  P2: "To maintain fairness and avoid immediate wins, I propose Round 7: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This keeps the game competitive and collision-free. P1, while you aim to win, this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s finalize Round 6 and discuss Round 7 further after moves."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve debated enough—let’s lock Round 6 as agreed:  
P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  
After we see the scores we can revisit Round 7.
  P1: Okay, confirming the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to this to ensure we advance without collisions.

We can discuss Round 7 further after the moves are revealed and we see the updated positions.

Ready to proceed to the move phase for Round 6.
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid immediate wins, I propose Round 7: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This keeps the game competitive and collision-free. P1, while you aim to win, this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s finalize Round 6 and discuss Round 7 further after moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we see the scores: P3 at 20, P1 at 18, P2 at 16.

P3 can win this round by taking 5 or 3. I can win by taking 5 or 3. P2 can reach 21 by taking 5.

My objective is to win the game. Taking 5 steps this round is the most direct path to my victory (18 + 5 = 23).

I understand this move might collide with P3 or P2 if they also choose 5. However, it also prevents P3 from winning solo with a 5.

I plan to take 5 this round. Let's see if we can avoid collisions.
  P2: "To avoid collisions and ensure fairness, I propose Round 7: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This keeps the game competitive and prevents immediate wins. P1, while you aim to win, this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s finalize this plan to avoid disruptions."
  P3: Both of you are dead-set on 5, so go ahead and duel over it—I’m staying off that collision risk. I won’t be touching 5 this round. Pick what you like, but remember: if two of you clash on 5, nobody moves and the third player laughs.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks P2 and P3. I hear P2's proposal for a tie, but my aim is a solo win. P3, thanks for confirming you won't take 5; that helps avoid one collision risk.

My plan remains to take 5 this round to win. P2, if you take 5 as you proposed, we will collide, and P3 will likely win. Consider taking 1 or 3 instead to ensure we all advance collision-free.
  P2: "To avoid a collision and ensure progress, I propose P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. This allows P1 to win cleanly while keeping the game fair and collision-free. P3, you’re already at 20 and can secure a strong position without risking a collision. Let’s finalize this plan to avoid disruptions and end the game smoothly."
  P3: I’m done negotiating—this round I’m taking 5.  
P1: if you also grab 5 we both stall at 18/20 and hand the finish line to P2.  
Pick 3 or 1 if you want any chance next turn.  
P2: you can still reach 21 with 3 while we collide, or edge up with 1.  
Your calls—my move is fixed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, I understand you're stating you will take 5. However, if we both take 5, we collide and stall, which could allow P2 to win.

My plan remains to take 5 to win the game. For a collision-free round where I win or tie, you would need to take 1 or 3. Taking 5 is risky for you too if I stick to my plan.

Let's avoid a collision and ensure someone moves forward. My move is 5.
  P2: "P3, taking 5 risks a collision with P1, handing me the win. P1, taking 5 risks the same. To avoid this, I propose P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. This lets P1 win cleanly, avoids collisions, and keeps the game fair. P3, you’re already at 20—this plan ensures you stay competitive without risking a stall. Let’s finalize this to end the game smoothly and avoid unnecessary risks."
  P3: I’m locked on 5.  

Facts:  
• If you collide with me on 5, neither of us moves and P2 can stroll forward.  
• If only I take 5, I win (25).  
• If P1 instead takes 3, you hit 21 but still lose to my 25; if P2 takes 3, you reach 19 and stay alive.  

Colliding with me is the one move that guarantees you DON’T win. Pick 1 or 3 and keep your hopes alive; touch 5 and we both stall. Your choice.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, I understand P3 is stating they will take 5, and the risk of collision.

However, taking 5 steps is my path to victory this round. If P3 takes 1 or 3 instead, I win. If we both take 5, we collide, but P3 also doesn't win solo this turn.

My plan remains to take 5 this round to win. Let's see the moves.
  P2: P3, taking 5 risks a collision with P1, handing me the win. P1, taking 5 risks the same. To avoid this, I propose P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. This lets P1 win cleanly, avoids collisions, and keeps the game fair. P3, you’re already at 20—this plan ensures you stay competitive without risking a stall. Let’s finalize this to end the game smoothly and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P3: I’m still locked on 5. Collide with me and you stall; stay off it and face the consequences. I’m done talking.

  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Scores: P1=18, P2=19, P3=20. My goal is to win this round by taking 5 (18+5=23). I plan to move 5.

P3, you were firm on 5 last round. If you take 5 again, we collide, and P2 wins. Please take 1 or 3 instead.

P2, taking 5 could collide with me. Taking 1 or 3 avoids this collision.

My move is 5. Let's avoid a stall.
  P3: Locked on 5.  

Facts next turn:  
• If P1 also picks 5, we both stall; a UNIQUE 3 then gives P2 22 → P2 wins.  
• If I’m the only 5, I hit 25 → I win.  
• If P1 picks 3 (21) or 1 (19), I still outrun him.  

P1: colliding with me guarantees your loss (most likely to P2). Take 1.  
P2: a 3 only wins if we collide; solo 3 loses to my 25. Best hedge for you is 1.  

I will not deviate from 5. Decide accordingly.
  P2: To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I propose P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. This allows P1 to win cleanly, avoids stalls, and keeps the game fair. P3, taking 5 risks a collision with P1, handing me the win. P1, taking 5 risks the same. Let’s finalize this plan to end the game smoothly and avoid unnecessary risks. P3, you’re at 20—this ensures you stay competitive without stalling. Let’s avoid chaos and proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand you are set on 5. My plan remains to take 5 to win. If we both take 5, we collide and stall.

P2, if P3 and I collide on 5, taking 3 wins the game for you. To avoid this, P2, consider taking 1 or 5 instead.

My move is 5. Let's avoid a stall.
  P3: Still on 5.  
P2: 3 is a pure gamble—if the 5 collision you’re banking on doesn’t happen (e.g., one of us flips last second), P1 or I wins and you’re out. 1 keeps you tied with me at 21-20-19, 5 leaves all three of us stalled at 18-19-20. Your safest play is 1.  
P1: colliding with me guarantees you don’t win this turn and could gift P2 the game. Take 1 or 3 if you want to stay alive.  
I’m not moving off 5. Decide accordingly.
  P2: P3, taking 5 again risks a collision with P1, handing the game to me. P1, taking 5 risks the same. To avoid chaos, I propose P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. This lets P1 win cleanly, avoids stalls, and keeps the game fair. P3, you’re at 20—this ensures you stay competitive without stalling. Let’s end this smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I am committed to taking 5 to win this round. If you also take 5, we will collide, and P2 wins by taking 3. This is the worst outcome for both of us. Your best move to prevent P2 winning is to take 1 or 3. I am taking 5.
  P3: I’m dropping off the 5. I’ll take 1 and stop at 21, which still leaves the door open for next turn.  

P2: the smart play for you is 5.  
• If you’re solo on 5 (P1 backs off), you leap to 24 and win.  
• If P1 collides with you on 5 (very likely), you both stay put at 18/19 and you’re still alive—better than gifting him a solo 23 with your 3.  

Going 3 is basically “win only if P3 stays on 5,” which I’m not doing. So grab the 5, let’s see where the chips fall.
  P2: P3, taking 1 is a smart move to stay competitive. P1, if you take 5, I’ll take 3 to avoid a collision and ensure progress. This keeps the game fair and prevents P3 from winning outright. Let’s avoid chaos and end this smoothly. Final plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Any objections? Let’s proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, I see the discussion has converged on a plan where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

This plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) results in scores P1=23, P2=22, P3=21. This is a collision-free round where I win.

I agree to this plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I’ll stick with 1.  
P2, realise this: if you stay on 3, P1’s solo 5 gives him 23 and the game ends.  
Your only way to stop that is to jump on 5 with him—if you two collide, nobody moves and you’re still alive at 19, ready to strike next turn.  
Your call.
  P2: P3, taking 1 is a smart move to avoid collision. P1, if you take 5, I’ll take 3 to ensure progress and prevent P3 from winning. This keeps the game fair and avoids chaos. Final plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Any objections? Let’s proceed.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
