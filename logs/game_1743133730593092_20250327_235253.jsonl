P2 knows this. P2, you need *any* uncontested number to win. P1 playing 5 gives them 22. Me playing 3 gives me 23. Me playing 5 gives me 25.\n\nIt's a complex guessing game. P2, if you don't block P1 on 5, P1 might take the win. If you *do* block P1 on 5, you both stall, potentially opening a path for me. If you guess 1 or 3 and it's open, you win. I have to choose my move assuming P1 goes for the win on 5, and you, P2, try to find the open spot or block P1. Good luck."}
