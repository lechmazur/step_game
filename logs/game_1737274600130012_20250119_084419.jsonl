The game requires coordination to avoid collisions while aiming to be the first to reach or exceed 17 steps.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Coordination**: Agree to an initial plan to avoid collisions in the first turn.\n2. **Adaptive Strategy**: Be open to adjusting the plan based on the game's progression.\n3. **Minimize Risk of Collision**: Choose moves that minimize the chance of stepping on the same number as other players.\n4. **Maximize Progress**: Aim for larger steps when safe to do so, to reach the goal faster.\n\n### Solution Code\nSince this is a strategic game rather than a coding problem, there isn't any code to provide. However, the strategy can be outlined in a step-by-step manner.\n\n### Solution Code Explanation\n1. **Initial Plan Agreement**:\n   - In the first turn, agree to a plan where each player chooses different step sizes (1, 3, or 5) to avoid collisions.\n   - For example, P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps.\n\n2. **Adaptability**:\n   - After the first turn, be flexible and ready to adjust the plan based on the positions and previous outcomes.\n   - Encourage open communication to coordinate moves in subsequent turns.\n\n3. **Risk Management**:\n   - Always choose a step size that is least likely to cause a collision based on the expected choices of other players.\n   - Prioritize larger steps when it is safe to do so, to make faster progress towards the goal.\n\n4. **Winning Condition**:\n   - Aim to be the first to reach or exceed 17 steps.\n   - If multiple players reach the goal in the same turn, aim for the highest step count to win outright or be prepared to share the victory if tied.\n\nBy following this strategy, I can maximize my chances of winning while minimizing the risks associated with collisions."}
