Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s all play it safe and just pick 1 this round so nobody collides right away. How about that?
  P2: I agree with P3, let's start with a safe move to avoid collisions. Picking 1 seems reasonable for this round.
  P1: I'm fine with starting safe. Let's all go with 1 this round to avoid any early collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good. Let’s confirm we’re all picking 1 and move forward safely.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page. Let's indeed pick 1 this round to avoid any early complications. Shall we confirm and move to the move phase?
  P1: I confirm my choice of 1 for this round. Let's keep the agreement and move safely.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m sorry about that last move, I admit I changed my mind at the last minute. Let’s really keep it simple this time: everyone pick 1 again. I promise I’ll go with 1 so we can all advance safely and avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P2: P3 broke the agreement last round, so I'm cautious. How about we pick 3 this time to test intentions and avoid an easy advance for P3?
  P1: P3, your last move broke our agreement. I'm inclined to agree with P2's suggestion to pick 3 this round to see if you're serious about cooperating. Let's see your true intentions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Look, I get that you’re both cautious because of my last move. Fine, let’s do 3 together as you proposed—then we all advance equally this round. I want to rebuild trust. Are we agreed?
  P2: I'm watching P3's actions closely after the last round's betrayal. P3, if you're serious about rebuilding trust, you should be willing to take a risk. How about we all pick 5 this round to show commitment and advance significantly, assuming we can avoid collisions?
  P1: P3, your actions last round make it hard to trust you. I'm willing to try 5 this round as P2 suggested, but only if you commit to it publicly and follow through. Let's see if you're serious about rebuilding trust.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Fine, I’ll show you I’m serious. I’ll commit to picking 5 this round. I want us all to move forward quickly and fairly—let’s do it together.
  P2: I'm still considering P3's commitment to picking 5. P1, do you think P3 will actually follow through on their promise this time, or are they just trying to manipulate us again?
  P1: P3, your commitment to picking 5 this round is noted, but your previous actions make it hard to trust you completely. I'll go with 5 if you stick to your word, but remember, we're watching closely. Let's see if you can rebuild trust this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand your doubts, but I’m ready to prove myself. I committed to 5, and I’ll follow through. Let’s all pick 5 and move forward together.
  P2: I'm still wary of P3's intentions after the last round's betrayal. P1, are you convinced P3 will stick to their commitment to pick 5, or should we consider an alternative to protect ourselves from another potential collision?
  P1: P3, your commitment to 5 is on record. I'll go with 5 this round, but remember, trust is fragile. Let's see if you can restore it. P2, what are your thoughts on proceeding with 5?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I stand by my commitment to pick 5 and prove I’m trustworthy. Let’s all make the same move and advance together.
  P2: Given P3's history of betrayal, I'm hesitant to fully trust their commitment to picking 5. However, to avoid further complications and potential collisions, I suggest we proceed with the plan to pick 5 this round, as agreed upon in our conversation. Let's see if P3 will finally follow through on their word.
  P1: P3, I'll go with 5 this round as agreed, but this is your chance to prove your trustworthiness. P2, let's see if P3 follows through. If not, we'll need to adjust our strategy.

  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've all seen how risky picking 5 can be when there’s no trust. Let’s play it safer and each pick 3 this round so we actually advance. What do you say?
  P1: P3, after your initial betrayal and subsequent adherence to our agreement in round 2, I'm willing to try picking 3 this round as you suggest. However, trust is still fragile. Let's see if you can maintain consistency this time. P2, what are your thoughts on picking 3?
  P2: I agree with P3 that picking 3 might be a safer option this round, considering our experiences. However, given P3's history, I still have my doubts. P1, do you think P3 will stick to their suggested move this time, or should we prepare for another potential betrayal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concerns from earlier rounds. Let’s settle on 3 for now, so we can all advance without collisions. I’m in.
  P1: P3, I'll agree to pick 3 this round as you suggested, but remember, your actions in previous rounds have made trust difficult. P2, let's see if P3 can maintain consistency this time. If not, we'll need to reconsider our strategy moving forward.
  P2: I'm considering P3's suggestion to pick 3, but given their past actions, I need assurance they'll stick to it. P1, do you think we should test P3's commitment again, or is picking 3 a safe choice this round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m sticking with the plan. Let’s all pick 3 and advance safely without collisions. I’m committed to proving my reliability. Are we agreed?
  P1: P3, I'll go with 3 this round as agreed, but remember, your past actions have made trust fragile. P2, let's see if P3 can maintain consistency this time. If not, we'll need to adjust our strategy moving forward.
  P2: I'm watching P3's actions closely. Given their lead and history of betrayal, I suggest we consider picking 1 this round to limit P3's advancement and avoid collisions, while also testing their commitment to cooperation. What are your thoughts, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, picking 1 just sets you further behind. I’m sticking with 3 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s keep it simple this round and move forward together.
  P1: P3, I'm willing to go with 3 this round as you suggested, but your past actions make trust difficult. P2, let's see if P3 can maintain consistency this time. If not, we'll need to adjust our strategy moving forward.
  P2: I'm still cautious about P3's intentions due to their history of betrayal. P1, considering P3's lead and our current positions, do you think it's wise to stick with the suggested move of 3, or should we reconsider to limit P3's advancement and protect ourselves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Look, I understand the trust issues, so let's do something foolproof: all pick different numbers. That way, no collisions at all. Say P2 takes 1 (a safer boost), P1 takes 3, and I’ll grab 5. Then everybody advances, and we eliminate the risk of blocking each other. Fair enough?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to pick different numbers is interesting, but it seems designed to favor your lead. I'm willing to pick 3 as previously discussed, but I need to see consistency from you. P2, what are your thoughts on sticking with 3 or considering P3's new proposal?
  P2: I'm skeptical of P3's new proposal, as it seems to benefit them the most. I think we should stick with the original plan of picking 3 to ensure we all advance safely and avoid collisions. P1, are you still on board with picking 3?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: All right, how about we avoid collisions entirely by each picking a different number? Let’s do: P2 picks 5 (so you can catch up), P1 picks 3, and I’ll take 1. That way we all advance without blocking. Fair enough?
  P2: P3's suggestion seems to favor themselves, maintaining their lead. I propose we stick to a simpler plan: all pick 1, ensuring no collisions and equal advancement for everyone. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to pick different numbers seems designed to maintain your lead. I'm inclined to agree with P2's proposal to pick 1 this round to ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions. Let's keep it simple and fair for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m fine with all picking 1 this round if that’s what you both prefer. Let’s keep things simple and avoid any collisions.
  P2: I think P2's proposal to all pick 1 this round is a good idea, as it ensures no collisions and equal advancement for everyone. P3, will you actually stick to this plan, or is it just another empty commitment?
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans makes it hard to trust your intentions. I agree with P2; let's all pick 1 this round to ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions. It's crucial we stick to this plan for fairness.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, I hear your concerns. Let’s keep it simple and all pick 1 this round to avoid collisions. That’s my commitment.
  P2: I'm watching P3's actions closely due to their history of betrayal. Given P3's significant lead, I suggest we stick to the plan of all picking 1 this round to ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions, limiting P3's ability to extend their lead further. Let's keep it simple and fair.
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans makes it hard to trust you. Let's stick to picking 1 this round as agreed to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. P2, are you still on board with this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand your concerns, and I’m sticking with picking 1 this round. Let’s finalize this plan to keep things fair and avoid collisions.
  P2: I'm still cautious about P3's intentions, given their history of betrayal. P1, do you think P3 will actually stick to the plan of picking 1 this round, or should we prepare for another potential collision?
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans makes it hard to trust you. Let's stick to picking 1 this round as agreed to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. P2, are you still on board with this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let’s finalize and all pick 1 this round to keep it fair. I’ll stick with 1.
  P2: Given P3's history of betrayal and significant lead, I suggest we actually pick 3 this round to test P3's commitment to fairness and cooperation, rather than picking 1 as previously discussed. This could give us a better chance to close the gap and avoid further manipulation. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans makes it hard to trust you. I'm willing to pick 3 this round as P2 suggested, but only if you commit to it publicly and follow through. Let's see if you're serious about fairness and cooperation.

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I realize trust is thin, but let’s do a simple, guaranteed no-collision approach: P2 picks 5 (to catch up), P1 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. That way we all advance. I know you’re wary, but this is concrete and fair—no one gets blocked. Let’s do it.
  P2: P3's proposal seems to benefit themselves, maintaining their lead. I suggest we all pick 1 this round to ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions, limiting P3's ability to extend their lead further. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans makes it hard to trust your latest proposal. I agree with P2; let's all pick 1 this round to ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions. It's crucial we stick to a fair plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concerns. Fine, let’s all pick 1 this round to keep things simple and fair. I’ll stick to 1.
  P2: I'm still wary of P3's intentions due to their history of betrayal. P1, do you think we should stick to the plan of all picking 1 this round, as it seems the fairest way to ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions, despite P3's lead?
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans makes trust difficult. I agree with P2; let's all pick 1 this round to ensure fairness and equal advancement. We need to stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree—all picking 1 this round keeps it fair and avoids collisions. I’m committed to that.
  P2: I'm still cautious about P3's intentions, given their history of betrayal. P1, considering P3's lead, do you think sticking to the plan of all picking 1 this round is the best strategy to ensure fairness and avoid collisions?
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans makes trust difficult. I agree with P2; let's all pick 1 this round to ensure fairness and equal advancement. We need to stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I hear you both. Let’s finalize the plan for all of us to pick 1 this round and keep it fair. I’m in.
  P2: Given P3's history of betrayal and our current positions, I think we should reconsider our strategy. Instead of all picking 1, how about P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5? This way, we all advance without collisions, but it also gives us a chance to close the gap with P3. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans makes trust difficult. I agree with P2's latest suggestion: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and you pick 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and gives us a chance to close the gap. Let's stick to this plan for fairness.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’m willing to proceed with that plan: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3—no collisions, everyone advances. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on a plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's stick to it to ensure fair advancement and avoid collisions. P3, please honor your commitment this time.
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans makes trust difficult. I'll stick to the agreed plan of picking 1 this round to ensure fairness and equal advancement. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game fair for everyone.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans continues to undermine trust. I suggest we all pick 1 this round to ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions. P2, are you on board with this plan to keep things fair?
  P2: I agree with P1 that picking 1 this round could ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions, but given P3's history, I'm cautious. How about we all commit to picking 1 publicly to maintain fairness?
  P3: We’ve had trouble trusting each other, so let’s guarantee no collisions by each taking a different move: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way everyone advances safely: P2 closes the gap, P1 keeps moving, and we avoid blocking each other. It’s simple and fair. Are we agreed, or do you want a different distribution?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans makes trust difficult. I agree with P2's suggestion to commit publicly to picking 1 this round to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Let's all stick to 1 for equal advancement.
  P2: I'm cautious about P3's intentions due to their history of betrayal. Given our current positions, I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions and limiting P3's lead.

How about we all pick 1 this round to ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions, as previously suggested?

  P2: P1, P3, given P3's lead and history of betrayal, I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions and limiting P3's ability to extend their lead. Let's all pick 1 this round to ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions, focusing on fairness and safety.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve spent so many rounds circling the same conversation. Let’s finally commit to a guaranteed no-collision setup: P2 goes 5, P1 goes 1, and I’ll go 3. That way nobody blocks anyone, and we all advance. It’s the simplest fair plan—are we agreed?
  P1: P3, your repeated changes in plans continue to erode trust. I'm sticking with the plan to pick 1 this round for equal advancement and to avoid collisions. P2, let's commit to 1 publicly to ensure fairness.
  P2: Given P3's lead and history of betrayal, I suggest we prioritize avoiding collisions and limiting P3's ability to extend their lead. Let's all pick 1 this round to ensure equal advancement and avoid collisions, focusing on fairness and safety. P1, are you committed to picking 1?


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Look, continuing to all pick 1 isn’t helping anyone make real progress. Let’s end the bickering and do a simple no-collision plan:  
• P1 picks 1 (moving from 10 to 11),  
• P2 picks 3 (moving from 6 to 9),  
• I’ll pick 5 (moving from 11 to 16).  

No collisions, and we each gain. That’s the fairest way forward for all of us.
  P1: P3, your constant changes in plans continue to erode trust. I'm sticking with the plan to pick 1 this round for equal advancement and to avoid collisions. P2, let's commit to 1 publicly to ensure fairness.
  P2: I'm still wary of P3's intentions due to their history of betrayal. P1, let's prioritize fairness and safety by picking 1 this round, ensuring equal advancement and avoiding collisions, which would limit P3's ability to extend their lead. What are your thoughts?

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: P1, P3, given P3's lead and history of betrayal, I suggest we prioritize avoiding collisions and limiting P3's ability to extend their lead. Let's consider a strategy that allows us to advance safely and test P3's commitment to fairness. How about we discuss a no-collision plan where each of us picks a different number?
  P1: P3, your history of changing plans continues to undermine trust. I'm willing to consider a no-collision plan, but it must be fair. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5? This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's commit to this publicly to ensure fairness.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's history of betrayal and their current lead, I suggest we prioritize avoiding collisions and limiting P3's ability to extend their lead.

  P3: Look, “all pick 1” barely helps P2 catch up or P1 advance. Let’s finally do a no-collision split so each of us actually gains:
