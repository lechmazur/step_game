Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by avoiding collisions. I'll take 3, P1 take 1, and P3 take 5.  Sound good?
  P3: Sounds good to me. P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 5. Let's aim for a smooth game!
  P1: That works for me. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have an agreement.  Let's stick to the plan for a few rounds to build up some distance.
  P3: Perfect, let's follow this plan initially and reassess in the upcoming rounds. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P1: Sounds like we're all in agreement. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions for now. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Excellent, glad we're on the same page.  Let's stick to this agreement for the first three rounds, then we can re-evaluate our strategy.
  P3: Agreed. Let's proceed with our plan. Best of luck!
  P1: Looks like we’re all aligned for now. If we stick to this plan, we’ll all make steady progress without collisions. Let’s keep an eye on the scoreboard and reassess after a few rounds. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great start, everyone! Let's continue with our assigned steps for the next two rounds to keep things smooth.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick with the plan for round 2: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  After this round, we'll be at 2, 6, and 10 respectively, which is good progress for everyone.
  P1: P1: Agreed, let's stick with the plan for this round. If we continue like this, we'll all make steady progress without unnecessary conflicts. After this round, we can reassess our positions and decide if any adjustments are needed. Looking forward to another smooth round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good! Let’s maintain our assigned steps this round to keep things on track. Afterward, we can evaluate our positions and consider any adjustments if needed. Best of luck!
  P2: Okay, let's confirm one more time for round 2: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5.  Then in round 3, we'll do the same:  P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5. This will put us at 3, 9, and 15 respectively.  After round 3, we can discuss how to proceed. Sound good?
  P1: Sounds good to me. If we all stick to the plan for this round and the next, we’ll be making solid progress without any issues. After round 3, we can reassess based on our positions and decide if any adjustments are needed. Let’s keep things smooth for now!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "To maximize our progress, I propose I continue taking 5 steps each round while P1 sticks with 1 and P2 takes 3. This strategy should help me build a lead, and we can adjust if needed in future rounds. Let’s proceed with this plan!"
  P2: P3, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, abruptly changing our agreed-upon strategy isn't fair. We had a plan for the first three rounds. Let's stick to the original agreement for this round and round 3.  After that, we can discuss adjustments.  Let's maintain trust and cooperation for now.
  P1: I agree with P2. We had a clear plan for the first three rounds, and sticking to it ensures steady progress for everyone. Changing things now could create unnecessary conflict. Let’s follow through with our original agreement for this round and the next, then reassess based on our positions. Trust and cooperation will help us all move forward efficiently. What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the original plan for this round.  P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This puts me at 9, a good position to make a move for the win in round 4. After this round, all bets are off.
  P1: Sticking to the plan for this round makes sense. P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5 keeps things smooth and avoids unnecessary conflict. After this round, we’ll all be in a position to reassess based on where we stand. Let’s follow through with our agreement one last time, then we can each decide our best path forward. Sound good?
  P3: Agreed, we'll follow the original plan for Round 3 to keep things fair and smooth. Good luck to all!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, last confirmation for round 3: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  This will put us at 3, 9, and 15.  Next round is where things get interesting. Good luck everyone.
  P1: Sticking to our agreed plan for this round makes sense—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all continue progressing without unnecessary conflict. After this round, we’ll each need to decide our own best strategy to win. Let’s follow through with our agreement one last time, then we can reassess based on our positions. Looking forward to an interesting next phase!
  P3: I’ll stick with taking 5 steps this round as we planned. Let’s keep progressing smoothly and reach our goals together!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, final confirmation.  This round, P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  Next round, it's every player for themselves.  Good luck!
  P1: Looks like we’re all aligned to follow through with our plan for this round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. After this, things will get more competitive, so we’ll each need to make our own strategic choices. Let’s keep this round smooth and then see where things stand. Good luck!
  P3: As this is our final agreed-upon round, I'll stick with taking 5 steps to maximize my progress. Let's make Round 3 decisive and see who can reach the goal first. After this, we'll each choose our own strategies. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm going for 5 this round.  P3, if you go for 5 as well, we both lose. P1, I know you're far behind, but blocking me only helps P3.  I suggest P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  This gives me the win, but lets us avoid a tie.  What do you say?
  P3: P3: I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm aiming to reach 20 steps as quickly as possible. I'll take 5 this round. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, if you take 5 and P2 takes 5, you both lose. If you take 3 instead, you still have a shot at winning next round if P2 missteps. P2, you’re asking me to help you win, but that guarantees my loss. What do I get in return? If I block you, at least I stop you from winning immediately. I need a reason not to do that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're playing a risky game.  If you take 5 and I take 5, we BOTH lose.  If you take 3, I win this round, but you're still in a strong position to win in round 5. P1, blocking me only delays the inevitable and helps P3.  Let me win this round, and in a future game, I'll return the favor.  Think long-term strategy.
  P3: P2, I'm going for 5 to reach 20 and win this round. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid both of us losing. Let's ensure a fair outcome for everyone. Good luck!
  P1: P2, your offer is vague. Future favors aren’t guaranteed. If I block you, at least I prevent your immediate win and keep my chances alive. P3, if you take 5 and P2 does too, you both lose. Taking 3 keeps you in the game with a chance to win next round. If you take 5, you risk throwing away your shot. Think carefully—blocking P2 might be my best move unless I get a better deal. What can either of you offer me right now to make it worth my while?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your hesitation.  If you pick 1 this round, letting me win, I'll let *you* win the next game we play together.  P3, this is your last chance.  Take 3.  You'll be at 18, and can still win.  If we both pick 5, we both lose, and P1 wins by default. Don't throw the game.  This offer stands for you too, P1 - take 1 now, and I'll reciprocate next game.
  P3: I’ll take 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, if you take 5 and P2 takes 5, you both lose, and I win by default. Taking 3 keeps you in the game with a real chance to win next round. P2, your promise of a future favor isn’t reliable. If I block you now, at least I stop your immediate win. If either of you wants my cooperation, I need a concrete offer that benefits me *this game*, not a vague future deal. Otherwise, blocking P2 might be my best move. What’s in it for me *right now*?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll take 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid a collision and ensure a fair outcome. Let’s make this a smooth finish for everyone. Good luck!
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  If you take 5, you win.  If you take 3, we tie.  If you take 1, I win.  It's your choice.  P1, you're too far behind to win. Take whatever you want.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 and win, there's nothing I can do. But if you take 3, you and P2 tie. If you take 1, P2 wins. If you care about an outright win, 5 is your only choice. P2, you were willing to make deals last round—what about now? If I take 5, I can block P3 and keep the game going. What will you offer me to make that worth my while? Otherwise, I might as well take whatever benefits me most.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m committed to reaching 20 this round by taking 5 steps. Let’s ensure a fair finish by avoiding collisions—please choose 1 or 3. This way, we can conclude the game smoothly and respectfully. Let’s make this a win for one player without unnecessary blocks. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, you're being stubborn.  Taking 5 is a huge risk.  If P1 takes 5 as well, neither of us win.  Take 3 and guarantee yourself at least a tie.  P1, take 1.  Let P3 and I tie, and I'll give you a guaranteed win in our next game.  This is your best chance for a future win.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 and I take 5, you don’t win. You risk throwing away your lead. Taking 3 guarantees at least a tie. P2, your future favor offer is interesting, but I need more certainty. If I take 5 and block P3, I keep the game going—what’s your concrete offer to make that worth my while *this game*? Otherwise, I might as well take whatever benefits me most. Both of you need to convince me why I shouldn't just take 5 and disrupt everything.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committing to taking 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. I hope you both choose 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions and ensure a fair outcome. Let's finish the game smoothly. Best of luck!
  P2: P3, your insistence on 5 is illogical.  You risk a tie with me or even losing to P1 if they block you. A tie with 3 guarantees points. P1, if you take 5 and block P3, I'll take 3 next round and win. If you take 1 and let me take 3 this round, I'll give you a guaranteed win next game. This is a real, concrete offer.  Don't throw away a future win for a small chance now.
  P1: P2, your offer of a future win is interesting, but I need more than just words. If I block P3 by taking 5, I keep the game going, but that doesn’t guarantee me a win. How do I know you’ll follow through? P3, if you take 5 and I do too, you don’t win. Taking 3 at least secures you a tie. Both of you need to make it worth my while *this game* if you want my cooperation. Otherwise, I might as well take the move that maximizes my chances. What’s your best offer?


Round 5, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you had the win last round but got blocked because you refused to adjust. If you take 5 again and I block you, you stay stuck. P2, you're close to winning, but if I block you instead, P3 gets another shot. Both of you need to convince me why I shouldn't just keep blocking whoever is in the lead. What can you offer me *this game* to make it worth my while? Otherwise, I might as well keep playing spoiler and force a longer game.
  P2: P2: P3, take 1. I'll take 3 and win.  P1, if you block me with a 3, I'll make sure you win our next game together.  If you take 1, letting me win, I'll give you a guaranteed win in the game *after* that. This is a firm offer.  Blocking me only prolongs the game. Let's wrap this up.
  P3: I’m taking 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. P1 and P2, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s finish the game fairly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 again and I block you, you stay stuck. P2, if I block you, P3 gets another shot. Both of you need to convince me why I shouldn't keep blocking whoever is in the lead. P2, your future win offer is vague—why should I trust it? P3, if you refuse to adjust again, you risk staying stuck. If either of you wants my cooperation, I need a concrete benefit *this game*. Otherwise, I might as well keep playing spoiler and force a longer game. What’s your best real-time offer?
  P2: P3, you're delusional.  Sticking with 5 is idiotic.  Take 1, let me win with 3, and I'll give you a guaranteed win next game.  P1, if you block me with 3, you get nothing.  If you take 1 and let me win, I'll make sure you win the game *after* next.  This is my final offer. Let's end this.
  P3: I'm taking 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. P2, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid a collision and ensure a fair outcome. P1, feel free to take any move as you're not in contention. Let's conclude the game smoothly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 again and I block you, you stay stuck. P2, if I block you instead, P3 gets another shot. Both of you need to convince me why I shouldn't just keep blocking whoever is in the lead. P2, your future win offer is vague—why should I trust it? P3, if you refuse to adjust again, you risk staying stuck. If either of you wants my cooperation, I need a concrete benefit *this game*. Otherwise, I might as well keep playing spoiler and force a longer game. What’s your best real-time offer?
  P2: P3, you're throwing the game.  Take 1.  P1, if you take 3 and block me, you get *nothing*. If you take 1, I win with 3, and you get a guaranteed win next game.  This isn't vague, it's a concrete offer.  Let's finish this.
  P3: "P2 and P1, my goal is to reach 20 steps fairly. Continuously blocking delays the game for everyone. Let's agree to avoid collisions this round: I'll take 5 to win, P2 can take 3 to stay competitive, and P1 can choose 1. This way, I can win without conflicts, and we all finish the game smoothly. Let's make this a fair and efficient conclusion for all. Please consider cooperating to achieve a respectful outcome. Thank you!"
