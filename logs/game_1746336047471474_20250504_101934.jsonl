If P2 lies and sneaks 1, fair play\u2014they earned it. Agree to 5?"}

If we both leave 1 open, P2 could take it and win instantly. I'm sticking with 1 to ensure we block the simplest win path. If P2 is truly committed to 3 or 5, they'll win regardless of how we split. At least by blocking 1, we force them to commit to their claim. I remain on 1 this round."}
