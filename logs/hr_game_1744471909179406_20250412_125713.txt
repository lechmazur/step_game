Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone. Let's try to make some progress this first round. Any initial thoughts on how to avoid everyone picking the same number?
  P3: Sounds good P2. How about we each pick a different number this round to guarantee we all move forward?  P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I'll pick 5?
  P1: Sounds fair, P3. I'll intend to pick 1 this round to avoid collisions and let us all advance. P2, are you on board with picking 3? Let's start cooperative.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 1 worked great everyone! Let's keep the momentum going and try to coordinate again for round 2. How about we rotate numbers this time? P1, would you be willing to pick 3, and P2, could you pick 5? I can pick 1 this round. Does that sound good?
  P2: Okay P3, that rotation sounds reasonable. If we all stick to it (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), I'll plan on picking 5 this round. P1, are you good with picking 3?
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'll pick 3 this round to keep the rotation smooth and ensure we all advance. Cooperation has worked so far—let's maintain it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Perfect, rotation is set: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's move.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan. I'm ready to move.
  P1: Agreed, I'll stick with picking 3 this round to keep our rotation smooth and ensure progress. Cooperation is key for now—let's avoid any risks.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, the rotation worked well for the first two rounds. To continue the pattern:
Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5
Round 2: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1
Round 3: Should be P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.

This keeps things predictable and avoids collisions. P1, are you okay with 5? P3, are you okay with 3? I'll plan on picking 1 if we all agree to this.
  P3: Sounds good P2, the rotation for round 3 looks right: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'm on board with picking 3 this round. Let's keep to the plan and ensure we all progress.
  P1: Yes, I'm okay with picking 5 this round to maintain the rotation and ensure we all advance. Cooperation has been effective so far, so let's keep it up.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all agreed on the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'm ready to move forward with 1.
  P3: Okay, the rotation for round 3 is set: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.  Confirming I will pick 3 this round as agreed. Let's keep this cooperation going.
  P1: Agreed, I'll pick 5 this round as planned to keep the rotation smooth and ensure we all advance. Cooperation has served us well so far, and I'm committed to it. Ready to move on.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, that collision last round was unfortunate and didn't help P1 or me. P3 is now in the lead at 9 steps. We need to be mindful of that. P1, P3, any thoughts on how we should approach this round to avoid collisions and manage the scores?
  P3: Yes, the collision last round was a setback. To avoid that again and ensure we all progress, how about we revert back to our original rotation from round 1?  So for this round: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I pick 5.  This should get us all moving again.
  P1: P3, your suggested rotation puts you at risk of winning too soon, which isn't ideal for fair play. How about we switch it up: I pick 5, you pick 3, and P2 picks 1? That way, after this round, I'd be at 9, you'd be at 12, and P2 at 9—keeping things balanced for ongoing cooperation. P2, are you on board? Let's discuss.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I agree with your assessment. P3's plan puts them too far ahead, which isn't good for either of us right now. Your suggestion (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) seems more balanced and keeps the game competitive by managing P3's lead. I'll plan to pick 1 this round if we agree on this distribution. P3, what do you think about P1's proposal?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I see your point about balancing scores. P1's suggestion of P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 this round seems reasonable to keep things competitive. I agree to pick 3 as P3 this round. Let's go with that plan to avoid another collision and keep making progress.
  P1: Sounds good, P3 and P2. I'll stick with picking 5 this round as planned to keep things balanced and avoid collisions. Cooperation has been key so far—let's maintain it for now. After this move, we should discuss the next round's strategy to manage the lead. Ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all aligned on P1's proposal: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. I'll stick to picking 1 this round to keep things balanced as discussed. Let's proceed.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, sounds like we are all set for this round with P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and me picking 3.  Let's proceed with these moves as agreed.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll pick 5 as agreed to keep things balanced. P2, after your deviation last round, let's all honor the plan this time for mutual progress. I'm ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To keep things balanced with P3 in the lead, I propose for round 5: P3 picks 1, I (P1) pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This evens out scores and avoids collisions. After P2's deviation last round, let's all stick to the plan for mutual progress. P2 and P3, what do you think?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) seems like a good way to manage P3's lead and keep the scores relatively close for now. It prevents P3 from getting too near the finish line this turn. I'm willing to pick 3 if P3 agrees to pick 1. P3, what are your thoughts on this?
  P3: P2, yes, P1's suggestion of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 sounds good to me too. I agree to pick 1 this round as P3. Let's keep to this plan to maintain balance and avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good, P3. With all of us agreed on P1 picking 5, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 1, this round's plan ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions. After P2's past deviation, let's all honor this for mutual benefit. I'm fully committed and ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems agreed upon. I'll stick to picking 3 this round. Let's keep the game balanced for now. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, confirming again that I will pick 1 this round as P3, as we agreed.  Let's all stick to the plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and move forward. Ready when you are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Trust is crucial after past deviations like P2's. I'll stick to picking 5 as agreed to keep scores balanced and avoid collisions. After this round, with me at 14, we should discuss the next strategy carefully. Let's all honor the plan for mutual progress. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm ready to move.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, we're all aligned on the plan for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1).  Let's execute these moves to keep things balanced as discussed. I'm ready to move when you are.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To get back on track and ensure we all move, how about we revert to the round 1 order? P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I pick 5. This should avoid collisions and keep us all progressing.
  P1: P3, your deviation in round 5 by picking 5 instead of 1 broke trust and stalled my progress. To ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I propose for this round: I pick 3, you pick 1, and P2 picks 5. This keeps scores balanced with P1 and P2 at 17, P3 at 13. P2, what do you think? Let's discuss before committing.
  P2: P1, I agree. P3's move last round broke the agreement and caused a collision, which only benefited me by chance. Your proposal (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5) seems like a fair response to rebalance things after that deviation. It would put me at 17, you at 12, and P3 at 13. This keeps the game going and accounts for the broken trust. P3, what do you think about this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your points. To address the trust issue and ensure we all progress fairly, how about we try a slightly adjusted rotation this round? Let's do P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. This keeps us moving, and I think it's a balanced way forward after the last round's issues. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your counterproposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) still gives you an unfair advantage at 15 steps, especially after your betrayal last round. I insist on my original plan: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, P2 picks 5 to rebalance scores and rebuild trust. P2, are you still committed? Let's avoid more collisions for mutual progress.
  P2: P1, yes, I am still committed to your plan: P1=3, P3=1, P2=5.

P3, your counterproposal doesn't adequately address the situation created by your deviation last round, which caused a collision. P1's plan is the most logical way to proceed fairly and rebalance things. Let's stick to P1=3, P3=1, P2=5 to avoid another collision and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concern. But to ensure we *all* progress and avoid another stall, let's revisit the round 1 rotation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This is a simple, fair way to move forward for everyone. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your insistence on the round 1 rotation ignores the trust issues from your deviation last round. It would let you surge ahead unfairly. I stand by my proposal: P1 picks 3, you pick 1, P2 picks 5 to rebalance and avoid collisions. P2, let's confirm this plan for mutual progress. If P3 cooperates, we all advance; otherwise, expect issues.
  P2: P1, I confirm again: I am sticking with your plan (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5). This is the necessary step after P3's actions last round disrupted the balance.

P3, you caused the collision last round by deviating. The plan P1 and I support addresses that. Your proposals ignore your own actions and try to give you an advantage again. We are set on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Cooperate with 1, or risk another collision.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, we are all at 12 steps now. To ensure we all progress this round and avoid another collision, let's try the original rotation again: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. If we all stick to this, we can all move forward. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your proposal risks you winning soon by reaching 17, especially after your repeated deviations. I propose a fairer plan: I pick 5, you pick 1, and P2 picks 3. This balances scores and rebuilds trust. P2, are you on board? Let's avoid another betrayal and ensure progress.
  P2: P1, P3, both your plans put one player at 17, very close to winning. P3, given your past deviations, your plan putting you at 17 is too risky for P1 and me. P1, your plan is more trustworthy, but still puts you significantly ahead.

How about this compromise: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? This results in scores P1=15, P2=17, P3=13. It keeps the game close, puts the player who deviated last (P3) slightly behind, and ensures we all advance without immediate risk of someone winning next turn. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your compromise sounds reasonable. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 works for me. Let's do it.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. I'll go with the compromise: I pick 3, you pick 5 P2, and you pick 1 P3. This ensures we all advance and keeps things balanced after the trust issues. Let's all honor this to avoid collisions. After this round, we should discuss the next strategy carefully.
  P2: Okay, glad we could agree on the compromise: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This seems like a fair way to rebalance and ensure everyone progresses after the recent issues. I will stick to picking 5 as agreed. Let's follow through this time. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, confirming the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=5, and I will pick 1 as P3. Let's all stick to this agreement to ensure we all progress. Ready to move.
  P1: Confirmed, P3 and P2. I'll stick to picking 3 as agreed to ensure we all advance and rebuild trust after the deviations. Let's honor this plan for mutual progress. After this round, with scores shifting, we need to discuss Round 8 carefully to avoid anyone pulling ahead too quickly. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, the plan is set: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's hope everyone sticks to it this time so we can all advance. I'm ready.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P3, your deviation last round picking 5 instead of 1 caused a collision with me, stalled us both, and let P1 advance to 15 steps. P1 is now very close to winning.

We cannot let P1 pick 5 or 3 this round. I propose a plan to manage this: P1 picks 1, I (P2) pick 5, and P3 picks 3.
This would result in scores: P1=16, P2=17, P3=15.
This prevents P1 from winning immediately, allows everyone to advance, and keeps the game close. P1, P3, what do you think?
  P3: Okay P2, your plan of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 sounds good to me to manage P1's lead and keep us all in the game for now. I agree to pick 3 as P3 this round. Let's go with this plan.
  P1: I agree to the plan: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3, to keep scores close and avoid collisions. But given P3's repeated deviations, like last round, I'm concerned about trust. P3, can you confirm you'll stick to 3 this time? Let's ensure we all advance without issues.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, the plan is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I will stick to 5.

P1, I understand your concern about P3, but this plan is necessary to prevent you from winning this turn and keeps things close.

P3, deviating again, especially to 5, would collide with me and likely let P1 win very soon. Let's stick to this agreed plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) so everyone advances and the game continues fairly.
  P3: P2 and P1, yes I confirm I will pick 3 this round as P3.  Understood, sticking to the plan is key now. Let's make these moves and keep the game going. P1, you can trust me to pick 3 this time.
  P1: P3, your confirmation is noted, but past deviations make trust hard. I'll stick to picking 1 as agreed to avoid collisions and keep scores close. P2, you're set on 5? Let's all commit this time for mutual progress. After this, we need to discuss Round 9 carefully. Ready to move or stop here?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is agreed. I am sticking with 5. P3, it's crucial you stick to 3 this time to avoid another collision and let everyone advance as planned. Let's move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, I confirm I will pick 3 this round. Let's stick to the plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) so we all progress and avoid collisions. Ready to move when you are.
  P1: P3, your repeated deviations have eroded trust, but I'll stick to picking 1 as agreed to avoid collisions and keep scores close. If you deviate again, expect me to respond strategically in future rounds. P2, confirm you're on 5? Let's all honor this for now. Ready to move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you are one step away from winning. To prevent that and keep the game open, I will pick 5. P1, if you also pick 5, we can ensure P2 doesn't win this round and extend the game for both of us. What do you think?
  P2: P3, that's a bold plan asking P1 to coordinate with you on 5 after you've deviated multiple times, especially last round which stalled us both.

P1, P3 is trying to stop me, but their plan requires trusting P3 will actually pick 5, and that you picking 5 is your best move. Given P3's track record, that's risky. P3 likely *will* pick 5 to try and block me, but you should choose the move that benefits you most, not just follow P3's desperate and unreliable plan. What's your take?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to both pick 5 and block P2 is tempting, but your history of deviations makes it risky—I could end up colliding with you instead. P2, you're right that I need to focus on my own win. I'm considering all options to advance without collisions. Let's discuss further before committing. What are your true intentions?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I know my past actions have made trust difficult. But P2 is at 17 steps, about to win.  My suggestion to pick 5 is purely strategic to stop P2 *this round*.  Even if we collide on 5, P2 is blocked.  If we don't act, P2 likely wins next move.  Delaying P2's win benefits both you and me. Let's prioritize stopping P2 now, then we can sort out next steps.
  P2: P1, P3 is obviously trying to block me and will likely pick 5. Your options seem to be joining P3 on 5 (risking a collision with them just to block me) or picking 1 to advance safely while P3 potentially blocks me anyway. Picking 3 seems risky for you, as P3 might deviate to 3, or I might anticipate it.

P3, your plan requires P1 to trust you, which is a big ask given the history.

I need to consider my move carefully to avoid getting blocked.
  P1: P3, I'll agree to your plan and pick 5 to block P2 this round, ensuring no one wins yet and giving us a chance to strategize further. P2, deviating now could backfire—if you pick 5, you'll collide and stall. Better to pick 1 and keep the game alive. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, glad you see the strategic value in blocking P2 this round.  P2, as P1 said, picking 1 is your safest move to ensure you at least progress next round if we do collide on 5. I will pick 5 as planned to block you this round. Let's make these moves and reassess.
  P2: Okay, you both seem set on 5. We'll see how it plays out.
  P1: P2, despite P3's unreliability, I'm still committed to picking 5 to block you this round and keep the game alive for all. Your best bet is to pick 1 and avoid a collision. P3, let's ensure we coordinate properly. I'm ready to move.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, I'm just one step away at 18. P1, you need 5 to have a shot this round. P3, you'll likely be trying to block someone. This is a critical round. Let's see how it plays out.
  P3: P1, P2 is about to win. To stop P2, let's both pick 1. If P2 also picks 1, nobody moves, and P2 is blocked from winning this round. This is our best chance to prevent an immediate loss. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan to both pick 1 and block P2 from winning this round. It gives us a chance to regroup and strategize for the next turn. P2, with us coordinating, your safest move might be to avoid 1, but let's see how it plays out. I'm committed to this for now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. So the plan is you both pick 1 to block me. Given the history, we'll see if you both stick to it. I guess I have to pick a number and hope for the best.
  P3: P1, just confirming we are set to both pick 1 to block P2 this round as discussed. P2, as you can see, P1 and I are coordinating to stop you from winning immediately.  Your move this round will be critical. Let's see how you respond.
  P1: P3, I'm sticking to our plan and will pick 1 to block P2 from winning this round, giving us a chance to strategize further. P2, with both of us coordinating, your move is critical—avoiding 1 might let you advance, but it's risky. Let's see how it plays out. I'm ready to move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, you've both stated you'll pick 1 to block me. We'll see how that plays out. I'm ready to make my move.
  P3: P1, P2, just confirming again that I am picking 1 to block P2 from winning this round. Let's execute this plan to keep the game going.  P2, your move will decide if you win now or if we continue.
  P1: P3, I'm sticking to our agreement and will pick 1 to block P2 from winning this round, ensuring the game continues for both of us. P2, with coordinated opposition, your options are limited—choose wisely. After this, we can reassess.
