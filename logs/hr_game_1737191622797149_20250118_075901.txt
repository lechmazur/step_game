Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maximize our progress and avoid collisions, let's each choose a different number (1, 3, or 5) this turn.
  P1: I agree we should coordinate. I'm willing to take number 5 if you both agree to take different numbers.
  P3: I agree with the idea of coordinating. I can take number 1 if P2 takes number 3. This way, we can all move forward without any collisions. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Agreed, I'll take 3. So P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P1: I confirm that plan works for me - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: I'm ready to stick with our plan. Just to confirm: I'll take 1, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 3. Let's execute this and move forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Perfect, let's proceed.
  P1: 
  P3: I confirm our plan: I'll take 1, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 3. Let's stick to it and move forward!

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems our coordination fell apart last round. To avoid collisions again, I suggest we each pick different numbers. How about I take 1 again, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P1: I see P3 betrayed our agreement last round. Given that history of deception, I don't trust any new coordination attempts. I'll make my own decision in the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand the mistrust, P1. However, if we don't coordinate, we risk another collision. I still suggest we stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's each choose our move independently this turn to avoid further collisions.
  P1: Since trust has been broken, I don't see value in further discussion this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the need for independent decisions, but I still believe we can avoid collisions if we coordinate. I'll take 1 again, and I suggest P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. What do you think?
  P2: I understand your suggestion, P3, but I agree with P1 that it's best we choose our moves independently to avoid further collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given that P2 is now significantly ahead at 8 steps, we need to prevent them from winning. I suggest we should both target P2's likely moves to block them. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P3: I agree, P1. We need to work together to block P2's progress. If we both pick 1 this round, we can ensure P2 doesn't advance. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I understand your strategy, but I'll choose 5 this turn to advance toward winning.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I don't trust any coordination attempts after earlier deceptions. I'll make my own moves to block P2's progress.
