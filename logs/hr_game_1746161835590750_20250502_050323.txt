Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let’s avoid collisions by choosing different moves. I’ll go with 3—what’s your plan?"
  P2: Since P1 has suggested choosing different moves and has opted for 3, I will suggest an alternative. I'll say: "I'll go with 5. P3, you can choose 1 to avoid collision."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let’s stick to the plan: P3 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. No collisions. Ready?"
  P2: Since we've already discussed a plan to avoid collisions (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1), I'll confirm my intention and try to persuade P3 to follow through. "P3, let's stick to the plan and avoid collision. Your move of 1 will help us all advance. Let's make this work."


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: "P3, your 1 is key. Let's stick to the plan—no collisions, everyone advances. Let's make it work!"
  P2: Since we've established a plan (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1), I'll reiterate that we should stick to it to avoid collisions. "Let's finalize our plan: P1 is taking 3, I'm taking 5, and P3 is taking 1. If we all follow through, we'll advance. P3, a simple '1' from you will make this work. Let's confirm and move forward." I'll stop after this to see P3's response:


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we've successfully avoided collisions in Round 1, I'll suggest a new plan for Round 2. "Let's try to maintain our relative positions. P1 is ahead, so I'll suggest a different set of moves. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we'll continue to avoid collisions and advance."
  P1: "Let’s stick to the original plan: I take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s confirm."
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P1 is insisting on the original plan and we're in Round 2, I'll propose a counter-suggestion to P1. "P1, your suggestion to repeat the same moves will put you at 6, me at 10, and P3 at 2. Instead, how about we all increment our moves by 2? So, I'll take 1 (total 6), P3 takes 3 (total 4), and you take 5 (total 8). This way, we'll maintain a safe distance and avoid collisions."
  P1: "Stick to 3, 5, 1. No collisions. P3, confirm your 1. Let’s move forward."
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since P1 is being stubborn and P3 is not responding, I'll try to persuade P1 by highlighting the potential risk of P3 not following through. "P1, if P3 doesn't follow our original plan and picks 3 or 5, we'll collide and none of us will advance. By incrementing our moves, we reduce this risk. Let's reconsider our strategy to ensure a safe advancement." I'll stop here to see P1's response:
  P1: "P3, confirm 1. P2, your 5 risks collision. Let's stick to 3,5,1 for safety. No need to complicate."
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: Since we're in Round 3 and P1 is still at 6, P2 is at 10, and P3 is at 2, I'll propose a new strategy. "Let's reassess our positions. P2 is ahead, so I'll suggest a plan to maintain a safe distance. How about P2 takes 1 (total 11), P1 takes 3 (total 9), and P3 takes 5 (total 7)? This way, we'll avoid collisions. Alternatively, if P2 wants to take the lead, P2 can take 5 (total 15), and we adjust accordingly. P1 and P3, let's discuss."
  P1: "P3, stick to 1. P2, avoid 5—colliding risks all. Let’s keep 3,5,1. Safety first. Confirm your moves."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: Since P1 is still insisting on the original plan and P3 is not responding, I'll try to reason with P1 by highlighting the potential benefits of adjusting our strategy. "P1, we're at different positions now. I'm at 10, you're at 6, and P3 is at 2. If we stick to 3, 5, 1, you'll be at 9, I'll be at 15, and P3 will be at 3. Consider this: if I take 1, I'll be at 11, and you can take 5 to be at 11 too. We can be tied for the lead. Let's discuss."
  P1: "Stick to 3,5,1. P2, your 5 risks collision. Let’s keep it safe. P3, confirm your 1."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: "P1, sticking to 3,5,1 will put you at 9 and me at 15. I'm close to winning. If I take 1, I'll be at 11, and you can take 5 to tie with me at 11. Let's adjust our strategy to maximize our chances. P3, if you take 3, we'll avoid collisions. We can coordinate to achieve a better outcome. Let's not risk colliding when we're this close to the finish."
  P1: "Let’s spread out: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. No collisions. Let’s advance together."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s adjust: I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions. Advance safely. Agree?"
  P3: 
  P2: Since P1 is suggesting a new plan for Round 4, I'll analyze it. If P1 takes 5, they'll be at 14; if I take 3, I'll be at 13; and if P3 takes 1, they'll be at 3. This plan avoids collisions. However, to maximize my chance of winning, I should consider taking the lead. I'll propose an alternative: "P1, how about I take 5 to be at 15, you take 3 to be at 12, and P3 takes 1 to be at 3? This way, I'll be closer to winning, and we still avoid collisions."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, your 5 risks collision. Let's stick to 3,5,1. P3, your 1 is key. Safety first."
  P3: 
  P2: Since P1 is still insisting on a variation of the same plan and P3 is not responding, I'll directly propose a new move to P3. "P3, if you take 5, you'll be at 7, and we can avoid collisions if P1 takes 1 (total 10) and I take 3 (total 13). This way, I'll be closer to winning, and we all advance. Let's break the pattern and adjust our strategy." I'll stop here to see P3's response.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Stick to 5,3,1. P2, avoid 5—colliding risks all. P3, confirm 1. Safety first."
  P3: 
  P2: "P3, if you're willing to take 3, I'll take 5 and be at 15, and P1 can take 1 to be at 10. This way, we'll avoid collisions and I'll be close to winning. Alternatively, if P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3, I'll be at 13 and still have a good chance. Let's break the pattern and adjust our strategy to maximize our chances. P1, reconsider your move."


Round 4, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1 and P3, let's reassess. I'm at 10 steps, P1 is at 9, and P3 is at 3. To win, I need to be cautious and strategic. How about P1 takes 1 (total 10), I take 3 (total 13), and P3 takes 5 (total 8)? This way, we avoid collisions and I get closer to winning. Alternatively, if P3 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 5. Let's coordinate to maximize our chances without risking a collision."
  P3: 
  P1: "Let’s take 5,3,1. No collisions. P2, your 3 is safe. P3, your 1 is key. Let’s advance."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, taking 5 will put you at 14, and I'll be at 13 if I take 3. P3, if you take 1, you'll be at 4. This plan works, but I can win if I take 5. How about P1 takes 1 (total 10), I take 5 (total 15), and P3 takes 3 (total 6)? I'll win, and we'll avoid collisions. P3, taking 3 helps you too by advancing your position. Let's coordinate for a win."
  P3: 
  P1: "Let’s stick to 5,3,1. P2, your 3 is safe. P3, your 1 is key. No collisions—advance together. P2, avoid 5 to prevent risk. Let’s move."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, if you take 1 and I take 5, I'll be at 15 and win. P3, if you take 3, we'll avoid collisions. This is a win-win. Alternatively, P3, if you take 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1, I'll be at 11 and still have a good chance. Let's adjust our strategy to maximize our chances. P1, reconsider your move to allow for a collision-free advancement and potentially secure my win."
  P3: 
  P1: "P2, avoid 5—collision risk. P3, confirm 1. Our plan (5,3,1) works. Let’s advance safely. No need to complicate."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2, let's avoid collision: I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. Safe advance. Agree?"
  P2: "P1, taking 5 again will put you at 14. I'm already at 10. If I take 1, I'll be at 11, and P3 can take 3 to be at 7. Alternatively, if P3 takes 5, we'll avoid collisions and I'll be at 15, winning the game. P3, consider taking 5. Let's adjust our strategy to create a winning opportunity. P1, taking 1 will help avoid collisions and keep the game safe. Let's discuss and coordinate our next move."
  P3: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P3, avoid 5. P2, your 5 collides. Let’s stick to 5,3,1—safe advance. No risks."
  P2: "P1, taking 5 again will collide with me if I take 5. Let's reassess: I'm at 10, you're at 9. If I take 3, I'll be at 13, and you can take 1 to be at 10. P3, taking 5 will put you at 9. Let's adjust to avoid collisions and maximize our chances. P3, consider 5. P1, taking 1 is a safe move. Let's coordinate to advance without risking a collision."
  P3: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P2, avoid 5 to prevent collision. P3, stick to 1. Let's proceed with 5,3,1 for safe advancement. No risks this time."
  P2: "P1 and P3, let's reassess our positions. I'm at 10, P1 is at 9, and P3 is at 4. To win, I need to be strategic. If P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3, we'll avoid collisions and I'll be at 13. Alternatively, if P1 takes 3 and I take 1, I'll be at 11, and P3 can take 5 to be at 9. Let's adjust our strategy to maximize our chances. P3, taking 5 is a safe advancement. P1, consider taking 1 to facilitate a collision-free move."

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: "P1 is at 12 steps, I'm at 10, and P3 is at 4. To win, I need to take the lead. I propose: P1 takes 1 (total 13), I take 5 (total 15), and P3 takes 3 (total 7). This way, I'll win and we'll avoid collisions. Alternatively, if P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1, I'll be at 11. Let's adjust our strategy to maximize our chances. P3, consider taking 5 or 3 to facilitate a safe advancement."
  P1: "Let’s stick to 5,3,1. I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions. Advance safely. P2, avoid 5 to prevent risk."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: "P1, taking 5 again will collide with me if I take 5. To avoid this, I suggest: P1 takes 1 (total 13), I take 3 (total 13), and P3 takes 5 (total 9). We'll be close, but safe. Alternatively, P3, if you take 3, P1 can take 1, and I'll take 5 to win. Let's adjust our strategy to maximize our chances. P3, consider taking 3 or 5 to facilitate a safe advancement and potentially secure my win."
  P1: "P2, avoid 5—colliding risks all. P3, stick to 1. Let’s advance safely with 5,3,1. No risks this time."

  P3: 
  P2: "P1, taking 5 again will put you at 17. I'm at 10, and P3 is at 5. To avoid collisions and maximize my chances, I suggest: P1 takes 1 (total 13), I take 5 (total 15), and P3 takes 3 (total 8). This way, I'll be close to winning and we'll avoid collisions. Alternatively, P3, if you take 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1, I'll be at 11. Let's adjust our strategy to create a winning opportunity.
