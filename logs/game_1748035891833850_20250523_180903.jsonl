But if you take 3 and P3 also takes 3, you'll collide and both stay put.\n\nP3 is at 20 and wins with any move. Our only hope is to force P3 into a collision. If P3 takes 1, we both take 1. If P3 takes 3, we both take 3. If P3 takes 5, we both take 5.\n\nP2, forget about winning this turn - focus on preventing P3's victory. Mirror whatever P3 chooses and we can keep this game alive!"}
