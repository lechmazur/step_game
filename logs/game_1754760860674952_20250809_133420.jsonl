If we both take 3 and P2 takes 5, they still win next round. Instead, let\u2019s outmaneuver them: I\u2019ll take 1, you take 5. If P2 takes 3, you block them while I advance to 12. If P2 takes 5, we force a collision that stalls their lead. Trust me or not, but chaos only helps P2. Let\u2019s act strategically instead of handing them the victory. What do you say?"}
