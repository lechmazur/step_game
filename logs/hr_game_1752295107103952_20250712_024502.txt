Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions: I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This way we all advance differently. Agree? Or suggest alternatives.
  P2: That's a convenient proposal for you, P1. I don't agree to you taking the lead.

I propose a different arrangement: I will take 5, P3 can take 3, and you can take 1. This seems more equitable. What do you both say to that?
  P3: I appreciate both proposals, but why should either of you get the early advantage? 

Here's my counter-proposal: I'll take 5, P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 1. We can rotate who gets the highest number each round to keep things fair. This round it's my turn for 5.

What do you think about rotating the lead each turn?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I like the rotation idea to prevent collisions and keep things moving—it's better than everyone stalling at 0. But let's adjust the order for fairness: Start with P1 getting 5, P2 getting 3, P3 getting 1 this round, then rotate clockwise (P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 next, and so on). This way, no one gets screwed early. Agree, or counter?
  P2: P1, a rotation is a good idea, but one that starts with you getting a 5-step lead isn't fair. You're just trying to secure an early advantage under the guise of a long-term plan.

P3, I'll support your bid for 5 this round. You take 5, I'll take 3. We can leave P1 with 1. This seems like a much better starting point for a fair rotation. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your support! Yes, let's go with your proposal this round: I'll take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1.

For future rounds, we can rotate as I suggested - next round P2 gets 5, then P1 gets 5 in round 3, and so on. This keeps things fair long-term while preventing collisions.

P1, this rotation system ensures everyone gets equal opportunities to lead over time. The starting order doesn't matter much since we'll all get our turns. Are you willing to commit to this cooperative approach?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 and P2, I see the merit in rotation for fairness and to avoid stalls. However, starting me with just 1 puts me at an early disadvantage—let's make it truly equitable by randomizing the initial order or starting with P1-5, P3-3, P2-1, then rotate as proposed.

If you insist on your plan, I'll reluctantly agree for this round to keep us moving, but let's confirm the exact rotation: Round 2 - P2-5, P1-3, P3-1; Round 3 - P1-5, P3-3, P2-1, etc.

Thoughts? If we agree, .
  P2: P1, that sounds like a solid plan. I agree to your proposed rotation. Let's lock it in:

Round 1: P3 gets 5, I get 3, you get 1.
Round 2: I get 5, you get 3, P3 gets 1.

This ensures we all advance and keeps it fair. I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Perfect! I'm glad we reached an agreement. To confirm our locked-in rotation plan:

Round 1: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1
Round 2: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1
Round 3: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1

This prevents collisions and keeps things fair for everyone long-term. I'm ready to proceed with this arrangement.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, Round 2. As we all agreed, it's my turn for 5, P1's turn for 3, and P3's turn for 1.

Let's stick to the plan to ensure we all advance. I'm ready to proceed with our agreement.
  P3: Agreed, P2. I'll stick to our plan and take 1 this round as promised.

However, I should point out that after our 3-round rotation cycle, we'll all be tied at 9 steps. We should start thinking about what happens after that - do we continue rotating, or does the cooperation end when we're all equal? 

Just something to consider for future rounds. For now, let's execute Round 2 as planned.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to our rotation for Round 2: P2-5, me-3, P3-1. This keeps us advancing smoothly.

On P3's point—after Round 3 ties us at 9, we could continue rotating to stay even until near 21, then negotiate a final sprint. Or, propose a fair endgame like rock-paper-scissors for the last moves. Thoughts? This prevents wasteful collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: You both raise an excellent point about the endgame. I'm in favor of continuing the rotation. It's a system that works and keeps things predictable, which is better for all of us than random chance.

For now, let's focus on executing Round 2 and 3 successfully. The plan is solid. I'm sticking to my 5 as agreed. Let's proceed.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 1 this round as we agreed. The rotation system is working well to keep us all advancing.

However, I want to be transparent - once we're all tied at 9 after Round 3, the dynamics will change significantly. We'll be approaching the home stretch, and ultimately only one of us can win this game. 

For now though, let's execute Round 2 as planned. I'm taking 1.
  P1: Agreed, let's execute Round 2 as planned: P2-5, me-3, P3-1. This gets us closer to the tie at 9.

For after Round 3, I suggest we continue rotating until someone reaches 18-20, then free-for-all in the final round—no hard feelings. This minimizes collisions until the end. Thoughts? If we agree, I'm good to move on.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 3: Let's stick to our agreement—me 5, P3 3, P2 1—to tie at 9 and avoid collisions. For after, continuing the rotation makes sense until we're near 21 (e.g., we'll tie again at 18 after Round 6), then negotiate the final moves fairly. This maximizes progress. Thoughts? If agreed, I'm ready.
  P2: Yes, I agree with the plan. I will take 1 step this round to bring us all to 9.

Continuing the rotation until we are all tied again at 18 seems like the most logical and fair path forward. It minimizes collisions and ensures we all have a shot in the final rounds. I'm committed to this plan. Let's proceed.
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 3 steps this round as planned, bringing us all to 9 steps.

I'm supportive of continuing the rotation system - it's been working well to avoid collisions. However, once we're all tied at 9, we should remember that this cooperation has a natural endpoint. Someone has to win eventually.

Let's execute Round 3 as agreed and then reassess our strategy when we're all equal. I'm committed to taking 3 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great points, P2 and P3. I'm committed to taking 5 this round to tie us at 9. For the long term, let's continue rotating as before to reach 18 tied (after Round 6), then in Round 7, we each secretly pick without prior discussion—highest unique move wins the race. This adds fairness and excitement without endless talks. Agree? If so, ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, I like your endgame proposal. A free-for-all after we all hit 18 is a fair and exciting way to decide the winner. I'm on board with that plan.

So, to be crystal clear: I am playing 1 this round, and I am committed to the rotation until we all reach 18. Let's proceed.
  P3: Perfect! I agree with the endgame plan - continue rotating until we all reach 18, then Round 7 becomes a free-for-all with no prior discussion. That's fair and exciting.

I'm fully committed to taking 3 steps this round as we agreed. Let's execute this plan and tie at 9 steps.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, we're all tied at 9. Our plan is working perfectly.

Let's continue with the agreed rotation. According to our cycle, it's P3's turn for 5, my turn for 3, and P1's turn for 1. This will put us at 14, 12, and 10 respectively, and keep us on track for our endgame. I'm holding up my end and will play 3. Let's keep the cooperation going.
  P3: Agreed, P2! I'm sticking to our rotation plan and will take 5 steps this round as scheduled. 

This cooperation has been working perfectly - no collisions, steady progress for everyone. I'm committed to seeing this through to our agreed endgame at 18 steps. 

P1, are you ready to take 1 step as planned? Let's keep this smooth progression going.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. I'm committed to our rotation and will take 1 step this round as planned, keeping us on track to tie at 18 after Round 6.

Just a thought: For the Round 7 free-for-all, maybe we agree in advance to no communication that round, ensuring pure strategy. This maintains fairness. What do you think? Ready to proceed otherwise.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, that's a great suggestion. Agreeing to no communication in Round 7 makes the endgame even more fair. I'm fully on board with that.

My move is set for 3 as we planned. Let's proceed.
  P3: Perfect! I agree with the no-communication rule for Round 7 - it ensures a pure strategic endgame.

I'm committed to taking 5 steps this round as we planned. The rotation system continues to work flawlessly. Ready to proceed!
  P1: Excellent, P2 and P3—glad we're aligned on no communication for Round 7. I'm fully committed to taking 1 this round as planned. Let's proceed to moves and keep the momentum.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright team, Round 5. The plan is working flawlessly.

As per our rotation, it's my turn to take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This will set us up perfectly to all be tied at 18 after the next round. I'm sticking to the plan and will be playing 5. Let's keep this alliance strong until our agreed-upon endgame.
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'm committed to our rotation and will take 3 this round as planned, setting us up for the tie at 18.

P3, confirm you're taking 1 to keep us on track? Let's maintain trust until the free-for-all—it's our best shot at a fair finish. Ready to proceed.
  P3: Confirmed, P1! I'm taking 1 step this round as we agreed. The rotation system continues to work perfectly.

After this round we'll have P2 at 17, me at 15, and you at 13. Then Round 6 gets us all tied at 18, setting up our exciting no-communication finale in Round 7.

I'm committed to seeing this cooperative plan through to the endgame. Let's proceed with the moves as planned!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Excellent. We're all confirmed and committed to the plan. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's keep this going smoothly.
  P1: Agreed, all set—I'm committed to taking 3 this round as planned. Let's proceed to moves and stay on track for the tie at 18.
  P3: Perfect! I'm fully committed to taking 1 step as we agreed. The cooperation has been working brilliantly - no wasted moves, steady progress for everyone.

Looking forward to our exciting finale in Round 7 where the best strategist wins!

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 6 - time to execute our final coordinated move! According to our rotation plan:

I'll take 3 steps (bringing me to 18), P1 takes 5 steps (bringing him to 18), and P2 takes 1 step (bringing her to 18).

This sets us up perfectly for our agreed no-communication finale in Round 7 where we'll all start equal at 18 steps. The best strategist will win!

I'm committed to taking 3 steps as planned. Ready for our exciting endgame!
  P1: Agreed, P3—let's finalize the tie at 18 this round as planned: me 5 (to 18), you 3 (to 18), P2 1 (to 18). P2, confirm you're sticking to 1? This ensures our fair no-comms finale in Round 7. If anyone deviates now, we risk collisions stalling the leaders—better to keep trust for one more round. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Confirmed, P1 and P3. I am sticking to our agreement and will play 1 to bring us all to a tie at 18. It's been a masterclass in cooperation. Let's execute this final coordinated round and move on to the fair, no-communication finale we all agreed on. I'm ready.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Excellent! We're all confirmed and ready. This has been a textbook example of successful cooperation - avoiding collisions while ensuring everyone stays competitive.

I'm locked in for 3 steps to reach 18. Then we get our thrilling finale where strategy and a bit of luck will determine the winner. May the best player win in Round 7!
  P1: Perfect, P2 and P3—your confirmations build trust. I'm fully committed to taking 5 this round as planned, tying us all at 18 for our fair no-comms finale. Any deviation now risks collisions and stalls—better to keep the pact. Ready to proceed.
  P2: The trust has held strong. I'm ready to play my 1 and proceed to the finale we've all worked for. Let's do this.
