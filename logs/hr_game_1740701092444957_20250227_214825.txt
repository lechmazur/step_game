Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone! Since we're all starting at zero, let's coordinate so we don't collide. I'm planning to choose 3 this round. How about you two?
  P3: P1, I appreciate you sharing your plan. However, if we all reveal our choices and follow through, it could lead to collisions. P2, what are your thoughts? Should we stagger our choices or take a different approach?
  P2: P1, your suggestion of 3 sounds risky. P3, I agree that full transparency could backfire. How about this: I *won't* say my exact number, but I will say I'm leaning towards an odd number. That gives us *some* information without revealing everything. What do you both think of that general approach for this first round?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your idea of partial transparency sounds reasonable for now. I'll also confirm I'm sticking to an odd number. Let's see if we can avoid collisions this way. P3, what do you think?
  P3: I see the value in partial transparency, but there's still a risk if we all lean toward odd numbers. If two of us pick the same odd number, we both lose progress. I’ll also choose an odd number, but I suggest we aim for different ones. Maybe one of us takes 1, another 3, and the last 5? That way, at least two of us move forward. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate P3's suggestion, but it still feels too structured. To truly minimize collisions, I think a bit more randomness is needed, even with odd numbers. I'm not going to commit to 1, 3, or 5 specifically. I'll just reiterate that I'm picking an odd number, and I suggest you both do something truly random within the odd options.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your preference for randomness, but complete randomness might actually increase collision risk. I'll pick my number carefully to minimize overlap. Good luck!
  P3: I see both sides—structured coordination vs. randomness. Since we all agree on odd numbers, the main risk is two of us picking the same one. I’ll make my choice strategically, but I won’t reveal it outright. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. Since we've all confirmed we're going with odd numbers, I'm going to stick with my plan. I've made my decision and I'm not changing it. I suggest you both do the same and we just get this first round over with.

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was unfortunate—looks like we all had the same idea! Clearly, total randomness isn't ideal. How about we try a simple rotation this time to avoid another collision? I'll commit to choosing a different number from last round. What do you two think?
  P2: P1, a rotation sounds better than last time, but it's still predictable. How about this: I'll commit to NOT choosing 5 this round. That leaves 1 and 3 as options for me. P3, what are you thinking to avoid another three-way collision?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your commitment to avoiding 5. That helps narrow things down. P1, since you suggested rotation, does that mean you're avoiding 5 as well? If so, we might be able to coordinate better. I’ll also commit to NOT picking 5 this round. That leaves 1 and 3 as options for all of us. If we each pick differently, at least two of us move forward. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, yes, I'll confirm clearly: I'm NOT choosing 5 this round either. That leaves just 1 or 3 for me as well. If each of us picks carefully between these two numbers, we have a good chance at progress. Let's choose wisely.
  P2: P1 and P3, since we've all ruled out 5, the only risk is two of us picking the same number between 1 and 3. I'm going to pick one of those two. I suggest we don't overthink it further. I've made my choice.
  P3: P1 and P2, since we've all ruled out 5, the key now is avoiding another collision between 1 and 3. If we each pick differently, at least two of us advance. I’ll make my choice carefully, but I won’t reveal it outright. If either of you wants to suggest a way to further reduce collision risk, now’s the time. Otherwise, I say we trust our instincts and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we've narrowed it down, I'll trust you both to choose carefully between 1 and 3. I've made my choice strategically to avoid another collision. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, I've made my decision and I'm not changing it. I suggest you both do the same. Let's just get this round over with.
  P3: P1 and P2, since we've all ruled out 5 and are choosing between 1 and 3, the only risk is if two of us pick the same number. To minimize that, I suggest we each silently commit and trust that at least two of us will pick differently. If anyone has a last-minute way to reduce collision risk, now’s the time—otherwise, let's finalize our choices and move forward. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, congrats on moving ahead! P3, we collided again. This time, I propose a slightly different approach. I will commit to *not* choosing 3 this round. This leaves 1 and 5 as my options. P1, you're already ahead, so maybe you can help us out by picking something different from both of us. P3, what do you think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your commitment to avoiding 3. That helps narrow things down. Since I also collided last round, I want to avoid that again. I will *not* pick 3 this round either. That leaves 1 and 5 as my options. P1, since you're ahead, what are your thoughts? If we can ensure all three of us pick differently, at least two of us will advance. Let’s try to avoid another wasted round.
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for clarifying your intentions. To help avoid collisions, I'll commit to NOT picking 1 this round. That leaves 3 and 5 as my options. With your choices narrowed to 1 and 5, and mine to 3 and 5, we have a better chance of avoiding overlap. Let's pick strategically.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, thanks for avoiding 1. Since you're choosing between 3 and 5, and P3 and I are choosing between 1 and 5, I have a suggestion. I will pick 1, guaranteeing I don't collide with you. P3, can you commit to 5? This way, we avoid all collisions.
  P3: P2, your plan makes sense. If you pick 1 and I pick 5, that prevents a collision between us. P1, since you're choosing between 3 and 5, I just need to know if you're okay with this setup. If you pick 3, all three of us will move forward. If you pick 5, we collide. Can you confirm your choice so we don’t waste another round?
  P1: P3, your logic is sound. I'm comfortable with this setup and will choose accordingly to ensure we all advance this round. Let's lock it in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 and P1, I'm committing to 1. P3, you said you'd commit to 5 if I committed to 1. P1, you said you'd choose accordingly, and the only choice that works for everyone is 3. So, let's finalize this.
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we've reached a clear agreement. P2 picks 1, I pick 5, and P1 picks 3. That way, all three of us move forward without collisions. I’m locking in my choice. Let’s follow through and finally make some progress. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, we've got a solid plan. Let's stick to it and finally make some solid progress. Locking in my choice as discussed. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round worked perfectly! However, now that we all have different scores, a simple rotation won't work. I'm open to suggestions, but I'm leaning towards picking either 1 or 3 this round. I'll definitely avoid 5 to maximize my chances of moving. What are your initial thoughts?
  P3: P2, thanks for sharing your plan. Since you're avoiding 5, that leaves 1 or 3 for you. P1, you're at 4 steps—what are you thinking? I want to avoid collisions, so I’m open to coordinating. I might avoid 5 as well to keep things balanced, but I’d like to hear your thoughts before committing. If we can each pick differently again, we all move forward. Let’s figure this out.
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for sharing your thoughts. To minimize collisions again, I'll commit clearly to NOT choosing 3 this round. That leaves 1 or 5 for me. With P2 avoiding 5 (choosing between 1 and 3), and P3 considering avoiding 5 as well, we should easily coordinate to ensure progress. Let's hear your final thoughts.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, thanks for avoiding 3. Since you're picking between 1 and 5, and I'm leaning towards 1 or 3, there's a risk of us colliding if we both pick 1. P3, if you're still considering avoiding 5, that means you're also choosing between 1 and 3. To avoid a collision, I suggest I pick 3, guaranteeing I don't collide with you, P1. P3, what do you think?
  P3: P2, your plan makes sense—you picking 3 avoids a collision with P1. If I also pick 3, we collide, so I need to decide between 1 and 5. P1, since you're choosing between 1 and 5 as well, we need to make sure we don't pick the same number. If you commit to one, I’ll take the other. What do you prefer?
  P1: P3, that's a fair suggestion. I'll commit clearly to choosing 5 this round, leaving 1 for you. P2 picks 3, I pick 5, and you pick 1. This ensures no collisions and progress for everyone. Let's lock it in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 and P1, I'm committing to 3. P1, you've committed to 5. P3, you're taking 1. Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we have a solid plan again—P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and continue progressing. I'm locking in my choice of 1. Let's follow through and keep the momentum going. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, we've got a clear agreement. I'll stick with my committed choice of 5. Let's lock it in and keep making progress. Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've successfully coordinated the past two rounds, and that's benefited everyone. I'm open to continuing this approach. I'll start by committing clearly to NOT choosing 5 this round. That leaves 1 or 3 for me. Let me know your thoughts for avoiding collisions.
  P2: P1, thanks for avoiding 5. Since you're choosing between 1 and 3, and I'm behind, I need to maximize my chances. I'm going to avoid 1 this round, leaving 3 and 5 as my options. P3, what are your thoughts? We need to avoid a collision, especially since you and I are closer in score.
  P3: P2, since you're avoiding 1, that leaves you with 3 or 5. P1, you're choosing between 1 and 3. To avoid collisions, I’ll commit to NOT picking 3 this round. That leaves 1 or 5 for me. If P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1, we all move forward. Does that work for both of you?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion works perfectly for me. I'll commit clearly to choosing 3 this round. P2, if you pick 5 and P3 picks 1, we all advance again without collisions. Let's lock this in.
  P2: P2 and P1, I'm locking in my choice of 1. P1, you've committed to 3. P2, you need to pick 5 to avoid collisions. Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P3: P2, I think you meant to say you're locking in 5, not 1, based on our plan. Can you confirm? If so, then we’re all set: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and you pick 5. That way, we all move forward without collisions. Let’s finalize this and stick to our choices.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, please confirm clearly that you're choosing 5 this round to match our agreed plan (P1: 3, P3: 1, P2: 5). Let's avoid confusion and keep our momentum going.
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm confirming that I will choose 5 this round. P3, you're choosing 1, and P1, you're choosing 3. Let's finalize this.
  P3: P2, thanks for confirming your choice of 5. P1, you’re locked in for 3, and I’m locked in for 1. That means we’ve successfully coordinated again with no collisions. Unless anyone has last-minute concerns, I say we finalize our choices and move forward. Let’s keep this momentum going!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've done well coordinating. I'm going to commit to NOT choosing 3 this round, leaving 1 and 5 as my options. P1, you're closest to winning. What are you thinking to avoid collisions?
  P3: P2, thanks for committing to avoiding 3. That leaves you with 1 or 5. P1, since you’re ahead, how do you want to approach this round? I’ll wait for your input before committing, but I’m open to avoiding a number if it helps us prevent collisions again. Let’s make sure at least two of us move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the coordination so far. I'll commit clearly to NOT choosing 5 this round, leaving me with either 1 or 3. Given P2 is avoiding 3, this reduces collision risk between us. P3, this should help you decide your choice strategically. Let's keep the momentum going!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, thanks for avoiding 5. Since you're choosing between 1 and 3, and I'm choosing between 1 and 5, there's a risk if we both pick 1. P3, to avoid collisions, I suggest I pick 5. This guarantees I don't collide with you, P1. P3, what do you think? If you pick something different from both of us, we should be good.
  P3: P2, your plan makes sense—you picking 5 avoids a collision with P1. Since P1 is choosing between 1 and 3, I need to decide carefully. If I pick 3, I risk colliding with P1. If I pick 1, I avoid both of you. P1, would you be willing to commit to 3 so I can safely pick 1? That way, P2 picks 5, I pick 1, and you pick 3—ensuring no collisions. Let me know if that works for you.
  P1: P3, your suggestion works well for me. I'll commit clearly to choosing 3 this round. You can safely pick 1, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions again. Let's lock this in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm committing to 5. P1, you've committed to 3. P3, you're taking 1. Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we have a solid plan again—P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and continue progressing. I'm locking in my choice of 1. Let’s follow through and keep the momentum going. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, our plan is clear and solid: I'm locked in for 3, P2 for 5, and P3 for 1. Let's stick to it and keep advancing smoothly. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've coordinated well so far, but now we're nearing the finish line. I'll commit clearly to NOT choosing 1 this round, leaving me with either 3 or 5. Let me know your thoughts so we can avoid collisions again.
  P2: P2 and P3, I've committed to *not* choosing 1, leaving me with 3 or 5. Since P2 is only one step behind me, I want to be careful. P2, what are you thinking? I'm leaning towards 3, but I want to avoid a collision with you, especially.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both close to winning, so I expect you'll be extra cautious. Since you're both avoiding 1, I could take 1 safely if needed. However, if you both pick the same number between 3 and 5, you'll collide, which benefits me. P1, since you're ahead, are you leaning toward 3 or 5? P2, are you trying to match or counter P1’s move? I’ll decide my move based on your responses, but I want to ensure at least I don’t collide unnecessarily. Let’s think this through.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since we're both close, we risk losing our lead if we collide. I'll clearly commit to choosing 3 this round. If you choose 5, we both advance safely. P3, you can safely pick 1. Let's finalize this clearly to avoid any collisions.
  P2: P1, thanks for committing to 3. That helps me. I'll commit to 5, ensuring we don't collide. P3, you can safely pick 1. Let's finalize this.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you've coordinated your choices—P1 picking 3 and P2 picking 5. That means if I pick 1, we all move forward without collisions. However, you're both very close to winning, while I'm behind. If I disrupt this round, I might get a better shot later. Why should I cooperate when it only helps you two? Convince me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, cooperation benefits you too. If you disrupt now, you remain behind while we still stay ahead. By cooperating, you steadily close the gap and keep your chances alive. Let's stick to the plan and all advance.
  P2: P3, while I understand your hesitation, disrupting us now only guarantees you stay significantly behind. If we both reach 20, it's a tie, and you lose outright. If we cooperate, you gain ground. Next round, you could potentially block one of us and gain a significant advantage. Think long-term, not just short-term disruption. I'm sticking with 5. Your best bet is still 1.
</stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your reasoning, but if I cooperate now, I only help you both get closer to 20 while I remain far behind. If I disrupt, I might force a better position for myself in later rounds. P1, if you win next round, I'm out completely. Why should I make that easy for you? P2, you also need to think—if you let P1 get too far ahead, you might lose outright. Maybe it's in your best interest to disrupt as well. What if we shake things up instead?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round P1 and I collided, despite our intentions. I'm going to avoid 3 this round, leaving 1 and 5 as my options. P1, you're very close to winning. What's your plan? P3, you're significantly behind. Are you going to try to disrupt, or are you going to play it safe? I need to know your intentions to make the best decision for myself.
</stop>
  P1: P2, thanks for clearly avoiding 3. I'll commit to NOT choosing 1 this round, leaving me with either 3 or 5. P3, you're currently behind—if you disrupt again, you'll remain far behind while we advance. Cooperating now gives you a chance to catch up. Let's choose strategically to avoid collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both very close to winning, while I'm still behind. If I cooperate, I help one of you win faster. If I disrupt, I might create a better chance for myself. P1, if you reach 20 first, I lose outright, so I have no reason to make it easy for you. P2, you're just behind P1—do you really want to let them win? Maybe we should work together to slow them down instead of just following their lead. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're committing to 3 or 5. Since I'm avoiding 3, I'm left with 1 or 5. If I choose 5, we might collide. P3, you have the most to gain from disruption, but also the most to lose. If you pick 3, you guarantee you don't collide with me. P1, are you *really* going to pick 3 again, given what happened last time? I'm leaning towards 1, hoping you switch to 5. P3, your move is crucial.
  P1: P2, your reasoning is clear, but switching numbers unpredictably now only increases collision risk. I'm committed to choosing carefully between my stated options to avoid another collision. P3, disrupting now would only ensure you stay behind. Cooperating gives you a chance to catch up. Let's be strategic and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both very close to winning, while I'm still significantly behind. If I simply cooperate, I only help one of you win faster. P2, you're just one step behind P1—do you really want to let them win easily? Maybe we should work together to slow them down instead of just following their lead. If P1 collides again, you have a better shot at winning. P1, if you were in my position, would you just help someone else win, or would you try to shift the game in your favor?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you keep saying I should cooperate, but you're not giving me a good reason *why*. You're about to win! P3, you're right, I don't want P1 to win easily. P1, I'm leaning towards 1. If you pick 3 again, we both advance, but you win next turn if you get 5. P3, are you going to help me block P1, or are you just going to let them win? I need to know!
</
  P1: P2, if we collide again, we both risk losing our lead. I'll stick to my committed options to avoid that. P3, disrupting now only ensures you stay behind. Cooperating at least gives you a chance to gain ground. Let's all pick wisely and avoid unnecessary collisions. Good luck!
  P3: P2, you're just one step behind P1—if you let them advance freely, they might win next round. If we both pick 3, we block them while still moving forward ourselves. If you pick 1 and I pick 3, P1 might still win next round. Think carefully—do you want to help P1 win, or do you want to keep your chances alive? P1, I know you want me to cooperate, but you haven’t given me a reason why I should help you win. If you were in my position, would you just let someone else take the victory?
