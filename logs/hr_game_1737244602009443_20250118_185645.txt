Round 2, Conversation subround 1:

Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3.  If you both choose 1, neither of you will advance.  P2, if you really intend to move 5, then P1 should move 1. But if you're bluffing P1, then he should choose 3 and you should choose 1. I'm locking in 3.
