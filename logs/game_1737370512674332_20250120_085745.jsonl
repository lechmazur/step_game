Since P2 and I are tied, how about P2 takes 5 and I take 3? This allows P2 to take the lead, while I stay close. P1 can take 1, maintaining a safe distance. This distribution minimizes collision risk and ensures progress. What do you think, P1 and P2?"}

P3 taking 3 and me taking 5 makes sense given our current positions. P1 taking 1 also seems reasonable to avoid collisions. Let's lock in this plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This should allow me to take the lead."}
