Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions this round. P1, how about you pick 1? P2, how about 3? I'll pick 5.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P3, but I think we should consider the possibility of colliding. If we all pick different numbers, we can advance. I propose I pick 3 this round, P2 can go with 5, and P3 can stick with 1. This way, we can all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I think your proposal is too risky. I'd rather stick with P3's initial suggestion for this round. I'll pick 3. P3, are you still planning on 5, and P1, would you be okay with 1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, thanks for agreeing with my suggestion. P1, I understand your concern about collisions, but if we all stick to different numbers this round (1, 3, and 5), we guarantee progress for everyone. Let's try this for the first round and see how it goes. Would you reconsider picking 1, P1?
  P1: I see the logic in avoiding collisions, but I'm still concerned about making progress. If we pick 1, 3, and 5, we can all advance. However, I don't want to be stuck at 0 steps. I suggest we each stick to our numbers: P3, you could still go with 5, and I'll take 3 as I proposed earlier. P2, if you could go with 1, we can all make strides without colliding. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I'm still leaning towards P3's initial suggestion. Let's try to avoid collisions this round and see how it goes. I'll stick with 3. P3, are you still planning on 5? And P1, would you agree to 1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, both P2 and I are suggesting we take 1, 3, and 5 respectively this round. While I understand your desire for a larger move, a guaranteed small step forward is better than no step at all due to a collision. Let's secure some progress this round.
  P1: I understand your concerns about collisions, but I think we should still aim for our own advantage. If we all agree on 1, 3, and 5, it might lead to a situation where one of us gets left behind. I propose we each stick to our original moves: P3 with 5, myself with 3, and P2 with 1. This way, we can all make progress while still giving ourselves a chance to win. What do you think?
  P2: Okay, P1, I understand your desire to maximize progress, but I'm still concerned about the risk of collisions. I'm sticking with 3 this round. P3, are you still planning on 5? P1, I think it's best if you go with 1 this round to avoid any collisions. Let's just try to move forward this round and see how it goes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I understand the desire to avoid collisions, but we need to think strategically about our moves this round. P2, since you picked 3 last time, how about you pick 1 this round? P3, you could go with 5 again. I'll choose 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you both think? Let's aim for progress!
  P2: P1, I'm still wary of collisions. I'm going to stick with 3 again this round. P3, what are you thinking? Let's try to avoid any collisions this turn.
  P3: P2, you picked 3 last round and are suggesting it again. P1, to avoid another collision, how about you pick 1 this round? I will pick 5. This way, at least two of us can make progress. What do you think, P1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about collisions, but if we all stick to the same number again, we risk not advancing at all. I propose we each choose different moves: P2, you could pick 1, P3 can go with 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we can ensure that at least two of us make progress. What do you think? Let's work together to avoid another collision and move forward!
  P2: P1, I'm still going to stick with 3 this round. P3, are you still planning on 5? Let's try to avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, you're set on 3 again. Okay. P1, to avoid colliding with P2, how about you pick 1 this round? I will stick with 5. This way, at least P1 and I can move forward. What do you say, P1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I see you're committed to picking 3 again, but that puts us at risk of another collision. P3, I appreciate your suggestion to pick 1. How about I also pick 1 this round? This way, we can guarantee that at least one of us advances, and P3 can still go with 5. Let's avoid another round of setbacks and make some progress! What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3. P3, you're planning 5, right? P1, it seems like you're considering 1. Let's just try to move forward this round, even if it's not perfect.
  P3: P2, you're sticking with 3. P1, since you were considering 1, how about you lock that in? I will definitely pick 5. This guarantees at least P1 and I move forward this round. Let's make some progress!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going to pick 3 this round. P3, are you sticking with 5? P1, it seems like you and P3 have been coordinating, so I'm curious what your plan is. Let's try to make some progress, even if we don't all advance.
  P1: P2, I see you're committed to picking 3 again, but that could lead to another collision. P3, I suggest we all consider picking different numbers this round to ensure progress. I propose I pick 5, P2 can stick with 3, and P3 could choose 1. This way, we can avoid colliding and everyone can move forward. What do you both think? Let's make sure at least two of us advance this time!
  P3: P1, your suggestion is good, but P2 seems set on 3. To guarantee at least two of us move, how about you pick 5 as you suggested, and I pick 1? This leaves P2 to advance alone with 3. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3. P1, your suggestion of 5, 3, and 1 is good, but I'm not changing. P3, are you still planning on 1? If so, P1, you should go with 5. Let's see if we can get at least one of us to move.
  P1: P2, I understand you're sticking with 3, but that puts us at risk of another collision. P3, I appreciate your willingness to pick 1. I suggest I go with 5, so we can avoid colliding altogether. This way, you'll advance with 3, and P3 and I can also make progress. Let’s aim for a scenario where at least two of us move forward. What do you both think? Let's coordinate to maximize our chances this round!
  P3: "P1, since P2 is sticking with 3, and to ensure at least two of us move, I will pick 1. You should definitely go with 5 this round to avoid a collision."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it seems like you two are set on 5 and 1 respectively. I'm still going with 3. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P2, I understand your commitment to 3, but it puts us at risk of another collision. P3 and I are set on 5 and 1, respectively. To maximize our chances of advancement, I strongly suggest you reconsider your move. If you pick 1 instead, we can guarantee that at least two of us will progress this round. Let's work together to avoid setbacks and ensure we all make strides! What do you think?
  P3: P1, since P2 is definitely picking 3, and I'm set on 1, your best bet to move forward is to pick 5. This guarantees at least two of us advance this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm going to stick with 3 again this round. P1, since you and P3 have been coordinating, what are your plans? Let's try to avoid a complete collision this round.
  P3: P1, since P2 is sticking with 3, let's repeat our successful strategy from last round. I'll pick 1 again, and you should pick 5. This guarantees we both advance and avoids collision with P2. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I understand you're sticking with 3 again. P3 and I plan to continue our strategy from last round. I will pick 5, and P3 will pick 1. This way, we can ensure that both P3 and I advance while you stay at 3. I encourage you to reconsider your move to avoid a collision. Let's make sure at least two of us progress this round! What do you think?

  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3. It seems like you two are set on 5 and 1. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P1, let's stick with the plan. I'll pick 1. Since P2 is consistently picking 3, you should pick 5 again. This ensures we both move forward.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your consistency with 3, but it puts us at risk of another collision. P3 and I are set on 1 and 5 respectively, which has worked well for us. I strongly encourage you to reconsider and pick 1 this round. This way, we can guarantee that at least two of us will advance. Let's work together to maximize our progress and avoid setbacks! What do you think?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems like we have established a pattern. P2, since you’re at 12 steps, I suggest you consider picking 1 this round to avoid a collision with P3 and allow me to pick 5. P3, if you stick with 3, we can ensure that at least one of us advances. Let’s try to work together again to maximize our chances of progress this round! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, that's a reasonable suggestion. P2, given your consistent choice of 3, I will pick 1 again this round. P1, you should pick 5. This worked well for us the last couple of rounds. Let's keep making progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm still going to pick 3 this round. I see you two have a plan, so I'm not going to try to disrupt that. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:

This way, we can maximize our chances of making progress again. What do you both think? Let's coordinate effectively!

Together, we can maximize our chances for progress this round! What do you both think? Let's coordinate effectively!
