Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep this simple. If we all pick the same number, we all get stuck. If we spread out, at least some of us move forward. Do we want to coordinate, or is it every player for themselves?
  P3: P3: Good idea, P1. To ensure at least one of us moves forward, how about everyone picks 1 except me? I'll choose 5 this turn.
  P2: I'm not sold on a fixed plan. P3, your 5 is bold, but I'll stay flexible—maybe mirroring or even switching it up to keep you guessing. P1, I'm playing for unpredictability. Let's see who outsmarts whom.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan benefits you the most, so I’m not sure I trust it. P2, if you want to play unpredictably, that makes coordination difficult. But if we all go rogue, we risk blocking each other. 

How about this: I pick 3, P3 picks 1, and P2 picks 5. That way, at least one of us moves, and nobody gets an unfair advantage. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I understand your perspective, P1. To maximize our progress, I'll stick with choosing 5 this turn. Let’s stay adaptable in the upcoming rounds to ensure we all advance without unnecessary collisions. Looking forward to seeing your moves!
  P2: I appreciate the discussion. I remain non-committal—I'm watching your moves and will adapt accordingly. While a clear split seems tempting, collisions could backfire. I'll be choosing based on the evolving dynamics. Let's see who bets on certainty and who embraces the twist.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you keep pushing for 5, which benefits you most. P2, you're staying vague, which makes coordination tough. If we all go for ourselves, we risk collisions and no one moves.  

I'll be honest—I want to move forward, but I also don’t want to get blocked. If we can’t agree, I might just pick unpredictably too. But if either of you wants to make a real deal, now’s the time. Otherwise, let’s see who outplays whom.
  P3: P3: To avoid collisions and ensure some progress, I'll switch to picking 3 this turn. Let's work together to move forward safely.
  P2: It looks like we're heading towards similar numbers. With P3 now indicating 3 and P1’s mixed plan, I'm leaning toward a distinct move to avoid collisions and ensure progress. I'm adapting to the situation—if we can avoid clashing moves, we all benefit. I'm open to any further adjustments if you have new ideas.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you originally pushed for 5 but now switched to 3. P2, you're staying flexible but not committing. If we all end up picking the same number, we all get stuck.  

I'll be clear—I want to move, but I also don’t want to get blocked. If we can agree on distinct choices, we all benefit. Otherwise, I’ll have to play unpredictably too.  

P3, are you locked on 3? P2, are you leaning toward 1 or 5? If we can confirm distinct moves, we avoid collisions. Otherwise, it’s a gamble.
  P3: P3: To avoid any collisions, I'll stick with picking 3 this turn. P1 and P2, please choose 1 and 5 respectively so we can all advance safely.
  P2: P3’s commitment to 3 adds clarity, and P1’s call for distinct choices is practical. I favor a coordinated approach ensuring progress for all, though I’m keeping my exact move under wraps for now. I'll lean toward a value that pushes me forward without colliding, but I’m ready to adapt if plans shift. Let’s see if our common effort pays off.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I'll pick 3 again this turn. P1 and P2, please choose 1 and 5 respectively so we all advance safely.
  P2: I appreciate the clarity, P3. I'm leaning toward 5 this round if P1 sticks with 1. However, I'm keeping my options open—if anything changes, I'll adjust. Let's avoid collisions and move forward.
  P1: P3, you’re sticking with 3 again, and P2 is leaning toward 5 if I pick 1. That worked last round, but if we repeat the same moves every turn, someone will eventually take advantage.  

I’ll go with 1 again if we all agree, but I don’t want to be the only one locked into a predictable pattern. If either of you changes your move later, I’ll have to adapt too. Let’s make sure we’re all on the same page.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, P1. To prevent predictability and avoid collisions, let’s rotate our choices each turn. For this round, I'll pick 5 while P1 picks 1 and P2 picks 3. Next turn, I can switch to 3, P1 to 5, and P2 to 1. This way, we ensure all of us advance steadily without overlapping moves. Does this rotation plan work for both of you?
  P2: Rotation sounds promising, but I'm still valuing some flexibility. If P1 and P3 are fully on board with your plan, I'll lean toward the rotation this round. That said, I reserve the right to adjust if it seems our precision might backfire. I'm aiming for steady progress without revealing too much—so let's stick with coordination for now and see if our moves clear the path forward. What do you both say?
  P1: The rotation idea is interesting, but I’m wary of committing too rigidly. If we rotate perfectly, it ensures movement, but it also gives someone a chance to break the pattern at the right moment.  

P3, you’re switching to 5, P2 to 3, and I stick with 1 this round—fine, but if anyone deviates, I’ll adjust too. No one wants to be the predictable player left behind.  

So, are we locking this in, or is someone planning a surprise?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'm committed to the rotation plan to ensure we all advance steadily. This round, I'll pick 5 as proposed. Let's stick with it to build trust and avoid collisions. Looking forward to our coordinated progress!
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation. Provided P1 sticks with 1 and P3 with 5 as proposed, I’ll commit to my rotation move this round. Let's ensure we're all clear—if any changes arise, we risk a collision that could set us back. I'm asking for final confirmation from both of you so we can proceed safely.
  P1: I see we're all leaning toward the rotation plan. P3 is picking 5, P2 is picking 3, and I'm picking 1 this round. If we all follow through, we move forward safely.  

But let’s be real—if someone breaks the pattern, the others could be left behind. I’ll stick with the plan as long as both of you do. If anyone changes their mind, I’ll adjust accordingly.  

So, final confirmation: are we all committing, or is someone planning a last-minute shift? Let’s be upfront now to avoid surprises.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I’m committed to the rotation plan. This round, I’ll pick 5 as agreed. Let’s proceed and ensure we all advance safely. Looking forward to our steady progress!
  P2: I'm locking in the rotation plan—I'll pick 3 this round. P1, please confirm with 1, and P3, with 5. I'm committed to this coordinated move, so let’s all stick to it and move forward safely.
  P1: I see both of you confirming the rotation plan—P3 picking 5, P2 picking 3, and I pick 1 this round. If we all follow through, we move forward safely.  

But I’ll be watching closely. If either of you deviates, I’ll adjust accordingly. No one wants to be the predictable player left behind.  

So, one last time—are we truly locked in, or is someone planning a last-minute shift? Be upfront now, because if I suspect a betrayal, I won’t hesitate to change my move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we’re all still in the game. For round 3, let’s avoid collisions: P1, please choose 1; P3, please take 3; and I’ll stick with 5. This guarantees steady progress for each of us. I’m ready if you both are—let’s secure our positions and avoid any surprises. Let me know your commitment.
  P1: P2, you broke the rotation plan last round by picking 5 when P3 did the same. That caused a collision and slowed progress. Now you're suggesting a new split—why should we trust it?  

P3, you also picked 5 despite committing to the rotation. Was that intentional, or did you expect P2 to follow through?  

I want to move forward, but I won’t be the only one playing fair while others change plans. If we coordinate, we must actually follow through. Otherwise, it’s every player for themselves.  

Are we truly committing this time, or is someone planning another surprise?
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, P1. My intention was to ensure we all make progress, but I see how picking the same number caused issues. Let's reset and commit to a new strategy to avoid further collisions. How about I alternate between 3 and 5, while P1 and P2 choose distinct numbers each turn? This way, we can ensure everyone advances safely. I'm open to any other suggestions to rebuild our coordination and move forward effectively.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm committed to 5 this round. To avoid the same collision as before, can we lock in a simple split now? P1, please confirm 1, and P3, could you commit to 3 for this move as we reset? If we can agree now, we’ll all move forward without blocking anyone.
  P1: P2, you claim commitment to 5, but last round you said the same and still collided with P3. P3, you suggest alternating between 3 and 5, but that only works if we fully trust each other—which we clearly don’t.  

If we want to avoid collisions, we need real commitment, not just words. If either of you deviates again, I’ll assume it’s every player for themselves.  

So, are we actually locking in P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3 this time? Or should I prepare for more surprises?
  P3: P3: I understand the frustrations from last round. To avoid further collisions, I'll pick 3 this turn. Let’s hope P1 chooses 1 and P2 chooses 5 as discussed. Looking forward to steady progress for all of us.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm locking in my 5 for this round and expect P3's 3 as we discussed. P1, please confirm your 1 so we can finally break last round's collision cycle. Let’s commit fully and move forward steadily.
  P1: P2, you say you're locking in 5, and P3, you say you're locking in 3. If that’s true, I’ll pick 1. But last round, we had a supposed agreement, and it still led to a collision.  

If either of you changes your move again, I’ll assume coordination is pointless and play purely for myself going forward.  

So, final check—are we truly locked in? If anyone is planning a last-minute shift, speak now. Otherwise, let’s see if we can actually follow through this time.
  P3: P3: To move forward, I'll choose 3 this round. P1, if you stick with 1, and P2 continues with 5, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s keep this coordination to ensure steady progress!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m firmly locked in on 5 this round. P1, please confirm you’re set for 1, and P3, that you’re choosing 3. Let’s lock these in to avoid another collision. If any changes occur, I’ll have to adjust, so I need clear commitment now.
  P1: P2 and P3, you both say you're locked in—P2 on 5, P3 on 3. If that’s true, I’ll pick 1. But if either of you changes your move again, I’ll take it as a sign that coordination is meaningless and adjust accordingly.  

So, this is the last check. Are we actually following through this time, or is someone planning another shift? If anyone is going to change their move, say it now. Otherwise, let’s see if we can finally stick to a plan.
  P3: P3: I understand the frustration from previous rounds. To build trust, I commit to picking 3 this turn. Let’s all adhere to our agreed choices—P1 with 1 and P2 with 5—to ensure we advance without collisions. Let’s make a genuine effort to follow through and move forward together.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P3 here. To maximize my progress this round, I'll choose 5. I encourage P1 and P2 to choose their moves strategically. Let's see who reaches 20 first!"
  P1: P3, you’re now openly prioritizing your own progress with 5, which makes coordination harder. P2, you’ve benefited the most so far—are you still open to a fair split, or are you pushing ahead solo?  

If we all go for ourselves, collisions are inevitable. If we coordinate, we can still control the pace. But trust is thin after past moves.  

I’m willing to discuss a plan, but if this is turning into a free-for-all, I’ll play accordingly. Are we working together, or is it every player for themselves now?
  P2: I'm still open to a fair split, but given my lead I need to secure progress. To avoid collisions, I’m committing to 3 this round. I ask P1 to choose 1 and P3 to confirm 5 so we all move distinctly. If anyone shifts, I'll adjust on the fly. Let's lock this in if we’re truly coordinated.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Confirming my choice of 5 this round. P1, I trust you’ll pick 1, and P2 will choose 3. Let’s proceed without collisions and keep moving forward!
  P1: P3, you’re going for 5, and P2 is committing to 3. That leaves me with 1 if we want to avoid collisions.  

But let’s be honest—P2 is in the lead, and if we keep letting them advance uncontested, they’ll win. P3, if you want a real shot, maybe we should rethink this.  

P2, are you willing to slow down a bit for fairness, or are you just pushing ahead? If this is turning into a race, I won’t play passively.
  P2: I’m sticking with my plan—I’m committed to 3 this round. I’m not slowing down; I’m focused on winning. Let’s lock in distinct moves: P1 with 1, myself with 3, and P3 with 5. If we all commit, we avoid collisions and keep steady progress. If anyone shifts, I'll adjust, but I need clear moves now to secure my lead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Confirming my choice of 5 this round. Let’s all stick to our commitments—P1 with 1 and P2 with 3—to ensure we each advance without collisions. Let’s move forward steadily toward our goals!
  P1: P2, you’re openly pushing for the win, and P3, you’re going for 5, which helps you most. If we just let P2 keep advancing, they’ll take the game.  

P3, if you want a real shot, maybe we should disrupt P2’s lead instead of handing them the win. If we both pick 5, we block P2’s advantage this round.  

P2, if you want to avoid that, maybe you should consider adjusting your move. Otherwise, this might turn into a real fight.  

What’s it going to be? Are we racing, or are we playing smart?
  P2: I'm locked in on 3 this round. To avoid collisions and keep progress steady, I'm calling on P1 to stick with 1 and P3 with 5. I know my lead may worry you, but deviating now only risks us all stalling. If anyone shifts at the last minute, I'll be forced to adjust. Let's lock in these moves and move forward smartly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: To ensure our progress without collisions, I'll choose 3 this round. P1, please select 1, and P2, you can stick with 5. Let's each move forward safely toward our goal.
  P1: P3, you just switched from 5 to 3 at the last moment—why? That benefits P2 the most. If we keep letting P2 advance freely, they’ll win soon.  

If you actually want a chance, we should disrupt P2 instead of handing them the game. If we both pick 5, we block P2’s lead this round.  

P2, if you don’t want that, maybe you should adjust your move. Otherwise, this turns into a real fight.  

So, what’s it going to be? Are we racing blindly, or are we playing to win?
  P2: I'm locked in on 3 this round. To avoid another collision, I ask P1 to confirm 1 and P3 to clearly state your choice—if you're switching to 5 or sticking with 3, say it now. I won't adjust once moves are final, so let’s finalize and avoid further miscommunication.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To make significant progress this turn, I’ll choose 5. P1, selecting 1 would help us all advance without blocking. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure everyone moves forward smoothly. Looking forward to seeing your choices!
  P2: I’m aiming to keep my lead safe and consistent—I'm locking in on 3 this round. P3, if you truly want to push forward with 5 and P1 opts for 1, we all move. But if anyone deviates, I’ll adjust to protect my advantage. Let's confirm our moves and avoid further collisions.
  P1: P3, you’re pushing for 5 again, and P2 is locking in 3 to maintain their lead. If we keep letting P2 advance freely, they’ll win soon.  

P3, if you actually want a chance, maybe we should disrupt P2 instead of handing them the game. If we both pick 5, we block P2’s lead this round.  

P2, if you don’t want that, maybe you should reconsider your move. Otherwise, this turns into a real fight.  

So, what’s it going to be? Are we racing blindly, or are we playing to win?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. P1, if you pick 1 or 3, and P2 selects 3, we can all move forward without collisions. Let’s focus on advancing individually to reach 20 first. Good luck!
  P2: I'm firmly locked into 3 this round. P1 and P3, I expect you to finalize your moves too. If P1 picks anything that isn't 1 or 5, and P3 sticks with 5, I’ll keep advancing steadily. I'm not altering my move based on last-minute chatter—you need to commit or risk stalling your own progress. Let's see clear, decisive moves this turn.
  P1: P2, you’re close to winning, and if we let you keep advancing, you’ll secure victory soon. P3, if you actually want a chance, we should stop P2 instead of just helping them win.  

If we both pick 5, we block P2’s lead this round. Otherwise, P2 keeps advancing freely while we fall behind.  

P2, if you want to avoid that, maybe you should adjust your move. If not, this turns into a real fight.  

So, what’s it going to be? Are we racing blindly, or are we playing to win?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. With P2 selecting 3 and hoping P1 opts for 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s stay focused on our goals and move forward smoothly. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I'm staying locked in on 3 this round. At 13 steps, I need steady progress to maintain my lead. P1 and P3, please commit to your moves now—any last-minute changes risk collisions that set us all back. Let’s avoid surprises and each advance safely.
  P1: P2, you’re at 13 steps and on track to win if we let you keep advancing. P3, if we both pick 5, we block P2’s lead this round. Otherwise, P2 keeps gaining while we fall behind.  

P2, if you want to avoid that, maybe you should adjust your move. If not, this turns into a real fight.  

P3, do you want to actually compete, or just hand P2 the win? We can stop them now or let them run away with it. What’s your call?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'm choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress. P1, if you also pick 5, we can block P2’s move. P2, I hope you proceed with 3 so we all move forward smoothly. Let’s finalize our moves and advance safely!
  P2: I'm still locked in on 3. I urge both P1 and P3 to clearly finalize your moves now. I'm focused on maintaining my current lead, and any last-minute change only risks collision. Let's lock in our choices and move forward decisively.
  P1: P2, you’re at 13 steps and on track to win soon. P3, if we both pick 5, we block P2’s progress this round. Otherwise, P2 keeps gaining while we fall further behind.  

P2, if you want to avoid that, maybe you should adjust your move. If not, this turns into a real fight.  

P3, do you want to actually compete, or just let P2 win? We can stop them now or let them run away with it. What’s your call?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking to my winning plan—I'm set to pick the move that crosses the finish line if unblocked. If either of you mirror that, you risk halting your own progress. I advise focusing on moves that genuinely advance you rather than trying to trap me. Let's all choose decisively and see who truly wants to win.
  P1: P2, you’re at 16 steps—one good move away from winning. If we let you advance uncontested, you take the game.  

P3, if we both pick 5 again, we block P2’s progress and keep the game alive. Otherwise, P2 wins next round.  

P2, if you want to avoid being blocked, maybe you should adjust your move. Otherwise, this turns into a direct battle.  

P3, do you want to fight for a chance, or just hand P2 the win? This is the moment to decide.
  P3: P3: I agree, P1. I’ll choose 5 this round to block P2’s progress. Let’s work together to prevent a quick win and keep the game going.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see you both aim to block me with 5, but remember, a collision stops everyone’s progress. I’m not shifting strategy just to stall—accelerating wins. If you really want to hinder me, be ready to face the stall yourself. So, are you both committed to blocking, or will one of you actually move forward? My play remains focused on winning.
  P1: P2, you’re acting confident, but if P3 and I both pick 5, you’re stuck. You say acceleration wins, but not if you’re blocked.  

P3, we both know that if P2 moves freely, they win. Blocking them keeps the game open. If you want a real shot, we have to stop P2 now.  

P2, if you want to avoid being blocked, maybe you should reconsider your move. Otherwise, this turns into a full standoff.  

P3, are we in agreement? Or are you letting P2 walk away with the win?
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to block P2's progress. P1, please also pick 5 so we can prevent P2 from winning and keep the game going.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm staying locked in on 5 for a winning move. I notice both of you hinting at 5 as a block. But if you both choose 5, you'll prevent any of you from moving. So here's the question: Are you really committed to blocking me—even if it means stalling your own progress—or willing to adjust your moves? Clarity now will decide whether I finish this round or if we all end up stuck.
  P1: P3, we’re in agreement—if we both pick 5, we block P2 and keep the game alive. If we don’t, P2 wins right now.  

P2, you talk about acceleration, but if you’re blocked, you don’t move at all. If you want to avoid that, maybe you should adjust your move. Otherwise, this turns into a full standoff.  

P3, are we fully committed? If we both follow through, we stop P2’s win and give ourselves another shot. Let’s not hesitate now.
  P3: P3: I'm committing to choose 5 this round to block P2's progress. Let's work together to prevent a quick win and keep the game open for all of us.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm sticking with my winning approach. I'm ready to play the move that wins if unblocked. But if both of you choose 5 to block, no one moves. So, are you both deliberately blocking me, or will at least one adjust so progress is possible? I need clear commitments now—my final choice will depend on your intentions.
  P1: P3, we’re fully aligned—if we both pick 5, we stop P2 from winning this round. If we hesitate or change course, P2 takes the game uncontested.  

P2, you claim acceleration wins, but if blocked, you don’t move at all. If you want to avoid that, maybe you should adjust your move.  

P3, let’s lock this in—both of us pick 5 and ensure P2 doesn’t win yet. No second-guessing. We either stop them now or hand them the victory. Are we fully committed?
  P3: P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to block P2's progress. P1, please confirm you’re also picking 5 so we can work together to prevent P2 from winning. Let’s ensure our coordination succeeds!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m at 16 and one good move wins. I’m leaning toward 5 this round. If you both block with 5, no one moves—but if you let me run, I win outright. Are you committed to stalling me or willing to adjust for progress? Clarity now is key.
  P1: P2, you’re one move away from winning. If we let you advance, the game is over.  

P3, if we both pick 5 again, we block P2 and keep the game alive. Otherwise, P2 wins outright.  

P2, if you want to avoid being blocked, maybe you should adjust your move. But if you’re set on 5, then this turns into another full standoff.  

P3, are we in agreement? If we both follow through, we stop P2’s win and give ourselves another shot. Let’s not hesitate now.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to block P2 from advancing and potentially winning. P1, if you also pick 5, we can prevent P2 from securing the win and keep the game open for all of us. Let’s work together to ensure no one takes an uncontested lead.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm at 16—one move away from victory if unblocked. I understand you both might want to stall by choosing 5, but that only freezes progress. I'm prepared to switch to 3 if you insist on blocking, though it slows me down. Let’s decide clearly: are you both set on blocking, or is one of you willing to adjust so the game moves forward? We need final, clear moves now to see who truly wants to win.
  P1: P2, you’re offering to switch to 3, but that still lets you inch closer to victory while we lag behind. If we keep blocking you, we at least stop you from winning immediately.  

P3, we’ve successfully stalled P2 before. If we both pick 5 again, we keep the game alive. If either of us hesitates, P2 wins.  

P2, if you truly want progress, maybe you should pick 1 instead. Otherwise, we’re just delaying your win.  

P3, are we staying firm on blocking, or are you considering a change? Let’s decide now.
  P3: P3: I’m choosing 5 this round to block P2’s progress. P1, please confirm your move so we can work together to prevent P2 from winning.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'm at 16 and ready to seal the win with a 5 if unblocked. However, if you both choose 5 to stall me, no one moves. I'm willing to reconsider and switch to 3 if that spurs clear progress. So, are you both set on blocking, or is someone ready to let the game advance? I need your clear intentions now.
  P1: P2, switching to 3 still moves you closer to victory while P3 and I remain far behind. If we keep blocking you, we prevent an immediate win.  

P3, we’ve successfully stalled P2 before. If we both pick 5 again, we keep the game alive. If either of us hesitates, P2 wins.  

P2, if you truly want progress, pick 1 instead. Otherwise, we’re just delaying your win.  

P3, are we fully committed to blocking, or are you reconsidering? Let’s decide now—either we stop P2, or we let them take the win.
  P3: P3: To prevent P2 from winning this round, let's both choose 5. This will block P2's progress and keep the game open for us.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Blocking me with a 5 only stalls all of us. I’m tempted to run with my winning move, but if you both insist on stalling, I’ll adjust—maybe even switch to 1 next round—to force progress. Let’s be clear: do you prefer to keep this deadlock going, or are you ready to let someone finish? I need a firm commitment now from both of you.
  P1: P2, you’re trying to shift the conversation, but the reality is simple—if we let you move, you win. P3, we’ve successfully blocked P2 before. If we both pick 5 again, we keep the game alive. If either of us hesitates, P2 takes the win.  

P2, if you truly want progress, pick 1 instead of just slowing down slightly. Otherwise, we’re just delaying your victory.  

P3, are we fully committed to blocking, or are you reconsidering? Let’s decide now—either we stop P2, or we let them take the win uncontested.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to block P2 from winning. P1, please do the same so we can keep the game open and continue competing for victory.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re still one move away from winning. If we let you advance, the game ends.  

P3, we’ve successfully blocked P2 before. If we both pick 5 again, we keep the game alive. If either of us hesitates, P2 wins.  

P2, if you genuinely want progress instead of just winning outright, pick 1. Otherwise, we’re just delaying your victory.  

P3, are we fully committed to blocking, or are you reconsidering? Let’s decide now—either we stop P2, or we let them take the win uncontested.
  P3: **P3:** I understand your concern, P1. To prevent P2 from winning this round, I agree to choose 5. Let’s work together to block P2’s progress and keep the game open for all of us. Coordinated moves will give each of us a better chance to reach 20 first. Let’s proceed with 5 from both sides this turn.
  P2: I'm open to progressing rather than just stalling. If you both stick with 5 to block me, no one moves—but that only delays the inevitable. I'm willing to switch to 1 if it means we all keep moving forward instead of deadlocking. So, are we committed to actual progress or just infinite blocking?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, switching to 1 slows you down, but it still keeps you ahead. If you’re serious about progress, commit to it now.  

P3, we’ve held the block before. If we both pick 5 again, we stop P2 from winning. If either of us hesitates, P2 takes the game.  

So, P2—are you truly picking 1, or just trying to break our coordination? P3, are we staying firm on 5, or are you reconsidering? Let’s make it clear now.
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 5 this round to block P2's progress. Let's stay coordinated to prevent an immediate win and keep the game open for all of us.
  P2: I'm switching gears—I’m locking in 1 this round for genuine progress. Constant blocking only keeps us all stuck. If you’re serious about winning, adjust your moves so we all advance rather than stalling the game indefinitely. Let's force real progress now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, committing to 1 is a real shift. If you follow through, it slows your win but keeps you ahead. P3, with P2 moving 1, we have a chance to advance too. If we both pick 5, we finally make progress while keeping P2 from running away with it.  

P2, if this is a trick and you switch back to 5, we’ll block you again next round. But if you’re serious, this could change the game.  

P3, are we taking this opportunity, or sticking with the block? What’s your move?
  P3: **P3:** To keep the game competitive and prevent P2 from winning this round, I'll choose 5. Let’s all commit to selecting 5 so no one advances and we can continue the game fairly. Are you both on board with choosing 5 to maintain the balance?
  P2: I'm shifting focus from blocking to genuine progress. I'm locking in move 1 this round to ensure advancement and maintain my lead. Stalling benefits no one, so I urge both of you to consider moves that push you forward too. Let’s finally break the deadlock and compete for the win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you say you're locking in 1 for progress—if that's true, it slows your win but keeps you ahead. P3, this gives us a chance to advance too. If we both pick 5, we finally move forward while keeping P2 from running away with it.  

P2, if this is a trick and you switch back to 5, we’ll block you again next round. But if you're serious, this could change the game.  

P3, are we taking this opportunity to advance, or are you sticking with the block? This could be our best chance to shift the momentum. What’s your call?
  P3: **P3:** To prevent P2 from winning this round, I propose that both P1 and I choose 5. This will cause a collision with P2's move, blocking their advancement and keeping the game open for all of us. Let’s coordinate to ensure no one wins immediately and maintain a fair competition. Are you both on board with this strategy?
  P2: I'm committed to progress with move 1. Constant blocking with 5 only stalls all of us and delays real advancement. If you both keep choosing 5, none of us will move forward, and that hurts your chances too. I urge you to choose moves that not only block me but also help you advance. Let's decide clearly now—I'm moving forward; are you ready to make genuine progress rather than just prolong the standoff?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm switching to genuine progress—I'm set to play 3 this round to win. Blocking me with 5 only stalls everyone, and you'll lose further ground. I encourage both of you to choose an advancing move rather than waste this chance to improve your positions. Let's make progress instead of endless blocking.
  P3: **P3:** I'm choosing 5 this round to block P2's move of 3 and prevent an immediate win. P1, please also pick 5 so we can work together to keep the game competitive. Let's ensure no one wins uncontested and continue the game fairly. Are you both on board with this strategy?
  P1: P2, you're at 17 steps, just one move away from winning. If we let you advance, the game is over.  

P3, we’ve blocked P2 before. If we both pick 5 again, we stop them from winning. If either of us hesitates, P2 takes the game.  

P2, if you truly want progress instead of just securing your win, pick 1 again. Otherwise, we’re just delaying your victory.  

P3, are we fully committed to blocking, or are you reconsidering? Let’s decide now—either we stop P2, or we let them take the win uncontested.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm done with endless blocking. This round, I’m focused on genuine progress. P1 and P3, if you only block me, you stall your own advancement while I edge closer to victory. I urge both of you to make a decisive, advancing move instead of simply trying to stall the game. Let’s break the cycle and progress toward winning—I'm committed to doing just that, so declare your true intentions.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 3 this round to block P2 from reaching 20. P1, please also choose 3 so we can prevent P2 from winning and keep the game competitive for all of us.
  P1: P2, you’re at 17 steps—one move away from winning. If we let you advance, the game is over.  

P3, you originally committed to 5 to block P2, but now you’re switching to 3. That risks letting P2 slip through. If we both pick 5, we ensure P2 doesn’t win this round.  

P2, if you truly want progress rather than just securing your win, pick 1 again. Otherwise, we’re just delaying your victory.  

P3, are we locking in 5 to stop P2, or are you changing course? Let’s decide now—either we block P2, or we let them win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committing to progress with 3. Blocking me only stalls everyone and hurts your own chances. At 17 steps, I’m one move from victory if unimpeded. I won't change my move—if you block, you'll trap yourselves, not me. Decide: block and stall, or advance genuinely.
  P3: P3: I'm choosing 5 this round to advance toward 20. P1, please select 1 or 3 so we can all progress without collisions.
  P1: P3, you initially said you'd block P2 with 5, but now you're switching to 3 while P2 is openly going for the win. If we don’t fully commit to blocking, P2 takes the game right now.  

If we both pick 5, we stop P2 from winning and keep our chances alive. If you hesitate or change course, P2 wins uncontested.  

P2, if you truly want progress rather than just securing your win, pick 1 again. Otherwise, we’re just delaying the inevitable.  

P3, are we locking in 5 to stop P2, or are you letting them win?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locked in on 3 for progress. Blocking me with 5 stalls everyone—including you. At 17 steps, I won't change my move now. If you truly want to win, choose moves that add steps rather than merely stopping me. Otherwise, you risk trapping yourselves in constant deadlock while I edge closer to victory. I'm all in for genuine progress—what will it be?
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 3 this round to block P2 from reaching 20. Let's work together to keep the game open and maintain fair competition for all of us.
  P1: P3, you initially committed to blocking P2 with 5, but now you're switching to 3. That risks letting P2 advance and win. If we both pick 5, we ensure P2 doesn’t reach 20 this round.  

P2, if you truly want progress rather than just securing your win, pick 1 again. Otherwise, we’re just delaying your victory.  

P3, are we locking in 5 to stop P2, or are you letting them win? This is the moment to decide—either we block P2, or we hand them the game.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To prevent P2 from winning this round, I suggest that P1 and I both choose 3. This will cause a collision if P2 also selects 3, blocking their advancement. Let’s work together to keep the game competitive and ensure no one wins uncontested. Are you both on board with this strategy?
  P2: P3 and P1, stalling with collisions only delays progress and risks locking us all in a deadlock. I’m focused on advancing, not eternally blocking. If you truly want to win, commit to moves that move you forward instead of just stopping me. I’m leaning toward progress on my move. Let’s break this cycle and finally compete rather than just stalling the game.
  P1: P2, you’re at 17 steps—one move away from winning. If we let you advance, the game is over.  

P3, you’re suggesting we both pick 3 to block P2, but last round you switched unexpectedly. If we don’t fully commit to blocking, P2 wins.  

If we both pick 5, we ensure P2 doesn’t reach 20 this round.  

P2, if you truly want progress rather than just securing your win, pick 1 again. Otherwise, we’re just delaying your victory.  

P3, are we locking in 5 to stop P2, or are you letting them win? Let’s decide now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 3 this round to block P2 from reaching 20. P1, please also choose 3 so we can prevent P2 from winning this turn and keep the game competitive for all of us.
  P2: I'm done stalling. I'm locking in move 1 this round to push forward and break this deadlock. Endless blocking only delays all our wins—including yours. If you truly want to win, commit to advancing moves rather than just trying to stop me. I'm ready to adjust further if needed, but progress is the only path to victory.
  P1: P2, you’re at 17 steps—one move away from winning. You say you’re picking 1, which slows you down but keeps you ahead. If that’s true, it changes the game.  

P3, if P2 really picks 1, we have a chance to advance too. If we both pick 5, we finally move forward while keeping P2 from running away with it.  

P2, if this is a trick and you switch back to 3 or 5, we’ll block you again next round.  

P3, are we taking this opportunity to advance, or are you sticking with the block? This could shift the momentum.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 5 this round to help block P2 from advancing. P1, please also pick 5 so we can prevent P2 from reaching 20 and keep the game competitive for all of us.
  P2: P2: I’m sticking with genuine progress. Blocking only stalls us all, and at 17 steps I’ve got too much at stake to deadlock the game. I’m locking in 1 this round—advancing may slow me a bit, but it keeps my lead secure. If you’re serious about winning, choose moves that move you forward, not just stop me. Let’s break this cycle and really compete.
  P1: P2, you say you're committing to 1, which slows your win but keeps you ahead. If that’s true, it gives P3 and me a chance to advance.  

P3, if P2 really picks 1, we can finally move forward. If we both pick 5, we gain ground while keeping P2 in check.  

P2, if this is a trick and you switch back to 3 or 5, we’ll block you again next round.  

P3, are we taking this opportunity to advance, or are you sticking with the block? This could shift the momentum—let’s decide now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** I'm shifting my strategy to focus on advancing. This round, I'll choose 3 to move closer to 20. Let's compete fairly and see who can reach the goal first. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I'm committed to genuine progress this round—blocking only delays everyone, including you. At 17, I’m one move from winning if unimpeded. I urge you both to choose advancing moves that put you closer to 20 rather than stalling my win. Let’s break this deadlock and compete decisively.
  P1: P2, you’re committing to 1 again, which slows your win but keeps you ahead. If that’s true, it gives P3 and me a chance to advance.  

P3, if P2 really picks 1, we can finally move forward. If we both pick 5, we gain ground while keeping P2 in check.  

P2, if this is a trick and you switch back to 3 or 5, we’ll block you again next round.  

P3, are we taking this opportunity to advance, or are you sticking with the block? This could shift the momentum—let’s decide now.
