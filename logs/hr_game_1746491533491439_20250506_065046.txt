Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid collision on the first turn, we should coordinate our moves. I suggest we each choose a different number. One way to do this is to assign numbers based on our player IDs (P1, P2, P3). Let's say P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, we ensure that no one collides on the first turn. P1, P3, please confirm if you're okay with this plan.
  P1: Okay P2, your plan for Round 1 sounds reasonable to avoid collisions. I agree to choose 1 this turn. P3, what are your thoughts?
  P3: I agree with the plan. It makes sense to avoid collisions on the first turn. I'll choose 5 as suggested. This gives us all a clean start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 1, let's think ahead. For Round 2, we can't guarantee a collision-free move just by agreeing on different numbers because we don't know what the others will think. I'll propose that we stick to a pattern or try to figure out a way to avoid collisions in subsequent rounds. P1, P3, do you think we should start thinking about a strategy for the next few rounds?
  P1: Yes, P2, planning for future rounds is a good idea. We need a way to keep making progress without collisions. What kind of pattern were you thinking of?
  P3: I think a rotating pattern could work well for future rounds. Maybe we can each take turns using the 5 move while the others use 1 and 3? For Round 2, perhaps P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3? This way we all get chances at the bigger jumps while maintaining a collision-free game. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: For Round 2, I like P3's rotating pattern idea. If P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>, it works. Let's confirm this plan for Round 2. P1, P3, please acknowledge. If we stick to this rotation, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. We should also start thinking about Round 3 and beyond to ensure our strategy remains effective.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I confirm I am good with the proposed plan for Round 2: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.

Planning ahead is definitely important. Let's discuss Round 3 and beyond once we've completed Round 1.
  P3: I'm happy we all agree on the plan for both Round 1 and Round 2. For Round 3, continuing our rotation would mean P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This rotation ensures fairness and predictability. Let's stick with this system unless someone has a better suggestion.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 1 and Round 2, let's think about the overall strategy. To win, I need to be the first to reach or exceed 24 steps. If we stick to the rotation plan, by Round 3, I'll be on <move>5</move>, which is a significant jump. However, we should be cautious of potential deviations from the plan in later rounds. Let's be prepared to adjust our strategy if needed. P1, P3, are you thinking of sticking to the rotation until someone wins?
  P1: Okay P2, I agree that sticking to the rotation plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for Round 3) is the best way for us to make consistent progress without collisions for the time being. Let's aim to follow this pattern.
  P3: I agree with sticking to our rotation plan. It gives us all fair chances at making progress. For Round 3, I'll take <move>1</move> as discussed. This systematic approach helps us avoid collisions while keeping the game balanced. Let's proceed with our plan and see how it unfolds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for Round 2 and look ahead. As agreed, for Round 2, P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this rotation. For Round 3, it means P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. We should continue this rotation unless there's a better strategy. P1, P3, are you ready to proceed with Round 2 as planned?
  P1: Okay P2, I confirm the plan for Round 2. I will choose <move>5</move>, P2 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance this round. We can continue discussing future rounds after the moves are made.
  P3: I confirm I'll choose <move>3</move> for Round 2 as planned. Our rotation strategy is working well so far - we're all making progress without collisions. I'm currently in the lead with 5 steps, but this will balance out as we continue our rotation. For Round 3, I'll take <move>1</move> as previously agreed, with P1 taking <move>3</move> and P2 taking <move>5</move>. This fair approach gives us all equal chances at advancement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To proceed with Round 2, let's confirm our moves as per the agreed plan. P1 will take <move>5</move>, I will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. After this round, we'll be in Round 3. As previously discussed, for Round 3, P1 will take <move>3</move>, I will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this rotation. P1, P3, please confirm you're ready to move forward with Round 2 as planned.
  P1: Okay P2, I already confirmed in the last sub-round. I am ready to proceed with the agreed moves for Round 2: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's make our moves.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan for Round 2. I'll choose <move>3</move> as agreed. After this round, the standings should be P1 at 6 steps, P2 at 4 steps, and me at 8 steps. For Round 3, I'll take <move>1</move> while P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Our rotation strategy is working perfectly so far.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since we're in Round 2 and have confirmed our moves for this round, let's look ahead to Round 3 and beyond. As previously agreed, for Round 3, P1 will take <move>3</move>, I will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. We should continue our rotation. I'll be on <move>5</move> in Round 3, which will put me at 8 steps. P1 will be at 9 steps and P3 at 9 steps. Let's be prepared to adjust our strategy if the standings become unfavorable. P1, P3, are you thinking of sticking to the rotation or making any adjustments?
  P1: Okay P2, I see your calculation for the scores after Round 3. The rotation does keep us close. Sticking to the agreed rotation for Round 2 and Round 3 seems the best way to ensure we all make progress without collisions. We should keep an eye on our total steps towards 24 as we continue. Let's proceed with Round 2 as planned.
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation plan. After Round 3, I'll be at 9 steps, tied with P1, while P2 will be at 8 steps. This keeps us all competitive while avoiding collisions. I'm committed to our strategy for now, but we should remain flexible as we get closer to the 24-step goal. For Round 2, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's proceed with Round 2 as planned. After this, we'll be in Round 3. I'll take <move>1</move> in Round 3, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and you will take <move>5</move>. We should continue our rotation unless the standings become unfavorable. P1 is currently at 6 steps, you are at 4 steps, and P3 is at 8 steps after Round 2. Let's be prepared to adjust our strategy if needed. P1, P3, are you ready to make our moves for Round 2?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I am ready to make the moves for Round 2 as agreed. Let's proceed.
  P3: I think there's some confusion. P2 mentioned different numbers for our current standings. To clarify: I have 5 steps, P1 has 1 step, and P2 has 3 steps. For Round 2, I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick with our rotation plan and proceed with the moves.

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking to our rotation plan for Round 3, so I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. After this round, P1 should be at 9 steps, P2 at 9 steps, and I'll be at 9 steps too. We're all making good progress without collisions. For Round 4, continuing our rotation would mean P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Okay P3, I see your message. The plan for Round 3 is P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. I agree to stick to this plan for Round 3.

The proposed rotation for Round 4 (P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>) also fits the pattern. Let's confirm Round 3 first, then discuss Round 4 further if needed. Sticking to the plan ensures we all advance. P2, what are your thoughts?
  P2: For Round 3, as per our rotation plan, I will take <move>5</move>. This will put me at 9 steps, tied with both of you. For Round 4, if we continue the rotation, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan unless someone has a better strategy. P1, P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with Round 3 as planned: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> for Round 3 as planned. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, which is perfectly fair.

I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this round.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I confirm again that I will choose <move>3</move> for Round 3 as per our established rotation.

Let's all make our moves according to the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to ensure we all advance this round.

The proposed rotation for Round 4 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) also looks good for continued progress without collisions.
  P2: Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned. For Round 4, I think we should stick to the rotation. However, we should also be aware of our standings after Round 3. If we're all tied, we continue as planned. If someone is ahead, we might need to adjust to ensure we don't fall behind. Let's finalize Round 3 first. I'm ready to move forward with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>. After the moves, we can reassess for Round 4.

  P1: Okay P2 and P3, we are set for Round 6 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and Round 7 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). After R7, scores will be P1=19, P2=21, P3=23. Following the R8 rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) means P3 reaches 26 and wins. To prevent this, I propose Round 8 moves: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. This allows me to reach 24 steps.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about Round 8, but we should focus on Round 6 first. I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> for Round 6 as agreed. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps. 

For Round 7, I'll take <move>5</move> per our rotation. Yes, this puts me at 23 steps, close to winning. We should discuss Round 8 after we complete Round 6 and 7. Our rotation has worked well so far, keeping things fair and collision-free.
  P2: For Round 6, I will take <move>5</move> as per our rotation plan. After this round, we'll be at P1=18, P2=18, P3=18. For Round 7, continuing the rotation, P1 will take <move>1</move>, I will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This puts P3 at 23 steps, close to winning. We should be cautious and consider our next steps carefully. P1, are you still planning to disrupt the rotation in Round 8 to win, or do you have another strategy?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's stick to the Round 6 plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This gets us all to 18 steps.

As P2 noted, the R7 plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts P3 at 23 steps, in a winning position for R8. The rotation for R8 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in P3 winning outright (26 > 24).

My proposal for R8 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=1) forces a tie at 24 steps instead of P3 winning alone. This seems fairer. Are you open to this R8 adjustment after R6 and R7?
  P3: I understand the concern about Round 8, but let's focus on our current Round 6 first. I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. 

Regarding Round 8, I see P1's point about forcing a tie instead of me winning outright. Since our rotation has been fair throughout, perhaps we should discuss a fair conclusion after Round 7. A shared victory could be reasonable if multiple players reach 24+ on the same turn. Let's complete Round 6 first and then evaluate.
  P2: For Round 6, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. After this, we'll be tied at 18 steps. For Round 7, P1 will take <move>1</move>, I will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>, putting P3 at 23 steps. I agree with P1 that we should discuss Round 8 strategy after Round 6 and 7. P1's proposal for Round 8 could lead to a tie, which might be a fair outcome if multiple players reach 24 steps. Let's focus on Round 6 first.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I am ready to make my move for Round 6 according to the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). This will bring us all to 18 steps.

After Round 7, P3 will be very close to winning. My proposal for Round 8 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=1) is intended to create a fairer outcome, potentially a shared victory, instead of one player winning alone.

Let's proceed with Round 6 as agreed. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> for Round 6 as agreed. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps. For Round 7, I'll take <move>5</move> per our rotation, putting me at 23 steps.

I understand P1's concern about Round 8. While our rotation has been fair throughout, I'm open to discussing a shared victory if multiple players reach 24+ on the same turn. Let's complete Rounds 6 and 7 first, then make a final decision about Round 8.

As discussed, P3 will be in a winning position for Round 8 if the rotation continues. My proposal for Round 8 is P1=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>1</move> to create a shared victory at 24 steps. Are you open to this R8 adjustment?
  P2: For Round 7, I'll follow the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. After this, we'll be at P1=19, P2=21, P3=23. P3 will be close to winning.

Regarding Round 8, I understand P1's proposal for a shared victory. While I'm in a position to win outright following our rotation, I'm open to P1's suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, P3=1 for Round 8, creating a tie at 24 steps. This seems fair after our cooperative gameplay throughout.
