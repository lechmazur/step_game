Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll go for 5. This way, we all move forward without any risk. Let me know if you're on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P2: I appreciate the idea of avoiding collisions, but remember—I'm playing solely to win. I might lean toward 3 this round, yet I'm keeping my options open. Let's see if our plans hold or if the game forces us to shift gears.
  P1: P3, I see your proposal for a clean start. While avoiding collisions is wise, allowing one player to take 5 steps immediately gives them a significant advantage. P2, your interest in 3 is noted. I'll be considering my move carefully to ensure I advance towards the win.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks for the feedback, P1 and P2. I understand the concern about giving an early lead with 5 steps, P1. How about we adjust the plan to keep things balanced? Let's all aim for lower numbers this round—say, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 as well. Or we can mix it up differently, as long as we avoid collisions. I’m open to suggestions to ensure we all move forward without anyone gaining a big edge early on. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, while I see the appeal of a collision-free start, I'm not yet convinced lower moves will secure the win. I need options that let me strategically edge ahead. Let's keep our ideas open, but remember—I’m playing to win any way I can.
  P1: P2, your focus on winning is understandable, but it makes coordinating a collision-free round difficult. P3, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution where we all advance. Given P2's position, are you still leaning towards 1 or 3? It's hard to predict moves when options are wide open.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I hear both of your concerns about balancing fairness and strategy. Since coordination is tricky with differing goals, let’s aim for transparency this round. I’m leaning toward a smaller move to avoid an early lead imbalance, but I’m still flexible. Can we agree on a loose plan to minimize collisions, even if it’s just signaling intent without locking in? P1, P2, what’s your current inclination? I want us all to advance if possible. Let me know your thoughts, and I’ll adapt accordingly.
  P2: I'm leaning toward a moderate choice—3 seems promising for steady progress without risking a collision. However, I'm keeping my options open and ready to adapt if necessary. Let’s try to avoid duplicating moves, so we all advance while playing smart. My final move remains private.
  P1: P2, thanks for sharing your leaning towards 3. P3, I appreciate your flexibility and desire for us all to advance. Given P2's likely choice, I will aim for a different number to avoid a collision. P3, I hope you can also find a unique number. Let's try to ensure we all make progress this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for the input. I’m glad we’re trying to avoid collisions this round. P2, noting your lean toward 3, and P1, your intent to pick a different number, I’ll aim for a unique choice as well to ensure we all advance. Let’s keep this momentum of transparency and coordination. I’m set on a number that should avoid overlap based on what’s been shared. If there’s any last concern or adjustment, let me know now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: I'm still leaning toward a moderate choice, likely around 3, but I'm ready to adapt if we need to steer clear of collisions. Let's aim for distinct moves so everyone advances. I'm focused on winning, so I'll adjust if clear coordination benefits us all.
  P1: P2, noted on 3. P3, let's ensure our choices are distinct from 3 and from each other. To make meaningful progress this round, I'll be considering a larger step.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 1 went well, everyone advanced. I'm happy with my position and plan to continue making strong moves towards the win. What are P2 and P3 thinking this round?
  P3: P1, P2, glad we all advanced last round. P1, congrats on the strong lead with 5. I’m still aiming to catch up and would like to avoid collisions again. How about we signal intent to keep moves distinct? I’m considering a moderate step this round to close the gap a bit. P1, since you’re ahead, maybe a smaller move? P2, what’s your plan? Let’s try to ensure we all progress while staying competitive. I’m open to adjusting based on your thoughts. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m still leaning toward a moderate move, but I might adapt if a collision can strategically hinder a key rival. P1’s strong lead could backfire with overly aggressive moves, and P3, if you aim moderate, we might need to tweak our choices. I'm focused solely on winning, so I’ll adjust my move if it helps secure that win.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand you want to catch up, but I need to maintain my momentum towards the win. I won't be taking a small step this round. P2, a collision only slows everyone down. I intend to make a significant move towards the goal. It's in everyone's interest to pick a unique number so we all advance.
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for sharing your plans. P1, I respect your push for momentum, but a big move might widen the gap too much. P2, I’m also leaning moderate to gain ground, so let’s avoid overlap. How about we aim for distinct choices again? P1, maybe consider a balanced step to keep things competitive. I’m thinking of a number that should differ from yours if we signal intent. Can we loosely coordinate to ensure no collisions while staying in the race? Let me know your inclinations so we can all advance.
  P2: I'm still leaning toward a moderate move, but I'm open to slight adjustments if needed. Avoiding collisions benefits us all, although I'm focused solely on winning. P1, your aggressive move is noted, and P3, I appreciate your moderation. Let’s try to ensure our moves stay distinct so everyone advances this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, noted on 3. P3, let's ensure our choices are distinct from 3 and from each other. To make meaningful progress this round, I'll be considering a larger step. P3, I hope you can choose a number different from both 3 and my intended larger step so we all advance.
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for the updates. P1, I understand your intent for a larger step, and P2, your lean toward moderate is clear. I’m still aiming for a moderate move to close the gap, but I’ll ensure it’s distinct from both of your inclinations. Let’s keep collisions off the table this round. P1, if your larger step is 5, I’ll steer clear, and P2, I’ll avoid 3. Can we confirm a loose plan to pick unique numbers again? I’m set to adjust if needed. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm committed to a moderate move—3 remains my solid choice. P1, your aggressive move is clear, and P3, I appreciate you steering away from 3. I'm keeping my focus on winning, so let's avoid collisions and each choose uniquely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, understood on 3. P3, yes, my larger step will be 5 this round to build on my lead. To ensure we all advance, please choose 1. This way, we all move forward with distinct numbers: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's make it happen.
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for the clarity. P1, I note your plan for 5, and P2, your commitment to 3. I’m fine with taking 1 to ensure we all advance with distinct moves. Let’s stick to this—P1 with 5, P2 with 3, and me with 1—to avoid any collisions this round. I’m still focused on catching up, but I agree coordination benefits us now. If there’s any last-minute concern, let me know. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: I’m locking in my moderate move with 3. Let's stick to our agreed plan—distinct numbers help everyone move forward. However, I remain focused on winning, so I’ll adapt if any unexpected opportunities arise. Let's keep the coordination tight and avoid collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 2 saw P2 and P3 collide, which was a shame. I advanced to 10 steps. My goal is to reach 23 swiftly, so I will continue taking large steps. P2, P3, what are your plans this round? Let's try to avoid collisions so everyone can advance.
  P3: P1, P2, sorry about the collision last round, P2. I’m focused on advancing now and catching up. P1, I see your intent for large steps to reach 23 quickly. I’m considering a moderate move this round to gain ground. Can we aim for distinct choices again? P1, since you’re likely going for 5, and P2, if you’re sticking to moderate, maybe 3, I’ll pick a different number. Let’s signal intent to avoid overlap. What are your inclinations? I’m open to adjusting to ensure we all progress. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm still leaning toward a moderate step. P1, your aggressive 5 is clear, and P3, if you're considering 1 or another option, please avoid 3. I’m focused solely on winning and want to avoid another collision. Let’s each pick a distinct step so we all move forward without hindrance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for confirming your lean towards 3. P3, I appreciate you wanting to avoid collisions and advance. I will be taking 5 steps this round to continue my push towards 23. To ensure we all advance without colliding, I suggest we repeat Round 1's successful moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows everyone to make progress towards the goal.
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for the input. P1, I note your plan for 5, and P2, your lean toward 3. I’m okay with taking 1 to ensure distinct moves and avoid collisions. Let’s stick to P1 with 5, P2 with 3, and me with 1 to keep progress smooth this round. I’m still aiming to catch up, but coordination helps us all now. If there’s any last concern or adjustment, let me know. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this plan.
  P2: I'm revising my plan. Instead of sticking with 3, I'll choose 5 this round to contest your aggressive move, P1. If you both stick with your previous numbers, this forces a collision that may curb your lead. P3, if you're still set to take 1, that works for me. My sole focus is winning, so sometimes slowing a front-runner is necessary.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, colliding at 5 stops both of us. I will not pick 5 this round to ensure I advance. P3, please stick to 1. P2, reconsider your move; choose a number that allows *you* to advance, rather than stopping me at your own expense.
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for the updates. P1, I’m glad you’re adjusting to avoid a collision. P2, I understand your intent to slow the leader, but let’s prioritize advancing. I’ll stick with 1 as planned to ensure a distinct move. P1, if you’re not taking 5, can you hint at your new choice? P2, reconsidering for progress over collision might benefit us all. Let’s aim for unique numbers—P1, pick what suits you, P2, maybe back to 3? I’m set on 1. Thoughts or adjustments before we finalize?
  P2: P1, P3, I've reconsidered my options. For safe advancement and to avoid another collision, I’m backing into a steady 3. If P1 stays with 5 and P3 with 1, this should let all of us progress without setbacks. I’m focused solely on winning, so I need to secure my move without risking a collision that stops me too. Let’s keep our choices distinct this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, glad to hear you're back to 3 for safe advancement. P3, thank you for sticking with 1. With P2 on 3 and P3 on 1, I will take 5 this round. This ensures we all pick distinct numbers (5, 3, 1) and everyone advances towards the goal. Let's make it happen.
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for the clarity. I’m sticking with 1 to ensure we avoid collisions. P1, I’m glad you’re back to 5, and P2, your return to 3 works well for distinct moves. Let’s finalize this plan—P1 with 5, P2 with 3, and me with 1—so we all advance this round. I’m still focused on catching up, but coordination benefits us now. If there’s any last-minute concern or change, let me know. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P2 here: I'm committed to my moderate move – 3 remains my choice. It’s crucial for each of us to stick to our distinct moves so everyone advances. P1, I count on your strong push with 5, and P3, I hope you keep with 1. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 3 saw P2 and P3 collide again, which is unfortunate. I advanced to 15 steps and am now very close to the goal. I plan to take a large step this round to get even closer to 23. To ensure we all advance, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This lets everyone progress without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, I’m disappointed about the collision last round with P2. I’m focused on advancing now. P1, congrats on reaching 15 steps; I see your plan for 5 to near the goal. I’m considering a moderate move to catch up. Let’s aim for distinct choices. P1, if you’re set on 5, and P2, if you’re leaning toward 3, I’ll pick differently. Can we confirm a plan to avoid overlap? I’m open to taking 1 if that ensures progress for all. What are your thoughts? Let’s coordinate to advance together.
  P2: P1, while I appreciate your clear plan, your 15-step lead is worrisome. I’m inclined to stick with my steady 3, but I won’t rule out adapting to hinder your pace if needed. P3, I’d favor keeping our moves distinct—1 works well for safe progress. Let’s aim to avoid another collision while also ensuring no one races too fast. I'll adjust if the situation demands.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, colliding to stop me also stops you. My proposed plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 ensures we all advance this round. This is the most efficient way for everyone to make progress towards the goal without setbacks. Let's agree on this to guarantee movement for all. I am proceeding with 5.
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for the input. P1, I understand your push for 5 to near the goal, and P2, I note your lean toward 3. I’m willing to take 1 to ensure distinct moves and avoid collisions. Let’s stick to P1 with 5, P2 with 3, and me with 1 to guarantee progress for all. I’m focused on catching up, but coordination helps us now. If there’s any last concern or change, let me know. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: I confirm I'll choose 3 this round. I’m sticking with our coordinated plan to avoid collisions. However, given P1’s lead, I’m watching the board for any chance to slow him down if needed. For now, let’s all stick to distinct moves—P1 with 5, me with 3, and P3 with 1—so we all advance safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm pleased we've reached an agreement. P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 1 ensures you both advance. As stated, I will take 5 to continue my progress. This plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 allows everyone to move forward without collisions. Let's proceed with this plan in the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on distinct moves with P1 at 5, P2 at 3, and me at 1. This plan ensures we all advance this round, which is critical for me to start closing the gap. I’m committed to sticking with 1 to avoid any collisions. If there’s any sudden change in intent, please let me know now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this coordinated approach. Let’s keep the momentum and ensure progress for everyone. Thoughts or final adjustments?
  P2: P1, P3, I'm locking in 3 this round as we agreed. However, I’m also keeping an eye on your moves—if an opportunity arises later to slow down a runaway leader, I might adjust my play. For now, I'm fully committed to our current plan to avoid collisions. Let's maintain the coordination and see how the game unfolds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate you both confirming your moves of 3 and 1 respectively. This confirms our plan for distinct moves this round. As agreed, I will take 5 steps. This ensures we all advance. Let's proceed with this plan in the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, I’m glad we’ve agreed on distinct moves with P1 at 5, P2 at 3, and me at 1. This ensures we all advance, which is crucial for me to gain ground. I’m committed to 1 and trust we’ll stick to this plan. If there’s any last-second doubt or shift, please speak up now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this coordination to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize this and progress together. Any final thoughts? If not, I’m set.
  P2: I’m staying with my committed 3 to ensure safe progress. I encourage both P1 and P3 to stick with our coordinated plan, as avoiding collisions is critical. Of course, I'll be watching closely for any opportunity to disrupt excessive leads. For now, a clean advance is best to keep our options open.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, last round’s collision hurt us all. I’m sorry for misjudging the moves. P1, you’re at 15 and close to winning, so I’m desperate to catch up. I’m considering a larger step this round. Can we avoid another collision? P1, if you’re aiming for 5 again, I’ll try a different number. P2, what’s your plan? Let’s signal intent to pick distinct moves. I’m open to adjusting to ensure we all advance. What are your thoughts? Let’s coordinate to keep the game competitive.
  P1: P3, I appreciate you wanting to avoid another collision. Round 4 was unfortunate for everyone. I am at 15 steps and focused on reaching 23 quickly, so I will be taking a large step this round. To ensure we all advance, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This plan allows everyone to make progress towards the goal without colliding. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, your 5 keeps your lead soaring, and it worries me. I'm considering matching that move to stall you—knowing full well stalling could benefit my win. P3, if you’re willing to switch from 1 to 3, we could work together to curb P1’s pace. I'm solely focused on winning and will play accordingly. Let me know if you’re open to adjusting our plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m desperate to catch up with only 1 step. P1, I see your plan for 5 to reach 20, nearing the win. P2, I’m tempted by your idea to stall P1, but collisions hurt us more. I propose we stick to distinct moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 to ensure we all advance. I’m still in the race and need progress. If we collide, P1 wins sooner. Can we agree on this plan to keep the game competitive? Thoughts or adjustments before we finalize?
  P1: P2, colliding only hurts your own progress towards the win. P3 is correct, collisions benefit no one, especially those furthest behind. My plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 allows all of us to advance this round without setbacks. This is the most productive path forward for everyone. I am committed to taking 5 steps. Let's ensure P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1 so we all move forward.
  P2: P1, your push for 5 continues to stretch your lead dangerously. I’m switching my pick to 5 this round to stall you—forcing a collision so you don’t advance. P3, if you can stick with 1, that leaves just the two of us clashing at 5 while you move safely. Let’s slow the runaway before it wins. I'm doing this solely to keep my hopes alive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m in a tough spot at just 1 step and need to advance. P2, I get your intent to stall P1 with 5, but a collision still leaves me trailing far behind. P1, I respect your push for 5. Let’s stick to distinct moves—P1 with 5, P2 with 3, and me with 1—to ensure we all progress. Colliding helps no one catch up. Can we agree to this plan to keep the game alive? I’m set on 1. Final thoughts or adjustments? If not, I’m ready.
  P1: P2, you are at 3 steps. Picking 5 stops you at 3 steps. How does that help you win? My plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is the *only* way for you to advance this round. P3 is taking 1. I am taking 5. Your only path to progress is taking 3. Don't stop yourself.
  P2: P1, while your plan seems fair, my priority is still slowing your race to 23. I see P3 is leaning toward 1, so matching your 5 might force a collision that stalls your progress—benefiting my catch-up. I'm seriously considering that option for this round. Let's see if you both have room to adapt, but I'm playing for the win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m at just 1 step and desperate to advance. P2, stalling P1 with 5 stops you too, and I still lag behind. P1, I respect your push for 5. Let’s stick to distinct moves—P1 with 5, P2 with 3, and me with 1—to ensure we all progress. Collisions only widen the gap for me. Can we finalize this plan to keep the game competitive? I’m committed to 1. If there’s any last concern or shift, speak now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, picking 5 only stops you at 3 steps. I will not collide with you at 5. P3 is taking 1. Your best path to advance is to choose a number distinct from 1 and from my move. Do not stop yourself. I am focused on reaching 23 and will ensure I advance this round.
  P2: P1, I understand your push for 5 but colliding only hurts all of us, including me. I won’t sabotage my own progress—I'm sticking to 3 to move forward. P3, I urge you to choose a distinct move so we avoid collisions. We each need to advance steadily if we’re to keep our chances alive. I remain laser-focused on winning, so I'll choose 3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m at just 1 step and desperate to catch up after last round’s collision. P1, you’re at 15 and close to winning with another likely 5. P2, you’re at 6 with a steady pace. I’m considering a larger move to close the gap. Can we aim for distinct choices to avoid collisions? P1, if you’re set on 5, I’ll pick differently. P2, what’s your intent? Let’s signal plans to ensure we all advance. I’m open to adjusting. Thoughts? Let’s coordinate to keep this competitive.
  P2: P1, I expect you'll go for 5 to keep your lead, and I'm sticking with 3 for steady progress from my 6. P3, please avoid 5 so we don't end up colliding again—you know collisions hurt everyone, including you. I'm set on advancing safely and won't sabotage my own move. Let's all pick distinct moves and keep the race competitive.
  P1: P2, thanks for sharing your plan for 3. P3, I understand you want to catch up, but colliding won't help you advance. I am taking 5 steps this round to move closer to 23. Given P2 is likely taking 3, your best chance to guarantee advancement is to take 1. This ensures P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, and everyone moves forward without collisions. Let's make sure we all advance this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for the input. P1, I note your plan for 5, and P2, your intent for 3. I’m desperate to catch up from 1 step, so I’m tempted to take a larger move, but I’ll stick to 1 to ensure distinct choices and avoid collisions. Let’s agree on P1 with 5, P2 with 3, and me with 1 to guarantee progress for all. I’m focused on staying in the race. If there’s any last concern or change, let me know. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, I’m locking in my steady 3 again. I urge both of you to pick distinct moves this round to avoid collisions—P1, your 5 is clear, so P3, please choose something different from 3 and 5. Collisions only slow our overall progress, and I’m focused on advancing safely. Let’s keep our moves distinct this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate you both confirming your intentions. P2 sticking with 3 and P3 with 1 aligns perfectly with the plan for distinct moves. As I stated, I will take 5 steps this round. This ensures P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1, allowing all of us to advance without collisions. Let's proceed with this plan in the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on distinct moves with P1 at 5, P2 at 3, and me at 1. I’m sticking to 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. I’m desperate to catch up from just 1 step, so this progress is crucial for me. If there’s any sudden change in intent, please speak up now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this plan to keep the game competitive. Any final thoughts or adjustments? If not, I’m set to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3: I’m staying with 3 this round. Collisions only slow us all down—even for me. P1, your aggressive move with 5 is clear, and P3, I really need you to avoid duplicating that. Let’s each pick a distinct number so we can all advance safely. I'm focused on steady progress and winning, so I stand by 3.
  P1: P2, thank you for confirming you are sticking with 3. P3 has also confirmed they will take 1. As stated, I will take 5 steps this round. This plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed with these distinct moves to guarantee progress for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m sticking with 1 as agreed to ensure we all advance without collisions. I’m at just 1 step and need this progress to stay in the race. P1, your push for 5 is noted, and P2, your steady 3 works for distinct moves. Let’s finalize this plan—P1 with 5, P2 with 3, and me with 1. If there’s any last-second doubt or change, please speak up now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: I’m locking in 3 again. Collisions only help P1’s runaway lead and slow me down. I urge you both—P1 with your 5 and P3 with your 1—to keep our moves distinct. Progress for all is key, and I’m sticking with my safe, steady choice. Let's avoid collisions and keep our chances alive.
  P1: P2 and P3, thank you for confirming your moves of 3 and 1 respectively. This aligns perfectly with the plan for distinct moves this round. As I stated, I will take 5 steps this round. This ensures P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1, allowing all of us to advance without collisions. Let's proceed with these distinct moves to guarantee progress for everyone.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
