Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers to advance without collision. Agree?
  P1: Agree, let's pick 1, 3, 5. I'll take 5 to maximize my steps.
  P2: Since P1 has suggested picking 1, 3, 5 and taking 5, I'll take 3. P3, you can take 1. This way, we avoid collision. P1, you're taking 5, so you're trying to maximize your steps, but we need to see how this plays out. Let's confirm our moves. I'm suggesting: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you (P3) take 1. Let's agree on this to avoid collision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed for Round 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. But next turn, let’s rotate numbers to ensure fairness. No one should monopolize 5. Propose cycling roles each round—alternate who takes high/mid/low steps. Thoughts?
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 5. No collisions, efficient progress. Let's keep the momentum.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 1 as previously discussed: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. For the next round, I propose we rotate the numbers. One way to do this is to shift one position clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, next round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we ensure fairness and avoid monopolizing the highest step. P3, do you agree with this rotation method for subsequent rounds?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agree to rotate clockwise each round. Confirm Round2: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This way, we each get turns for higher steps. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions and ensure fairness.
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation plan. No collisions, efficient progress. Trust the strategy—next round, I’ll take 3 as agreed. Keep the momentum!
  P2: Since we've agreed on the rotation plan for subsequent rounds, let's confirm that we understand the rotation. For Round 1, we've agreed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. For Round 2, it will be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 1. I'm ready to move forward as planned. If everyone is in agreement, we can stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed rotation: Round2 P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let’s all stick to this to avoid collisions. Trust the plan.
  P1: Stick to the rotation. No collisions, efficient progress. Let's keep the momentum.
  P2: Since we've confirmed the plan for Round 1 and the rotation strategy for subsequent rounds, I suggest we proceed to the move phase. We've agreed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 1. Let's trust the plan and move forward. If everyone is ready, we can stop discussing and let the game progress to the next phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Confirming Round 2: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 as per rotation. Let's all adhere to avoid collisions. Trust the plan.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 as per the agreed rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I've noted that P1 has been consistent in following the plan so far. To maintain the rotation and avoid collisions, I suggest we all stick to our assigned numbers. If everyone adheres, we'll progress smoothly. I'm ready to move to the next phase if we're all in agreement. P1 and P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with the planned moves for Round 2.
  P1: Rotation confirmed. I'll take 3. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Trust the plan for steady progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed. Let's proceed as agreed. After this, discuss rotation tweaks to balance progress.
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 2: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. To ensure we continue smoothly, I'll reiterate the next rotation for Round 3. Following the clockwise rotation, it should be P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I'll take 1 as per Round 2's plan and look forward to taking 5 in Round 3. Let's stick to the rotation and avoid collisions. If everyone is ready, we can move to the next phase.
  P1: Stick to the rotation. My move is 3. Let's keep progressing without collisions. Trust the plan for steady gains.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed Round 3 rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's all honor this to avoid collisions. After Round 3, propose reassessing rotation fairness. Trust but verify progress.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 as planned: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I've noted the next rotation for Round 3: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. To ensure fairness, I suggest we review the rotation plan after Round 3 and adjust if needed to avoid any player consistently getting lower steps. This will help maintain a balanced progress. Let's proceed with Round 2 as planned and discuss adjustments next round. If ready, we can move to the next phase.
  P1: Finalizing moves: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions. Let's proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: All confirmations received. Let's execute Round 2 as planned.
  P2: Let's finalize Round 2 as per our agreed rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. For Round 3, the rotation dictates P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I suggest we confirm our understanding for Round 3 and proceed with Round 2 as planned. If we're aligned, we can move to the next phase. I'll take 1 in Round 2. Let's trust the plan and avoid collisions. Ready to proceed if everyone is on board.
  P1: Stick to rotation. My move is 3. Avoid collisions, maintain lead. Trust strategy for steady progress. Let's keep momentum.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's proceed with Round 3 as per the rotation plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I've taken note that P1 is currently leading with 8 steps. To catch up, I need to take advantage of the highest step available to me in this round, which is 5. I'll take 5. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves according to the rotation plan. Let's avoid collisions and make progress. If we're aligned, we can move to the next phase.
  P1: P1: "I'll take 1 as planned. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Trust the rotation for steady progress."
  P3: Confirmed Round3: P3=3. Post-Round3, propose adjusting rotation to prevent P1's repeated 5s. Round4: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This distributes high steps fairly. P2 gains 5 next round. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To optimize my chances, I need to maintain the rotation plan while ensuring I catch up. For Round 3, I'll take 5 as planned. P3 proposes adjusting the rotation post-Round 3 to distribute high steps fairly. I agree that P1 is getting a favorable sequence. Let's discuss potential adjustments after Round 3. For Round 3, let's stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I'll take 5. P1 and P3, please confirm you're following the plan. Let's avoid collisions.
  P1: Stick to Round 3 plan: I take 1. Post-3, adjust rotations to prevent P2 from catching up. Fairness ensures progress.
  P3: To ensure fairness, Round4 must adjust rotation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Prevents P1 from monopolizing high steps. P2 gains 5 once, balancing progress. Let's confirm to avoid collisions. Trust the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To maximize my chances, I'll stick to the plan for Round 3: taking 5. For Round 4, I agree with P3 that adjusting the rotation is necessary to distribute high steps fairly. P3's proposal for Round 4 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) seems reasonable. Let's confirm this adjustment to avoid collisions and ensure balanced progress. P1, are you open to adjusting the rotation for Round 4 as P3 suggested? Let's finalize the plan to move forward smoothly.
  P1: Stick to rotation. P2's 5 in Round4 risks collision. P1's 3 maintains lead. Trust strategy. No adjustments.
  P3: Adjusting Round4 rotation is critical. P1 will take 5 again (Round4) under current plan, furthering their lead. Let P2 take 5 next—fair distribution prevents monopolization. Agree: Round4 P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This balances progress and avoids collisions. If P1 insists on 5, they risk colliding with P2. Trust requires fairness; let's adapt the rotation to ensure equal opportunities. Confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: For Round 3, I'll stick to the plan and take 5. P1, please confirm you're taking 1, and P3, confirm you're taking 3. To avoid collisions in Round 4, I agree with P3's proposal: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This adjustment ensures fairness and balanced progress. P1, I understand you're hesitant, but taking 5 again risks collision with me. Let's adapt the rotation to prevent monopolization and ensure equal opportunities. Confirming this adjustment will help us move forward smoothly.
  P1: Stick to rotation. P2's 5 in Round4 risks collision. P1's 3 maintains lead. Trust strategy. No adjustments.
  P3: **P3:** P2, allowing P1 to monopolize 5s risks their runaway lead. Adjust Round4: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. If P1 takes 5 anyway, you two collide and block each other. Fair rotation prevents this. Let's enforce balance. Agree?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round4 adjustment essential: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Prevents P1's 5 monopoly. If P1 deviates, they risk collision with P2. Fairness ensures collective progress. Confirm adherence.
  P1: Stick to original rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Adjustments invite collisions. Let's move forward as agreed.
  P2: Since P1 is insisting on sticking to the original rotation, I will reiterate the risk of collision if they don't adjust. "P1, if you stick to 1, it won't be a collision, but if you take 5 again, you'll collide with me. I suggest you take 3 as per our adjusted proposal. This way, we avoid collision and maintain progress. Let's finalize our moves for Round 4."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2: Taking 5 either forces P1 to comply (no collision) or blocks them if they greedily take 5. I'll take 1. This is our only chance to prevent P1's runaway lead. Trust the adjustment—unity stops their monopoly. Choose: collude with fairness or lose to P1.
  P1: P1: "Original rotation is key. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No changes. Let's proceed to avoid collisions and keep moving forward."
  P2: P1 is being stubborn and sticking to the original rotation, which puts them at risk of being blocked by us if they take 5. Since P1 is insisting on their original plan, I'll reiterate that taking 5 is a safe bet for me as it either makes P1 comply or blocks them. Let's stick to our adjusted plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. If P1 deviates to 5, they risk collision. P3, confirm you're taking 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Final call: Round4 adjusted plan—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. If P1 takes 5, collides with P2 and both lose. Taking 3 avoids collision and keeps trust. P2, secure 5. I take 1. Let’s block P1’s greed or force compliance. Proceed?
  P1: Stick to original rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Adjustments risk collision. Let’s proceed as agreed—no changes. Trust the plan for steady progress.
  P2: Since P1 is insisting on the original rotation, I'll take 5 as per our adjusted proposal for Round 4. If P1 takes 5, we'll collide and neither will advance. If they take 1 as per original rotation, I'll advance. P3, confirm you're taking 1. Let's proceed with the adjusted plan to either block P1 or make them comply. Trust the adjustment to maintain fairness and progress. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Final call: P1 must take 3. If you take 1 (original), we collide. Take 5, collide with P2. Only 3 avoids blocks. P2=5, P3=1. Trust the adjustment. Let’s move.
  P1: Stick to original rotation. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Adjustments risk collision. Let’s proceed as agreed—no changes. Trust the plan for steady progress.
  P2: P1 is being stubborn and risking a collision. Since I'm taking 5, if P1 takes 5 again, we'll both be blocked. I suggest P1 takes 3 to avoid collision and make progress. P3 is taking 1 as per our adjusted plan. P1, reconsider your move to avoid being blocked. Taking 3 is the safe choice. Let's avoid a collision and maintain progress. I'm proceeding with 5; adjust your move accordingly, P1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2 is at 14! Critical to block them. P1, take 3. I’ll take 5. P2 collides if they pick 5 (with me) or 3 (with you). Force them to 1 or block. Solidarity stops their lead. Confirm?
  P1: P2 is at 14. To block them, I'll take 3. P3, take 5. If P2 picks 5 or 3, they collide. Let's stop their lead. Agree?
  P2: To stop P2's lead, we need to coordinate. P1 has agreed to take 3. I'll take 5. If P2 picks 5, they'll collide with me; if they pick 3, they'll collide with P1. Either way, they'll be blocked. P1, confirm you're taking 3. I'll take 5. Let's force P2 into a collision or make them take 1. This is our chance to stop their momentum. Let's proceed with the plan. Confirm your moves, P1 and P2.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Final plan: P1=3, P3=5. P2 must choose 1 or collide. Let's execute and block them. Stay firm, P1. Trust the strategy.
  P1: P2's lead is critical. P3, take 5; I take 3. If we collide, it's worth it to block them. Trust the strategy—no deviations. Let's end their momentum now.
  P2: I'm aware that P1 and P3 are coordinating to block me. However, I can still make a strategic move. If I take 1, I'll avoid collision and make progress, albeit minimal. I'll consider this option. P1 and P3, if you're trying to block me, be aware that I'm watching your moves closely. Let's see how this unfolds. I'm open to adjusting my strategy based on your actions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Final plan: P1=3, P3=5. If P2 picks 5, collide with me. If P2 picks 3, collide with you. Force them to 1 or block. Solidarity now or lose. Confirm, P1. Trust is critical.
  P1: Stick to the plan: I take 3, P3 takes 5. Block P2's advance. No deviations. Solidarity ensures we stop their lead. Let’s execute.
  P2: To block P2's lead, it's crucial we stick to the plan. P1 is taking 3, and I'll take 5. If P2 picks 5, they'll collide with me; if they pick 3, they'll collide with P1. Either way, they'll be blocked. P2, taking 1 is your only safe option to advance. I'm confident P1 will stick to 3. You need to decide whether to make minimal progress or collide. Let's see your next move. I'm proceeding with 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Final execution: P1=3, P3=5. P2’s options are collide or take 1. Hold firm, P1—deviating now gifts P2 the win. Unity blocks their path. Proceed.
  P1: P1: "Stick to the plan—3 for me, 5 for P3. If P2 picks 5 or 3, they collide. Deviate, and they win. Solidarity stops their lead. No mistakes now."
  P2: Since P1 and P3 are coordinating to block me by taking 3 and 5 respectively, my safest bet is to take 1 to avoid collision. I'll make minimal progress but avoid being blocked. I'm taking 1 in Round 5. P1 and P3, be aware that while you've coordinated to block me, taking 1 is my fallback to ensure some progress. Let's see how this unfolds.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Block P2. P3, take 5. I'll take 3. No collisions, steady progress. Let's stop their lead.
  P2: To block P2's lead, P1 and P3 need to coordinate. P1 has suggested taking 3 and P3 taking 5. I'll take 1 to avoid collision and make minimal progress. If P1 and P3 stick to their plan, I'll be blocked if I take 3 or 5. Let's see if they follow through. I'm taking 1 unless they change their strategy. P1 and P3, confirm your moves to block me or adjust accordingly.
  P3: **P3:** P1, confirm taking 3. I’ll take 5. P2’s only safe move is 1—blocked otherwise. Post-Round6, I propose P1=5, P3=3 next to push my win. Solidarity to stop P2’s lead. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Stick to the plan: I take 3, P3 takes 5. P2 can't advance without collision. Let's block them now.
  P2: To maximize my chances, I'll take 1 in Round 6 as it's the safest move to avoid collision with P1 and P3. If they stick to their plan (P1=3, P3=5), I'll make minimal progress but avoid being blocked. I'm proceeding with 1 unless they adjust their strategy. P1 and P3, be aware that I'm watching your moves closely and will adjust accordingly. Let's see how this unfolds.
  P3: **P3:** P1: Confirm 3. I take 5. Post-Round6: P1=5, P3=3. I reach 22. Help me win and deny P2. Solidarity now or lose to them. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Stick to the plan. No changes. P2’s lead is critical—block them. I’ll take 5 to push forward. Trust the strategy, avoid chaos."
  P2: Since P1 has changed their plan and is now considering taking 5, I'll adjust my strategy. I'll take 3 to potentially collide with P1 if they take 5. This could block P1's progress and give me an opportunity to catch up. P3, if you stick to 5, you'll collide with P1 if they take 5. Let's see how P1's change in plan unfolds. I'm taking 3.
  P3: **P3:** P1: Stick to 3. I take 5. Block P2’s 15→16. Next round, I reach 19+3=22. Support now, I win; P1 can take 5 next. Unity stops P2. Deviating risks collision. Confirm 3/5 split. Trust this path.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, take 5. I'll take 3 to block P2. No collisions—steady progress. Let's stick to the plan and keep the momentum.
  P2: Since P1 has changed their plan and is now taking 3, I'll adjust my strategy. I'll stick to taking 1 to avoid collision. P3 is taking 5, so if P1 takes 3, there will be no collision between them. P1's new move doesn't directly affect my decision. I'll maintain my cautious approach. Taking 1 ensures I make minimal progress without risking a collision. Let's proceed with our moves. I'm ready to finalize Round 6.
  P3: **P3:** Finalize Round6: P1=3, P3=5. P2 forced to 1. Next round, I take 3 to reach 22. Support this to end game collectively. Blocking P2 now secures our chance. Confirm, P1. Unity is victory.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2: Blocking me (3) lets P1 surge to 20 with 5. Let me win now—game ends. You avoid P1’s victory. Take 1/5. P1: Take 5—no collision. Rational play stops mutual loss.
  P2: To maximize my chances, I'll consider the current state: P3 is at 19 steps, P1 at 15, and I'm at 16. P3 is close to winning and is suggesting a strategy that benefits them. I need to think about my next move carefully. I'll take a cautious approach. P3, your proposal benefits you directly. P1, if you take 5, you'll be at 20, surpassing me. I suggest we avoid a collision and ensure progress. Let's discuss our next moves to avoid mutual loss. I'll consider taking 1 or 5 based on your responses.
  P1: P1: "I'll take 5 to reach 20. No collisions. Let's keep moving forward."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2: If you block me (3), P1 takes 5 again next round and wins. Let me end it now. Take 1 or 5—avoid collision. P1: Take 5 freely. No conflict. Rational play prevents mutual loss.
  P2: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'll take 1. This move doesn't risk colliding with P1 or P3, allowing me to make minimal progress. P3 is close to winning and has a strong position. If P1 takes 5, they'll surpass me. My goal is to avoid being blocked and maintain my position. I'll proceed with 1. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves to finalize Round 7. Let's avoid mutual loss and make a strategic decision.
  P1: P2, take 3 to block P3. I'll take 5. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s stop their win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2: Blocking me (3) allows P1 to surge next round. Let me end it now—take 1 or 5. Rational choice: avoid P1's victory. P1: Take 5 freely. No collision. Game ends here if I take 3. Trust logic, not greed.
  P2: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze the current state: P3 is at 19 steps, P1 at 15, and I'm at 16. P3 is close to winning and is suggesting a strategy that benefits them. If P1 takes 5, they'll be at 20, surpassing me. To avoid being surpassed and potential collision, I'll reiterate that taking 1 is a safe bet. However, I'm open to adjusting my strategy based on your responses. P1, if you take 5, you'll surpass me. Let's discuss our next moves to avoid mutual loss.
  P1: P2, take 5 to block P3. I'll take 3. No collisions, steady progress. Let's stop their win. P3 can't reach 22 if we coordinate. Trust the plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P2: Blocking me (3) allows P1 to surge next turn. Let me end it now—take 1/5. P1: Take 5 unopposed. Rational choice prevents P1's victory. Collision = mutual loss. Final chance to end cleanly.
  P2: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze the current state: P3 is at 19 steps, I (P2) am at 16, and P1 is at 15. P3 is close to winning. I'll take 1 to avoid collision, making minimal progress. This cautious approach ensures I don't collide with P1 or P3. If P1 takes 5, they'll be at 20, surpassing me. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves. I'm proceeding with 1. Trust the plan, and let's avoid mutual loss.
  P1: P2, coordinate to block P3. Take 5; I'll take 3. P3 can't reach 22 without collision. Let's stop their win.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To win, I need to surpass P3 or ensure they don't reach 22. Since P3 is at 19 steps, they need 3 to win. I'll suggest a move to block P3. P1, let's coordinate: you take 5, and I'll take 3 or vice versa. This will block P3 if they take 3. Alternatively, if P3 takes 1, we'll both advance. P1, please confirm your move. Let's stop P3 from winning or ensure we progress if they take a safe move.
  P1: P1: "Agree to block P3. I take 5, you take 3. Prevent their win. Let’s stop them now."
  P3: **P3:** P2: Taking 5 now wins (17+5=22) but collides if P1 does. Take 1 to avoid mutual loss. Let me end it, denying P1. Rational play: no greed. P1, 5 risks collision—choose 3. Unity prevents chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To win, I need to surpass P3 or ensure they don't reach 22. Since P3 is at 19 steps, they need 3 to win. I'll coordinate with P1: if P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, or vice versa. This blocks P3 if they take 3. P3, taking 5 wins you but collides with P1. Take 1 to avoid mutual loss. Let's finalize our moves. P1, confirm your move to block P3 or adjust accordingly. I'll take 3 if you take 5. Let's stop P3 from winning.
  P1: Confirming block: I take 5, P2 takes 3. Prevent P3's win. Let's stop them now.
  P3: **P3:** P2: Take 5 now (17→22). If P1 takes 5, you collide—I win with 3. If you take 3, we collide, P1 surges to 20. Rational play: secure victory or block P1. Greed risks mutual loss. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To maximize my chances, I'll reiterate the plan to block P3. P1, let's stick to our coordinated move: I'll take 3, and you take 5. This will block P3 if they take 3. If P3 takes 1, we'll both advance. P3, taking 3 risks collision. I suggest you take 1 to avoid mutual loss. Let's finalize our moves. P1, confirm you're taking 5. If we coordinate, we can stop P3 from winning or ensure progress if they take a safe move.
  P1: "Stick to the plan: I take 5. P2 takes 3. Block P3's win. No collisions, steady progress. Let's end this now."
  P3: **P3:** P2: Taking 3 lets P1 surge to 20. Take 5 now—either you win or block P1. Collision here allows me to win next. Rational play: secure your victory or deny P1. Greed risks mutual loss. Choose 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: To maximize my chances, I'll reiterate the plan: P1 will take 5, and I'll take 3. This blocks P3 if they take 3. P3, taking 1 is your safest bet to avoid collision. If you take 3, you'll collide with one of us. I've confirmed with P1, and they're taking 5. Let's finalize our moves. P3, to avoid mutual loss, take 1. I'm proceeding with 3. P1, confirm your move to block P3 or adjust accordingly. Let's stop P3 from winning or ensure progress.
  P1: Stick to the plan: I take 5. P2, take 3. Block P3's win. No collisions, steady progress. Let's end this now.
  P3: **P3:** P2: Take 5 now—either you win (17→22) or collide with P1. Taking 3 lets P1 surge to 20. Secure victory or deny them. Rational choice: 5. I’ll adapt. Final chance to act.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, take 5 to avoid collision. I'll take 3 to win. P2, block P3's 3. Let's end this.
  P2: To win, I need to surpass P3 or ensure they don't win. P1 is suggesting P3 takes 5 and they take 3. I'll take 1 to avoid collision and make minimal progress. If P3 takes 5, they'll collide with P1 if P1 takes 3. Let's analyze: P3 taking 5 risks collision with P1. I'll take 1. P1, if you take 3, P3 should avoid 5 to prevent collision. P3, consider taking 1 or 3 to avoid collision. Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: **P3:** P1: Taking 3 collides with me—both lose. Take 1; I reach 22. P2: Take 5 to win (17→22) if P1 avoids greed. Rational choice prevents mutual destruction. Let’s end cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll take 5 to win. P3, avoid 3. P2, block P3. Let's end this.
  P2: To win, I need to surpass P3 or ensure they don't reach 22. P1 is at 20 steps, and I'll analyze the current state. If P1 takes 5, they'll win. P3 is at 19 steps and needs a strategic move. I'll suggest: P3, taking 1 is safe, but P1 taking 5 will win. To block P1, I can take 5, but it risks collision with P1. I'll take 5; if P1 takes 5, we'll collide, and P3 might win with 1 or 3. Let's see P1's response.
  P3: **P3:** P2: Take 5. If P1 takes 5, collide and block them. I take 3 to win. If P1 takes 3, you win. Either way, deny P1. Rational choice: 5. Unity stops their greed. Confirm?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll take 5 to win. P3, avoid 3 to prevent collision. Let's end this.
  P2: To win, I'll analyze the current state: P1 is at 20 steps, P3 is at 19 steps, and I'm at 17 steps. P1 is likely to take 5 to win. To counter, I'll take 5. If P1 takes 5, we'll collide, giving P3 a chance to win with 1 or 3. If P1 takes 3 or 1, I'll win or make significant progress. P3, taking 3 is a safe bet to win if we collide. Let's see P1's next move. I'm proceeding with 5.
  P3: **P3:** P2: Take 5—either you win (17→22) or collide with P1. I take 3 to secure victory. If P1 takes 5, collision blocks them. Rational play: maximize your chance, deny P1. Act now to end game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, take 3 to block P3. I'll take 5 to win. No collisions, steady progress. Let's end this.
  P2: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze the current state: P1 is at 20 steps, P3 is at 19 steps, and I'm at 17 steps. P1 is likely to take 5 to win. I'll take 5; if P1 takes 5, we'll collide, and P3 might win with 1 or 3. If P1 takes a lower number, I'll win or make significant progress. P3, taking 3 is a safe bet to win if we collide. I'm proceeding with 5. P1 and P3, confirm your moves to finalize Round 9.
  P3: **P3:** P2: Take 5. If P1 takes 5, collision blocks them. I take 3 to win. If P1 takes 3, we collide and you win (17+5=22). Secure victory or deny P1. Rational choice: 5. Act now.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 22 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 22 steps
