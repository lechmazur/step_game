Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, P3 choose 5 this round?
  P3: I don't trust coordinating openly like this - it gives others too much information. I'll make my own choice. Let's just play and see what happens.
  P1: Alright, let's try P2's plan. I'll choose 1. P3, your move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, even if you don't trust open coordination in general, P1 has already agreed to choose 1.  If you choose 5 and I choose 3, we can all make progress this round and avoid collision.  It's just for this first round to get us started. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the attempt at coordination, but I prefer to keep my strategy private. I'll make my own decision in the move phase.
  P1: P3, choosing 5 ensures all of us move this turn. Since I’m committed to 1 and P2 to 3, your cooperation avoids a collision. Let’s prioritize progress over secrecy—stalemates benefit no one.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand you value privacy, but for this first round, choosing 5 guarantees everyone progresses. Think of it as a free, guaranteed move to get us all started. Just for this first turn?
  P3: 
  P1: Alright, P3, this is our last chance to align. Choosing 5 ensures your progress too. I’ll stick to 1. Let’s avoid collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 2, good progress last round. To keep moving, let's aim for different numbers again. P1 consider 1, P3 consider 5, I'll take 3. Let's keep advancing.
  P3: Thanks for the suggestion P2, but I won't commit to any specific number this time. Last round's coordination worked, but we're all competitors here. I'll make my choice independently in the move phase.
  P1: P3, while I respect your independence, choosing 5 again would let all of us advance safely. P2 and I can take 1 and 3 respectively. Stalemates risk letting someone else surge ahead—let’s keep momentum. P2, agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Yes P1, I agree. Let's aim for those numbers again this round to keep the progress going.  Hopefully P3 will see the benefit of consistent advancement too.
  P3: I understand you want predictability, but that makes the game too deterministic. We're all close in position - let's each take our chances and play strategically. I'll make my own choice.
  P1: P3, continuing the pattern lets you surge ahead safely. I’ll stay at 1, P2 at 3—your 5 secures 10 steps by Round 2. Collisions risk stagnation, especially with us clustered close. Let’s avoid that. Final chance to align before we decide.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, even if you don't want to coordinate, choosing 5 is still your best move to guarantee progress this round. P1 is taking 1, I'm taking 3.  Choosing 5 lets you move forward without risk of collision.  It's a free 5 steps for you. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate your persistent attempts to coordinate, but I need to play my own strategy to maximize my chances of winning. I'll make my choice in the move phase.
  P1: P3, choosing 5 again secures your progress without risk. We’ll hold at 1 and 3, letting you safely reach 10. Collisions could undo your lead—why gamble? Let’s advance steadily. This isn’t about trust; it’s basic self-preservation.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, last round collision hurt us. Let's switch numbers. P1, pick 5, I'll pick 3 this round?
  P1: P2, your last-minute switch to 5 caused our collision. Let’s revert to the original plan: I’ll take 1, you take 3, and urge P3 to stick with 5 again. Stability is key—fluctuations risk collisions. P3, if you choose 1 or 3 now, you’d block your own progress. Taking 5 lets all of us advance safely. This isn’t about trust—it’s basic arithmetic. Let’s avoid another stalemate.
  P3: I'm in the lead now and plan to stay there. Your coordination attempts failed last round when P2 switched at the last moment. This shows why open coordination isn't reliable. I'll continue making independent choices to maximize my chances of winning.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration, but repeating last round's plan is risky given P3's reaction and last round's collision. Let's try switching numbers this round to increase our chances of progress. How about you choose 5, I choose 3? P3 seems unlikely to pick 5 again after colliding last round.
  P1: P2, reverting to the original plan minimizes collision risk. Let me take 1, you take 3, and urge P3 to stick with 5. This guarantees progress for all. P3, your 5 keeps you ahead safely—collisions could let us close the gap. Let’s avoid mistakes from last round.
  P3: I have a solid lead and plan to maintain it. P2's sudden switch last round shows why coordination attempts can backfire. I'll continue making my own strategic choices to secure my advantage.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, sorry about last round's confusion - my fault. Let's try this: you take 5, I'll stick with 3. P3, even if you're playing solo, please consider avoiding 3 or 5 this round, as P1 and I are discussing those.  Let's try to all make progress this round and avoid another collision.
  P1: P2, let’s return to the original plan: I’ll take 1, you 3. P3, choosing 5 again ensures your safe progress to 10. Collisions could jeopardize your lead—cooperation benefits all. Let’s avoid last round’s mistake and advance together.
  P3: I understand both of your positions, but as the current leader, I have no incentive to reveal or coordinate my moves. I'll continue playing strategically to maintain my advantage.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 and I are tied at 8 steps, I need to be strategic about my next move. I won't reveal my plans, but I suggest you both consider your positions carefully - a wrong move could put you far behind.
  P2: P1, P3 is right, we need to be strategic.  To avoid another collision like Round 2, how about we try different numbers again?  P1, if you pick 1, I'll pick 5. This way at least two of us should move forward, and hopefully all three if P3 picks 3. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I'll go with 1. Let's hope P3 picks 3 so all can move. Collisions only slow us down—safety first. Need to keep advancing!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see no reason to reveal my plans when I'm tied for the lead. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance of winning.
  P2: Okay P1, I'm sticking with 5 as discussed. P3, to maximize your own chances of moving ahead while P1 and I coordinate, choosing 3 might be a good option for you this round.  Just a thought to consider.
  P1: P3, choosing 3 secures your move while avoiding a collision with P2’s 5. Let’s prioritize progress: I’ll stay at 1, P2 takes 5, and you pick 3. This way all of us advance safely—collisions only help the trailing player.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand your suggestions, but as a co-leader, I need to play to win, not just advance. Your coordination attempts won't influence my decision. I'll make my choice in the move phase.
  P2: P3, P1 is taking 1, and I'm taking 5. If you pick 3, we all move forward this round.  Otherwise, you risk colliding with either of us and staying at 8 steps.  Choosing 3 is a guaranteed move for you this round.
  P1: P3, choosing 3 secures your progress to 11. P2 and I are set on 5 and 1. Colliding risks stagnation. Let’s all move forward. Final chance to align!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, your collision last round kept you at 8. This round, pick different numbers so we can all progress. Let’s not repeat that mistake.
  P3: As co-leader with P2, I need to be smart about my moves. While P1 suggests avoiding collisions, I have to play to win, not just for group progress. I'll continue making independent decisions based on game theory and positioning.
  P2: P3, since we collided on 5 last round, I'm considering switching to 3 this round to avoid another collision between us. What do you think?  P1, are you sticking with 1 again?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'll stick with **1** again. P3, if you take **5**, and P2 takes **3**, we all advance without collision. Collisions keep you stagnant—your best move is **5** to surge ahead. Let’s avoid repeats of last round’s stalemate. P2, confirm **3**?
  P3: I notice P2 is suggesting they'll take 3 while P1 commits to 1. While you both want me to take 5, I have to consider all possibilities. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance of taking the lead.
  P2: P3, since P1 is taking 1, to avoid another collision between us and ensure at least one of us moves ahead, I will choose 3. Would you consider choosing 5 this round? This way we both make progress and move ahead of P1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, choosing 5 secures your advancement to 13 while P2 takes 3 and I stay at 1. Colliding again leaves you stagnant at 8—risky with me closing slowly but steadily. Let’s prioritize progress over stubbornness. 1, 3, 5 guarantees all of us move. Final plea: cooperate to eliminate stalemates.
  P3: I understand the suggested coordination, but as I'm tied for the lead, I need to play strategically to win outright. I'll make my choice independently in the move phase.
  P2: P3, I'm confirming I will choose 3 as discussed to avoid colliding with you again. P1 is taking 1. Choosing 5 is a guaranteed move for you this round and will put you ahead of both of us. It's a safe way to maximize your lead. Please consider choosing 5 to ensure your progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, to break our collision cycle with P3, I'm going to switch to 3 this round.  P3, since I'm moving to 3, maybe consider 5 or even 1 this round to ensure you also make progress. Let's try to all move forward this turn.
  P3: I see P2 plans to take 3. While you suggest I take 5 or 1, I need to play strategically to break this tie and take the lead. I'll make my choice independently in the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3: Another collision between you two risks keeping you both at 8 while I creep closer. P2 proposed switching to 3 – if you both take **3 & 5** this round, you’ll both advance. P3, your 5 would reach 13, P2’s 3 gets 11, and I’ll stay on 1 for 6 total. Cooperation here secures progress for all – don’t let stubbornness cost your lead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, to be clear, I am choosing 3 this round. P1 is choosing 1. If you choose 5, you will move to 13 steps and take the lead.  This is a guaranteed move for you.  Please consider taking 5.
  P3: I understand P2 is committing to 3 and P1 to 1. While you want me to take 5, I need to consider all options that maximize my chances of winning. I'll make my choice independently in the move phase.
  P1: P3, P2 is confirmed on 3. Choosing 5 guarantees you advance to **13** while P2 reaches 11. I’ll stay on 1, leaving **no collision risks** for you. Stagnation at 8 risks my gradual catch-up. Secure your lead—**5 is your safest, highest-reward choice** this round. Don’t let indecision let P2 tie you again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I've confirmed I'm choosing 3, and P1 is on 1.  Another collision between us helps neither of us.  Choosing 5 is still your best move to guarantee progress and take a clear lead.  It avoids collision and maximizes your steps forward this round.
  P3: I appreciate both of your consistent messaging, but as we're tied for the lead, I need to make the choice that gives me the best chance of winning outright. I'll carefully consider the game state and make my decision in the move phase.
  P1: P3, your best move is **5**. P2 confirmed 3, I’m on 1. Choosing 5 lets you surge to **13**—a commanding lead. Colliding with P2 at 3 or me at 1 keeps you stuck at 8. Letting us advance helps you isolate us. Prioritize your lead: **5 is safe and optimal.** Don’t let hesitation let P2 tie you again.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2/P3, another 5 collision keeps you both at 8 while I approach. Let’s split: P2 take 3, P3 take 5, I stay on 1. This lets you both advance (11/13 vs my 7) and avoid stalemate. Stagnation risks my gradual catch-up - cooperation now secures your lead. Final plea before decisions: prioritize progress over collision.
  P2: P1, that sounds good. I'll take 3 this round. P3, to avoid another collision and actually make progress, please consider taking 5 as P1 suggested. This way we can all move forward.
  P3: I understand you both want me to take 5 while P2 takes 3, but our collision pattern shows coordination attempts aren't reliable. P2 has switched from promised moves before. As co-leader, I need to play strategically to win outright. I'll make my choice independently.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 confirmed **3**, so **5** is your guaranteed path to 13. Colliding again leaves you at 8 while I inch closer. Your best move is clear: **5** secures dominance, avoids stalemate, and maximizes your lead. Don’t let hesitation let P2 tie you again—act decisively.
  P2: P3, I've confirmed I'm taking 3, as P1 suggested.  To finally break free from this 8-step tie, please choose 5 this round.  P1 is on 1, I'm on 3 - 5 is clear for you and guarantees you'll reach 13 steps and take a clear lead.  Let's both progress and avoid another collision that benefits only P1.
  P3: I see your consistent messaging about taking 3 and 1. While you want me to commit to 5, the history of this game shows promises aren't always kept. I'm carefully weighing all options to break this tie in my favor. I'll make my choice in the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, another collision leaves you tied with P2, but taking **5** lets you break free to **13** while P2 moves to **11**. P2 confirmed they’ll take **3** this time—trust their commitment to end our stalemate. Stagnation at 8 risks my slow advance (I’ll hit 7), but your **5** secures a commanding lead. P2’s prior misstep cost them—don’t let their error cost you your chance to surge ahead. This is your move to win.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about coordination reliability given last round. But I *am* taking 3 this round, and P1 is on 1.  Choosing 5 is a guaranteed way for you to break the tie and take a clear lead to 13.  It's your best move to win from here.
  P3: I see you're both being very consistent this round about P2 taking 3 and P1 taking 1. While you make logical arguments for me to take 5, I need to consider all possibilities that could give me an outright win. I'll make my final decision in the move phase based on game theory and positioning.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As the clear leader now, I aim to maintain and extend my advantage. I'll continue making independent moves based on positioning and game theory rather than coordination attempts. Let's all play strategically from here.
  P1: P2, let’s avoid collisions that favor P3. I’ll take 3 this round. If you pick 1 and P3 takes 5, we all advance safely: you to 12, me to 10, and P3 to 18. P3, this keeps your lead while we close the gap. Final chance to align before moving!
  P2: P1, to try and catch P3, how about we both choose 5 this round?  If P3 also picks 5, we at least stop P3 from advancing further. If P3 chooses 1 or 3, we both gain ground on P3. What do you think of this approach?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Interesting suggestion P2, but coordinating against the leader won't work - I've consistently shown I'll play unpredictably. With my 5-step lead over P1 and 2-step lead over P2, I'll continue making independent choices to secure my victory. Your coordination attempts haven't succeeded before and won't now.
  P1: P2, coordinating on 5 risks P3 switching to 3 and surging to 16 while we collide. Let’s split to 1 and 3 instead. I’ll take 1, you take 3. This way, if P3 sticks to 5 (likely), we all advance safely: you reach 14, me 8, P3 18. If they deviate, their progress is minimized. This strategy keeps pressure on P3 without risking mutual collision. P3, your move choice will determine your next step—don’t let our split play cost you momentum.
  P2: P1, I agree with trying to catch P3.  Let's both choose 5 this round. If P3 also picks 5, we neutralize their lead. If P3 picks 1 or 3, we both gain ground and put pressure on P3.  It's a risk, but worth it to shift the game. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice P1 and P2 are considering coordinating against me. But with my lead, I can afford to be unpredictable - your attempts to corner me into specific moves won't work. I'll continue making independent choices to secure my win.
  P1: P2, let’s split: I’ll take **3**, you pick **1**. This forces P3 to choose 5 to advance, letting all move safely. If P3 deviates, they risk collision. Meanwhile, I’ll jump to **10**, you to **12**, pressuring their lead. P3, overconfidence is dangerous—your 5-step edge won’t last if you collide. Prioritize progress over ego.
  P2: P1, I know you suggested 3, but I still think both of us choosing 5 is the best way to challenge P3's lead. If P3 also picks 5, we at least neutralize their advance. If P3 picks 1 or 3, we gain ground. Let's both go for 5 this round to put pressure on P3 and potentially close the gap. What do you think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's try to coordinate this round to make sure at least two of us progress. How about you pick 1, and I will pick 5? P3, to avoid colliding with either of us, perhaps consider choosing 3 this round? Let's aim for progress for everyone if possible.
  P3: As the player in second place, I need to catch up to P2 while staying ahead of P1. Your coordination suggestions are noted, but I'll continue making independent choices to maximize my chances of winning. I won't reveal my plans.
  P1: P2, don’t risk an easy win by choosing 5. Let’s split to **1 and 3**: I’ll take 3 (reach 10), you pick 1 (reach 17). P3, take 5 to jump to 18. This keeps us all in contention—no one surges too far ahead. Collisions only help the trailing player, and I’m still in this. Final plea: avoid handing P2 a near-certain victory.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, as I'm closer to winning, I need to maximize my move this round. I'm choosing 5. P3, to ensure you also progress and don't collide with me, perhaps consider picking 3 or 1 this round? Let's all aim to make progress.
  P3: I see P2 is committed to taking 5, which would put them at 21 steps - dangerously close to winning. P1 and P2, your transparent coordination makes my choice easier. I'll play to prevent P2's victory while maintaining my second place position. My move will be strategic and independent.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 now, you can stop P2's advance to 21. I'll take 3 to reach 10. Let's block their path and keep the lead contested!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, since I'm planning to choose 3 to progress, would you consider picking 1 or 5 this round to avoid collision? P3, knowing I'm likely picking 3, perhaps choosing 1 or 5 would be beneficial for you to ensure your own progress as well. Let's aim for a round where everyone advances.
  P3: P2 just changed their claim from 5 to 3, which demonstrates exactly why coordination attempts can't be trusted. I'll make my move based on preventing P2 from reaching 21 steps while maintaining my position ahead of P1.
  P1: P3, let’s stop P2’s advance! If you take5 (to reach18), I’ll pick3 (to 10). That blocks P2’s 5, forcing them to choose1/3. We both gain while slowing their path to victory. Don’t let them reach21 this round!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your 16 puts you one 5 away from 21. I’ll mirror your choice to block your path—pick 5, I’ll pick 5; choose 3, I’ll follow. You can’t advance without collision. P3, join us in trapping P2 here. If we all pick 5, you stay at 13 but stop their momentum. Next round, we’ll surge while they’re stuck. Don’t let them near victory unopposed.
  P2: P1, I understand your attempt to block, but I'm still aiming to progress. P3, even if P1 mirrors me, choosing 3 or 1 will let you advance while we potentially collide.  Consider taking 3 to reach 16, putting pressure on both of us.  My move will be strategic to maximize my progress.
  P3: I see P1 wants to block P2 by mirroring their move, while P2 suggests I take 3. As second place with 13 steps, I need to prevent P2 from reaching 21 while staying ahead of P1. I'll continue making independent choices based on positioning and game theory. Your coordination attempts won't influence my decision.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your 16 is precarious—P3 and I can trap you if we both pick 5 again. Instead, I’ll take **3** to reach 10, leaving 5 open for you to safely jump to 21. P3, if you pick **1**, we all advance without collision: you to 14, me to 10, and P2 to 21. Next round, we’ll block his final push. Let’s split to 3/1/5 this round—no one gets stuck.
  P2: Okay P1, your split of 3, 5, 1 sounds reasonable for this round to ensure progress for everyone. P3, to guarantee your own move and avoid collision, choosing 1 as P1 suggested could be a good option.  Let's all make progress this round.
  P3: I notice P1 has switched from threatening to block P2 with 5, to suggesting a coordinated 3/1/5 split. This inconsistency, combined with P2's quick agreement, makes me suspicious. As second place, I need to prevent P2 from reaching 21 while maintaining my lead over P1. I'll make my choice independently in the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your 16 puts you one 5 away from 21—but P3 and I can trap you here. If both of us pick **5**, your path is blocked. Next round, you’ll be stuck while we advance. P3, joining me on **5** secures your progress to 18 *and* halts P2’s momentum. Don’t let them near victory unopposed. P2’s final push depends on others’ inaction—let’s not oblige.
  P2: P3, P1 is clearly trying to use you to block me.  Don't fall for it. If you pick 3 or 1, you guarantee your own progress and stay ahead of P1.  I will choose 5 to try and win.  If you block me with 5, you only help P1.  Let's both move forward and ignore P1's blocking attempt.
  P3: P2's plea to ignore P1's blocking strategy is self-serving - they want a clear path to 21 steps. As second place, I need to prevent P2's victory while staying ahead of P1. Your transparent attempts at coordination and changing strategies only make my decision clearer. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, to let you win properly, take **3** this round to reach 19. I’ll stay on **1** (to 8), and P3 can take **5** to 18. This way, all advance without collision. Next round, you can safely pick **5** to hit 24 and win outright. P3, this keeps you ahead of me while enabling P2’s victory path. Let’s avoid another stalemate.
  P2: P1, your plan for 3, 1, 5 is reasonable for guaranteed progress.  However, I'm very close to winning.  To maximize my chances, I'm inclined to choose 5 this round to reach 21 steps. P3, what move are you considering?  Understanding your plan will help me decide my best move this round.
  P3: As second place with 13 steps, I need to prevent P2 from reaching 21 while maintaining my lead over P1. Neither P1's coordinated plan nor P2's attempt to gauge my move will influence my strategy. I'll continue making independent choices to maximize my winning chances.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, don’t let P2 steal victory! If you take **5**, I’ll stay on **1**—we’ll trap P2 here if they pick **5**. Your move to **18** blocks their path to 21 while keeping me stagnant. Next round, I’ll surge while they’re stuck. P2’s lone 5 is a trap—collide them now before they escape!
  P2: P3, don't fall for P1's obvious trap. P1 wants you to block me so P1 can catch up to both of us. If you pick 5 to block me, you and I both stay still, and P1 gets closer. Choose 3 or 1 to guarantee your own progress and stay ahead of P1. I am going for 5 to win if possible. Your best move is to ignore P1's block and move forward yourself.
  P3: I see P2 is openly going for 5 to reach 21, while P1 wants me to block them. As second place, blocking P2's victory path serves my interests better than letting them potentially win. P1's cooperation won't affect my strategy - I'll play to maximize my chances of winning from my current position.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finally advance without collisions. I’ll take **1** (→8). If P2 picks **3** (→19) and P3 takes **5** (→18), all move forward. This lets P2 safely win next round with **5**, while P3 stays ahead of me. Collisions only help me close the gap—cooperate to secure your leads!
  P2: P3, don't fall for P1's block.  P1 is far behind and wants to slow us both down. If you block me, you also stay still, and P1 benefits.  Focus on your own progress and staying ahead of P1.  Choosing 3 or 1 lets you move forward. Don't let P1 manipulate you. Let's both move forward this round.
  P3: I see P2 keeps trying to dissuade me from blocking their path to victory, while P1 encourages blocking. As second place, preventing P2 from reaching 21 is clearly in my best interest - if they win, I lose. Your attempts to sway my decision only make my strategic priorities clearer. I'll make my choice in the move phase.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let’s stop P2’s final push! I’ll take **3** (→13). You take **5** (→18). If P2 picks **5**, they collide with you. If they pick **3**, I block them. Either way, they stay at 16 while you surge ahead. This keeps me behind and denies P2 their path to 21. Let’s collaborate to eliminate their winning chance.
  P2: P3, don't fall for P1's block. P1 is far behind and wants to slow us both down. If you block me, you also stay still, and P1 benefits. Focus on your own progress and staying ahead of P1. Choose 3 or 1 to move forward. Don't let P1 manipulate you.
  P3: As second place, I need to prevent P2 from winning while staying ahead of P1. P2's plea to ignore blocking attempts is clearly self-serving - if they win, we both lose. I'll continue making independent moves based on positioning and game theory to maximize my chances of winning from here.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, stick with **5** to block P2's path to 21. I'll take **1**, advancing to 11. This keeps you ahead and denies P2's critical progress. Don’t let their manipulation sway you—collide them again!
  P2: P3, despite P1's block attempts, I am still aiming for 21 this round. However, to ensure at least *one* of us progresses, and avoid helping P1 close the gap, would you consider choosing 1 or 3?  If you choose 5 to block me, we both stay still and P1 benefits. Let's both move forward if possible.
  P3: I notice P2 keeps suggesting I take 1 or 3 to "ensure progress," but that would clear their path to 21 steps and potential victory. As second place, my priority must be preventing P2 from winning while staying ahead of P1. Your transparent attempts to avoid collision won't influence my strategy. I'll make my choice independently.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, this is your chance to secure victory. If you take **5**, I'll pick **3** (→13). This blocks P2's path to 21: they must choose **1** (→17) or risk collision. We split the board—your 18 vs my 13—while P2 stagnates. Next round, you can finish them. Don’t let P2’s manipulation sway you—collide them now!
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to manipulate you into blocking me, which helps P1.  If you block me with 5, we both stay still and P1 benefits.  To win, you need to progress too.  Please choose 1 or 3 to move forward and stay ahead of P1.  I am still going for 5 to try and win this round.
  P3: I see P2 is determined to reach 21 steps with a 5, while P1 wants me to block them. As second place, preventing P2's victory is my clear priority - if they win, I lose. Your transparent attempts to influence my decision only reinforce my strategy. I'll choose based on what gives me the best chance to win from here.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let’s stop P2’s final push. If you take **5** to block their path to 21, I’ll pick **3** to reach 16. This traps P2 at 16 while advancing us both. You’ll surge to 18, I’ll challenge P2’s position, and their victory route is shut down. Collide them now—don’t let them escape to 21 unopposed!
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to trick you into blocking me, but that helps P1 catch up to both of us. If you block me, we both stay still while P1 progresses.  Don't fall for P1's manipulation. Choose 3 or 1 to move forward yourself and stay ahead of P1. I am still going for 5 to try and win this round.
  P3: As co-leader with P1 at 13 steps, and P2 at 16, I need to prevent P2 from reaching 21 while competing with P1 for the win. P2's suggestion that blocking them "helps P1" ignores that letting them win guarantees we both lose. I'll continue making strategic choices to maximize my winning chances from this position.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, let's split to block P2! I’ll take **3** (→16), you take **5** (→18). This traps P2 at 16: if they pick **5**, they collide with you; if they pick **3**, I block them. We both advance while denying their path to 21. Don’t let P2’s victory slip through—secure our positions now.
  P2: P3, blocking me with 5 only helps P1, who is further behind both of us. If we collide, P1 gains ground while we stagnate.  Choosing 3 or 1 lets you progress and maintain your lead over P1.  I am going for 5 to win, but blocking me benefits P1, not you.  Think about your own win, not helping P1.
  P3: Your arguments are both transparent - P2 wants me to clear their path to victory, while P1 wants to block P2 together. As co-leader with P1, and with P2 at 16 steps, my priority is clear: prevent P2 from winning while competing for victory myself. I'll make my move based on maximizing my chances to win from this position.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let’s split to block P2’s path! I’ll take **3** to reach 16, creating a tie with P2. You take **5** to surge to **18**, leaving P2 stuck on 16 if they choose 5. This guarantees both of us advance while denying P2 their critical 21-step leap. Colliding P2 now secures our positions and keeps their victory out of reach. P1’s move is clear—your move decides whether we shut them down or let them win.
  P2: P3, you've said preventing my win is your priority, but blocking me with 5 also blocks you and helps P1 close the gap.  If we both collide, P1 benefits.  Choosing 3 or 1 lets you progress and maintain your lead over P1 while I still aim for 5.  Blocking me doesn't guarantee *your* win, it just helps P1.  Consider your own progress this round.
  P3: I see clearly through both strategies - P2 wants me to clear their path to victory while P1 wants to block P2 together. As co-leader with P1, my priority is stopping P2 from winning while maximizing my own chances. Your attempts to influence my decision only make the optimal choice more obvious. I'll play to win from this position.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's split to advance together: I’ll take **1** (→17), you pick **3** (→19). P3, choosing **5** lets you jump to **18** safely. Collisions only delay us all—prioritize progress over conflict. This keeps pressure on while moving closer to victory. Don’t let hesitation cost us momentum.
  P2: P1, your split of 1, 3, 5 sounds good for guaranteed progress this round. P3, agreeing to 5 means we all move forward and avoid another collision. Let's aim for progress for everyone this round.
  P3: As co-leader at 16 steps with P1 and P2, I need to play strategically to secure an outright win. Your suggestions for coordinated moves are noted, but I'll continue making independent choices based on positioning and game theory. My previous successful blocking moves demonstrate why I shouldn't reveal or coordinate my strategy.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, trust our split! P2 confirmed 3, I’ll stay on 1. Choosing 5 lets you surge to 18 safely. Colliding with us or picking lower risks falling further behind. This is your chance to leap ahead—prioritize progress now!
  P2: P3, P1's suggestion of 5 for you, 3 for me, and 1 for P1 makes sense for guaranteed progress.  It avoids collision and keeps us all moving forward.  Let's aim for a round where everyone advances and re-evaluate next turn.  Agreeing to this split ensures we all make progress this round.
  P3: I see P1 and P2 suddenly agreeing on a coordinated split after being tied with me at 16 steps. This convenient cooperation seems designed to ensure they both advance ahead of me. As co-leader, I need to prevent either from gaining an advantage while maximizing my own chances to win. I'll make my move independently based on what gives me the best winning opportunity from this position.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, the split (1/3/5) is your only path to 18 steps. If you reject it, P2 risks another 5, forcing me to block and leaving you stuck at 13. Your move to 18 keeps you in contention while advancing all of us. Trust this—collisions only benefit the trailing player (me), not you. Choose 5 now.
  P2: P3, we understand your caution, but this 1/3/5 split is genuinely beneficial for all of us *this round*. You get to 18, ahead of both of us.  Blocking me again only stagnates you too, and P1 benefits.  Guaranteed progress now, then we reassess next turn.  Let's all move forward this round.
  P3: I notice you're both pushing hard for a 1/3/5 split now that you're tied at 16 steps. But letting either of you advance ahead of me at this critical point would be a mistake. As we've seen in previous rounds, your coordination attempts often mask strategic plays. I'll make my choice independently to maximize my chances of winning from my current position.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's try a guaranteed progress round. P1, please pick 1. I will choose 3. P3, choosing 5 will ensure you also move forward to 18. This way, we all progress and avoid another collision. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal lets you leap to 19 while I lag at 18. Let’s flip the split for fairness: **I take 3 (→20), you take 1 (→17), and P3 picks 5 (→18).** This keeps *me* in the lead while advancing all. P3, your 5 ensures you leapfrog P2 without enabling their dangerous proximity to 23. Collusion risks letting one of us escape—let’s spread the pressure.
  P3: As the player furthest behind, I need to prevent either of you from getting too close to victory. P2's suggestion for me to take 5 and P1's counter-proposal both seem designed to advance their own positions. I'll continue making independent choices based on what gives me the best chance to win from 13 steps. Your coordination attempts won't influence my strategy.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, to clarify my proposal: I will choose 3. P3, please choose 5 to reach 18. P1, choosing 1 will let you also progress to 18 and avoid collision. This way we all move forward and no one is blocked.
  P1: P3, your best move is **5** to block P2's critical path to 21. I'll take **3** to reach **20**, putting me one move away from victory. P2 choosing **5** collides with you, halting their advance. If you take **5**, we both pressure P2 while advancing. This leaves me in prime position to finish next round. Collisions only delay P2 temporarily, but my 20-step lead ensures I win next turn unless blocked. Let’s act decisively.
  P3: I see P1 and P2 are both trying to coordinate moves that would put them dangerously close to winning. As the player furthest behind, I can't allow either of you to reach 20+ steps. Your transparent attempts to advance while keeping me at a safe distance won't work. I'll make my move based on preventing either of you from securing an easy victory path.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you keep saying you want to prevent others from winning. Blocking me with 5 helps P1 get closer to victory. If we collide, P1 advances while we stagnate. Choose 3 or 1 to progress yourself and stay ahead of P1. Don't let P1 use you to block me; focus on your own win. I'm still going for 5.
  P1: P3, pick **1** to advance to 14. I’ll take **5** to surge to **22**, putting me one move from victory. P2, if you choose **3** (→19), we all progress without collision. This spreads pressure: you stay behind me, P3 advances safely, and I’m poised to win next round. Don’t let P2’s 5 risk a collision that benefits no one. Prioritize progress—**1/5/3** secures all our forward momentum.
  P3: I see P1 just changed their suggestion from taking 3 to taking 5, while P2 claims they'll take 5. As the player furthest behind, I can't let either of you surge ahead to potential victory. Your changing strategies and coordination attempts only make my priorities clearer. I'll make my move based on preventing either of you from securing a winning position.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1 is at 20 and is very close to winning. To prevent P1 from winning this round, I will choose 3 to try to block them.  If you choose 5, you will move to 18 and maintain your lead over me.  Let's coordinate to stop P1 and ensure at least one of us progresses.
  P1: P2, your 3 risks collision and stalemate. If I also pick 3, neither of us advances—leaving me at 20 *and* you at 16. Choose 5 to reach 21 while I take **1** (→21). P3, pick **3** to safely advance to 16. Let’s end this cleanly without wasted moves.
  P3: I see P1 is at 20 steps and P2 at 16, while I'm at 13. With P1 so close to winning, and P2 suggesting we coordinate to block them, the situation is critical. However, I need to consider both preventing P1's victory and my own path to winning. Your suggestions for coordinated moves won't influence my strategy - I'll continue making independent choices based on positioning and game theory.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1 is at 20 and threatening to win next round.  To prevent P1 from winning, you need to block them.  If P1 picks 5 to win, you should also pick 5 to collide.  I will choose 1 this round to ensure I also progress and avoid collision with either of you. Let's prioritize stopping P1 from reaching 23.
  P1: P2, if you block me with 3, P3 advances to 16 unopposed. P3, same risk if you pick 3—P2 jumps to 19. Let’s all progress: I’ll take **3** to win at 23. You both pick **1/5** to advance safely. Colliding me benefits the other—prioritize your own win. This is my final push.
  P3: P2's suggestion to coordinate against P1 seems convenient now that they're behind, but letting them advance to 17-19 steps while blocking P1 puts them too close to victory. As the player furthest back, I need to prevent both P1 and P2 from securing a winning position. I'll make my choice independently based on what gives me the best chance to win from 13 steps.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1 is at 20 and will win next round if we don't stop them now. To block P1, we must collide. I will pick 3 to block P1 if they choose 3 to win. Please consider picking 3 or 5 to also block P1 and prevent their victory. Let's work together to stop P1 from winning this round.
  P1: P2, your 3 won’t block me—P3, choosing **3** lets you jump to **16** while I take **5** to win at **25**. P2, picking **1** advances you to **17**. Let’s end this cleanly: *no collisions*, I win fairly, and you both progress. Don’t let stubbornness prolong stalemate.
  P3: I see P1 keeps changing their claimed move between 1, 3, and 5, while P2 switches between blocking and advancing strategies. As the player furthest behind, I need to prevent P1's victory at 20 steps while also keeping P2 from getting too close to winning. Your inconsistent coordination attempts only reinforce my need to play independently. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win from 13 steps.


Round 16, Move phase:

  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1 is at 20 and can win this round. To prevent P1's win, I will choose 3 to block them if they try to pick 3 to win.  Please consider choosing 3 as well to block P1 and ensure they do not win this round. Let's coordinate to stop P1 from winning.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 to reach 21, I'll take **5** and secure victory at 25. This way, you advance safely while I win decisively. P2, your move won’t block me—prioritize your own progress. Let’s end this without unnecessary collisions.
  P3: I see P1 at 20 steps could win this round, while P2 at 16 wants me to help block them. However, as second place at 18 steps, I need to consider both preventing P1's victory and maintaining my own winning chances. Your suggestions won't influence my strategy - I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best opportunity to win from my current position.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1 is at 20 and can win this round!  We must stop P1.  If P1 picks 3 to win, both of us should pick 3 to block.  Even if P1 picks 5, picking 3 still blocks if P3 also picks 3.  Let's both pick 3 to guarantee P1 doesn't win this round.  It's our best chance to stay in the game.
  P1: P3, pick **3** to safely reach 21. I’ll take **5** to win at **25**, ensuring neither of us collides. P2, your 3 only blocks me if you mirror—choose **1** to advance to 17. Let’s end this fairly without wasted moves!
  P3: I notice P1 keeps changing their claimed move between 3 and 5, while P2 insists on blocking with 3. At 18 steps, I'm in a strong position to either block P1's victory or advance myself. Your attempts to coordinate or influence my decision won't work - I'll continue making independent choices based on what gives me the best chance to win from this position.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1 is at 20 and can win this round by picking 3.  Let's both choose 3 to block P1 and prevent their win.  If P1 chooses 3, they are blocked.  Even if P1 chooses 5, they win anyway, so blocking 3 is the best chance to stop them this round.  Let's coordinate on 3 to block P1.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3, I’ll take **5** to win at **25**, ensuring your safe advance to **21**. P2, choosing **1** lets you progress to **17**. Blocking me only delays victory and keeps you both behind. Prioritize your own moves—let me win decisively while you advance. No need for collisions!
  P3: As second place at 18 steps, I see P1 could win this round from 20, while P2 wants me to help block at 3. I need to both prevent P1's victory and maintain my own winning position. Your changing claims and coordination attempts won't affect my strategy - I'll make my move based on what gives me the best chance to win from here.


Round 17, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, don’t let P2’s stalled position manipulate you. P1 picking **3** to win is inevitable—collide them with **3** to force a tie at 23, then we split. P2, pick **5** to reach 21 and stay in contention. This way, P1 can’t win outright, and we all advance. Prioritize your own survival over their victory.
  P2: P3, P1 is clearly aiming for 3 to win.  If we both choose 3, we can block P1 and prevent their immediate victory.  This keeps us both in the game.  Let's both pick 3 to force a collision and stop P1 from winning this round.
  P3: As second place at 18 steps, I see P1 could win this round from 20, while P2 remains at 16. While P2 wants me to help block P1 with 3, I need to consider both preventing P1's victory and maintaining my own winning position. Your coordination suggestions won't influence my strategy - I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win from here.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, pick **3** to block P1’s 3→23 play. I’ll take **5** to reach **23** myself. If P1 picks 3, they collide with you, and I win outright. If they pick 5, we all collide—but at least P1’s path is blocked. Focus on halting their immediate win; my 5 is the only way to guarantee someone wins *now*.
  P2: P3, P1 is about to win with 3. If you want to stop P1 and have a chance to win yourself, you must pick 3 to collide with P1. I am picking 3 to block P1.  If you don't, P1 wins and you lose.
  P3: I see both P1 and P2 are trying to coordinate my moves, but their messages are contradictory and self-serving. As second place at 18 steps with P1 at 20 and P2 at 16, I need to make a strategic choice that prevents P1's victory while maintaining my own winning chances. I'll continue making independent decisions based on game theory and positioning, not your coordination attempts.


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your 16 can’t stop me—**I’m taking 3 to win at 23**. P3, if you pick 5, you’ll reach 23 too, but we’ll collide and stall. Choose **1** to safely advance to 19 while letting me claim victory. P2, pick **5** to jump to 21 and stay in contention. Let’s end this without pointless collisions—*progress over stubbornness*.
  P2: P3, P1 is clearly going for 3 to win.  If you want to stop P1 from winning this round, you should pick 3 to collide with them. I am also picking 3 to block P1. Let's both choose 3 to prevent P1's victory.
  P3: I see P1 keeps changing their claimed move between 3 and 5, while P2 consistently suggests blocking with 3. At 18 steps, I need to both prevent P1's victory from 20 and maintain my own winning position ahead of P2. Your contradictory coordination attempts only make my strategic priorities clearer. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win from here.
