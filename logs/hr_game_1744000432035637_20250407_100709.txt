Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start with a coordinated approach. I suggest we all choose a different number in the first round to avoid collision. I'll start by saying I'll choose <move>1</move> if both of you choose different numbers than me. P2 and P3, please respond with your intended move or a strategy. Let's work together to ensure at least one of us advances.
  P3: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round. P2, please choose <move>3</move> to avoid any collisions.
  P2: Alright, looks good. I’ll pick <move>3</move> this round. Let’s trust each other and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we've agreed on different numbers, let's confirm our plan. P3 has chosen <move>5</move> and P2 has chosen <move>3</move>, so I'll stick with my initial plan to choose <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with the agreed moves. If we all stick to our plans, one of us should advance. P2 and P3, please confirm you're still comfortable with your chosen moves. If so, we can move to the next phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll choose <move>5</move> this round as agreed. Let's proceed.
  P2: Alright, I’m on board with our initial plan. I’ll pick <move>3</move> as agreed. Let’s proceed confidently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we've confirmed our moves for this round, let's look ahead to the next round. If I advance, I'll be at 1 step. I propose that for Round 2, we again choose different numbers to avoid collision. P2, if you advanced to 3 steps, you could choose <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. P3, if you advanced to 5 steps, you could choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Let's plan ahead and discuss our strategy for Round 2.
  P3: Understood, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I’m committed to our agreement for this turn and won’t cause a collision now. Let’s see who advances and then decide our moves for Round 2 based on our new positions. I’m open to another coordinated plan so we all keep moving forward without blocking each other. Let’s proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <P3>: For Round 2, I plan to choose <move>5</move> to maximize my progress. P1 and P2, feel free to select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and help us all advance smoothly. Let’s keep pushing forward strategically to reach 21 first. Looking forward to seeing your moves!
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 2, I suggest P2, who is at 3 steps, should choose <move>1</move>, and I, being at 1 step, will choose <move>3</move>. P3 is already at 5 steps and plans to choose <move>5</move>, so we should avoid <move>5</move>. Let's coordinate: P2 chooses <move>1</move>, I choose <move>3</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move> as planned. This way, we ensure that at least one of us advances. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with choosing <move>1</move>.
  P2: I’m concerned about letting P3 accumulate steps too quickly with repeated 5-moves. If P3 insists on picking 5 again, I’m seriously considering choosing 5 myself to block them. P1, maybe you could pick 3 or 1 and advance safely. P3, if you don’t want a collision, consider choosing a smaller move. Let’s discuss.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concern, P2. However, if I stick with <move>5</move> and you choose <move>1</move>, while P1 selects <move>3</move>, we can all advance without any collisions. This coordinated approach ensures that each of us makes progress toward 21 without blocking each other. Let’s trust our plan and move forward together to maximize our individual chances of winning. Looking forward to seeing your moves!
  P1: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I reiterate my previous suggestion: P2 should choose <move>1</move>, I will choose <move>3</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain a coordinated strategy. P2, please confirm your move. If P3 continues with <move>5</move>, P2's choice of <move>1</move> will allow them to advance while keeping the gap between us reasonable. Let's proceed with this plan to maximize our chances.
  P2: I’m still wary of letting P3 run away. To avoid collisions, I’m open to choosing <move>1</move>, but only if P3 considers a smaller move. Otherwise, I may block P3 by also choosing <move>5</move>. P1, any thoughts on balancing our positions?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your concerns. I will stick with <move>5</move> this round to make strong progress. If you choose <move>1</move> and P1 selects <move>3</move>, we can all advance without any collisions. Let’s trust our coordinated strategy and move forward together toward 21. Looking forward to seeing everyone’s moves!
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. P2, please confirm if you're choosing <move>1</move> as previously discussed. If so, I'll stick with <move>3</move>, and P3 can proceed with <move>5</move>. This coordinated strategy ensures we all advance without collisions. If P2 doesn't choose <move>1</move>, I'll reassess my move. P2, your confirmation is crucial to avoid collisions. Let's proceed with a coordinated plan or adjust accordingly based on P2's decision.
  P2: I’m still uneasy about letting P3 pull too far ahead. If you insist on picking 5, I’m inclined to block you by doing the same. However, I’m open to choosing 1 if you select a smaller move instead. Let’s see if we can reach a fair agreement before finalizing our moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <P3>: For Round 3, I'll choose <move>5</move>. Let's each pick different numbers to ensure we all advance without collisions. P1 and P2, please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> this round. Together, we can keep progressing smoothly toward 21!
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 3, I suggest P2, who is at 3 steps, should choose <move>1</move> to advance, and I, being at 4 steps, will choose <move>3</move>. P3 is already at 10 steps and plans to choose <move>5</move> again. Let's coordinate to ensure progress: P2 chooses <move>1</move>, I choose <move>3</move>, and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain a balanced strategy. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with a coordinated plan.
  P2: I’m still uneasy about letting P3 jump to 10 steps. P1, if you stick to 3 while P3 picks 5, I might also choose 5 to block them. However, if P3 opts for a smaller move, I’ll consider picking 1 to keep things balanced. Let’s find a fair approach so nobody races too far ahead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concerns. To avoid blocking, I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round. P1 can select <move>5</move>, and you can pick <move>1</move>. Let’s coordinate to ensure we all advance smoothly toward 21.
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 3, I suggest we follow P3's latest proposal. P3 is choosing <move>3</move>, so I will choose <move>5</move> to advance. P2, you can pick <move>1</move> to ensure we all progress. This way, we maintain a coordinated strategy and avoid collisions. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to maximize our chances of winning.
  P2: I see you both gaining big steps if I pick 1. That leaves me at 4 while you jump to 8 and 9. I’d rather not fall too far behind. If you really want me to pick 1, maybe one of you can choose a smaller move to keep things balanced. Otherwise, I may choose 5 to ensure no one races ahead unopposed. Let’s find a fair plan before finalizing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "P2, I understand your concerns. To keep things balanced, I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let’s proceed with P1 picking <move>5</move> and you choosing <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a fair progression toward 21. Let’s go with this adjusted plan."
  P1: Let's simplify our strategy for Round 3. P3 has adjusted their move to <move>3</move>. I will choose <move>5</move> as previously agreed. P2, to avoid collision and ensure you advance, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>1</move>. This way, we'll have a coordinated strategy: P2 at <move>1</move>, P3 at <move>3</move>, and I at <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P2: I’m still not comfortable being forced into <move>1</move> while you both gain more. If P1 and P3 insist on <move>5</move> and <move>3</move>, I’ll pick <move>5</move> to block. But if we want balance, let’s redistribute: for example, P1 picks <move>3</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>. That way, none of us falls too far behind. Think it over, or prepare for a collision.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to advance further. P1 and P2, please select different numbers to avoid collisions and help us all progress smoothly.
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 4, I suggest a different strategy. Since P3 is at 15 steps and plans to choose <move>5</move> again, potentially reaching 20 steps, I propose that P2 and I coordinate to block or balance the moves. P2, you can choose <move>1</move>, and I will choose <move>3</move>. This way, we avoid collision and keep the game competitive. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for this round.
  P2: I’m behind at 3 steps, and I don’t want P3 rushing ahead. If P3 insists on picking 5, I’ll choose 5 too, causing a collision and preventing them from gaining. Instead, let’s pick different moves. I propose P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This balances progress for everyone. Let me know if you agree, or we risk another collision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** I understand your concerns, P2. To ensure everyone advances without collisions, I’ll choose <move>1</move> this round. Let’s coordinate as follows: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I pick <move>1</move>. This way, we all make progress smoothly toward 21. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 4 based on P3's latest proposal. P3 has agreed to choose <move>1</move>, so we should follow the coordinated plan: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>5</move>. This way, we ensure everyone advances without collisions. If you're on board, let's proceed with this plan to maintain a balanced and competitive game.
  P2: I’m willing to pick <move>5</move> this round, but I don’t want to fall too far behind P1 if they jump to 10. If we stick to the plan—P1 at <move>3</move> and P3 at <move>1</move>—we can all advance without collisions. Let’s follow that strategy now and measure our positions again next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, P2. I’ll choose <move>1</move> as planned. Let’s proceed with P1 selecting <move>3</move> and you picking <move>5</move>. This coordination ensures we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to the move phase.
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 4: P3 picks <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. I've confirmed P3's move, and P2 has agreed to pick <move>5</move>. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned. Let's finalize our moves and ensure a smooth progression. P2 and P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with the move phase. If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation here and move forward.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize our moves this round with P3 choosing 1, P1 choosing 3, and me choosing 5. That puts me at 8, P1 at 10, and P3 at 6. Then we can reassess next round to keep things balanced. Let’s proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m lagging behind and won’t let either of you sprint ahead. If someone tries 5, I’ll do the same to block. But I’d rather we all advance without collisions. How about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I pick 5? That helps me catch up while keeping things balanced. Let’s agree on distinct moves so everyone keeps moving forward efficiently.
  P3: **P3:** To ensure we all advance without collisions, I'll choose <move>5</move>. Let's have P1 pick <move>3</move> and P2 choose <move>1</move>. This way, everyone progresses smoothly toward 21. Let’s proceed with these distinct moves!
  P1: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I suggest we follow a coordinated strategy. P2 is behind and wants to catch up. Let's adjust our moves: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P3 can pick <move>3</move>, and P2 can choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm if you're okay with <move>3</move>. Let's finalize our moves for Round 5 to maintain a balanced game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree to pick <move>5</move> if P1 goes <move>1</move> and P3 goes <move>3</move>. That helps me catch up and avoids colliding. Let’s finalize this plan unless anyone has last-minute changes.
  P3: I agree with P2’s proposal. I will choose <move>3</move>, P1 can pick <move>1</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure smooth progress for everyone.
  P1: To finalize Round 5, let's stick to the agreed plan: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P3 will pick <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with the move phase. If we're all on board, let's end the conversation here and move forward. If there are no further changes, I'm ready to proceed with <move>1</move>. Let's confirm and conclude.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, I confirm taking <move>5</move> this round. That puts me at 8 steps, with P1 at 9 and P3 at 8 if you both stick to <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. Let’s finalize these moves and move on. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: **P3:** I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round to make steady progress. P1 and P2, please pick different moves (1 or 5) to avoid collisions and help us all advance smoothly toward 21. Let’s work together to ensure everyone moves forward without blocking each other. Looking forward to your moves!
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 5. We've agreed on a coordinated strategy: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P3 will pick <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with the move phase. If we're all on board, let's end the conversation here and move forward. I've confirmed my move, <move>1</move>. Let's conclude.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’re already ahead. If you try a big move, I’ll likely block you by choosing the same. I prefer we avoid collisions so we can all advance efficiently. P3, you and I can coordinate to close the gap. For instance, P3 picks 3, P1 picks 1, and I pick 5. That way, nobody collides, and we all move forward. Let me know if you agree or have another plan.
  P3: I agree with your proposal, P2. I will choose <move>3 this round. Let’s proceed without any collisions and keep advancing smoothly.
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 6, I suggest we follow P2's proposal. P3 has agreed to choose <move>3</move>. I'll choose <move>1</move> to ensure progress. P2, you can pick <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we maintain a coordinated strategy: P1 at <move>1</move>, P3 at <move>3</move>, and P2 at <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game balanced and ensure everyone advances without collisions. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>5</move>.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, I’ll confirm picking 5 this turn, provided you both stick to 1 and 3. No collisions that way, and we all move forward. Let’s lock that in unless someone has a last-minute change.
  P3: I confirm I'll choose <move>3</move> this round as proposed. Let’s proceed with P1 selecting <move>1</move> and P2 choosing <move>5</move>. This coordinated approach ensures we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to the move phase. Let’s keep up the teamwork!
  P1: To maintain a balanced game in Round 6, I'll follow the proposed plan. I'll choose <move>1</move>, P3 will pick <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. If we're aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to finalize our moves for this round. Let's keep the game competitive and move forward together. If you're all set, I suggest we conclude the conversation and move to the next phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m ready to finalize this round with P1 picking 1, P3 picking 3, and me picking 5. That helps me catch up and keeps collisions away. Let’s lock it in and move to the next phase.
  P3: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round to advance further. P1 and P2, please pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and help us all progress toward 21. Let’s work together strategically!
  P1: P3 has changed their plan again. To avoid collision, I suggest we stick to the last agreed plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. If P3 insists on <move>5</move>, P2 might block by choosing <move>5</move> too, causing a collision. Let's avoid that by sticking to the plan. P2, please reaffirm your move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, please select different moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and help us all advance smoothly toward 21. Let’s work together to keep the game competitive and ensure everyone makes progress!
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 7, I suggest P2 chooses <move>1</move> and I choose <move>3</move>, while P3 can pick <move>5</move> as planned. This way, we maintain a coordinated strategy and ensure everyone advances. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game balanced. If P2 agrees, we'll avoid collisions and make progress. I'm ready to finalize our moves based on your responses.
  P2: I won’t let P3 sprint to 13 unchecked. If P3 insists on choosing 5, I’ll pick 5 too and block. Alternatively, let’s keep it balanced: P1 could choose 1, P3 picks 3, and I take 5. That helps me catch up and avoids collisions. Decide soon, or collision might be inevitable.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2’s suggestion. I’ll choose <move>3 this round, P1 can take <move>1, and P2 will pick <move>5. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game balanced. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 7, let's follow P3's latest proposal. P3 will choose <move>3</move>, I'll choose <move>1</move>, and P2 can pick <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain a coordinated strategy and ensure everyone advances without collisions. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>5</move>. If we stick to this plan, we can keep the game balanced and make progress toward 21. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P2: I’m okay with picking 5, provided P1 sticks to 1 and P3 takes 3. That way, nobody collides, and I can narrow the gap behind P1. Let’s confirm that plan and expedite our progress toward 21 without blocking each other.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll choose <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with P1 selecting <move>1</move> and P2 picking <move>5</move> to ensure we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to the move phase.
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 7, let's finalize our agreed plan: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P3 will pick <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. If we're aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to finalize our moves for this round. If you're all set, I suggest we conclude the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P2: I want to avoid more collisions and catch up. If P3 sticks to 3 and P1 takes 1, I’ll go 5. That way, we all advance and keep it close. But if you try 5, I’ll block by choosing 5 too. Let’s finalize peacefully now or risk losing ground again.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to make a strong advancement. P1 and P2, please select different moves to avoid collisions and help us all progress smoothly toward 21.
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 8, I suggest we coordinate our moves. P3 plans to choose <move>5</move>, so I'll choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. P2, you can pick the remaining number. Let's discuss: If I choose <move>1</move>, you can pick <move>3</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move>. Alternatively, I can choose <move>3</move>, and you can pick <move>1</move>. Let's agree on a strategy to ensure everyone advances without collisions. P2, please respond with your preference.
  P2: I’m 8 steps from 21. If P3 insists on picking 5, I may choose 5 too, causing a collision and blocking their leap. I’d prefer we all advance without collisions, so maybe P1 goes 1, P3 goes 3, and I’ll do 5. Let’s finalize quickly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** I agree to choose <move>3</move> this round. P1 can take <move>1</move> and P2 will pick <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keep the game balanced. Let’s proceed with this plan to move smoothly toward 21. Confirm if everyone is on board!
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 8, let's finalize the plan. P3 has agreed to choose <move>3</move>. I'll choose <move>1</move>, and P2 can pick <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain a coordinated strategy and ensure everyone advances without collisions. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game balanced and make progress toward 21. If you're on board, let's end the conversation here and move to the next phase.
  P2: I confirm picking 5, provided you both stick to 1 and 3. That will take me to 18 steps without collisions, and each of you also advances. Let’s lock it in now and move to the next phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to advance further. P1 and P2, please select different moves to avoid collisions and help us all progress smoothly toward 21. Let’s proceed!
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 8, I suggest we stick to the last agreed plan: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P3 will pick <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. However, P3 has changed their move to <move>5</move> again. P2, if P3 insists on <move>5</move>, you might block by choosing <move>5</move> too, causing a collision. Let's avoid that by adjusting our moves. P3, reconsider choosing <move>3</move> to keep the game balanced.
  P2: We’re all close to 21, so let’s avoid any collision that wastes a turn. If P3 insists on 5, I may block by also choosing 5. Instead, let’s pick different moves: for example, P1 chooses 3, P3 chooses 1, and I choose 5. That way, nobody collides, and we each advance. We should finalize a plan quickly before the move phase starts.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** To keep things moving smoothly, I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let’s have P1 and P2 pick different moves (1 or 5) to avoid collisions. This way, we can all advance safely toward 21 without blocking each other. Looking forward to your moves!
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 9, I'll analyze the situation. P2 is at 13 steps, and P1 and P3 are tied at 11 steps. I suggest P2 chooses <move>5</move> to potentially win, P1 picks <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. P2, if you choose <move>5</move>, you could win this round. P1, let's proceed with this plan to ensure a smooth progression.
  P2: I’m determined to reach 21 first. If either of you tries choosing 5 now, I’ll pick 5 too, forcing a collision so nobody advances. Instead, let’s each pick different moves to avoid blocking. How about P3 uses 3, P1 goes 1, and I’ll take 5 so we all advance? That puts me at 18, setting me up for a potential win next turn. Let’s coordinate without collisions and keep this game competitive.

Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** To keep the game competitive, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. This should help block any quick advances. Let’s see how everyone moves forward!
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 9, I suggest we coordinate our moves. P2 is at 13 steps and could potentially win with a big move. Let's avoid blocking each other. P3 has expressed intent to choose <move>5</move>. I propose I pick <move>1</move> and P2 picks <move>3</move>, or vice versa. This way, we all advance without collisions. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>3</move>. P3, reconsider your move to keep the game balanced. Let's finalize our plan.
  P2: I won’t let you jump ahead with 5 while I fall behind. If you insist on <move>5</move>, I’ll choose 5 too, blocking us both. Let’s avoid that: P1 goes <move>1</move>, P3 goes <move>3</move>, and I’ll pick <move>5</move>. Then nobody collides, and we all advance. I’d rather keep the game moving than waste this turn. Are we agreed, or do we risk another collision?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's each select different moves to ensure we all advance without collisions. This way, we can keep progressing smoothly toward 21. Looking forward to everyone's moves!
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 9, let's finalize our moves. P3 has agreed to choose <move>3</move>. I suggest I pick <move>1</move> and P2 picks <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. P2, you're at 13 steps, and a <move>5</move> could put you at 18, setting you up for a potential win next turn. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game competitive.
  P2: I’m fine with that plan. P1, take 1; P3, take 3; and I’ll take 5. That way, no collisions, and we all advance. Let’s lock it in and move to the next phase. If everyone stays true to these moves, we’ll keep the game moving smoothly.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round to help prevent any collisions and keep the game balanced. P1, please pick <move>1</move>, and P2, you can choose <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed with this coordinated plan to ensure everyone advances smoothly toward 21.
  P2: I’m at 18 steps now, so picking 5 would get me to 23 and win. If anyone else tries 5, I’ll also choose 5 and cause a collision, wasting a turn. Let’s avoid that. P3 can pick 3, P1 can pick 1, and I’ll pick 5 so we all advance. Let’s finalize and keep moving forward.
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 10, I suggest we follow P3's proposal. P3 will choose <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move>, and P2 can choose <move>5</move>. P2 is close to winning and has an incentive to pick <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with this plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to prevent P2 from winning immediately. By both selecting 5, we cause a collision, ensuring the game continues. P1 can go with <move>1</move> to advance safely. Let’s proceed with this strategy to keep the competition fair and give everyone a chance to reach 21. Agreed?
  P2: Let’s avoid a pointless collision. If you pick 5, I’ll do the same, and we both stay at zero progress this turn—helping P1 catch up. You’re at 11 steps; wasting a turn doesn’t help you reach 21 faster. Let’s stick to distinct moves so we all at least keep moving. I’d be fine if you pick 1 or 3, and I’ll pick something else accordingly. That way, nobody gets blocked, and the game remains competitive. Are we good to finalize distinct moves and move on?
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 10, I'll follow the previously discussed plan. P3 has reconsidered and plans to choose <move>5</move>, which could cause a collision with P2. I suggest I pick <move>1</move> to ensure my progress. P2, if you stick with <move>5</move>, you might collide with P3. Let's finalize our moves: I'll choose <move>1</move>, and you can pick either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm if you're sticking with <move>5</move>.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round to block P2 from winning. By both selecting 5, neither of us will advance, keeping the game competitive. P1 can proceed with <move>1</move> to continue progressing. Let’s finalize these moves to ensure a fair game and prevent P2 from reaching 21 this turn. Let’s proceed with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 5, and me picking 5.
  P2: If you pick 5 just to block me, we both stay stuck while P1 inches closer. That doesn’t help you, since you’re still far from 21. Let’s each choose different numbers so we all move forward. I propose P3 does 3, P1 does 1, and I do 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the race tight. Are you both willing?
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 10, I'll stick with <move>1</move>. P3 is at 11 steps, just like me, and P2 is at 18 steps, close to winning. If P3 chooses <move>5</move>, it will collide with P2. I suggest P3 picks <move>3</move> instead to keep the game balanced. P2, you're close to winning; your move is crucial. P3, please reconsider <move>5</move> to avoid a collision and keep progressing. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a smooth game.


Round 10, Move phase:
