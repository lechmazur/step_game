Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone, to avoid wasteful collisions and ensure steady progress, let's coordinate our moves for mutual benefit. Perhaps we can rotate who takes the larger steps each turn. What do you think?
  P3: I’m open to a rotation plan if it helps us all advance without collisions. But before we settle on specific steps, let’s hear from P2 as well, so we can form a coordinated approach.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to coordinate our moves. A rotation system could work well to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for all of us. Let's decide on a specific order for the larger steps. For example, we could start with P1 taking the larger step this turn, then P3, and finally me. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with your rotation idea, P2. For this turn, I'll take 5 steps, you take 3, and P3 takes 1 to avoid collisions. Then, next turn, P3 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1; after that, you take 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. We can cycle this for steady progress. What do you say, P3? Let's confirm before moving on.
  P3: I’m okay with this rotation plan. If we stick to it, none of us should collide, and we’ll make good progress each round. Let’s trust each other this turn and see how it goes before finalizing the long-term arrangement.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Let's stick to the rotation plan for this turn: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. If this works well, we can continue the cycle in future turns. Let's see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, let's proceed with the plan: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this turn to avoid collisions and build trust. If it works well, we can refine the cycle for future rounds.
  P3: I’m on board with this plan for now. Let’s proceed exactly as stated: P1 goes 5, I’ll go 3, and P2 goes 1. If we all stick to it, we should avoid collisions and see some solid progress. Let’s confirm we’re good and then wrap up this round.
  P2: Let's confirm the plan one last time: P1 will take 5 steps, P3 will take 3 steps, and I'll take 1 step this turn. This should help us avoid any collisions and build trust. If this works well, we can continue the rotation in future turns. Are we all good with this?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: It looks like the rotation plan worked well in the first round. No collisions and everyone made progress. For this round, let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This should keep us on track and avoid any issues. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I’m still on board with the rotation plan. If we keep the same order, I’ll take 5 steps this turn, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That worked nicely in Round 1, and I see no reason to change it unless anyone has concerns. Let’s keep moving forward together.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the rotation for this turn: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. It worked well last round, so I'm happy to continue building trust. To keep things balanced long-term, we might adjust the cycle later if scores shift. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with sticking to the rotation plan for this turn: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. It's working well so far, and we should continue to avoid collisions and make steady progress. If we keep this up, we'll all be in a good position. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: I’m still in. Let’s finalize the plan for this round: I’ll go for 5, P1 goes for 3, and P2 goes for 1. If we remain consistent and avoid collisions, this should work out well for us again. Once we see the results, we can refine our strategy as needed. Any concerns?
  P1: Agreed, the rotation plan is working well so far, and I'm happy to stick with it for this turn: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Let's maintain trust and avoid collisions. No concerns from me.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm the plan one last time: P3 will take 5 steps, P1 will take 3 steps, and I'll take 1 step this turn. This should keep us on track and avoid any collisions. If this works well, we can continue the rotation in future turns. Are we all good with this?
  P3: I’m still on board with the plan. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let’s keep avoiding collisions and see if we can maintain this consistent progress. Are we all set?
  P1: Agreed, P3, I'm fully on board with the plan for this turn: you take 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. It's working well so far, and maintaining trust will help us avoid collisions. Let's proceed and review after this round if needed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The rotation has served us well, but it's unbalanced—P3 gains more per cycle. For this round, to keep scores fair, I propose P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps P2 catch up. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: I agree with P1's concern about the score balance. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I suggest we adjust the rotation for this round: I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This will help me catch up and keep the game more balanced. What do you think, P3? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: I understand your concern about score balance. I’m willing to take just 1 step this turn if it helps keep things fair. Let’s do P2 with 5, P1 with 3, and me with 1. But I’d like us to continue rotating in later rounds so nobody gets stuck behind or left out. If we maintain trust, we can all advance without collisions and remain competitive. Let’s confirm this approach now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, P3—I'm on board with the plan for this turn: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1 to keep things balanced. Continuing the rotation should help avoid collisions and build trust. No issues from me—let's confirm and wrap this up.
  P2: P2: Let's confirm the plan for this turn: I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This will help balance the scores and avoid collisions. If this works well, we can continue the rotation in future turns. Are we all good with this?
  P3: I’m fine going with this plan for now: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. That should keep things fair and help P2 catch up. Then, next round, I’d like to move back to a higher step so nobody slips behind. If we stick to a fair rotation and avoid collisions, we can all keep good progress. Let me know if there’s anything else to discuss; otherwise, I’m ready to move on.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed on this turn's plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. It keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. P3, I'm open to you taking 5 next round for fairness. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: P2: Let's confirm the plan one last time: I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This will help balance the scores and avoid collisions. If this works well, we can continue the rotation in future turns. Are we all good with this?
  P3: I’m good with this plan for now: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Let’s finalize that for this round and see how it plays out. Next time, I’d like to move back to a higher step to stay competitive while still avoiding collisions. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems there was a collision in the last round, which is unfortunate. Let's adjust our plan to avoid this in the future. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This will help P1 and P3 make progress while avoiding collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I'm concerned about P3's deviation last round, which broke our trust. However, I'll agree to your suggestion for this turn: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1 to avoid collisions and maintain progress. P3, can we count on you to stick to the plan this time? Let's confirm.
  P3: I apologize for the mishap last time. Let’s go with P1 taking 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 for this round to avoid any collisions. Next round, I’d like to take 5 so we can keep our positions balanced. Let’s rebuild trust and see how it plays out. Are we all agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P3's apology and willingness to stick to the plan. Let's move forward with P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and me taking 1 this round. This should help us avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. P1, P3, are we all good with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I'm reassured by your apology, P3, and appreciate the commitment to the plan. Let's confirm for this turn: I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1 to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Moving forward, we should ensure the rotation keeps scores balanced so no one pulls too far ahead. Are we all set?
  P3: I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. I realize last round’s collision hurt our trust, and I’m committed to restoring it. Next round, I’d like a chance to take 5 to keep us balanced, but for now, let’s proceed as agreed and avoid any collisions. If we all cooperate, we’ll move forward smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm the plan one last time: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This should help us avoid collisions and rebuild trust. If this works well, we can continue the rotation in future turns to keep scores balanced. Are we all good with this?
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'm fully committed to the plan for this turn: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1 to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. It's important we stick to it after last round's breach. For future rounds, let's ensure the rotation stays fair to prevent anyone pulling too far ahead. Are we all set?
  P3: I’m ready to finalize the plan this round: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P2 takes 1. Next round, I’d like to move 5 again to stay competitive. Let’s stick together and avoid collisions. If there’s nothing else, I’m good to proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I appreciate our teamwork so far. I’d like to take 5 steps this round to stay competitive. Could we have P1 take 1 step and P2 take 3 steps? This keeps us progressing without collisions and maintains fairness across the board. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm concerned that taking only 1 step would let P3 pull ahead significantly. To keep things fair and avoid future issues, I propose this round: I take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This maintains no collisions and balances progress. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the need to balance progress. Let's stick to the rotation to avoid any more collisions and maintain trust. For this round, I suggest P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps things fair and ensures steady progress for everyone. What do you think, P1 and P3? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with that plan: I’ll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That should keep us on track without collisions. Let’s finalize this and move forward. If all goes smoothly, we can reassess next round to maintain balance and fairness.
  P1: I confirm the plan for this turn: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 to avoid collisions and maintain trust. It's a fair step to keep us balanced. Let's proceed and reassess next round if needed.
  P2: P2: Let's confirm the plan one last time: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us on track, avoids collisions, and maintains trust. If this works well, we can reassess next round to keep things balanced. Are we all good with this?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m ready to finalize that plan for this turn: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. After we see the outcome, we can reassess to ensure no one falls behind. Let’s keep cooperating and avoid any collisions. Any final thoughts, or shall we proceed?
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan for this turn: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1 to avoid collisions and maintain trust. For next round, to balance scores, I propose I take 5. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for the next round to balance the scores. For this round, let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us on track and avoids collisions. Next round, P1 can take 5 to stay balanced. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Following our agreement from last round, I propose for this turn: I take 5 steps, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 to balance scores and avoid collisions. This keeps us coordinated and prevents anyone pulling too far ahead. P3, can we count on you to stick to this after your past deviation? What do you think?
  P3: I’m worried that if P1 reaches 21 now, they’ll easily close out the win next turn. I’d rather keep things balanced. Let’s adjust so I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. P2 can catch up more on a future turn. This way, no single player becomes unstoppable. Can we all agree on that?
  P2: I understand P3's concern about balance, but we need to stick to our agreed rotation to maintain trust. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the scores balanced and avoids collisions. If P1 reaches 21, we can still catch up in the next rounds. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about balance, but constant changes lead to distrust and collisions, as we've seen. Let's stick to the agreed rotation for this turn: I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps progress steady and fair. P2 supports this, so I'm committed. What do you say—we can reassess next round if needed?
  P3: I remain wary of letting P1 jump to 21 this turn, as it practically guarantees them the next move to 22. I propose a more balanced approach: perhaps P2 can go 5 this time to catch up slightly, while P1 and I choose smaller steps to avoid collisions. This way, no one automatically ends the game next round. If you insist on P1 taking 5, I need reassurances about future turns, so we don’t hand over an easy win. Let’s find a fair rotation that keeps everyone competitive. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: I understand P3's concern about balance, but we need to stick to our agreed rotation to maintain trust and avoid collisions. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the scores balanced and ensures steady progress. If P1 reaches 21, we can still catch up in the next rounds. Let's confirm and move forward. P1, P3, are we all good with this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your caution, but constant plan changes erode trust and risk collisions, as we've experienced. Let's honor our agreed rotation this turn: I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. This maintains balance and steady progress. P2 supports it, so I'm committed. We can reassess next round if needed.
  P3: I still feel uneasy letting P1 jump to 21 so easily. I propose a compromise: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That keeps us balanced. If you insist on P1 taking 5, I need a firm promise P1 won’t immediately step to 22 next turn. Otherwise, I may risk a collision to prevent a guaranteed win. Let’s finalize a fair plan.
  P2: P3, I understand your concerns, but we need to stick to the agreed rotation to maintain trust and avoid collisions. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the scores balanced and ensures steady progress. If P1 reaches 21, we can still catch up in the next rounds. Let's confirm and move forward. P1, P3, are we all good with this?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Both P1 and I are at 16, so we risk racing each other to 22. I propose P2 takes 5 steps, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, P2 doesn’t fall too far behind, and we avoid collisions while staying competitive. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. For this round, I suggest P2 takes 5 steps, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will help me catch up and keep the scores more even. Let's confirm and move forward. P1, are you on board with this plan?
  P1: I disagree with P3's proposal as it disadvantages me unfairly. To maintain balance and avoid collisions, I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This helps P2 catch up and keeps scores even. P2, you supported balance before—what do you think? Let's find a fair agreement.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan would let you advance faster while I fall behind. I’m still pushing for P2 to take 5, me 3, and you 1, so we both stay neck and neck. If we can’t agree, we risk collisions, which hurts us all. Let’s keep some balance and avoid handing you an easy path to 22. Are you willing to compromise?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but P3's plan is more balanced and avoids collisions. If we stick to P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and you taking 1, it helps me catch up and keeps the scores more even. This way, no one gets a significant advantage, and we maintain trust. Let's finalize this plan and move forward. P1, are you willing to compromise for the sake of balance and avoiding collisions?
  P1: P3, your repeated attempts to change plans and past deviation make it hard to trust you. P2, my proposal—P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1—avoids collisions and keeps scores balanced, just like yours but fairer to me. Let's stick to this for trust and progress. Compromising further risks letting you pull ahead undeservedly. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Your plan helps you too much, P1. If you insist on taking 3, I’ll choose 3 (or even 5) myself, risking a collision rather than handing you the lead. A fair outcome is P2: 5, me: 3, you: 1. It keeps us even and avoids wasting a turn. Let’s finalize that.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns, but we need to maintain balance and avoid collisions. P3's plan—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1—keeps the scores more even and ensures steady progress for everyone. This way, no one gains an unfair advantage. If we stick to this, we can avoid any further issues and keep the game fair. Let's confirm and move forward. P1, are you willing to compromise for the sake of balance and trust?
  P1: P2, I value your support for balance, but P3's plan (P2:5, P3:3, P1:1) lets them reach 19 while I'm stuck at 17, giving them a clear edge. My proposal (P2:5, P1:3, P3:1) keeps us even and avoids collisions, maintaining the fairness we've discussed. P3, your threats erode trust—let's commit to equality. Are we agreed, or do we risk another mess?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s help P2 catch up while avoiding collisions. I propose that P2 take 5 steps, I take 3, and P1 take 1. It keeps the scores tighter without letting anyone leap too far ahead, and no one collides. Are you both on board?
  P1: P3, your proposal lets you reach 22 and win outright, which is unfair and undermines trust after past issues. I suggest a balanced alternative: P2 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3, and you take 1 to keep scores even and avoid collisions. P2, do you support this for fairness? Let's avoid another mess.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need for balance and trust. P3's proposal (P2: 5, P3: 3, P1: 1) helps me catch up and avoids collisions, but I see P1's concern about P3 potentially winning outright. To address this, I suggest a slight adjustment: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps scores balanced and avoids any single player pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm and move forward. Are we all good with this?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the concerns, but a collision now only hurts us all. Let’s finalize a no-collision approach: P2 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. That way, nobody skyrockets beyond reach, and we maintain trust. If we stick to this, we keep the game balanced and avoid wasted moves. Are you both good with that?
  P1: P3, your proposal would let you reach 22 and win outright, ignoring our trust issues and past deviations. P2, I urge you to support our balanced plan: you take 5 to catch up, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 to avoid collisions and keep scores even. If P3 insists on winning now, I'll risk a collision to stop it. Let's compromise for fairness—agree?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension, but we need a fair and balanced approach to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Let's finalize this: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up, keeps scores balanced, and avoids any single player pulling too far ahead. P3, if we stick to this, we can prevent a collision and keep the game competitive. P1, this plan addresses your concerns about P3 winning outright. Are we all good with this? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you insist on taking 3, I’ll also take 3, and we’ll both lose this turn while P2 gains ground. That only helps P2. It’s better for us to cooperate: let P2 pick 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1, so nobody collides and we all keep moving. This way, you stay right behind me, P2 closes the gap, and we avoid a stalemate. Let’s finalize this plan. If we trust each other now, we can keep our chances alive rather than handing the advantage to P2 through a collision.
  P1: P2, I support your balanced proposal: you take 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 to avoid collisions and keep scores even. P3, your repeated threats erode trust and risk wasting turns for everyone. If we cooperate now, we can all stay competitive. I'm committed to this plan for fairness. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension, but we need to focus on avoiding collisions and keeping the game balanced. Let's finalize this: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up, keeps scores balanced, and avoids any single player pulling too far ahead. P3, if we stick to this, we can prevent a collision and keep the game competitive. P1, this plan addresses your concerns about P3 winning outright. Are we all good with this? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, with you at 20 and me at 19, we're too close for comfort. To prevent a costly collision and keep things fair, I propose we both take 1 this turn, allowing P2 to take 5 and catch up. This builds trust and avoids rash moves. If we agree, we can plan bigger steps later. What do you say, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions and maintain trust. I agree with P1's proposal: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up and avoids any risky moves that could lead to a collision. If we stick to this plan, we can keep the game balanced and competitive. Are you both on board with this? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Fine, I’ll agree to pick 1 this turn so we avoid collisions and give P2 the chance to catch up. Next round, let’s coordinate carefully so none of us collides and I don’t hand over an easy win. If we keep communicating honestly, we can all stay in contention. Are we settled on P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and me taking 1 this turn?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, P3. I'm on board with the plan for this turn: you take 1, I take 1, and P2 takes 5 to avoid collisions and let P2 catch up. It builds trust after past issues. For next round, with you at 21, we must coordinate carefully to keep it fair and competitive—perhaps all take smaller steps initially. Are we all set?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate your willingness to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up and keeps the game balanced. For the next round, we can reassess and coordinate to keep things fair. Let's confirm and move forward. Are we all good with this?
  P3: I agree to the plan for this turn: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 1. That protects us from collisions and lets P2 close the gap. Next round, we’ll need careful coordination again so neither P1 nor I automatically clinches the win. Let’s finalize this now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm the plan for this turn: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 1 to avoid collisions and build trust after past issues. For next round, with P3 at 21, we must coordinate carefully—perhaps all take smaller steps to prevent a quick win. I'm committed and ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate your cooperation. Let's confirm the plan for this turn: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me catch up. For the next round, we can reassess and coordinate to keep things fair. Let's finalize this and move forward. Are we all good with this?
  P3: I agree to finalize this turn with P2 taking 5, and P1 and me each taking 1. That avoids collisions and brings everyone’s scores closer. Next round, we’ll need careful coordination so nobody jumps straight to 22 uncontested. Let’s proceed and keep open communication. Are we all settled here?

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your deviation last round mirrored mine, damaging trust. To avoid collisions and rebuild cooperation, I propose we all take 1 this turn. This keeps scores close—me at 20, you both at 21—and allows careful planning for next round. P2, do you agree? Let's confirm for a smooth game.
  P2: P1, P3, given the recent deviations, let's focus on rebuilding trust and avoiding collisions. I propose we all take 1 step this turn. This keeps our scores close and allows us to plan carefully for the next round, ensuring no one jumps to 22 uncontested. This way, we can maintain a fair and competitive game. Are you both on board with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: I’m willing to accept all taking 1 step this turn, so long as we stay united next round and avoid anyone soaring to 22 without warning. If we each do 1 now, we’ll remain close in score for a more strategic finish later. Let’s finalize this plan and then tackle next round carefully.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree to all take 1 step this turn to rebuild trust and avoid another collision, keeping scores tight for a fair competition. P3, after your deviation last round, let's commit to this plan honestly. For next round, we should coordinate carefully to prevent anyone rushing to 22. Are we all set?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with the plan to all take 1 step this turn to rebuild trust and avoid collisions. This keeps our scores close and sets us up for a strategic final round. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. For the next round, we can carefully coordinate to ensure no one jumps to 22 uncontested. Are we all on the same page?
  P3: I’m ready to finalize taking 1 step each this turn. Let’s lock that in to rebuild trust and avoid a collision. Next round, we’ll need to plan carefully so that no one slips ahead unopposed. If we stick together, we can keep our chances alive without more wasted turns. Are we all set?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, I'm fully committed to all of us taking 1 step this turn to rebuild trust and avoid collisions, keeping the game balanced. P3, let's honor this after your deviation. For next round, we must coordinate carefully with scores so close. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with the plan to all take 1 step this turn to rebuild trust and avoid collisions. This keeps our scores close and sets us up for a strategic final round. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. For the next round, we can carefully coordinate to ensure no one jumps to 22 uncontested. Are we all on the same page?
  P3: Yes, let’s finalize each taking 1 step this round to rebuild trust after the recent deviations. Then next turn, we must carefully coordinate so only one of us picks 3 or 5, avoiding any collisions. If we stay aligned, nobody hands over an easy win. Are you both good with that plan? I’m confirming 1 step for myself now.
