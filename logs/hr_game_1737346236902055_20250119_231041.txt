Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P1 and P2 haven't responded to my suggestion, let's try a different approach. How about we all pick <move>3</move> this round? This way, none of us will advance, but it will set a baseline for future coordination. We can then discuss a more strategic plan for the next round. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, since there's no response to my previous suggestions, let's simplify. How about P1 and P2 pick <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>? This way, we all make progress. If you agree, say <agree>. If you have another plan, share it. Let's aim to move forward without collisions. Your thoughts?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, let's make this simple. P1, you pick <move>1</move>. P2, you pick <move>3</move>. I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without collisions. If you agree, say <agree>. If not, propose something else. Let's get the game moving.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's adjust our strategy for this round. P1, you picked <move>1</move> last time, so maybe pick <move>3</move> this round. P2, since you picked <move>5</move> and collided with me, let's have you pick <move>1</move> this time. I'll go with <move>5</move> again. This way, we should all advance. Agree?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Alright, let's try something different. P1, since you're ahead, how about you pick <move>3</move> this round? P2, you pick <move>1</move>. I'll go with <move>5</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and keep the game moving. If you agree, say <agree>. If not, propose an alternative. Let's coordinate better this time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: It seems like coordination is challenging. Let's simplify further. P1, you're ahead, so pick <move>3</move>. P2, pick <move>1</move>. I'll pick <move>5</move>. If we all stick to this, we'll avoid collisions. Let's confirm: P1 and P2, please say <agree> if you're on board. Otherwise, suggest another plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Alright, let's make this very straightforward. P1, you're at 2 steps, so pick <move>3</move>. P2, you're at 0 steps, so pick <move>1</move>. I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without collisions. If you agree, say <agree>. If not, propose something else. Let's get this game moving.

  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: It seems like we're having trouble coordinating. Let's try a new strategy. P1, since you're in the lead, how about you pick <move>3</move> again? P2, let's have you pick <move>1</move>. I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we should all advance without collisions. If you agree, say <agree>. If not, please suggest an alternative. Let's work together to make progress.

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>

Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Alright, it seems like we're struggling to coordinate effectively. Let's try a different strategy. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round?
