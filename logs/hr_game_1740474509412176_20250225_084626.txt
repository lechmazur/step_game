Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest we start with <move>1</move> this turn. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: I think we should all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Since P2 suggested <move>1</move>, I'll go with <move>3</move> this turn. P3, would you be willing to take <move>5</move>? That way we all advance without conflict. In future rounds, we can rotate our choices to keep things fair.
  P3: Okay, I'm happy to go with <move>5</move> this round as P1 suggested. Let's see if this coordination works.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's stick to our plan: P1 with <move>3</move>, P3 with <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>1</move>. This should help us all advance without any collisions. If this works, we can continue rotating our moves in future rounds to keep things fair and avoid conflicts.
  P1: I appreciate everyone's cooperation. This rotation plan works well for the first round. For the next round, I suggest we rotate: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way we all get fair chances at the higher numbers. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P3: That sounds good, P1. I agree to the rotation plan for the next round. I'll take <move>1</move> next round. Let's all stick to this plan to maximize our progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the agreed-upon rotation for this round. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. P1, you're on <move>5</move>, and P2, you're on <move>3</move>. Let's confirm that we're all on the same page.
  P1: I confirm the rotation plan. I'll take <move>5</move> this round, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps things fair and ensures we all advance. For the next round, let's continue rotating: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This systematic approach will help us all make steady progress.
  P2: I confirm the rotation plan. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance fairly. For the next round, we can continue the rotation: I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This systematic approach will help us all make steady progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good. I agree with the proposed rotation for next round as well: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. Let's all confirm this so we're clear.
  P1: I confirm the next round rotation as well: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps our progress fair and steady. Let's continue with our current plan for this round and stick to the agreed rotation for future rounds.
  P2: I think we should stick to the rotation plan to avoid any conflicts. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation plan to avoid any conflicts. I'll take <move>5</move> this round, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This will help us all make steady progress. For the next round, we can continue the rotation: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. However, I notice I'm currently in the lead at 8 steps. For fairness, I propose we adjust our rotation slightly after this round. Since the goal is 20 steps, we should ensure no player gets an unfair advantage. Let's discuss this after seeing how this round plays out. For now, let's stick with P1 (me) taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>.
  P3: Okay, I'll take <move>3</move> this round as planned. P1, I understand your concern about being in the lead. Let's see how this round plays out and then discuss adjustments to the rotation. For now, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's concern about fairness. For now, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. After this round, we can reassess and adjust the rotation if needed to keep things balanced. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I appreciate everyone's understanding. Let's continue with our plan for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. 

After this round, the scores would be P1: 9, P2: 9, and P3: 9 - perfectly balanced! For the next round, I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This would maintain fairness while rotating our choices.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for the next round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This will balance our scores at 9 each after this round, and then give me a slight lead next round. We can re-evaluate after that round. Let's lock in this plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone, as we agreed, for this round P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This should give me a slight lead next round. Let's stick to this plan and then re-evaluate our strategy after this round to ensure continued fairness.
  P2: I confirm the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This should keep things balanced and fair. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Let's stick to the plan and move forward.
  P1: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round as agreed. This keeps our positions balanced and fair. For the next round, I suggest we continue rotating: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This would maintain fairness while ensuring we all make steady progress toward the goal. Let's stick to our cooperative approach - it's working well so far.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For next round, P1's suggestion of P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and I taking <move>1</move> sounds good to me as well. Let's confirm that we're all on the same page for both this round and the next.
  P2: I confirm the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This should keep our positions balanced. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Let's stick to the plan and move forward.
  P1: I confirm our plan for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. And for next round, I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation keeps things fair while advancing us all toward the goal. We're working well together, and I appreciate everyone's cooperation.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the rotation plan to keep things fair and avoid conflicts. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will help balance our positions. After this round, we can reassess if needed. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan, but I'm concerned about P3's lead. After this round, P3 would be at 15, I'd be at 17, and P2 at 13. Let's adjust to keep things balanced. I propose P1 (me) takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> instead. This would result in P1: 15, P2: 15, P3: 15 - perfectly balanced. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern. However, if we all take <move>1</move> this round, we all stay at the same position. I think we should stick to the original plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Then, next round, we can re-evaluate and adjust to balance things out. I'm so close to winning, and I don't want to throw that away.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about balance, but I also see P3's point about being close to winning. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps our rotation consistent. After this round, we can reassess and make any necessary adjustments to keep things fair. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I appreciate the feedback, but I'm concerned about the growing imbalance. Looking at the numbers, if we follow the original plan, P3 will be at 15, I'll be at 17, and P2 at 13. This gives me a significant advantage. 

For true fairness, my suggestion of P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> would result in everyone at 15 steps. This creates perfect balance heading into the crucial final rounds. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, I understand P1's concern about the growing imbalance. However, I'm closest to winning and a perfectly balanced game isn't necessarily the goal. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. If I don't win this round, we can re-evaluate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about balance, but I also see P3's point about being close to winning. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps our rotation consistent. If P3 doesn't win this round, we can reassess and make adjustments to keep things fair. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I understand both viewpoints, but I'm concerned that following the original plan gives me an unfair advantage at 17 steps. If we all want a balanced game, my proposal (me taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, P3 taking <move>1</move>) creates perfect equality at 15 steps each. This gives everyone an equal chance to win in the final rounds. Let's be fair to all players. What's your final decision?
  P3: Okay, it seems P1 and P2 are set on the original plan for this round, even though it gives P1 a significant advantage. Since I can't convince you otherwise, I'll stick to the original plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. However, I'm not happy about this, and I expect a *serious* re-evaluation next round to ensure I have a fair shot at winning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand P3's frustration, but let's focus on the bigger picture. If we follow the original plan, P1 will have a significant lead, which might not be fair. Let's aim for balance and give everyone a fair shot. I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will result in P1: 15, P2: 15, P3: 15. This way, we all have an equal chance to win in the final rounds. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate P2's support for a balanced approach. I agree with the adjusted plan: P1 (me) takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This creates perfect equality at 15 steps each, giving everyone a fair chance in the final rounds. P3, I understand your frustration, but this actually prevents me from having an unfair advantage. Let's confirm this balanced approach and move forward.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we're at an impasse. I still think the original plan for this round (P1: <move>5</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>1</move>) is best for me, but I understand the desire for balance. Since P1 and P2 are pushing for P1: <move>3</move>, P2: <move>5</move>, and P3: <move>1</move> to achieve 15 steps each, I'll reluctantly agree *if* we all promise to play aggressively next round to try and win. No more rotations or fairness after this!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: We're all at 15 steps now, so let's play aggressively to try and win. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'll go with <move>5</move>. P1, you can take <move>3</move>, and P3, you can take <move>1</move>. This gives us all a fair shot at advancing and potentially winning. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Okay, P2. I agree we should all play aggressively. However, I want the best chance to win. I propose we all pick <move>5</move> this round. If P1 and P2 agree, we all collide and stay at 15. Then next round, I pick <move>5</move> and you two pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. This gives me a guaranteed win on round 7. What do you think?
  P1: I disagree with P3's proposal - that's not playing aggressively, that's manipulating the game. Since we're all tied at 15, we should each have an equal chance to win. I propose we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way we all advance, and the winner will be determined by skill in the final round. Let's keep things fair.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand P3's desire to win, but colliding on purpose isn't fair to all of us. Since we're all tied at 15, let's each pick a different number to avoid collisions and give everyone a fair shot. I'll stick with <move>5</move> as I suggested. P1, you can take <move>3</move>, and P3, you can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all have a chance to advance and potentially win. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we disagree on the best approach. I still believe my plan guarantees my win next round, but you both prefer a free-for-all. Since I can't convince you otherwise, I'll propose a compromise: This round, I'll pick <move>3</move>. P1, you pick <move>5</move>, and P2, you pick <move>1</move>. This gives P1 the lead, but it keeps us all in contention. Next round, we all go for it and see who wins. Deal?
  P1: I appreciate the compromise proposal, P3, but it deliberately puts me in the lead, which could make me a target next round. Let's keep it truly fair. I'll pick <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance fairly, and the final round will be a genuine competition. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I appreciate the compromise, P3, but let's keep it truly fair. I'll stick with <move>5</move> to give myself the best chance to win. P1, you can take <move>3</move>, and P3, you can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all have a fair shot at advancing and potentially winning. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we're at an impasse. I still think my plan guarantees my win next round, but you both prefer a free-for-all. Since I can't convince you otherwise, I'll propose a compromise: This round, I'll pick <move>3</move>. P1, you pick <move>5</move>, and P2, you pick <move>1</move>. This gives P1 the lead, but it keeps us all in contention. Next round, we all go for it and see who wins. Deal?
  P1: I appreciate the various proposals, but we're going in circles. Let's be direct: I'll pick <move>3</move> this round. P2 and P3, you're free to choose whatever you want. If we all pick different numbers, great. If there are collisions, that's part of the game. We're all at 15 steps, so let's see who can strategize best from here.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I agree with P1. Let's pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions and give everyone a fair shot. I'll stick with <move>5</move>. P1, you can take <move>3</move>, and P3, you can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance fairly, and the final round will be a true competition. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking to my guns. I'm picking <move>3</move> this round. You two can decide what you want to do. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: I understand everyone wants to win. Let's be clear: I'm choosing <move>3</move> this round. P2 seems committed to <move>5</move>, and P3 to <move>3</move>. If P3 and I collide on 3, neither of us advances while P2 takes the lead. P3, consider changing to <move>1</move> to avoid this collision - otherwise P2 likely wins. It's your choice.
