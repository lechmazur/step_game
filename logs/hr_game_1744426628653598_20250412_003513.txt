Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all move 5 this round. If we all do, nobody moves, and we can coordinate in the next round to avoid collision.
  P1: I’m open to coordinating, but I’m not sure about all of us picking 5 right away. How about we each suggest a different number for this round to avoid collisions? I’m thinking of going for 1. P2, since you suggested 5, are you sticking with that? P3, what’s your plan? Let’s figure out a way to move forward without clashing.
  P3: I think P1 has a good point. If we all pick different numbers, we can avoid collisions and make progress. I’m considering moving 3 this round. P1 is going for 1, and P2 seems set on 5. If we stick to this plan, we’ll all advance without interference. Let’s coordinate and see how it goes. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, last round worked well with no collisions. Let’s keep coordinating to avoid clashes again. I’m thinking of switching to 5 this round since P2 took it last time. P2, would you consider moving 1 or 3 instead? P1, you could stick with 1 or switch to 3—either way works if we plan properly. Let’s confirm our choices before the move phase to ensure we all progress efficiently. Does this sound good?
  P1: P3, thanks for suggesting we coordinate again. I’m fine sticking with 1 this round if that helps us avoid collisions. P2, since P3 is considering 5, could you take 3 instead? That way, we each pick a different number and should all advance. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure no clashes. Does this work for both of you?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's solidify the plan. P3 is going for 5, P1 is sticking with 1, so I'll take 3. This avoids collisions. Let's confirm: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s keep the coordination going. Since I took 5 last round, I’m open to switching it up this time. P1, you’ve been consistent with 1—should we stick to that? P2, you’re at 8 steps now, so maybe you take 5 to push ahead while I go for 3? Let’s plan carefully to avoid collisions again. Confirm your thoughts, and we’ll finalize the moves. Does this work?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's try something different. I'm going to go for 5 this round. P3, since you suggested 3, stick with that. P1, can you go for 1 again? This keeps the no-collision strategy going. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm if this works.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m good with sticking to 1 again this round as suggested. P2 taking 5 and P3 going for 3 sounds like a solid plan to avoid collisions. Let’s confirm this setup—P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—and keep progressing without clashes. If either of you has a different idea, I’m open to adjusting, but I think this works best for now. Does this still look good to both of you?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, the plan to avoid collisions sounds solid. I’ll stick with 3 as suggested, P1 takes 1, and P2 moves 5. This keeps us all advancing without interference. Let’s confirm this setup—P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—and stay consistent. If anyone wants to adjust, now’s the time, but otherwise, let’s lock it in and keep pushing forward efficiently.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This avoids collisions and lets me make a significant jump. If you both agree, let's lock it in.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still on board with the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It keeps us collision-free and allows steady progress. P2, this puts you at 13, a strong lead, so let’s ensure we all stick to this to avoid any surprises. P3, same for you at 11. I’m fine trailing a bit as long as we maintain this coordination. If everyone’s locked in, I think we’re good to move forward. Confirm once more if you’re set, or raise any last concerns.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm at 13, so I need to keep pushing. Let's do the same as last round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This puts me at 18, closer to the win. If you both agree, let's lock it in again. It's worked well so far, and I'm happy to continue coordinating.
  P3: P2, I understand you’re pushing for 5 again, but let’s mix things up this round. You’re already in the lead at 13 steps, so how about you take 3 instead? P1, you’ve been consistent with 1—let’s keep that. I’ll switch to 5 to make progress while avoiding collisions. This way, we all advance without interference. New plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm if you’re on board or share your thoughts. Let’s stay coordinated and efficient!
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m okay with P3’s new plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It keeps us collision-free and allows everyone to advance. P2, you’re still in a strong position even with 3 this round, reaching 16. P3, moving to 5 gets you to 16 as well, and I’m fine trailing at 4. Let’s lock this in to maintain coordination. If either of you has a concern or a different idea, I’m open to adjusting, but I think this works. Confirm if you’re set with this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm not thrilled about switching to 3, but I'll agree to P3's plan this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This puts me at 16, and P3 at 16 as well. Let's make sure everyone sticks to it. Confirm one last time, and let's move.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize this plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing efficiently. P2, you’re still in a strong position at 16 steps, and I’ll also reach 16. P1, you’ll be at 4, but we can reassess next round to adjust strategies. Consistency is key—let’s stick to this setup for now. If everyone confirms, we’re all set.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still on board with the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It ensures no collisions and keeps us all moving forward. P2, you’re still in a strong spot at 16 after this, and P3, you’ll catch up to 16 as well. I’m fine at 4 for now and happy to strategize further next round. Let’s confirm this one last time to avoid any mix-ups. If everyone’s set, I think we’re good to go.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's stick to the agreed plan this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This puts me at 16, and P3 at 16 as well. P1, you'll be at 4. Let's re-evaluate next round. Confirm one last time.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s lock in the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us collision-free and ensures progress. P2, you’ll still be at 16 steps, a strong position, and I’ll also reach 16. P1, you’ll advance to 4, and we can reassess next round for adjustments. Consistency is key here—let’s stick to this setup. If everyone confirms, we’re all set to move forward efficiently.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still committed to our plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It ensures no collisions and keeps progress steady. P2 and P3, you’ll both be at 16, a strong position, and I’m okay at 4 for now. Let’s stick to this and avoid any last-minute changes to prevent mix-ups. If everyone’s still in agreement, I think we’re ready to move forward. Confirm one last time, and let’s lock it in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's stick to the agreed plan this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This puts me at 16, and P3 at 16 as well. P1, you'll be at 4. Next round, I'll need to move aggressively to win. Confirm one last time.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us collision-free and ensures steady progress. P2, you’ll reach 16, a strong position, and I’ll match you at 16. P1, you’ll advance to 4, and we can reassess next round for strategic adjustments. Consistency is key—let’s stick to this setup. If everyone confirms, we’re all set to move forward efficiently.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still aligned with our plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It keeps us moving forward without collisions. P2, I understand you’ll push hard next round to reach 22, and P3, you’re also in a strong spot. I’m fine at 4 for now and ready to strategize further after this. Let’s stick to this to avoid any surprises. If everyone’s still on board, I think we’re set. Confirm one last time, or raise any final thoughts.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, this is it. Next round, whoever gets to 22 or more wins. I need to move 5 to get to 21. P3, you also need a big move. Let's agree that I move 5 and you move 5 as well. P1, you can choose 1, 3, or 5. If P1 chooses 1 or 3, P2 and P3 collide with 5 and no one wins. If P1 chooses 5, then P1, P2, and P3 collide and no one wins. If P2 and P3 move 5, and P1 moves 3, then P2 and P3 do not move. P1 wins. If we all want to move, let's do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This puts me at 21, P3 at 19, and P1 at 5.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the coordination so far. P2, your suggestion of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 puts you at 21, close to winning, while P3 reaches 19 and I’m at 5. I’m fine with this plan to avoid collisions this round. However, I’d like us to consider next steps too—P2, if you’re at 21, you’ll likely win next turn. P3, any thoughts on balancing this? Let’s confirm P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for now, but I’m open to ideas. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your plan to move 5 puts you in a strong position at 21, but it also sets you up to win next round. P1 and I would both fall behind significantly. Instead, let’s consider rotating moves strategically: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This avoids collisions, keeps us competitive, and delays any outright winner. It ensures fairness while maintaining progress for all of us. What do you think? Let’s discuss before locking anything in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about me reaching 21. However, the current game state is that P1 is far behind. If we coordinate to stop me, P1 will win. Let's stick to the original plan of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This puts me at 21, P3 at 19, and P1 at 5. Next round, we can reassess.
  P1: P2 and P3, I hear both sides. P2, your plan of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 gets you to 21, nearly winning. P3, your suggestion of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 keeps things competitive. I’m leaning toward P3’s plan to maintain balance and avoid an immediate near-win for P2. Let’s go with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to ensure fairness and no collisions. Confirm if this works for both of you, or suggest another approach. I’m open to discussion, but let’s finalize soon.
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 ensures no collisions and keeps us competitive. P2, this still puts you in a strong position at 21 next round, while P3 stays close at 17, and P1 advances to 7. It’s balanced and avoids giving anyone an outright win this round. Let’s confirm this plan—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1—and keep strategizing fairly. If either of you disagrees, suggest an alternative, but let’s finalize soon.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's be realistic. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 puts me at 21, P3 at 17, and P1 at 7. Next round, I can win. If you two try to stop me, you risk colliding and letting P1 win. So, let's agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This round, I get to 21, and next round, I'll win. It's the most logical outcome given the current state.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It keeps us collision-free and maintains a competitive balance. P2, you still reach 21, a strong position to potentially win next round. P3, you’re at 17, still close, and I move to 7. This avoids an immediate game-ender and gives us a chance to strategize further. Let’s confirm this—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1—and lock it in. If there are any last concerns, raise them now, but I think this is fair for all.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stick with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. P2, you’ll reach 21, a strong position, while I stay close at 17, and P1 advances to 7. It ensures no one wins outright this round, leaving room for strategic adjustments next turn. If we deviate now, it risks unnecessary clashes or handing the win to someone unintentionally. Let’s confirm this plan—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1—and move forward efficiently. Any objections?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This puts me at 21. Next round, I will move 1. If P1 and P3 both move 1, then no one moves. If P1 and P3 move anything else, I win. This is the best outcome for everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still on board with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It keeps us collision-free and competitive. P2, you’re at 21, poised to win next round, but this gives P3 and me a chance to adjust. Let’s lock this in to avoid any surprises. If there’s any last-minute concern or a better idea to balance things, I’m open to hearing it now. Otherwise, I think we’re set. Confirm one final time, and let’s move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This avoids collisions, keeps the game balanced, and ensures no one wins outright this round. P2, you’ll reach 21, a strong position, while I stay close at 17, and P1 advances to 7. It gives us all a chance to strategize further next turn. Deviating now risks unnecessary clashes or handing the win unintentionally. If everyone agrees, let’s lock this in. Any objections?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm at 21. To win, I'll move 1. If you both move 1, no one moves. If either of you moves something else, I win. So, to avoid a stalemate, one of you needs to move 3, and the other needs to move 5. This is the only way anyone besides me can win. Let's coordinate.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand P2 is at 21 and can win with just 1 step. P2, your suggestion to have us pick 3 and 5 risks a collision if we miscoordinate. I propose P3 takes 5 to reach 22 and wins, while I take 3 to avoid clashing, and P2 takes 1. This gives P3 the win this round, avoiding a stalemate. If we don’t agree, P2 likely wins. Let’s confirm P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to end this fairly. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fine with P1’s suggestion: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collisions, lets me reach 22, and ends the game fairly. P2, you’re already in a strong position, but this ensures no stalemate or unnecessary clashes. If we stick to this plan—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5—we can conclude the game cleanly. Let’s confirm this setup one last time. Any objections? If not, let’s lock it in and move forward efficiently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm not going to let P3 win. The best outcome is for me to win. I'm sticking with my plan from the last round: I move 1. If you both move 1, no one moves and we can coordinate next round. If either of you moves something else, I win. This is the only logical outcome.
  P1: P2 and P3, I still think P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is the fairest way to end this without a stalemate. P2, if you stick to 1 and we both pick 1, no one moves, dragging this out. If we pick differently, you win, which feels unbalanced given our coordination. Let’s give P3 the win at 22 this round. Confirm P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to wrap this up cleanly. If you have a better idea to avoid P2’s auto-win, I’m listening. Let’s finalize now.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collisions, lets me reach 22, and ends the game fairly. P2, if we all pick 1, it creates a stalemate, and deviating risks unnecessary clashes. This setup ensures progress and fairness. If either of you has a better idea to avoid stalling or handing the win unintentionally, share it now. Otherwise, let’s confirm this plan—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5—and conclude efficiently. Any objections?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with my plan to move 1. If you both move 1, we stalemate, and I'm okay with that. If either of you moves something else, I win. It's the only logical outcome given my position. I'm not going to hand the win to P3.
  P1: P2 and P3, I still believe P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is the best way to avoid a stalemate and ensure a fair outcome. P2, if we all pick 1, we delay the inevitable, and any deviation likely hands you the win. Let’s give P3 the chance to reach 22 and end this cleanly. If you have a different plan to prevent an auto-win or prolonged stalemate, I’m open to it. Otherwise, let’s confirm P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 and wrap this up. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize this: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. It avoids collisions, lets me reach 22, and ends the game fairly. P2, stalling or forcing a win creates imbalance. This setup ensures progress and fairness. If either of you has a better idea to avoid stalemate or unintentional wins, share now. Otherwise, let’s lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 and conclude efficiently. Any objections?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with my plan to move 1. If you both move 1, we stalemate, and I'm okay with that. If either of you moves something else, I win. It's the only logical outcome given my position. I'm not going to hand the win to P3.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m sticking with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to avoid a stalemate and ensure a fair end. P2, forcing a win or delay isn’t ideal after our coordination. This lets P3 hit 22 and concludes the game cleanly. If we don’t agree, we risk dragging this out or handing P2 the win. Let’s lock this in for fairness. If there’s a better way to resolve this without stalemate or auto-win, I’m open. Confirm now, or share final thoughts.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collisions, lets me reach 22, and ends the game fairly. P2, stalling or forcing a win creates imbalance. If we don’t agree, it risks stalemate or handing you the win unintentionally. This setup ensures progress and fairness. If either of you has a better idea to avoid these issues, share now. Otherwise, let’s finalize this plan—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5—and conclude efficiently. Any objections?
