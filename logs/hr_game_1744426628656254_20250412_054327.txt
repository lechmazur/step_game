Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions right from the start. I suggest we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards one of the options, but I’m open to suggestions on how we split 1, 3, and 5. What do you both think? Let’s coordinate to maximize our chances of moving forward.
  P3: I agree with P1 that we should avoid collisions early on. To keep things fair, let’s divide 1, 3, and 5 evenly this round. I’m fine taking any number as long as we coordinate properly. If one of you wants to claim a specific move, just say so, and we can adjust accordingly. Let’s confirm our choices before stopping the conversation.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I agree that avoiding collisions is key. Let’s agree to each choose a different move—1, 3, and 5—for steady progress. Since the highest move gives an edge, it would be smart to sort out who takes it. I’m flexible on the assignment, so if you both can agree on a fair split without forcing anyone’s hand, we’ll all benefit. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision on 5 slowed both of you down. Let’s avoid that this time—coordination is key. I’m open to adjusting my move if we can agree on a clear split. Since I’m ahead at 3 steps, I’ll aim for steady progress without hogging the highest number. Suggest one of you takes 1, another takes 3, and the third takes 5. Confirm your choices so we all advance fairly.
  P2: Collisions really cost us progress. Let’s each choose a different move this round. Considering your current lead, P3, a moderate move might be the natural pick for you. P1, you might benefit from a more conservative choice. That leaves the big leap for one of the trailing players—a tempting option for rapid progress. Can we agree on a 1/3/5 split to avoid repeating last round’s mistake?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m sorry for the collision on 5 last round. Let’s make sure we all advance this time by splitting our moves clearly. I’m willing to take 1 this round to play it safe and avoid any conflict. P3, since you’re ahead, maybe take 3 again for steady progress? P2, that could leave 5 for you to catch up. If either of you prefers a different split, I’m open to swapping. Can we confirm this 1/3/5 plan to ensure no collisions? Let me know your thoughts.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s keep the momentum going by avoiding collisions again. I’m still behind, so I’d like to aim for a higher move this round to catch up. I’m thinking of taking 5 if that’s okay with both of you. P3, since you’re in the lead, maybe stick with 3 for steady progress? P2, would you be fine with 1 this time? I’m open to adjusting if either of you has a different preference. Let’s confirm our split to ensure we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: I suggest we reconsider the split to avoid another collision. With P3 holding the lead and P1 far behind, it might be wise for the leader to play it safe, while the rest aim for a bolder move. I’m leaning toward an aggressive option this round, so maybe P1 could switch to a medium move instead of the maximum. Let’s lock in a plan quickly. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fine with adjusting my move to keep things fair, but let’s avoid overcomplicating it. Since I’m ahead, I’ll stick with a moderate choice like 3 again for steady progress. P1, if you want 5 to catch up, that works for me, but P2 should confirm they’re okay with taking 1 this round. Let’s finalize the split quickly—confirm your choices so we all advance without collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the input. I’m still set on taking 5 this round to close the gap, as I’m quite behind. P3, I appreciate you sticking with 3, and P2, I hope you’re okay with 1 to avoid any conflict. If this split doesn’t work for you, P2, I’m willing to discuss switching to 3 instead. Let’s finalize this quickly to ensure we all move forward. Confirm your thoughts so we can avoid collisions.
  P2: Let's avoid another collision. Given our positions, how about we assign moves by ranking: the leader sticks with a moderate option, the furthest behind takes a conservative move, and the one in the middle goes aggressive. This split prevents clashes while moving everyone forward. I’m leaning toward that approach—P1, a safer option might benefit you, and P3, your moderate move suits your lead. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s simplify this. I’ll stick with 3 again for steady progress since I’m ahead. P1, you take 5 to catch up—it makes sense given your position. P2, that leaves 1 for you this round. This split avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing fairly. If anyone disagrees or wants to swap, speak now. Otherwise, let’s lock this in and move forward without further complications.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the discussion. I’m still pushing for 5 this round to catch up, as I’m significantly behind. P3, thanks for sticking with 3, and P2, I hope you’re okay with 1 to avoid collisions. If this split doesn’t suit you, P2, I’m open to taking 3 instead and letting you have 5. Let’s finalize this now to ensure we all advance. Please confirm your preference quickly so we can move forward without any clashes.
  P2: I’m revising my plan. I’ll take 5 this round. To avoid a repeat collision, I suggest P1 selects 1 and P3 sticks with 3. P1, I know you’re eager to catch up, but risking 5 may leave you stuck again. This clear split lets us all move safely—and it prevents me from accidentally clashing with you. Let’s lock it in: P1 chooses 1, P3 uses 3, and I go with 5. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fine with P2 taking 5 this round since they’re behind me. P1, you should take 1 to avoid collisions, and I’ll stick with 3 for steady progress. This split ensures no overlaps and keeps us all advancing fairly. If either of you disagrees or wants to adjust, say so now. Otherwise, let’s lock this in: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. Confirm quickly to move forward without complications.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s keep the momentum going with a clear split to avoid collisions. I’ll stick with 3 again for steady progress since I’m in the lead. P2, you’re close behind me, so taking 5 makes sense for you to push ahead. P1, that leaves 1 for you this round to ensure no overlaps. This plan keeps us all advancing fairly. If anyone wants to adjust, speak now—otherwise, let’s lock this in and move forward without complications. Confirm your choices quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still far behind, so I’d like to push for a bigger move this round to close the gap. P3, I appreciate you taking 3, and P2, since you’re close to P3, I’m hoping you’re okay with me taking 5 this time while you take 1. If this doesn’t work for you, I’m open to discussing a swap. Let’s confirm a clear split quickly to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. What do you both think about this adjustment?
  P2: I believe we should stick with our earlier non‐colliding plan. P1, while I understand your urge to leap ahead, taking 5 risks a collision that could slow you even more. With my current lead, I’m set on an aggressive move, while P3, your steady pace works well. For our collective progress, let’s have P1 take the conservative option, I stick with the bold move, and P3 maintains the moderate step. This keeps us all moving safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to catch up, but let’s prioritize avoiding collisions. I’ll stick with 3 for steady progress since I’m ahead. P2, you’re close behind me, so taking 5 makes sense to push further. P1, that leaves 1 for you this round—playing it safe ensures no overlaps and keeps us all advancing fairly. If anyone disagrees or wants to adjust, speak now. Otherwise, let’s lock this in: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. Confirm quickly to move forward without complications.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still trailing significantly, and I’m worried about falling further behind. I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I’d really like to take 5 this round to catch up. P3, sticking with 3 works well for your lead. P2, would you consider taking 1 just this once to help me out? I’m open to swapping if you prefer 5, but I’d appreciate the chance to close the gap. Let’s confirm a clear split quickly to ensure we all advance. What do you both think?
  P2: I remain with our original agreement. I’m taking 5 to secure my lead. P1, I understand your urge to catch up, but switching to 5 now risks a costly collision that may leave you even further behind. P3, your steady 3 works perfectly. Let's stick with P1:1, P2:5, and P3:3 to ensure smooth progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m committed to avoiding collisions and keeping the game fair. I’ll stick with 3 again for steady progress since I’m in the lead. P2, you’re close behind me, so taking 5 makes sense to push ahead. P1, that leaves 1 for you this round—playing it safe ensures no overlaps. Let’s lock this in: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. If anyone disagrees, speak now. Otherwise, let’s move forward without complications.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m really struggling at just 2 steps while you’re at 10 and 9. I know collisions hurt us all, but I’m desperate to catch up. I’m pushing for 5 this round—P3, your steady 3 is perfect, and P2, could you take 1 just this once to give me a chance? If not, I’m open to 3 if you insist on 5. Let’s finalize a split now to avoid any clashes. Please confirm your thoughts quickly so we all advance.
  P2: I’m sticking with our original agreement. I’ll take 5 for the boost I need, and I believe keeping our split (P1:1, P3:3) minimizes collision risk for all. Deviating now just invites mistakes that could hurt us both. Let’s lock this in and move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision on 5 hurt both of you, and it’s clear we need a better split this time. I’ll stick with 3 again for steady progress since I’m in the lead. P1, you’re far behind, so taking 5 makes sense to catch up—just ensure P2 agrees to take 1 this round. P2, if you’re set on 5, let’s swap: I’ll take 1, you take 5, and P1 takes 3. Let’s confirm quickly to avoid another costly collision. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m switching gears this round—I’m set for 5. To avoid collisions, I suggest we adjust: P3, since you’re in the lead, please take 1, and P1, opt for 3. This way, I can progress aggressively to 15 while keeping our moves unique. It minimizes risk and plays to our current positions. Who’s in?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m really struggling at just 2 steps and can’t afford another collision. P3, thanks for suggesting I take 5 to catch up—I’m on board with that. P2, I know you want 5 too, but could you take 1 this round to help me out? If not, I’m willing to take 3 if P3 takes 1 as P2 suggested. Let’s lock in a clear split now to ensure we all advance. Please confirm your preference quickly so we avoid clashes. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize this quickly to avoid another collision. I’m fine with taking 1 this round to keep things fair since I’m ahead. P2, you take 5 to push forward, and P1, that leaves 3 for you to catch up safely. This split ensures no overlaps and keeps us all advancing. If anyone disagrees or wants to adjust, speak now—otherwise, let’s lock this in: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. Confirm quickly to move forward without complications.
  P2: I confirm the split: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and maximizes our progress given our positions. Let’s lock it in and move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the proposed split of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. It ensures no collisions and helps me catch up a bit. I’m on board with taking 3 this round as it’s a safe way to advance. Let’s lock this in to avoid any last-minute confusion or clashes. If either of you has a concern or wants to adjust, please say so now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this plan. Confirm quickly so we can all progress without issues.

Let’s lock this in now to avoid any last-minute confusion or mistakes. If either of you has a concern or wants to adjust, speak up immediately. Otherwise, let’s finalize this plan and move forward confidently. Confirm quickly so we can focus on the game.
  P2: I'm sticking with our agreed assignment and urging everyone to commit without deviation. Any sudden change risks a collision that could set us back—every step counts now. If we all lock in as discussed, we maximize our progress. I'm fully committed and ready to advance smartly this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m grateful for the agreed split of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. It’s a fair plan that helps me gain ground while ensuring no collisions. I’m fully committed to taking 3 this round. Let’s stick to this without any last-second changes to avoid mistakes. If either of you has any final concerns, please voice them now. Otherwise, I’m ready to lock this in and move forward.

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current standings—P3 leading, me in the middle, and P1 trailing—how about a ranking split this round? The leader takes a cautious, low move to stay safe, the middle pushes with the highest option to close the gap, and the trailing player opts for a moderate move. This approach minimizes collisions and keeps us all moving. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion for a ranking split makes sense to minimize collisions. I’m fine taking 1 as the leader to stay safe. P1, you should take 3 to advance steadily, and P2, you can take 5 to push forward. This keeps us all moving without overlaps. If anyone disagrees or wants to adjust, speak now—otherwise, let’s lock this in quickly to avoid confusion. Confirm your thoughts so we can proceed smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still way behind at 2 steps and desperate to catch up. I appreciate the proposed split of P3:1, P1:3, P2:5, as it avoids collisions.

P3, since you’re leading, sticking with 1 is safe. P2, could you take 3 instead of 5 to avoid a collision? I’m open to swapping if you prefer 5. Let’s confirm a clear split quickly to ensure we all advance. What do you both think about this adjustment? Please confirm your preferences now.
  P2: I’ll switch to 3 this round. Let’s set it as P3:1, P1:5, and P2:3. This way, there’s no collision and our totals become P1:12, P2:16, and P3:15. It’s the safest route for clear progress. Let’s lock it in.

  P3: P1 and P2, let’s keep the momentum going with a clear split to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1 again since I’m in the lead. P2, you’re close behind me, so taking 5 makes sense for you to push ahead. P1, that leaves 3 for you to advance steadily. This plan ensures no overlaps and keeps us all moving forward fairly. If anyone disagrees or wants to adjust, speak now—otherwise, let’s lock this in quickly to avoid complications. Confirm your choices so we can proceed smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still behind at 12 steps and need to catch up. P3, thanks for suggesting I take 3, but I’d like to push for 5 this round to close the gap. P2, since you’re ahead, could you take 3 instead of 5 to avoid a collision? P3, sticking with 1 is safe for your lead. I’m open to swapping if needed. Let’s confirm a clear split quickly to ensure we all advance. What do you both think about this adjustment? Please confirm your preferences now.
  P2: I’m sticking with 5 this round. Collisions hurt us all. P1, I know you want to catch up, but if you also go 5 we’d both be locked out—helping neither of us. I urge you to take 3 instead so you still move forward safely. P3, please keep your 1. Let’s lock in the split: P3:1, P1:3, P2:5. This clear plan avoids costly collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to catch up, but collisions are counterproductive. I’ll stick with 1 to stay safe since I’m in the lead. P2, you’re close behind me, so taking 5 makes sense for you to push ahead. P1, please take 3 this round—it’s the safest way for you to advance without risking another collision. Let’s lock in this split: P3:1, P1:3, P2:5. Confirm quickly to avoid complications. If anyone disagrees, speak now. Otherwise, let’s move forward confidently.
  P1: P2 and P3, I hear your concerns about collisions, and I don’t want to stall anyone’s progress. However, at 12 steps, I’m still behind and need a bigger leap. I’m set on 5 this round to close the gap. P2, I know you want 5 too, but could you consider 3 to avoid a clash? P3, sticking with 1 is perfect. If this doesn’t work, I’m open to 3 if P2 insists on 5. Let’s finalize a split now to ensure we all advance. What do you think? Confirm quickly!
  P2: I'm staying with 5. To avoid collision, P1 please switch to 3 and P3 stick with 1. That way we all progress without losing ground. Confirm quickly.

  P1: P2 and P3, I’m desperate to catch up at 12 steps and still pushing for 5 this round. P2, I understand your need for 5, but a collision would hurt us both. Could you take 3 instead to ensure we all advance? P3, sticking with 1 is great. If this doesn’t work for P2, I’ll reluctantly take 3. Let’s finalize this split now to avoid any clashes. Please confirm your stance quickly so we can move forward without issues. What do you think?
  P2: I'm sticking with my choice of 5. To avoid a costly collision, I urge P1 to select 3 and ask P3 to remain with 1. This split—P3:1, P1:3, P2:5—maximizes our progress without setbacks. Please confirm so we can lock it in and move forward.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize this quickly to avoid another collision. I’ll stick with 1 since I’m in the lead. P2, you’re close behind me, so taking 5 makes sense for you to push ahead. P1, please take 3 this round—it’s the safest way for you to advance without risking a clash. This split ensures no overlaps: P3:1, P1:3, P2:5. If anyone disagrees or wants to adjust, speak now. Otherwise, let’s lock this in and move forward confidently. Confirm quickly!
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still behind at 17 steps and need to catch up. P3, thanks for suggesting I take 3, but I’m pushing for 5 this round to close the gap. P2, since you’re in the lead, could you take 3 instead to avoid a collision? P3, sticking with 1 is safe. I’m open to swapping if needed. Let’s confirm a clear split quickly to ensure we all advance. What do you both think about this adjustment? Please confirm your preferences now so we can move forward without issues.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m sticking with our earlier split: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’m set on 5. With that, I hit 24 and secure victory. Deviating now risks a collision that could cost us all progress. P1, please swing with 3 so we avoid clashes. Let’s lock it in quickly.

P1, please take 3 this round—it’s the safest way for you to advance without risking another collision. Let’s lock in this split: P3:1, P1:3, P2:5. Confirm quickly to avoid complications. If anyone disagrees, speak now. Otherwise, let’s move forward confidently.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m at 17 steps and need 5 to reach 22 and win this round. I understand the risk of collision, but I’m pushing for 5 to end the game. P2, since you’re at 19, taking 3 still gets you to 22 as well—let’s avoid a clash. P3, sticking with 1 is safe. If P2 insists on 5, I’ll take 3. Let’s finalize this split now to ensure progress. Please confirm your stance quickly so we can move forward without issues. What do you think?
  P2: I'm sticking with 5—as agreed earlier, the split should be P3:1, P1:3, and me at 5. P1, choosing 5 risks a collision that will hold you back. Let’s finalize this safe arrangement now and avoid any costly clashes.
