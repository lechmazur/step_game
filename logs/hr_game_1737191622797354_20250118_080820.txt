Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm open to coordination, but how do we ensure everyone sticks to the agreement? What's to stop someone from betraying the others and picking a different number to get ahead?
  P3: I agree with P1's concern. How about we establish a penalty for betrayal, like if someone deviates from the agreed-upon numbers, the others will target them in future rounds to hinder their progress? This way, we can ensure cooperation and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1 and P3. To build trust, I propose we follow the initial plan for this round and see how it goes. If everyone cooperates, we can continue with a similar strategy. If someone deviates, we can discuss penalties then. Let's start with small steps and build from there. Agreed?
  P1: I'm willing to go along with P2's initial proposal for this round, with the understanding that if anyone betrays the agreement, we will reassess and consider a penalty strategy for future rounds. Let's see if we can start with a clean slate of trust.
  P3: I agree with P1's willingness to go along with P2's initial proposal for this round. Let's see if we can start with a clean slate of trust and follow the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. If everyone cooperates, we can continue with a similar strategy. If someone deviates, we can discuss penalties then. Let's start with small steps and build from there. Agreed?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:

  P3: I agree with P2's proposal to continue with the same strategy for this round. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we can maintain trust and avoid collisions. If everyone cooperates, we can continue with a similar strategy for future rounds. Let's keep the momentum going!
  P1: I'm considering continuing with the agreed-upon strategy for this round, but I want to emphasize that if anyone deviates, we should be prepared to adapt and potentially implement a penalty strategy to maintain fairness and cooperation. Let's confirm our commitments: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5, as previously discussed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given that I deviated from the plan last round by picking 5 instead of 1, I expect some mistrust. However, I'd like to propose we continue with a variation of the original plan to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 this round? This way, we can still make progress without immediately targeting each other. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your proposal, but given your deviation last round, trust needs to be rebuilt. How about we adjust the plan slightly: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. This way, we can still avoid collisions and see if trust can be re-established. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal to adjust the plan slightly: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and P2 picks 1. This way, we can still avoid collisions and see if trust can be re-established. Let's give it a try and see how it goes.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P2's and P3's concerns about trust, given my deviation last round. However, I'd like to point out that P2's proposed adjustment gives P2 a significant advantage by letting them pick 1, which is the smallest step. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we should consider a more balanced approach to rebuild trust. How about we stick with my original proposal: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5? This way, everyone gets a chance to move forward without giving one player a disproportionate advantage.
  P2: I understand your concern, P1, but trust needs to be re-established after your deviation. Let's find a middle ground: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This ensures we all move forward without giving anyone a disproportionate advantage. If this round goes well, we can consider more balanced approaches in future rounds. Agreed?
  P3: I think P2's proposal is reasonable, considering the need to rebuild trust. Let's go with P2's suggestion: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and see if trust can be re-established. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm willing to consider P2's proposal, but I think it's essential to acknowledge that P3 is currently in the lead. To maintain a balance, how about we adjust the plan to ensure P3 doesn't get too far ahead? What if P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1 this round, so we all move forward but don't let the lead grow too large?
  P2: P1, I see your point about balancing the lead, but let's prioritize rebuilding trust first. How about a compromise: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can still avoid collisions, and no one gets too far ahead. Let's focus on re-establishing cooperation. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal to prioritize rebuilding trust. Let's go with the compromise: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and re-establish cooperation. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough proposals. To simplify, let's go with a straightforward approach to rebuild trust and avoid collisions: each of us picks a different number. I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 for this round. If everyone cooperates, we can reassess and adjust our strategy in the next round. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your effort to simplify, but given the past deviation, let's stick with the compromise to rebuild trust: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This ensures we all move forward and avoid collisions. Agreed?

  P2: It seems we're going in circles. Let's simplify and agree on: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5 for this round. Trust needs to start somewhere. Agreed?
  P3: I think we've discussed enough proposals. To simplify, let's go with a straightforward approach to rebuild trust and avoid collisions: each of us picks a different number.

  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P3's proposal to focus on rebuilding trust. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal to rebuild trust by sticking to a simple plan. However, considering P2's significant lead, I think we should discuss a strategy that prevents them from getting too far ahead. How about we adjust the plan to limit P2's progress while still avoiding collisions?
