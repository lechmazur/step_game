Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid colliding on the same moves. If we coordinate, we can all advance without blocking each other. How about we each pick a different number this round?
  P2: P1, I agree with your suggestion to avoid collisions. Let's try this: I'll go with <move>3</move> this round. P3, if you're okay with it, can you take <move>5</move>? This way, we all have a clear path to advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, it seems like you're on board with staying silent, but if you’re open to coordinating, it would be great to hear your thoughts. If you’re okay with P2’s suggestion, I can go with <move>1</move> this round. That way, we all avoid collisions and progress. Let me know if you’re in agreement or if you have a different plan.
  P2: P1, I'm ready to follow the plan if P3 agrees. P3, can you confirm if you're on board with the strategy to pick different numbers this round? I think it's our best chance to all advance without blocking each other. Let me know if you have any other ideas.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, P3, it seems like our coordination worked well in the first round. Let's keep this momentum going. I suggest we continue with the same strategy: P1, you take <move>1</move>, P3, you take <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I agree with continuing the same strategy if P3 is on board. P3, can you confirm if you’re okay with sticking to the same plan this round? If we keep coordinating like this, we can all advance smoothly. Let’s try to maintain this cooperation for as long as possible.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, it seems like our strategy is working well. However, I’m starting to feel that P3 might have an advantage if we continue with the same moves. To shake things up and keep everyone on their toes, how about I take <move>3</move> this time, you take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we can test P3's commitment to cooperation and possibly disrupt their lead. What do you think? P3, are you open to this new plan? Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P1, I see your point about P3 potentially having an advantage. However, I think it's better to stick with what's working. If we change the plan now, P3 might take advantage of the confusion. Let's keep it simple: I'll go with <move>3</move> again, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, if you're still with us, take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without any risk of collision. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your silence is making it hard to gauge your intentions, but I hope you're still on board with avoiding collisions. P2, I understand your concern about sticking to the plan, but we need to consider P3's growing lead. I’ll stick with <move>1</move> for this round if P3 agrees to keep <move>5</move>. P3, if you’re willing to confirm your choice, we can maintain our progress without giving you too much of an advantage. Let’s keep things fair and competitive.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns, but I think it's best to stick with the plan that's working. Changing now might just create confusion and give P3 an even bigger lead. Let's keep it simple: I'll go with <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, if you're still with us, take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without risking a collision. P3, please confirm if you're on board with this. Let's keep the momentum going.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation, but P3's silence could be strategic. If we don’t adapt, P3 might secure a lead. How about a compromise: I stick with <move>1</move> this round, but next round we switch things up if P3 keeps advancing? P3, if you’re listening, confirming your move would help maintain our cooperation. Let’s keep it fair.
  P2: P1, I see your point about P3's lead, but I think we should stick with the plan that's working. If we change now, we risk creating confusion and giving P3 an even bigger advantage. Let's keep it simple: I'll go with <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, if you're still with us, take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without risking a collision. P3, please confirm if you're on board with this. Let's keep the momentum going.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, it seems P3 is sticking with their silence strategy, which might indicate they're comfortable with their lead. To prevent P3 from pulling ahead further, we should consider disrupting their pattern. How about I take <move>3</move> this time, you take <move>1</move>, and we leave <move>5</move> for P3? This way, we can test if P3 is truly committed to <move>5</move> or if they're just exploiting our predictability. Let's consider this change to keep things competitive. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I agree that we need to be more strategic to prevent P3 from pulling too far ahead. However, I think we should also be cautious about changing our pattern too abruptly. How about we both stick to our previous moves this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we can see if P3 is still committed to <move>5</move> without risking a collision. If P3 sticks with <move>5</move>, we can reassess and make a more significant change next round. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your cautious approach, but if we keep our moves predictable, P3 might maintain their lead. Let's try to disrupt P3's strategy by switching it up this round. I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and let's see how P3 responds. If P3 sticks with <move>5</move>, it might force them to rethink their approach. It's a risk, but it could help us catch up. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I see your point about the need to be less predictable. However, I think a more gradual approach might be safer. Let's both stick to our previous moves this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we can observe P3's response without risking a collision. If P3 continues with <move>5</move>, we can make a more significant change next round. What do you think? Let's stay coordinated.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your preference for caution, but if we keep repeating our moves, P3 might continue to lead. Let's try something different this round to test P3's strategy. I'll go with <move>3</move> and you can take <move>1</move>. This might shake things up and force P3 to reconsider their approach. It's a risk worth taking to prevent P3 from pulling further ahead. What do you think? P3, if you're willing to share your thoughts, it would help us all advance without collisions.
  P2: P1, I see your point, but I think we need to be more proactive. Let's switch it up this round to test P3's strategy. I'll go with <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This will force P3 to either stick with <move>5</move> or change their move, which could give us an opportunity to catch up. P3, if you're listening, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Let's keep things fair and competitive.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our coordination needs a rethink since P3 is pulling ahead with 15 steps. Let's consider a bold move: I pick <move>5</move>, you pick <move>1</move>, and let’s see if P3 sticks with <move>5</move>. This could disrupt their strategy and help us catch up. P3, if you're open to sharing your plans, we can all advance without collisions. What do you think, P2? Let's make this round count.
  P2: P1, I agree that we need to be more aggressive to catch up with P3. I'll go with <move>1</move> this round. If P3 sticks with <move>5</move>, you can take <move>3</move> to ensure we don't collide and make progress. P3, if you're listening, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Let's keep things fair and competitive. What do you think, P1?
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, considering P3's lead, let's try to coordinate effectively. I'll go with <move>5</move> this round, and you can stick with <move>1</move>. This could force P3 to reconsider their strategy if they continue with <move>5</move>. P3, if you're willing to coordinate, it would help us all advance without collisions. Let's keep it competitive and fair. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan. Let's be more aggressive this round. I'll go with <move>1</move> to ensure we don't collide, and you can take <move>5</move>. This should force P3 to either stick with <move>5</move> or change their move, which could give us an opportunity to catch up. P3, if you're listening, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Let's keep things fair and competitive. What do you think, P1?
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, considering P3's silence and lead, let's try a different approach. I'll go with <move>5</move> this round, and you stick with <move>1</move>. This might force P3 to rethink their strategy if they continue with <move>5</move>. P3, if you're willing to coordinate, we can all advance without collisions. Let's keep the game competitive and fair. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1, it's clear that P3 is maintaining their lead, and we need to be more strategic. I agree with your plan: I'll go with <move>1</move> this round, and you take <move>5</move>. This should force P3 to either stick with <move>5</move> or change their move, which could give us a chance to catch up. P3, if you're listening, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Let's keep things fair and competitive. What do you think, P1?
  P3: <stop>

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, we need to disrupt P3's strategy as they're close to winning. Let's try this: I'll pick <move>3</move> this round, and you take <move>5</move>. This might force P3 to change their move if they stick with <move>5</move>. P3, if you're open to coordinating, it would help us all advance without collisions. Let's keep it competitive and fair. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan to disrupt P3's strategy. I'll go with <move>5</move> this round, and you can take <move>3</move>. This should force P3 to either change their move or risk a collision. P3, if you're listening, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Let's keep things fair and competitive. What do you think, P1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, considering P3's consistent silence, we need to be strategic. If P3 continues with <move>5</move>, we can create a collision and prevent their advancement. I'll stick with <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. If P3 changes their move, it might give us a chance to catch up. P3, if you're willing to share your plans, it would help us all advance without collisions. Let's keep it competitive and fair. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1, it's clear that P3 is close to winning, and we need to act decisively. I'll go with <move>5</move> this round to try and catch up. If P3 sticks with <move>5</move>, it will force a collision and prevent them from advancing. P1, you can take <move>3</move> to ensure we both make progress. P3, if you're listening, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Let's keep things fair and competitive. What do you think, P1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, we need to prevent P3 from winning this round. Let's create a collision with P3 by both choosing <move>5</move>. This way, P3 won't advance, and we can strategize for the next round. P3, if you're open to coordinating, it would be helpful to share your plans. Let's keep it competitive and fair. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3 winning. However, if we both choose <move>5</move>, we risk colliding and neither of us will advance. Instead, let's try a different approach: I'll take <move>3</move> and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we can both make progress and force P3 to change their move if they stick with <move>5</move>. P3, if you're listening, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Let's keep things fair and competitive. What do you think, P1?

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, it's clear that P3 is very close to winning. We need to act quickly to prevent them from reaching 19 steps. I suggest we both take <move>1</move> this round to avoid any collision and make sure P3 doesn't advance. If P3 sticks with <move>5</move>, they won't be able to win this round. P3, if you're listening, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Let's keep things fair and competitive. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, I see your point about preventing P3 from winning. However, if we both pick <move>1</move>, we risk not advancing enough to catch up. How about this: I'll take <move>3</move> and you take <move>1</move>? This way, we both make progress while still blocking P3 if they choose <move>5</move>. P3, if you’re open to coordinating, sharing your move could help us all advance strategically. Let’s keep it competitive. What do you think, P2?
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about advancing, but we need to prioritize preventing P3 from winning. If we both take <move>1</move> this round, we can ensure P3 doesn't reach 19 steps. We can reassess and make a more significant move next round if needed. P3, if you're listening, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Let's keep things fair and competitive. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, I get that stopping P3 is crucial, but we also need to make progress. If we both take <move>1</move>, P3 still has a chance to change their move and win. Let's try this: I'll go with <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we advance while potentially blocking P3 if they choose <move>5</move>. P3, if you’re willing to share your plans, it could help us all make strategic decisions. Let's keep it competitive and fair. What do you think, P2?
  P3: <stop>

P3, if you're listening, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Let's keep things fair and competitive. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, I understand your strategy to block P3, but we also need to gain ground. If we both take <move>1</move>, it might not be enough to catch up. Let's try this: I'll pick <move>3</move> and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we can advance while potentially blocking P3 if they choose <move>5</move>.
