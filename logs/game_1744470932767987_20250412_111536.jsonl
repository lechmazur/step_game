To clarify, I suggested the alternative because a three-way stalemate helps nobody. This arrangement (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) keeps the game flowing while maintaining competitive balance. After this round, you'll be at 18, I'll be at 14, and P1 at 4. I commit to taking 5 as discussed. Let's proceed with this plan and avoid unnecessary collisions."}
