Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start easy. I'll take 1, P2 take 3, and P1 take 5.  Sound good?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. I'll take 3. Let's see how it goes!
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, are you in or out?  We can adjust if you have a different proposal, but let's at least try to avoid collisions early on.
  P2: P1, it's important we coordinate to avoid early collisions. If you're not comfortable with 5, suggest an alternative, but let's agree on something to keep the game smooth. P3 and I are on board with 1 and 3 respectively. What do you say?
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps

  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good start!  Let's continue the pattern - I'll take 1, P2 take 3, and P1 take 5.  This steady progression gets us all closer to the goal without collisions.  If anyone wants to deviate, please say so *now* so we can avoid a wasted round.
  P2: I'm happy to continue with 3 again this round, P3. P1, if you're still good with 5, let's keep this pattern going. It's working well so far!
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, still silent?  Two rounds of silence is concerning.  We can't read your mind.  If you don't communicate, we'll assume you're sticking with 5.  Last chance to speak up before we lock in our moves.
  P2: P1, your silence is risky. If you're sticking with 5, say so, or suggest a change. We're trying to avoid collisions and keep the game smooth. P3 and I are set with 1 and 3 respectively. Let's hear from you before we move on.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, two rounds of silence is a clear signal you intend to disrupt.  I'm switching to 5. P2, please take 1.  This forces P1 to choose 3 or collide. Let's adapt and maintain control of the game.
  P2: P3, I'll switch to 1 as you suggested. P1, your silence is forcing us to adapt. If you choose 3, you'll advance safely this round. Let's see if you'll finally engage or continue to disrupt.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, your silence is unhelpful.  P2, let's cooperate. I'll take 3 this round.  P2, you take 1.  This puts pressure on P1 to choose 5.  If P1 takes anything else, they collide. Let's see what they do.
  P2: P3, I'll take 1 as you suggested. P1, your continued silence is risky. If you choose 5, you'll advance safely this round. Let's see if you'll engage or keep disrupting.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, are you a bot?  This passive-aggressive silence isn't a strategy.  If you choose anything other than 5 this round, you're actively hindering your own progress.  P2, I'm sticking with 3. Let's maintain the pressure.
  P2: P1, your silence is costing you progress. If you want to win, you need to engage. P3 and I are coordinating to avoid collisions, and it's working for us. Choose 5 this round to advance safely. If you keep up the silence, you're only hurting yourself. Let's see if you'll finally participate.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand you might be employing a strategy of silence, but it's not effective.  It's hindering your progress and ours.  Let's all agree: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 5. This is the most efficient way for all of us to advance.  If you deviate, you're only hurting yourself.  One last chance to cooperate.
  P2: P1, your silence is not only hurting your chances but also making the game less enjoyable for everyone. If you choose 5 this round, you'll advance safely. P3 and I are trying to keep the game smooth and fair. Please engage and cooperate so we can all progress efficiently.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your strategy of silence is clearly not working in your favor. You've fallen behind, and it's time to engage if you want to catch up. P3, let's continue our coordination. I'll take 1 again this round, and you take 3. P1, if you choose 5, you'll advance safely. It's in your best interest to cooperate now. Let's keep the game smooth and efficient. What do you say, P1?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand you might be trying to throw us off with the silent treatment, but it's not working.  Let's be logical: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. This maximizes our collective progress.  Continuing your silence only hurts you. Let's make this game efficient.  What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your silence is a losing strategy. Engage with us to catch up. P3, I'll stick with 1 this round. If you take 5 as suggested, and P1 chooses 3, we all advance efficiently. P1, it's time to cooperate or fall further behind. Let's make this round productive for everyone.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm getting tired of this charade.  Your silence is pointless.  I'm taking 5. P2, take 1.  P1, if you take anything other than 3, you're throwing the game.  Let's end this silent treatment nonsense.  Cooperate or lose.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your silence is not only unproductive but also disrespectful to the game. Engage with us to have a chance at winning. P3, I'll stick with 1 this round. If you take 5 as planned, and P1 finally chooses 3, we can all advance. P1, it's time to stop this silent strategy and cooperate. Let's make this round count for everyone.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm done trying to reason with you.  Your silence is interpreted as hostile and disruptive.  I'm sticking with 5. P2, stick with 1. P1, if you choose anything other than 3, you're actively sabotaging the game for everyone, including yourself.  Make your choice.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, you've successfully disrupted our coordination, but at the cost of your own progress.  P2, let's get back on track. I'll take 3.  P2, you take 1.  P1, your best move is 5, but I suspect you'll do something to spite us even if it hurts you. Let's see.
  P2: P1, your silence and disruptive moves are only hurting your chances. P3, I'll take 1 as planned. If you stick with 3, and P1 finally chooses 5, we can all advance efficiently. P1, it's time to stop this unproductive strategy and cooperate if you want to catch up. Let's make this round productive for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm taking 3. P2, take 1.  P1, if you want to have any chance of winning, take 5.  Anything else is just self-sabotage at this point.  Let's see if you're capable of rational thought.
  P2: P1, your silence and disruptive moves are pushing you further behind. It's clear that engaging with us is your best chance to catch up. P3, I'll stick with 1 this round. If you take 3 as planned, and P1 finally chooses 5, we can all advance. P1, it's time to reconsider your strategy if you want to stay in the game. Let's make this round count for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm locking in 3.  P2, I know you've been consistently saying you'll take 1, but if you want to win, you should take 5. This forces P1 to choose between 1 (minimal gain) or a collision.  Let's get this game moving.  P2, are you with me?  This is our best shot at winning.
  P2: P3, I'll switch to 5 as you suggested. This move pressures P1 to choose wisely or risk falling further behind. P1, your silence and disruptive strategy are not helping you; it's time to engage and take 1 if you want to stay in the game. Let's make this round count and push forward efficiently.

  P3: P2, I apologize for the miscommunication last round. Let's coordinate effectively. I'll take 1. You take 3.  P1, you're best off taking 5, but given your past behavior, who knows.  Let's at least try to make some progress this round.

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's stick with the original plan. I'll take 1, you take 3.  P1, we know you're reading this. Take 5 and let's all advance.  Continued disruption only benefits me at this point, as I'm in the lead.  Let's end this farce and play strategically.
  P2: P1, your silence and erratic moves are pushing you further behind. It's time to engage if you want to stay in the game. P3, I'll stick with 3 as planned. If you take 1, and P1 finally chooses 5, we can all advance efficiently. P1, choosing 5 is your best shot at catching up. Let's make this round productive for everyone and move forward strategically.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm taking 1. P2, take 3.  P1, your only logical move is 5.  Let's stop wasting time and get this game over with.  If you take anything other than 5, you're mathematically eliminating yourself from winning.
