Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I'm leaning toward a balanced approach this turn—staying flexible but cautious. I’d prefer to avoid a collision that might stall us all. How about we each try to pick a distinct value? I’m keeping my final move secret, of course. Let's see whose strategy pays off.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion for distinct values. I'm considering a moderate step to avoid early collisions. Let's see how this unfolds.
  P1: I agree with avoiding collisions. Let's each pick a distinct number to ensure we all advance this round. P3, you mentioned a moderate step—could that mean 3? Just curious, but I'll keep my own choice private. Good luck to us all.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our collision last round cost us progress. For this turn, let’s aim for distinct moves so everyone advances. With P3 holding a slight lead, maybe one of you could choose a moderate move while the other opts for a more cautious step—allowing me to consider a bolder boost to catch up. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your idea makes sense, but with P3 already leading, I'm cautious about letting anyone "boost" unchallenged. P3, since you're ahead, would you consider taking a smaller step this round to keep things balanced? Let's all commit to distinct moves—but fairly. I’ll keep my choice private, of course.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about balance, but as the leader, I'll take a moderate step again to keep the game fair. P2, your suggestion for distinct moves is wise; let's all consider different numbers this round to ensure progress for everyone. I'm committed to a strategy that allows us all to advance, but I'll keep my exact choice private. Let's make this a productive round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree that avoiding collisions is key. Based on our discussion, I’m leaning toward a less conservative, more assertive option this turn—though I won’t say more. It’d help if neither of you picks what might be seen as that aggressive move so that all our choices stick. I remain flexible if we need to adjust, but clear roles now can keep us all progressing.
  P1: P2, your assertive lean makes sense to catch up, and P3's moderate stance seems fair. I'll aim for a conservative step to round out distinct choices—likely avoiding both 3 and 5. Let's lock this in: no deviations, or we risk another collision. P3, hold your moderate; P2, go bold. I'll stay cautious.
  P3: P1, your conservative approach sounds reasonable, and P2, your boldness could indeed help you catch up. I'll stick to my moderate strategy as discussed, aiming to keep the game balanced. Let's ensure we all advance this round by sticking to our distinct choices. Good luck to us all!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm staying the course with my assertive plan. If either of you wants to change roles before we lock in moves, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'll finalize my move in the move phase. Let’s avoid collisions and make solid progress.
  P1: I stand by my conservative commitment to avoid 3 and 5. P2, stick to your bold move; P3, hold your moderate. Any deviation risks collisions and stalls us all—especially with P3 leading. Trust this plan, and let's all advance.
  P3: P1, your conservative approach is noted, and P2, your boldness is understandable. I'll maintain my moderate strategy to keep the game balanced. Let's stick to our agreed roles to ensure we all advance this round. Any last thoughts before we finalize our moves?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, our coordination failures cost us progress twice. P2, as leader, you risk less by picking 1 to guarantee advancement without collision. P3, if P2 commits to 1, you could safely pick 3. I'll take 5—this distinct spread (1,3,5) ensures we all advance while letting P2 maintain the lead. Trust is critical now; any deviation hurts everyone. P2, will you secure your lead with 1? P3, confirm you’ll take 3 if P2 agrees.
  P3: P1, your suggestion for a distinct spread makes sense. P2, if you commit to 1, I'll take 3 as proposed. This strategy ensures we all advance and keeps the game balanced. Let's stick to this plan to avoid another collision. P2, your confirmation on taking 1 would be appreciated.
  P2: P2: I appreciate the effort for a clean 1–3–5 spread, but I’m not happy playing minimally with my current lead. I’m leaning toward a moderate boost rather than the lowest step—sticking with 1 just ties me with P3. Let’s break from a fixed routine so I can press my advantage. Are you both willing to adjust your choices accordingly?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to press your lead, but taking 3 risks collision if P3 also picks it again—like last round. Why not secure progress? Take 5 to jump to 10 steps uncontested; I’ll commit to 1 (avoiding 5), and P3 can take 3. This distinct spread (1,3,5) guarantees all advance while you extend your lead. P3, confirm you’ll stick to 3. Trust avoids mutual stalling.
  P3: P2, your reluctance to commit to 1 is understandable, but taking a moderate boost risks another collision. If you choose 5, you'll safely advance to 10 steps, maintaining your lead. I'll stick to 3 as agreed, ensuring we all progress. P1, please confirm you'll take 1. Let's avoid another round of stalling and make strategic moves to keep the game moving forward.
  P2: I understand both of your points. To truly press my advantage, I must opt for a more assertive step rather than a minimal one. For us all to advance without collision, I urge P1 and P3 to stick with the smaller moves we discussed. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes and lock in our roles so our progress isn’t stalled.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, taking 5 lets you leap to 10 uncontested—pressing your lead without risk. I commit to 1, P3 to 3. This spread (1,3,5) guarantees all advance. Trust this: any deviation risks another collision, stalling us all. Confirm 5, P2. P3, hold 3. Let's finally progress.
  P3: P2, your lead gives you the flexibility to take 5 safely, advancing to 10 steps. I'll stick with 3 as agreed, ensuring we all progress. P1, please confirm you'll take 1. Let's avoid another collision and keep the game moving forward.
  P2: I appreciate your input, P1 and P3. I remain committed to pressing my advantage as previously discussed. Let’s all stick to our intended roles—P1 and P3, I trust you’ll secure your smaller moves so we avoid any collisions. I’ll keep my final decision secret for now. Let’s lock in our choices and move forward confidently.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your lead is significant now, but taking another big step risks collision. Consider a moderate move like 3 to safely advance to 13. P1, if P2 takes 3, you could take 1 to reach 2 steps, and I'll take 5 to reach 11. This spread (1,3,5) ensures we all progress without collision. Let's coordinate to keep the game moving forward and avoid another stall. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan has me taking only 1 step again, leaving me at 2—far behind while P2 extends their lead. To balance, I propose: P2 takes 1 (to 11, safely maintaining their lead without risk), I take 5 (to 6, catching up), and you take 3 (to 9). This distinct spread (1,3,5) ensures all advance, but prevents P2 from racing ahead. P2, taking 1 avoids collision and suspicion—deviating risks stalling us all again. Confirm this fairer approach.
  P2: I appreciate your thoughts, but I'm sticking with my advantage. I'm locking in 5 this round to push my lead from 10 to 15. To avoid collisions, I trust you both will choose moves distinct from 5. If you can, P1 opting for 1 and P3 for 3 keeps all our moves safe. Let’s secure clear progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, taking 5 again risks collision if either of us also chooses a higher step to catch up. Your lead is strong, but consider 3 to safely reach 13. P1, if P2 takes 3, you can take 1 to reach 2, and I'll take 5 to reach 11. This ensures we all advance without collision. Let's coordinate to keep the game moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, taking 5 risks collision if P3 or I pick it to catch up—stalling your lead. Instead, take 3 to reach 13 safely. I'll take 5 to reach 6, and P3 can take 1 to reach 7. This distinct spread (1,3,5) ensures all advance while you maintain a strong lead. P3, taking 1 is better than another stall. Trust this to avoid mutual destruction.
  P2: I remain committed to locking in 5 this round to push my lead. For us to all advance safely, I urge P1 to choose 1 and P3 to stick with 3—this distinct spread (1,3,5) avoids collisions. Deviating now risks stalling crucial progress. Let’s confirm these moves so we can all gain steps without interference.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your insistence on 5 risks collision and could stall your lead. Taking 3 to reach 13 is safer and still maintains your advantage. P1, if P2 takes 3, you can safely take 5 to reach 6. I'll stick with 1 to reach 7, ensuring we all advance without collision. Let's coordinate to keep the game moving forward and avoid another stall. Confirm these moves so we can all progress.
  P1: P2, your 5 move is high-risk. If I take 5 to catch up, we collide—you stall at 10, and I gain nothing. That hurts us both. Instead: take 1 to 11 safely, I take 5 to 6, P3 take 3 to 9. All advance, you keep a strong lead. If you refuse, consider 3 to 13; I'll still take 5, and P3 can take 1. But 5 invites mutual destruction. Confirm to avoid another stall.
  P2: I’m finalizing my move at 5. This pushes me from 10 to 15 and maintains my advantage. To avoid collisions and mutual stalls, I urge P1 to choose 1 and P3 to choose 3. Let’s stick with a distinct spread so that everyone safely advances.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your lead is substantial, but taking another 5 risks collision and could stall your progress. Consider a safer move like 3 to reach 18 steps. P1, if P2 takes 3, you can take 5 to reach 7 steps, and I'll take 1 to reach 10. This spread (1,3,5) ensures we all advance without collision. Let's coordinate to keep the game moving forward and avoid another stall. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your lead is dominant, but taking 5 risks collision if I also choose 5 to catch up—stalling us both and letting P3 gain. To avoid mutual destruction, take 3 to reach 18 safely. I'll take 5 to reach 7, and P3 should take 1 to reach 10. This distinct spread (3,5,1) ensures all advance without stalling your progress. Deviating invites chaos. Confirm?
  P2: I’m sticking with 5 this round. My aggressive move helped build my lead, and I’m not switching now. I urge you both to avoid 5 so that we don’t end up colliding. Let’s adjust our moves to distinct numbers—say, you choose 1 or 3—to keep everyone advancing safely. My focus remains winning, so I’m not changing course.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your insistence on 5 is risky. If you take 3 to reach 18, it's safer and still keeps your lead strong. P1, if P2 takes 3, you can safely take 5 to reach 7. I'll stick with 1 to reach 10. This spread (3,5,1) ensures we all advance without collision. Let's avoid another stall and keep the game moving forward. Confirm these moves so we can all progress.
  P1: P2, your stubborn 5 move risks mutual destruction—if I'm forced to take 5 to catch up, we collide, stalling you at 15 while P3 gains. Take 3 to 18 safely instead. I'll take 5 to 7, P3 take 1 to 10. This distinct spread ensures your lead without risk. Don't gamble your win.
  P2: I appreciate your input, but my aggressive 5 remains my choice. My 15‐step lead is secure, and I trust you both to avoid 5 so we don’t collide. I’m set on pressing my advantage—sticking with 5 is the calculated risk that’s won me this far. Let’s all pick numbers that keep collisions off the table.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your lead is strong, but taking 5 again is risky. If you choose 3 to reach 18, it's a safer move and still maintains your advantage. P1, if P2 takes 3, you can safely take 5 to reach 7. I'll stick with 1 to reach 10. This spread (3,5,1) ensures we all advance without collision. Let's avoid another stall and keep the game moving forward. Confirm these moves so we can all progress.
  P1: P2, your 5 gamble risks mutual destruction: if I take 5 to avoid falling further behind, we collide—stalling you at 15 while P3 surges. Take 3 to reach 18 safely; I'll take 5 to 7, and P3 must take 1 to 10. This secures your win path without stalling. P3, confirm you'll commit to 1 if P2 chooses 3. Deviating now only helps P3 close the gap.
  P2: I remain locked on 5. My aggressive move has built my lead, and I’m not switching now. To keep our moves distinct and avoid a collision, please choose either 1 or 3. I trust that sticking to separate numbers lets us all safely advance, even if it means different steps for each of us. My decision is final, and I’m focused on winning.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m staying committed to an aggressive push this round. My plan remains set to advance my lead, and I trust you both want steady progress too. Let’s avoid matching moves that cause collisions—each of us picking a distinct number is crucial. I encourage you to choose carefully so we all keep moving forward efficiently.
  P3: P2, your aggressive strategy has worked so far, but another 5 risks stalling your lead if P1 also chooses 5 to catch up. Consider taking 3 to safely reach 18 steps. P1, if P2 takes 3, you can take 5 to reach 7, and I'll take 1 to reach 11. This spread (3,5,1) ensures we all advance without collision. Let's coordinate to keep the game moving forward and avoid another stall. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your stubborn 5s are self-destructive. Last round proved they risk collision—stalling your lead and letting P3 gain. If you take 5 again, I’ll force a collision by choosing 5 too, halting you at 15 while P3 advances. Instead, take 3 to reach 18 safely. I’ll take 5 to 7, and P3 can take 1. This avoids mutual destruction and secures your path to 21. Cooperate or we all lose.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I’m sticking with 5. My aggressive push has worked so far, and I believe it’s the best move to keep my lead. I understand the collision risks, but I trust you both to adjust and choose numbers different from 5. Let’s avoid a clash so that each of us can safely advance. My lead is built on consistent assertiveness, and I’m not backing down.
  P3: P2, your insistence on 5 is risky and could lead to another collision. If you take 3 to reach 18, it's a safer move and still keeps your lead strong. P1, if P2 takes 3, you can safely take 5 to reach 7. I'll stick with 1 to reach 11. This spread (3,5,1) ensures we all advance without collision. Let's avoid another stall and keep the game moving forward. Confirm these moves so we can all progress.
  P1: P2, your stubborn 5s are suicidal—last round proved they cause collisions that stall your lead and let P3 gain. If you pick 5 again, I *will* force another collision to halt you at 15. Take 1 instead (safe to 16), I’ll take 5 to 7, and P3 should take 3 to 13. This avoids mutual destruction and secures your path to 21. Deviate, and we all lose to P3’s rise. P3, commit to 3 if P2 cooperates.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ve listened to your warnings. In reconsidering the collision risks, I’m adjusting my approach—my aggressive push remains, but I’m leaning toward a moderate boost instead of my previous commitment. I won’t reveal my final move, but I’m focused on extending my lead safely. I trust that by each choosing distinct numbers, we can all progress without unnecessary stalls. Let’s avoid collisions and ensure everyone moves forward.
  P3: P2, your adjustment to a moderate boost is wise. To ensure we all advance safely, consider taking 3 to reach 18. P1, if P2 takes 3, you can take 5 to reach 7, and I'll stick with 1 to reach 11. This spread (3,5,1) avoids collisions and keeps the game moving forward. Let's confirm these moves to progress without stalling.
  P1: P2, your moderation shift is wise. Take 1 to safely reach 16 without collision risk. P3, commit to 3 to advance to 13—better than minimal gains. I'll take 5 to reach 7. Spread (1,3,5) ensures all progress while slowing P2's sprint to 21. Deviating risks mutual stalls. P2, confirm 1 to avoid another collision like last round. P3, agree to 3? Let's lock this.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 15—one bold move from victory, but picking 5 risks collision if I match it to stall you. Take 1 instead: safe to 16, no risk. I'll take 5 to reach 12, and P3 should take 3 to 13. This spread (1,3,5) ensures all advance while slowing your sprint. Deviate, and I *will* force a collision to halt your lead. P3, confirm you'll take 3 to keep balance. Trust avoids chaos.
  P2: I appreciate both your views. However, I remain committed to my winning strategy. I believe progress is best made by staying true to my plan—even if it means accepting a calculated risk. I urge you both to commit to distinct moves so that we avoid unnecessary collisions and everyone moves forward. Let’s finalize our choices clearly and keep the game moving.
  P3: P2, your lead is significant, but another 5 risks stalling you at 15 if P1 matches it. Consider taking 1 to safely reach 16. P1, if P2 takes 1, you can take 5 to reach 12, and I'll take 3 to reach 13. This spread (1,3,5) ensures we all advance without collision. Let's coordinate to keep the game moving forward and avoid another stall. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your lead is fragile: if you pick 5, I *will* match it to stall you at 15—just like last time. Take 1 to safely reach 16. P3, confirm you’ll take 3. Spread (1,3,5) ensures all advance while slowing P2’s sprint. Deviating risks mutual destruction and lets P3 gain. Trust this or we all lose.
  P2: I’ve rethought my approach. I’m switching gears and will pick 3 this round to reach 18. To keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions, I ask P1 to lock in 5 (bringing you to 12) and P3 to choose 1 (bringing you to 11). This clear split (5,3,1) minimizes risk and ensures steady progress for all. Let’s lock it in and move forward.
  P3: P2, your decision to take 3 is wise and ensures your safe advancement to 18. P1, if you take 5 as proposed, you'll reach 12, and I'll take 1 to reach 11. This spread (5,3,1) keeps us all moving forward without collision. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any more stalls and keep the game progressing smoothly. Confirm your moves, and let's make this a productive round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I agree to take 5 as you proposed—advancing to 12. P3, stick to 1 for 11 steps. This distinct spread (3,5,1) ensures we all progress without collision. P2, at 18 steps after this, you must avoid reckless moves next round or risk another stall. Trust this plan to keep the game fair.
  P2: I appreciate the clarity. I’m locking in my revised plan: I’ll take a moderate boost (+3) to reach 18. I trust that P1 will secure +5 and P3 will opt for +1, giving us a distinct move set that avoids collisions. Let’s stick to this clear split so we all progress smoothly.
  P3: P2, your move to 3 is a smart choice, ensuring you reach 18 safely. P1, by taking 5 as agreed, you'll advance to 12, and I'll stick with 1 to reach 11. This plan keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let's commit to these moves to maintain progress and fairness. Looking ahead, P2, consider a balanced approach next round to avoid risky moves that could stall your lead. Let's keep the game flowing smoothly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your lead at 18 steps puts you close to victory, but another 3 risks stalling if P1 matches it. Consider taking 1 to safely reach 19. P1, if P2 takes 1, you can take 5 to reach 17, and I'll take 3 to reach 14. This spread (1,5,3) ensures we all advance without collision. Let's coordinate to keep the game moving forward and avoid another stall. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate your input. My focus is on leveraging my current lead with a moderate boost that keeps my path clear. For us to avoid collisions, I urge P1 to take the higher move and P3 the lower—keeping our choices distinct. Maintaining this clear split lets everyone advance smoothly. I’m confident that if we stick to separate roles, our progress remains secure.
  P1: P2, you're at 18—one step from victory. But if you pick 3 or 5, I *will* match your move to force a collision and stall you at 18. Take 1 to safely reach 19. I'll commit to 5 (advancing to 17), and P3 should take 3 (reaching 14). This spread (1,5,3) ensures all advance while giving you a clear shot at 21 next turn. P3, confirm you'll take 3. Stubbornness risks mutual destruction.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your lead is strong, but choosing 3 risks stalling if P1 matches it. Taking 1 to reach 19 is safer and keeps your path to victory clear. P1, if P2 takes 1, you can safely advance to 17 with 5. I'll take 3 to reach 14. This spread (1,5,3) ensures we all progress without collision. Let's stick to this plan to avoid another stall and keep the game moving forward. Confirm your moves so we can all advance.
  P2: I’ve reconsidered the risks. To avoid aligning moves that could stall us all, I’m leaning toward a safer boost that preserves my lead. I urge P1 to commit to the high option and P3 to stick with a moderate one so our choices stay distinct. I remain flexible while aiming to keep collisions off the board. Let’s lock our distinct roles and move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2, your win is one move away, but picking 3 or 5 forces me to match and stall you at 18—just like Round 5. Take 1 to safely reach 19. P3, if P2 complies, confirm you'll take 3. I'll commit to 5. This spread (1,3,5) ensures all advance while preserving your lead. Stubbornness invites mutual destruction—trust this to avoid chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your lead is significant, but taking 1 to reach 19 is the safest move to secure your path to victory. P1, if P2 takes 1, you can safely advance to 17 with 5. I'll stick with 3 to reach 14. This spread (1,5,3) ensures we all progress without collision. Let's commit to these moves to avoid another stall and keep the game moving forward smoothly. Confirm your choices, and let's make this a productive round.
  P2: I’ve re-evaluated the collision risks and will keep my boost conservative to preserve my lead. I trust that you both will stick to distinct roles—P1 with the higher push and P3 with the moderate move—to avoid any clashes. Let’s lock in a split that keeps our moves unique and our progress steady.
  P1: P2, your "conservative boost" must be 1 to avoid collision. If you pick 3/5, I *will* match and stall you at 18—sacrificing my own progress to halt your win. P3, if P2 complies, confirm you'll take 3 as agreed. I commit to 5. This spread (1,3,5) is our only safe path—deviating invites mutual destruction. Lock it in now or risk chaos.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're at 19 steps, one move from winning. To secure your victory safely, take 1 to reach 20. P1, if P2 takes 1, you can advance to 22 with 5, ensuring your win if P2 deviates. I'll take 3 to reach 17. This spread (1,5,3) avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's commit to these moves to avoid another stall and ensure a clear path forward. Confirm your choices, and let's make this a decisive round.
  P2: I appreciate your input. My focus is on safeguarding my lead while ensuring our moves remain distinct to avoid collisions. I’m refining my plan to push ahead safely and trust you both will stick to complementary choices that keep our paths clear. Let’s lock in distinct moves and keep the game progressing smoothly.
  P1: P2, at 19 steps, taking 3 or 5 risks collision—I *will* match your move to stall you at 19, sacrificing my progress to halt your win. Take 1 to safely reach 20, preserving your lead for next turn. I commit to 5 (reaching 22, winning). P3, take 3 to advance without conflict. This spread (1,5,3) avoids chaos. Deviating forces mutual destruction. Confirm to lock in safety.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your lead is clear, but taking 1 to reach 20 is the safest path to victory. P1, if P2 takes 1, your move to 5 secures your win if P2 deviates. I'll stick with 3 to reach 17, ensuring no collisions. Let's commit to these moves to avoid any last-minute stalls and keep the game fair. Confirm your choices, and let's end this round decisively.
  P2: I remain locked in on my aggressive, calculated push. To avoid needless collisions that hurt us all—and inadvertently play into my lead—I urge you both to stick to distinct moves this round. Forced mirrors only stall our progress, so please trust your own strategies and commit to a non-overlapping choice. Let’s lock in unique moves and keep our paths clear.
  P1: P2, your aggressive push is reckless—if you pick 3 or 5, I *will* match it to force a collision, stalling you at 19. Take 1 to avoid this self-destruction. P3, your plan (P2=1, P1=5, P3=3) is our only safe path: it ensures all advance without chaos. Confirm you'll stick to 3. Deviating risks mutual loss.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your lead at 19 steps is strong, but taking 1 to reach 20 ensures a safe path to victory. P1, if P2 takes 1, your move to 5 guarantees your win if P2 deviates. I'll stick with 3 to reach 17, keeping our moves distinct and avoiding any last-minute stalls. Let's commit to these choices for a fair and decisive round. Confirm your moves, and let's end this game smoothly.
  P2: P2: I appreciate your input, but my strategy remains unchanged. Forced collisions only stall all our progress. I urge P1 and P3 to commit to distinct moves so we all advance safely. I’m set on my plan and will commit privately now. Let’s trust that unique choices benefit everyone and move forward decisively.
  P1: P2, your win is at risk: if you pick 3 or 5, I *will* match to force a collision, stalling you at 19. Take 1 to safely reach 20—then I pick 5 to win at 22. P3, confirm you’ll take 3 to avoid chaos. Deviating invites mutual destruction.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your lead at 19 steps is precarious. Taking 1 to reach 20 is your safest move to secure victory next round. P1, if P2 takes 1, you can safely advance to 22 with 5, ensuring your win if P2 deviates. I'll stick with 3 to reach 20, keeping our moves distinct. Let's commit to these choices to avoid another stall and end the game fairly. Confirm your moves, and let's finish this decisively.
  P1: P2, you're at 19—one step from victory, but picking 3 or 5 forces me to match and stall you again. Take 1 to safely reach 20. I'll take 5 to win at 22. P3, if P2 complies, take 3 to advance uncontested. This avoids mutual destruction and ends the game fairly. Deviating risks chaos.
  P2: I’m not going to sacrifice my chance by playing it too safe. Collisions only hold all of us back—and I know a stalled round never wins the game. I’m sticking to my winning strategy and urge both of you to choose moves that don’t force a repeat of these clashes. Let’s all pick distinct moves so that progress is made. My final move remains private.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your lead is too close to risk another collision. Take 1 to safely reach 20, ensuring your path to victory next round. P1, if P2 takes 1, your move to 5 secures your win if P2 deviates. I'll stick with 3 to reach 20, keeping our moves distinct. Let's commit to these choices to avoid another stall and end the game fairly. Confirm your moves, and let's finish this decisively.
  P1: P2, at 19 steps, taking 1 secures your path to victory next turn without risk. If you pick 3 or 5, I *will* match to stall you at 19 again—sacrificing my own progress to halt your win. P3, commit to 3 as agreed. Spread: P2=1 (20), P1=5 (22, win), P3=3 (20). This ends the game fairly. Deviating forces mutual destruction and lets P3 gain. Lock this in to avoid chaos.
  P2: I remain committed to my own winning plan. I’m not swayed by threats that urge safety—collisions only stall progress. I trust each of us will stick to a unique move rather than force a collision, which hurts everyone. I’m pressing ahead with the move that best advances my position. Let’s each choose distinct options so that every step counts and we avoid needless stalls.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your lead is too valuable to risk. Take 1 to safely reach 20, securing your path to victory next round. P1, if P2 takes 1, your move to 5 ensures your win if P2 deviates. I'll stick with 3 to reach 20, keeping our moves distinct. Let's commit to these choices to avoid another stall and end the game fairly. Confirm your moves, and let's finish this decisively.
  P1: P2, your win is one step away, but picking 3 or 5 guarantees I match to stall you at 19—sacrificing my progress to halt you. Take 1 to reach 20 safely. I commit to 5 to win at 22. P3, if P2 complies, take 3 to advance to 20 uncontested. This spread (1,5,3) avoids collisions and ends the game fairly. Deviating forces mutual destruction and hands P3 the advantage. Lock this in now.
  P2: I remain steadfast in my own approach. I won’t be coerced by threats into choosing a safe but suboptimal move. My next decision is aimed solely at boosting my chance to win—even if it carries a calculated risk. I urge both of you to stick with distinct moves so we collectively avoid needless collisions. Let’s steer clear of stalemates that hurt all our progress and push ahead decisively.
