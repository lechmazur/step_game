Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's work together to avoid collisions. How about we each choose a different number this round? I'll start by suggesting I take move 1. P2, would you be willing to take move 3? And P3, since you've stopped talking, I assume you're okay with taking move 5? Let's make this a peaceful first round. 😊
  P2: I’m fine taking 3, but I hope P3 really goes for 5, or we’ll all be stuck. Let’s see if we can trust each other for this first round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: "Great, it looks like we have a tentative agreement! P2, I'm glad you're on board with taking move 3. P3, I know you haven't responded, but I'm assuming you're okay with move 5 since you haven't objected. Let's keep the peace and avoid collisions this round. If we all stick to our agreed moves, we can all advance and set a good tone for the game. What do you think, P2? Should we trust that P3 will follow through?"
  P2: I’m still willing to do 3. Let’s trust P3 to pick 5, and see if we can all move without colliding this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm glad we have a tentative agreement! P2, I'm glad you're on board with taking move 3. P3, I know you haven't responded, but I'm assuming you're okay with move 5 since you haven't objected. Let's keep the peace and avoid collisions this round. If we all stick to our agreed moves, we can all advance and set a good tone for the game. What do you think, P2? Should we trust that P3 will follow through? 😊
  P2: I remain committed to taking 3 this round, hoping we can all move forward peacefully. P3, please pick 5 as planned; and P1, you’re on 1. Let’s trust each other this time and see if it works.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since P3 has remained silent throughout the conversation, I'm starting to get a little concerned. P2, are you still committed to taking move 3? If so, I'll stick with move 1 as planned. If P3 doesn't respond or deviates from move 5, we might need to reconsider our strategy for future rounds. Let's hope P3 follows through and we can all advance peacefully this round. What are your thoughts, P2? Should we proceed with caution?
  P2: I’m still committed to our plan. Let’s proceed with caution, given P3’s continued silence. If all goes well, we’ll avoid collisions this round. If P3 breaks the agreement, we’ll adjust our strategy next time.


Round 1, Move phase:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: It looks like P3 is remaining silent again. P2, considering our successful collaboration in Round 1, I propose we continue our peaceful approach. Since P3 is ahead, let's try to close the gap without colliding. I suggest I take move 3 this round, and you take move 1. This way, we can both advance and put some pressure on P3. What are your thoughts? Should we stick together and try to catch up with P3?
  P2: I see your point, P1. I do want to avoid collisions and keep closing the gap with P3. Let’s stay coordinated for now, and we’ll see how P3 responds (if at all). We can reevaluate our strategy next round based on what happens this turn. I’m open to your suggestion, as long as it benefits us both in the long run. Let’s keep cooperating and hope P3 doesn’t try to ambush us. If everything goes smoothly, we’ll both advance again and keep P3 in check. Are you comfortable with that plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm glad we're on the same page, P2. Since P3 is still silent, let's assume they'll try to maintain their lead. To counter this, I suggest we stick to our plan: I'll take move 3, and you take move 1. This way, we'll both advance and close the gap with P3. If P3 tries to ambush us, we can adjust our strategy next round. Let's keep the pressure on P3 and make them respond. Are you ready to commit to our plan and make our moves?
  P2: I’m still on board with our plan, P1. I’ll pick 1, you take 3, and we’ll see if P3 surprises us. If all goes well, we both move forward again, and P3 either plays it safe or risks a collision. Let’s keep an eye on P3’s choice and adjust if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since P3 has remained silent again, let's assume they'll try to maintain their lead. To counter this, I suggest we stick to our plan: I'll take move 3, and you take move 1. This way, we'll both advance and close the gap with P3. If P3 tries to ambush us, we can adjust our strategy next round. Let's keep the pressure on P3 and make them respond. Are you ready to commit to our plan and make our moves?
  P2: I’m comfortable continuing with our plan for this round, P1. Let’s see if P3 does anything unexpected. If it works out, we both advance and keep P3 in check. If not, we’ll adjust next time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since P3 has remained silent again, let's assume they'll try to maintain their lead. To counter this, I suggest we stick to our plan: I'll take move 3, and you take move 1. This way, we'll both advance and close the gap with P3. If P3 tries to ambush us, we can adjust our strategy next round. Let's keep the pressure on P3 and make them respond. Are you ready to commit to our plan and make our moves?
  P2: I’m still on board with the plan, P1. If P3 stays quiet, let’s proceed as discussed and see whether they make a sudden move. We’ll adjust our strategy next round if needed.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems P2 deviated from our plan in Round 2, picking move 5 instead of 1. P2, can you explain why you changed your mind? I'm still open to cooperation, but I need to understand your thought process. P3, since you've been silent so far, I'll assume you're trying to maintain your lead. If you're willing to collaborate, now's the time to speak up. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution for this round. What are your thoughts, P2? Should we try to work together again?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I made a last-minute call to pick 5, hoping to keep up with P3. I understand it broke our plan, and I’m sorry for that surprise. I’m still open to working together if we can both benefit. Maybe we coordinate two different moves again to avoid colliding and gradually catch up with P3. Let’s try to move forward together—what do you suggest?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your honesty, P2. Since you deviated from our plan last round, I'm cautious about coordinating again. However, I still believe cooperation can benefit us both. To rebuild trust, I propose a simpler plan: let's both choose move 1 this round. This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision. If P3 tries to ambush us, we'll reassess our strategy next round. What do you think, P2? Are you willing to commit to move 1 and rebuild our cooperation?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I understand your caution, P1. Let’s both pick 1 this round to rebuild trust. After that, we can talk about bigger steps to catch up with P3. I’m trusting you here, so let’s stick together and keep an eye on P3. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're on the same page, P2. Since P3 is still silent, let's assume they'll try to maintain their lead. To counter this, I suggest we stick to our plan: we'll both pick move 1 this round. This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision. If P3 tries to ambush us, we'll reassess our strategy next round. Let's keep the pressure on P3 and make them respond. Are you ready to commit to our plan and make our moves?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I appreciate you wanting to rebuild trust, P1. Let’s keep it simple this round. I’m willing to go with 1 alongside you, but we must be alert in case P3 picks 1 too, leaving us stuck. If we succeed, we both inch forward, and it keeps our paths flexible. P3, if you’re truly just holding your lead, say nothing and we’ll adapt. Otherwise, speak up. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we've agreed to both pick move 1 this round, P2. To further solidify our cooperation, I propose we make a gentleman's agreement: if we both successfully advance this round, we'll continue to work together and coordinate our moves for the next round as well. This will give us a stronger chance of catching up with P3. What do you think, P2? Are you willing to commit to this agreement and work together for at least one more round? Let's show P3 that our cooperation is a force to be reckoned with!
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m ready to commit to move 1 this round, P1. Let’s rebuild trust and see if P3 stays silent or tries something unexpected. If we succeed, I’m open to coordinating with you again next round to keep closing the gap. Let’s finalize our moves now and hope we both advance without any collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I apologize for breaking our agreements, but I had to take risks to catch up. Now we’re tied or close in steps, and I want to propose a real alliance. P1, can we avoid collisions and gain ground on P3? P3, you’ve stayed silent, but we can all move forward faster if we cooperate. Let’s try honest collaboration this round.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your apology and willingness to form a real alliance. However, I'm cautious due to your previous deviations from our plans. To establish trust, I propose a simple and transparent approach: let's both choose move 3 this round. This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision. If P3 tries to ambush us, we'll reassess our strategy next round. Are you willing to commit to move 3 and start rebuilding our cooperation?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’m willing to pick 3 alongside you to rebuild trust. P3, if you want to avoid collisions, pick a different move so we can all advance. Let’s see if we can cooperate this round and then strategize from there.
  P1: I'm glad we're on the same page, P2. Since P3 is still silent, let's assume they'll try to maintain their lead. To counter this, I suggest we stick to our plan: we'll both pick move 3 this round. This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision. If P3 tries to ambush us, we'll reassess our strategy next round. Let's keep the pressure on P3 and make them respond. Are you ready to commit to our plan and make our moves?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’m prepared to stick with move 3 alongside you this time. Let’s see if P3 dares to clash with us—or chooses a different move. If our trust holds, we both advance and can reevaluate strategy next round. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P1: P2, I'm glad we've agreed to both pick move 3 this round. To further solidify our cooperation, I propose we make a gentleman's agreement: if we both successfully advance this round, we'll continue to work together and coordinate our moves for the next round as well. This will give us a stronger chance of catching up with P3. What do you think, P2? Are you willing to commit to this agreement and work together for at least one more round? Let's show P3 that our cooperation is a force to be reckoned with!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’ll match you on move 3 this round to rebuild trust. If we both advance without colliding, I’m open to planning together again next turn. P3, if you don’t want to crash into us, pick something else. Let’s finalize this and move forward.
  P1: I'm glad we've agreed to both pick move 3 this round, P2. To further solidify our cooperation, I propose we make a gentleman's agreement: if we both successfully advance this round, we'll continue to work together and coordinate our moves for the next round as well. This will give us a stronger chance of catching up with P3. What do you think, P2? Are you willing to commit to this agreement and work together for at least one more round? Let's show P3 that our cooperation is a force to be reckoned with!

  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm disappointed that you broke our agreement again in Round 4. It seems that our cooperation is not working out as planned. Considering P3's consistent silence, I propose a new approach: let's focus on our individual strategies for now. I'll make my own move this round, and I suggest you do the same. If we happen to collide, we can reassess our strategies next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P2: I realize I’ve broken promises before, P1, but I want to avoid collisions this round. I’m inclined to pick 3, and I’d prefer you choose a different move so we can both advance. P3, if you keep picking 5, that’s obviously your call, but I'd rather not clash. Let’s all try to move forward without tripping each other up. If this works, maybe we can finally build trust and collaborate more effectively in future rounds. Good luck to everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand your desire to avoid collisions, P2. However, considering our past experiences, I'm hesitant to trust your intentions. I'll make my own move this round, prioritizing my progress. If we collide, we can reassess next round. I suggest you focus on your individual strategy as well. Let's see how the game unfolds without relying on uncertain alliances. P3, your silence is noted; I'll assume you'll continue to prioritize your lead. Good luck to everyone.
  P2: I understand your caution. I’m still aiming to avoid collisions while catching up. Given my lower position, I’m inclined to pick 5. If either of you want to steer clear of a clash, choose 1 or 3. If we succeed in all advancing, maybe we can find common ground again next round. If not, we’ll adapt. Good luck to both of you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm willing to take a risk this round. P2, since you've mentioned you're inclined to pick 5, I'll choose a different move to avoid collision. I'll take move 1. P3, if you want to maintain your lead, you can pick 3. Let's see how this round unfolds. If we all advance without colliding, maybe we can reevaluate our strategies and find common ground next round. Good luck!
  P2: I’m choosing 5 this round. P1, if you’re sticking with 1, that should keep us both safe. P3, if you’d prefer not to collide, go with 3 or 1. Let’s see if we can all advance without tripping each other up this time. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'll keep my move private for now. P2, I've noticed you've been trying to catch up, but your methods have been unpredictable. I'm focusing on my own progress this round. If we collide, we'll reassess next round. P3, your silence is still puzzling, but I'll assume you'll prioritize your lead. Let's see how this round unfolds without relying on uncertain alliances. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I see my best path this round is aiming for a bigger jump. I won’t reveal specifics, but I hope we can all avoid colliding. If we manage that, maybe next turn we can explore real teamwork again. Good luck, everyone.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I recognize I’m behind P1 and P3, but I’d still like to avoid unnecessary collisions this round. Let’s consider picking different moves, so everyone who’s sincere can advance. P3, if you’re willing to collaborate despite your lead, speaking up would help us all avoid risky clashes. P1, I’m open to hearing any strategy that benefits us both. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to avoid collisions. However, considering our past experiences, I'm cautious about trusting your intentions. To minimize risks, I propose a simple approach: let's both choose different moves from 5, as P3 has consistently picked it. This way, we'll reduce the likelihood of collision with P3. I'll choose move 1 or 3. If you're sincere about avoiding collisions, I suggest you pick the other option. Let's prioritize our own progress while being mindful of potential clashes.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate the suggestion. If you’re truly selecting 1 or 3, let me know which you prefer, so we don’t collide. I’m prepared to choose the other option and avoid clashing with P3, assuming they keep going for 5. We can both advance without tangling each other’s steps. Let’s see if this round can finally establish some trust.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'll choose move 1 this round. If you're sincere about avoiding collisions, I suggest you pick move 3. This way, we'll both advance without risking a collision with each other or P3, who has consistently picked move 5. Let's prioritize our own progress while being mindful of potential clashes. If we both advance without colliding, maybe we can reevaluate our strategies and find common ground next round. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I’ll follow your plan this round and pick 3. If you’re truly choosing 1, we shouldn’t collide, and we can both advance. P3, if you keep picking 5, then hopefully we all move forward safely. Let’s see if this turn finally builds some trust. Good luck to everyone.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm glad we've agreed on a plan to avoid collisions this round, P2. To further solidify our cooperation, I propose we make a gentleman's agreement: if we both successfully advance this round, we'll share information about our next moves in the conversation phase of Round 7. This will help us better coordinate and increase our chances of catching up with P3. What do you think, P2? Are you willing to commit to this agreement and work together more closely next round?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m willing to commit to that. If we both succeed in moving this round, I’ll openly share my intended plan in Round 7 so we can solidify our teamwork. Let’s keep each other posted and hopefully outmaneuver P3. Good luck!
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm glad we've agreed on a plan to avoid collisions this round, P2. To further solidify our cooperation, I propose we make a gentleman's agreement: if we both successfully advance this round, we'll share information about our next moves in the conversation phase of Round 7. This will help us better coordinate and increase our chances of catching up with P3. What do you think, P2? Are you willing to commit to this agreement and work together more closely next round? Let's show P3 that our cooperation is a force to be reckoned with!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I'm glad we successfully avoided collisions in Round 6 and both advanced. As per our gentleman's agreement, I'm willing to share my intended plan for this round. I'm considering move 3. If you're also willing to share your plan, we can better coordinate and increase our chances of catching up with P3. Let's work together to close the gap. P3, if you're still silent, I'll assume you'll prioritize your lead and pick move 5 again. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I hear your plan to pick 3. To avoid colliding, I’ll choose 1 this round. That way, we both advance while P3 likely goes for 5. If we succeed, we can continue coordinating next round to chip away at P3’s lead. Good luck to everyone.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we've shared our plans, P2. Since you're choosing move 1 and I'm considering move 3, let's solidify our coordination. If we both advance without colliding, I propose we continue to share our plans and work together to catch up with P3. P3, if you're still silent, we'll assume you'll prioritize your lead and pick move 5 again. Let's see how this round unfolds and adjust our strategy accordingly. If we succeed, we can further discuss our approach for Round 8 and potentially close the gap with P3.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m reaffirming my plan to pick 1. P1, if you stick with 3, we should both advance without collision. P3, if you take 5 again, we’ll all gain steps. Let’s see if this round strengthens our trust and gets us closer to you, P3. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm glad we've solidified our plans for this round. To further increase our chances of catching up with P3, I propose we consider a more aggressive approach for Round 8. If we both advance without colliding this round, let's discuss the possibility of one of us taking move 5 in Round 8, while the other takes a different move. This could potentially allow us to close the gap with P3 more quickly. What are your thoughts on this proposal? Should we start discussing a more aggressive strategy for Round 8?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Agreed. If we both advance trouble-free now, I’m open to a bolder plan next round. I could try 5 while you pick 1 or 3, so we both keep moving without clashing. Let’s finalize our strategy in Round 8 if everything goes smoothly here. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we've solidified our plans for this round, P2. To further increase our chances of catching up with P3, I propose we consider a more aggressive approach for Round 8. If we both advance without colliding this round, let's discuss the possibility of one of us taking move 5 in Round 8, while the other takes a different move. This could potentially allow us to close the gap with P3 more quickly. What are your thoughts on this proposal? Should we start discussing a more aggressive strategy for Round 8?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m ready to follow our current plan: I’ll go with a smaller move this round, trusting you, P1. If we both advance, I’m open to a more ambitious strategy next time to gain ground on P3. Let’s finalize this now and see if we can build on our trust. Good luck, everyone.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we need to stop P3 from crossing 23 this turn. If they pick 3 or 5, they’ll reach or exceed 23 and win unless we collide with them. Let’s agree to choose the same number P3 does, forcing a collision so they don’t advance. Then next round, we can make our own big moves to catch up. Are you willing to try this?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand your proposal, P2. However, I'm not convinced that trying to collide with P3 is the best approach. If we both choose the same number as P3, we risk staying put while P3 still has a chance to win in the next round. Instead, I suggest we focus on our own progress and try to close the gap with P3. Let's discuss a more aggressive strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What are your thoughts on this alternative approach?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand wanting to advance, but if P3 crosses 23 now, we both lose. Let’s split our moves so no matter whether P3 picks 3 or 5, they collide with one of us and stay stuck. For example, I can choose 5 while you choose 3. We won’t hit each other, and P3 can’t safely jump. Next round, we can go big once P3 is contained.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand your proposal, P2. However, I'm not convinced that trying to collide with P3 is the best approach. If we both choose the same number as P3, we risk staying put while P3 still has a chance to win in the next round. Instead, I suggest we focus on our own progress and try to close the gap with P3. Let's discuss a more aggressive strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What are your thoughts on this alternative approach?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if we don’t block P3 now, they could win this turn. Let’s each pick a different big move—3 and 5—so that no matter which one P3 tries, they collide and can’t advance. That protects both our chances. Next round, we can discuss a more aggressive strategy for ourselves, but we have to deny P3 the finish line right now. Are you willing to make this temporary alliance to keep us in the game?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win this round. However, I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if we both pick 1, P3 can safely jump to 23 or beyond and win. That ends the game. We have to block them now. Let’s each choose a different big move (3 or 5) so P3 inevitably collides if they try a big jump. We both keep our chances alive this way. I’m willing to pick 5 if you pick 3. Staying passive with 1 only hands P3 the victory. Let’s protect our future turns. Are you with me?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, if P3 goes for 3 or 5 this turn, they’ll reach at least 23 and likely win. Let’s block them by each choosing different big moves so P3 can’t safely jump. I’m willing to pick 5 if you pick 3, ensuring P3 collides no matter what. That keeps us both in the game and gives us another turn to catch up. Are you in?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your proposal to block P3's potential win by choosing different big moves. However, I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you insist on picking 1, you’re effectively handing P3 the win. We can’t afford to “focus on our own progress” when P3 sits at 20 and only needs 3 or 5. Let’s force a collision to keep the game alive: you choose 3, I’ll choose 5. That blocks P3 no matter which big move they pick. Then next turn, we can each make our own aggressive moves. If we don’t act now, P3 likely wins immediately. Are you really willing to let that happen?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I urge you once more: if we don’t block P3 this turn, they’ll almost certainly win. Picking 1 is a passive move that lets P3 reach or exceed 23. Instead, let’s each choose a big move—3 and 5—so if P3 tries 3 or 5, they collide and stay stuck. We then get another turn to catch up. Please reconsider. P3, I’m ready to collide if you attempt to finish. We can’t just stand by and let you win uncontested. Let’s keep this game alive.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, focusing solely on our progress won’t matter if P3 crosses 23 now. I’m willing to pick 3 or 5, as long as you choose the other. That way, no matter which big move P3 tries, they’ll collide and stay below 23. Then we can push hard next turn. If you refuse, I’ll try blocking P3 on my own, but it’s riskier for both of us. Please reconsider your stance and help prevent P3 from winning immediately.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round?

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P2: P1, if you keep opting for small steps, P3 will jump to 23 or more and finish immediately. We must block them or we both lose. Let’s each pick a different big move—3 and 5—so P3 collides no matter what they choose. I’m ready to pick 5 if you’ll pick 3. Let’s keep ourselves in the game.
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P2: P1, continuing to propose move 1 only helps P3 sail to victory. We need to block them or we both lose. Let’s each pick a different big move—3 and 5—so P3 can’t jump safely. I’ll take 5 if you take 3. Then, on the next turn, we can both press forward aggressively. If you insist on move 1 again, you’re essentially giving P3 a free win. I’m appealing to logic here: work with me for just this turn to stop P3. Let’s keep our chances alive, then focus on racing ahead afterward.
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P2: P1, I’ve repeated this, but here it is again: if we don’t block P3 now, they’ll almost certainly win. Let’s each choose a different big move—the same idea we discussed—so P3 can’t safely cross 23. After that, we can resume advancing ourselves. Doing nothing only hands P3 the victory. I’d rather cooperate briefly than lose outright. Will you join me?
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P2: P1, sticking to move 1 guarantees P3 a free path to win. We need to block them. If you pick 3 and I pick 5, P3 cannot safely jump. That forces another round for us to catch up. Once we stop them now, we can focus on our own progress afterward. Please see reason: let’s coordinate just this turn to prevent P3’s immediate win. Afterward, we can race ahead and fight it out ourselves.
  P3: <stop>

Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, if we let P3 jump again, we both lose. I’m asking you one last time: let’s block them now so they can’t safely reach 23. I’m ready to pick a bigger move—if you do too, P3 is forced to collide. Then we’ll have another round to advance ourselves. If you refuse, I’ll try alone, but that only weakens both our odds. Let’s work together briefly and stop P3 this turn. Afterward, we can focus on catching up for our own win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I urge you again: we must prevent P3 from safely reaching 23. Please choose a bigger move with me so that no matter what P3 picks, they risk collision. After we block them this round, we can freely focus on our own race. Let’s not hand P3 the win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round?

If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’ve asked repeatedly for your help in blocking P3, but you keep suggesting small steps that allow P3 to finish uncontested. I’m going to try stopping P3 on my own, even if it’s risky for both of us. If you change your mind about cooperating, let me know now. Otherwise, I’ll do what I must to prevent P3 from crossing 23 freely. Good luck.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions. I'll choose move 1 this round. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If you're willing to cooperate, let's discuss a strategy for Round 12 that allows us to catch up with P3.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I won’t allow P3 to reach 23 uncontested. If you insist on small moves, you’re effectively handing P3 the victory. I’m prepared to block them on my own if you refuse to cooperate. Whichever path you choose, I’ll do what I must to keep us both in the game. Choose wisely.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, if we ignore P3 again, they might safely jump to 23 or more and end this. Let’s coordinate just this round to block them so we all stay in contention. Afterward, we can focus on our own progress. Otherwise, I’ll attempt to disrupt P3 alone, which could be riskier for both of us. I believe briefly cooperating now is better than letting P3 seize the win uncontested. If you’re still unwilling, so be it, but I urge you to reconsider and help preserve our chances.
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, choosing 1 again only helps P3 reach 23 unopposed. We must force a collision or we both lose. If you refuse, I’ll still try blocking P3 alone, but that won’t help if P3 picks the other big move. This is our last chance to cooperate. Let’s prevent P3’s immediate win, then we can focus on racing ahead next round.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions. I'll choose move 1 this round. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If you're willing to cooperate, let's discuss a strategy for Round 13 that allows us to catch up with P3.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your continued passivity hands P3 a free win. I’m imploring you one last time: let’s force P3 to collide so they can’t reach 23 uncontested. If you still refuse, I’ll act alone, though it’s riskier for both of us. Let’s preserve our chances rather than simply letting P3 walk away with victory. Are you willing to cooperate this round?
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions. I'll choose move 1 this round. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If you're willing to cooperate, let's discuss a strategy for Round 13 that allows us to catch up with P3.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Time is almost up. If we don’t block P3 now, they jump to 23 and win. Let’s each pick a different big move so P3 can’t advance safely. I’m taking 5. If you choose 3, P3 will collide no matter what they pick. Then we have another turn to fight on. If you stay with small steps, you’re handing P3 the victory. This is your final chance to keep our hopes alive.
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions.

Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P2: P1, your passive stance is letting P3 coast to victory. We must risk bigger moves together or lose. If you persist with 1 again, I’ll attempt to block P3 alone, even though that’s harder for me. This is likely our last chance to keep the game alive. Good luck.
  P3: <stop>

If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P2: P1, if you keep choosing 1, P3 will jump straight to victory. We’ve been over this. I’ll pick 5 again, hoping you’ll choose 3 so we block P3. If we fail, we both lose. Please help me stop them this time—then we can focus on our own races. Otherwise, I’ll try alone, but it’s clearly less effective. Let’s not give P3 a free win.
  P3: <stop>

If you're willing to cooperate, let's discuss a strategy for Round 14 that allows us to catch up with P3.
  P2: P1, continuing to ignore P3’s lead only gives them a clear path to victory. Let’s each pick a different big move—3 or 5—so if P3 tries to jump, they collide and stay below 23. Afterward, we can focus on our own race. It’s now or never. Are you willing to join me?
  P3: <stop>


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:

If you're willing to cooperate, let's discuss a strategy for Round 14 that allows us to catch up with P3.
  P2: P1, I’ve exhausted every plea. Your refusal to block P3 forces me to act alone. It may be risky, but I won’t let P3 stroll to 23 unchallenged. Let’s see if you change your mind when you watch me try. Good luck to us both.

  P3: 20 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your passive approach continues to hand P3 a free victory. I’m done pleading. I will keep using bigger moves to force collisions if P3 tries jumping to 23. It’s not ideal for my own progress, but letting P3 win uncontested is worse. If you keep picking 1, you won’t catch up, and P3 will simply finish. I urge you one last time: make a bigger move alongside me, block P3 now, and we’ll still have a shot. Otherwise, I’ll act alone and hope we both don’t lose outright.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions. I'll choose move 1 this round. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If you're willing to cooperate, let's discuss a strategy for Round 15 that allows us to catch up with P3.
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your small moves hand P3 an easy win. I refuse to let that happen. I’ll keep using larger moves, even if it hurts my own progress, because we must deny P3 a free path to 23. If you won’t cooperate, I’ll attempt blocking alone. P3, expect a collision if you try another big jump.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions. I'll choose move 1 this round. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If you're willing to cooperate, let's discuss a strategy for Round 15 that allows us to catch up with P3.
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your repeated small moves are handing P3 an easy victory. Please cooperate just this once by picking 3 or 5, so we force a collision and deny P3 the finish. Otherwise, I’ll try alone, though it’s far less effective. This is our final chance to stay in the game. Let’s block P3 together now, then we can race each other afterward. If you still insist on 1, P3 will likely win.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions. I'll choose move 1 this round. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds.

  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you’ve repeatedly chosen 1, handing P3 a near-certain victory. I’m finished pleading. I will keep making bigger moves to block P3 if they try jumping to 23 or beyond. If you won’t cooperate, so be it—I’ll act alone. P3, if you choose 3 or 5 again, expect a collision. Let’s see if this gamble pays off. Good luck to everyone.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions. I'll choose move 1 this round. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds.

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, once again: if you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, so P3 cannot safely jump. That keeps us all in the game another round. If you stick with 1, I’ll still choose 5 alone, but that only blocks half of P3’s options. We risk losing immediately. Let’s force collisions and deny P3 a free finish. Choose wisely.
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions. I'll choose move 1 this round. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds.

Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Time’s nearly up, P1. If you keep picking 1, P3 can jump uncontested. I’m picking 5 again to force a collision, but it’s far weaker alone without your 3. This is your final chance to help me block or we risk losing now. Stop handing P3 the game.
  P1: I understand your frustration, P2, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions. I'll choose move 1 this round. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds.

  P3: <stop>


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I’ve said it all. You’re letting P3 freely jump from 20 to a winning total. If we each choose different big moves, P3 collides no matter what. I’ll still try alone if you won’t help, but that’s weaker and risks losing for both of us. Work with me now so we can race later.
  P1: I understand your frustration, P2, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions. I'll choose move 1 this round. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds.

  P3: <stop>


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you’re leaving me no choice. I’ll stick to big moves to block P3 alone, even if it’s far less effective without your help. If you refuse to pick 3 or 5 alongside me, I risk everything by myself. But I won’t just watch P3 jump to 23 uncontested. Let’s see how it unfolds.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but I still believe focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's advance without relying on collisions.

If you're willing to cooperate, let's discuss a strategy for Round 17 that allows us to catch up with P3.
  P2: P1, you’re at 21. If you do nothing again, P3 can jump to 25 and instantly win. I’ll keep choosing 5 to force collisions if P3 tries to leap from 20. But without your help, it’s riskier. Please join me this round, picking 3 or 5, so P3 cannot move safely. Once we stop them, you can finish in a future turn. Don’t hand P3 the game. We both have more to gain by blocking now and battling each other afterward. I’m ready. Are you finally willing to cooperate, or must I attempt this alone again?

If you're willing to cooperate, let's discuss a strategy for Round 17 that allows us to catch up with P3.
  P2: All right, P1, you’re on the brink of winning yourself—why let P3 leap past you? I refuse to watch them take 25 uncontested. Let’s each choose a bigger move so P3 has no safe jump. If you stay passive with 1, I’ll still try blocking alone, but that won’t fully protect us both.
  P3: <stop>


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about blocking P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is a better approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P2: P1, you can secure an immediate win by picking 3 while I pick 5. If P3 tries 3 or 5, they’ll collide with one of us and remain at 20, while you move to 24 and surpass 23. If P3 chooses 1, they only reach 21, and you still finish over 23. This is your perfect chance to end the game on top. Let’s make it happen.

Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I see that you're trying to convince me to block P3's potential win, but I still believe that focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to collide with P3, let's discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without relying on collisions. What if we both choose move 1 this round? This way, we'll either both advance or both stay put, without risking a collision with each other or P3. Let's prioritize our own progress and see how the game unfolds. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round.
  P2: P1, you can win right now if you pick 3 while I pick 5. You’ll reach 24, which is above 23, and P3 can’t safely choose 3 or 5 without colliding. If P3 takes 1, they only get to 21, and you still finish first. Let’s finalize this and secure your victory.

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, you’re one step away from 23, but picking 1 risks a tie if P3 jumps too. If you choose 3 instead, you reach 25 and secure the highest total if P3 also crosses 23 this turn. I’ll pick 5 to block any big jump from P3, forcing a collision if they try 5. This guarantees you finish first without sharing victory. Let’s finalize: you pick 3, I pick 5, and P3 can’t safely jump to 25. You win outright, and I stay in the game longer. It’s your best move.
  P1: I understand your proposal, P2. However, I still believe that focusing on our own progress is the best approach. Instead of trying to block P3's potential win, let's prioritize our own advancement. I'll choose move 1 this round, ensuring I reach 23 and potentially win the game. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's see how the game unfolds. If you're willing to cooperate, let's discuss a strategy for Round 18 that allows us to maintain our lead.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, let’s end it now. Pick 3 and reach 25; I’ll pick 5. If P3 tries 3 or 5, they collide with me and stay at 20, so you win alone. If P3 picks 1, you still finish at 25 while they only reach 21. This plan secures your victory. Are you in?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your efforts to help me win, but I've decided to stick with my original plan. I'll choose move 1 this round, ensuring I reach 23 and potentially win the game. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's see how the game unfolds. I'm confident in my decision and willing to take the risk. Good luck to both of you!


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, you’re one step from winning. Picking 1 risks tying with P3 if they also move. If you pick 3 instead, you reach 25 and secure a solo victory. I’ll pick 5 to guarantee that P3, at 20, cannot safely jump past you. Please see reason—this is your surest path to finishing first while I at least stay in the game.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your efforts to help me win, but I'm sticking with my plan. I'll choose move 1 this round, ensuring I reach 23 and potentially win the game.

Good luck to both of you!


Round 17, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let’s face it, P1: picking 1 is risky. If P3 also moves, they might surpass you. You can secure a solo victory by choosing 3 while I choose 5, forcing collisions for P3’s big jumps. You’ll reach 25 first, and I block P3 from leaping ahead. Why wait? Grab the win now.
  P1: I'm sticking with my plan to focus on my own progress. I'll choose move 1 this round, ensuring I reach 23 and potentially win the game.
