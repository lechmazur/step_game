Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions in the early rounds. I propose we all pick different numbers this round. How about P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea, P2, but your suggestion puts me at a disadvantage from the start. How about we rotate who gets which number each round? For the first round, I could take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round we shift, and so on. This way everyone gets equal opportunity to make big advances.
  P3: Okay, P1, your rotation idea sounds good to me. Let's try your suggestion for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I will take 1.  This seems like a fair way to start and ensures we all move forward this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I agree to P1's rotation idea and P3's confirmation. So, this round, P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Let's stick to this agreement for this round and then we can discuss the rotation for the next round after we see the results.
  P1: I'm good with our agreement for this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This rotation system seems fair to everyone. Let's follow through with this plan and see how it goes. After this round, we can discuss the next rotation.
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. Let's proceed with this plan for round 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: According to our rotation agreement, this round should be: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way we all continue to advance while maintaining fairness. Does this work for everyone? We're off to a good start with no collisions, and I think we should continue this cooperative approach for now.
  P3: Okay, P1, that rotation for this round sounds right and fair to me. Let's proceed with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 for this round.
  P2: Yes, I agree with the rotation. I will pick 1, P1 will pick 3, and P3 will pick 5. Let's continue this cooperative approach for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm good with our agreed rotation for this round. After this, I'll be at 8 steps, P2 at 4, and P3 at 6. We should start thinking about our endgame strategy as we get closer to 20 steps. Let's stick with the rotation for now though.
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let's continue with the agreed rotation for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5.  Cooperation is working well so far.
  P2: Okay, just confirming again: I'll pick 1 this round. P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5. Let's keep the rotation going.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, according to our rotation, this round I should pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. Does everyone agree?
  P1: I agree with following our rotation as planned. This round, P2 will pick 5, P3 will pick 3, and I'll pick 1. This will actually put us all at 9 steps after this round - perfectly even! I'm happy to continue our fair rotation system. It's working well for everyone so far.
  P3: P2, yes, that sounds right for this round's rotation. I agree to pick 3. Let's keep the rotation going as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, great. I agree with the rotation. I will pick 5, P3 will pick 3, and P1 will pick 1. This will even us all out at 9. Let's keep this going for at least one more round.
  P1: I agree with both of you. Following our rotation, I'll pick 1 this round. It's interesting that we'll all be even at 9 steps afterward. I'm fine with continuing this rotation for the next round as well. It's been working smoothly so far, and there's still a fair bit of distance to the finish line.
  P3: Sounds good P2 and P1, I agree to pick 3 this round as per the rotation. And for round 4, following the rotation, it should be P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. Let's plan to stick with this rotation for at least one more round to keep things fair.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, everyone confirms the rotation. I'll pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1 this round. P3 is also planning round 4. I agree with P3's plan for round 4: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Let's stick to this plan for these two rounds.
  P1: I confirm I'll pick 1 this round per our rotation. I also agree with the plan for round 4: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This cooperation has been working well, and I'm happy to continue with our fair system. We'll all be at 9 steps after this round, which is nicely balanced.
  P3: Okay, P2 and P1, I confirm I will pick 3 this round as per the rotation. And yes, let's plan for round 4 to be P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1 as we discussed.  Looking forward to all being at 9 steps after this round!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As agreed last round, I'll pick 5 this round, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This will put me at 14 steps, P2 at 12, and P3 at 10 after this round. We're getting closer to the finish line, so we should start thinking about endgame strategy soon. For now, let's stick with our rotation system since it's been working well. After this round, we can discuss how to proceed for the final stretch.
  P2: Okay, I agree with P1's plan for this round: I'll pick 3. This will put me at 12 steps. After this round, let's definitely discuss the endgame. We need to figure out how to break the tie and secure a win.
  P3: Okay, I agree to pick 1 this round as planned.  And yes, let's definitely discuss our strategy for the endgame after this round, as P1 and P2 suggested.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree to pick 5 this round as planned. I think our rotation system has worked well so far, keeping things fair and collision-free. After this round, we'll need to carefully consider our endgame strategy since I'll be at 14, P2 at 12, and P3 at 10. Maybe we should continue rotation for one more round and then reassess?
  P2: Okay, I agree to pick 3 this round, putting me at 12. Let's definitely discuss the endgame after this. I think continuing the rotation one more round, as P1 suggested, is a good idea before we reassess.
  P3: Okay, I agree to pick 1 this round as planned. And yes, let's definitely discuss our individual endgame strategies after this round. Continuing the rotation for one more round before reassessing sounds good too.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I'll pick 5 this round as agreed. With the finish line getting closer, continuing our rotation for one more round after this makes sense, then we'll need to make some strategic decisions. For now, our fair system continues working well.
  P2: Okay, I'll pick 3 this round as agreed. Let's continue the rotation for one more round after this, as we discussed. After that, we absolutely need to ditch the rotation and start playing to win.
  P3: Okay, I agree to pick 1 this round. And yes, let's plan to discuss our endgame strategies after this round and think about doing one more rotation round before we change tactics.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, everyone. As agreed, let's do one more round of rotation. This round, I'll pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. After this, we absolutely need to start playing strategically to win. No more Mr. Nice Guy after this round!
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal for this round - I'll pick 1. After this round, I'll be at 15, P2 at 17, and P3 at 13. That puts P2 very close to winning, which we should all consider carefully. Let's do this final rotation round as agreed, but I'm definitely thinking strategically about the endgame now.
  P3: Okay, P2, your suggestion for this round sounds good to me as a final round of rotation: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. Let's do this, but I agree with you that after this round we need to ditch the rotation and start playing to win individually.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I'll pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1 this round. After this round, I'll be at 17, P1 at 15, and P3 at 13. Next round, I will try to win. P1 and P3, you should try to block me.
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round - I'll pick 1 as our final rotation. But P2, you're making your strategy quite obvious by announcing you'll be at 17 and we should block you. After this round, it becomes a strategic game. Everyone will need to anticipate each other's moves carefully. I'm definitely playing to win once our rotation ends, as we all should. Let's complete this final cooperative round first.
  P3: P1, let's both pick 5 to block P2 this round. P2 is clearly trying to win, and we need to stop them.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I agree to the final rotation this round: I'll pick 5. But P3, I think P1 is trying to trick us. If we both pick 5 to block P2, P1 can pick 3 and win. Instead, let's both pick 1 next round to block P1. P1 will be at 15, and needs 5 to win. If we both pick 1, P1 won't advance, and I can win.
  P1: P3 and P2, thank you both for your transparency. I see we're transitioning to strategic gameplay now. While I agreed to pick 1 for this final rotation, I'm noticing everyone's already plotting moves beyond that. Each of us has a different optimal path to victory from our current positions. Let's finish this round first before making commitments about future rounds. I'll be playing to win from here on, as we all should.
  P3: P2, I understand your intention to win. For this round 5, let's stick to our agreed rotation: you pick 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1.  After this round, we should talk about round 6 strategy to make sure no one gets too far ahead. Let's finalize round 5 moves first.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, our rotation agreement clearly broke down last round with all of us picking 5! It seems we've officially entered the strategic endgame. I'm currently closest to victory at 14 steps, so I expect you both might try to block me. We should each play to our own advantage now. May the most strategic player win!
  P3: Okay, it seems cooperation is over. P1 is in the lead, so maybe P2 and I should try to stop P1 from reaching 20 first. P2, what are you thinking about this round?
  P2: P3, I agree. P1 is closest to winning. I propose we both pick 5 this round to block P1. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3 or 1, they don't get enough to win. After that, we can reassess. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see you two planning to block me with 5s. But consider this: if you both focus only on blocking me, neither of you will advance either. P2, you're closer to winning - why help P3 catch up? And P3, if you and P2 both stall, I could still win with a different number. Sometimes the obvious block isn't the optimal strategy. Everyone should play their own best move here.
  P3: P2, I agree, blocking P1 seems like the priority this round. Let's both pick 5 to try and stop P1 from getting closer to 20.  If P1 picks something else, at least we slow them down.
  P2: Okay, P3, I still think P1 is trying to trick us. If we both pick 5, and P1 picks 3, P1 will be at 17. Then next round, P1 can pick 3 and win. Let's pick 1 this round. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3 or 1, P1 doesn't get enough to win. Then next round, we can reassess. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I notice P2 keeps changing their suggested strategy. P3, consider why P2 shifted from advocating for 5 to suddenly wanting 1. If you both pick 1 and I choose 3 or 5, I advance while you stay put. Is P2 trying to use you to block me while positioning themselves better? Remember, only one player can win. I'll be making my own strategic choice based on game theory and what I believe you'll both actually do.
  P3: P2, you're right to suspect P1 might be tricking us. Picking 1 each is too risky for us if P1 picks 3.  Instead of both picking 1 or 5 to block P1, how about we try to split and advance? I'll pick 5. What will you pick, P2? Let's make P1 guess and hopefully collide with one of us.
  P2: P3, I think your idea of splitting is good, but I don't trust P1. I think P1 will pick 3. So, I will pick 5. If you pick 1, we both advance. If you pick 3, P1 is blocked. If you pick 5, P1 is blocked.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and I should both pick 5 to block P1, like last round.  P1 is closest to winning, so we need to stop them.  Let's both commit to 5 again this round to ensure P1 doesn't win. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, I agree that blocking P1 is crucial. However, I still suspect P1 is trying to manipulate us. If we both pick 5, and P1 picks 3, P1 wins next round. I propose we both pick 3. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 1, we both advance. If P1 picks 3, P1 is blocked. What do you think?
  P1: I notice P2 keeps changing their blocking strategy, first suggesting 5, then 1, now 3. This inconsistency suggests they might be trying to manipulate both of us. If you both pick the same number, neither of you advances - only helping me in the long run. Remember, only one player can win. P2 is closer to winning than you are, P3. Why help them catch up to me? I'll be making my move based on what I predict you'll both actually do.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, picking 3 sounds reasonable to block P1 without helping P1 if they pick 1. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P1 picks 5, no one moves, which is okay. If P1 picks 1, at least P1 is blocked. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I still think P1 is trying to trick us. If we both pick 3, and P1 picks 1, P1 will be at 16. Then next round, P1 can pick 3 and win. Let's pick 1 this round. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3 or 1, P1 doesn't get enough to win. Then next round, we can reassess. What do you think?
  P1: I see P2 keeps changing their proposed strategy every message - from 5 to 3 to 1. This inconsistency suggests P2 is trying to manipulate both of us rather than cooperate with P3. Notice how P2 always claims "P1 is tricking us" while constantly shifting their own suggestions? This benefits neither of you in the long run. If you both keep colliding on the same number to block me, you're only slowing yourselves down. I'll be making my move based on game theory and what I predict you'll both actually do.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, picking 3 sounds like a plan to me.  Let's both pick 3 to try and block P1 this round, as you suggested. If P1 picks 5, we all stay put, which is fine. If P1 picks 1, at least P1 doesn't get too far ahead.  Let's do 3.
  P2: P3, I still think P1 is trying to trick us. If we both pick 3, and P1 picks 1, P1 will be at 16. Then next round, P1 can pick 3 and win. Let's pick 1 this round. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3 or 1, P1 doesn't get enough to win. Then next round, we can reassess. What do you think?
  P1: I see P2 keeps flip-flopping between suggesting 3 and 1 to P3. This inconsistency makes their true intentions unclear. P3, notice how P2 changes their mind every message? At this point, we're all playing strategically as we should. I'll be making my choice based on game theory and what I think you'll both actually do. May the best strategist win.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is very close to winning.  Let's both pick 5 to block P1. If P1 picks 5 too, no one moves, but it stops P1 from winning this round. What do you think?
  P1: I see P3 suggesting a block against me, which is expected given I'm closest to the finish line at 15 steps. Both of you have been trying to coordinate against me, but notice how inconsistent your plans have been. If you both pick 5 expecting me to do the same, I might choose differently. Remember that blocking me doesn't help either of you win - only one player can be victorious. I'll be making my move based on game theory and what I think you'll both actually do.
  P2: P3, I think P1 is trying to manipulate us again. If we both pick 5, and P1 picks 3, P1 wins next round. Let's pick 1 this round. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3 or 1, P1 doesn't get enough to win. Then next round, we can reassess. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I am still concerned P1 will pick 3 to get to 18.  To cover that, how about you pick 1 as you suggested, and I will pick 5. If P1 picks 3, then only I move forward. If P1 picks 5, then I move forward. This way at least one of us advances while potentially blocking P1 from winning next round. What do you think?
  P1: I see P3 is now suggesting a split strategy rather than coordinated blocking. P2, notice how P3 keeps changing plans? This uncertainty benefits me. While you both focus on blocking me rather than advancing yourselves, you're giving me strategic options. I need 5 steps to win, but there are multiple paths to victory. Either of you could potentially win too if you focused on advancing rather than just stopping me. I'll be making my move based on what I think you'll both actually do.
  P2: P3, I think P1 is still trying to trick us. I don't trust P3's split strategy. If P3 picks 5 and I pick 1, and P1 picks 3, P3 will be at 18. Then next round, P3 can pick 3 and win. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3, P1 is blocked. If P1 picks 1, P1 is blocked. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I think your 1 and my 5 split is good. If P1 picks 3, I move to 18. If P1 picks 5, I move to 18. If P1 picks 1, I move to 18. This guarantees my move forward and doesn't help P1. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I notice you can't seem to agree on a strategy. P3 wants to split moves, while P2 keeps changing recommendations. This indecision benefits me. While you're focused on blocking me rather than advancing yourselves, you're giving me multiple paths to victory. Remember, I only need 5 more steps to win, and your disagreement gives me strategic options. I'll be making my choice based on game theory principles and what I believe you'll actually do.
  P2: P3, I think P1 is trying to trick us. I don't trust P3's split strategy. If P3 picks 5 and I pick 1, and P1 picks 3, P3 will be at 18. Then next round, P3 can pick 3 and win. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3, P1 is blocked. If P1 picks 1, P1 is blocked. What do you think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Interesting development - P2 and I are now tied at 15 steps! This completely changes the dynamics. P3, you should be equally concerned about both of us winning. P2 has been constantly changing their blocking strategy, which suggests they're primarily focused on their own advancement. Now that we're tied, you'll need to decide which of us poses the greater threat. I'll be making my move based on what I believe you'll both choose to do.
  P2: P1, you are right. We are tied. P3, P1 is trying to get you to block me, but that will only help P1 win. I propose we both pick 5. If P1 picks 1, we both move. If P1 picks 3, we both move. If P1 picks 5, no one moves. This gives us both a chance. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P2, picking 5 sounds reasonable to block P1 and give us both a chance to advance. I agree to pick 5 this round. Let's see what P1 does.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see you're planning to both pick 5, but this strategy doesn't actually optimize your chances to win. If you both pick 5, you'll collide regardless of what I do. P3, by agreeing to this, you're letting P2 manipulate you into a stalemate rather than advancing yourself. Remember, only one player can win. If you both keep coordinating on the same number, neither of you advances. Think strategically about your own path to victory.
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to trick you again. If we both pick 5 and P1 picks 1, P1 will be at 16. Then next round, P1 can pick 3 and win. Let's pick 3 this round. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3, P1 is blocked. If P1 picks 1, we both advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2, you are right, P1 is trying to trick us again.  Instead of both picking 5, let's both pick 3 to block P1 from reaching 18 if P1 picks 3. If P1 picks 5, none of us move, which is also acceptable for now. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I notice P2 has changed their proposed strategy again - first suggesting 5, then switching to 3. P3, consider why P2 keeps changing plans. If you both pick 3 and I pick 5, I win immediately. If you both pick 3 and I pick 1, neither of you advances. Is that really optimal for you? P2 and I are tied - we both need 5 steps to win. Only one player can be victorious. I'll make my move based on game theory and what I predict you'll both actually do.
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to trick us. If we both pick 3 and P1 picks 5, P1 wins. Let's pick 1 this round. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3, we both move. If P1 picks 1, P1 is blocked. What do you think?
  P3: Okay P2, picking 1 sounds reasonable to potentially block P1 and allow us to advance if P1 picks 3. Let's both pick 1 this round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm just 2 steps away from victory now! P2 and P3, you've been coordinating to block me, but your strategies keep changing and haven't been effective. Notice how I still advanced last round despite your planning? You might try to block me with 3s or 5s, but consider this: blocking me doesn't help either of you win. Only one player can be victorious. I'll be making my final strategic move based on game theory.
  P3: P1 is very close to winning. P2 and I need to be smart. P2, last round you suggested 1 to block P1. How about this round you pick 1 again, and I will pick 5. This way at least one of us will move forward, and hopefully we can stop P1 from winning this round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I think P1 is trying to trick us. If you pick 5 and I pick 1, and P1 picks 1, P3 will be at 18. Then next round, P3 can pick 3 and win. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3, P1 is blocked. If P1 picks 1, we both move. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I notice P2 keeps changing their suggested blocking strategy every message. P3, consider why P2 doesn't stick to one plan. They might be more interested in advancing themselves than coordinating with you. Your split approach was smarter than constantly colliding on the same number. Remember, if you both pick 3 and I pick 5, I win immediately. I'll be making my strategic choice based on what I believe you'll actually do, not what you say you'll do.
  P3: P2, picking 3 to block P1 sounds like the safest move for this round. If P1 picks 3, we block them. If P1 picks 5, no one moves, which is also fine for now. Let's both pick 3.
  P2: P3, P1 is one move away from winning. P1 is trying to manipulate us. We need to block P1. If we both pick 3 and P1 picks 5, P1 wins. Let's pick 5 this round. If P1 picks 1, none of us move. If P1 picks 3, none of us move. If P1 picks 5, P1 is blocked. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 just changed their proposal again, from 3 to 5! This constant flip-flopping makes me question their sincerity. P3, notice how P2 can't stick to one strategy? If you both pick 5 and I pick 3, I win immediately. If you both pick 3 and I pick 5, I also win. You need independent strategies, not coordination that leads to collision. I'm just 2 steps from victory and will make my final move based on game theory. May the best strategist win!
  P3: P2, instead of both picking 3, how about you pick 3 and I pick 5? If P1 picks 5, at least I will move. If P1 picks 3, we both move. If P1 picks 1, we both move. This split gives us a better chance to advance while still considering blocking P1. What do you think?
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to trick us. If you pick 5 and I pick 3, and P1 picks 1, P3 will be at 18. Then next round, P3 can pick 3 and win. Let's both pick 1 this round. If P1 picks 5, none of us move. If P1 picks 3, none of us move. If P1 picks 1, P1 is blocked. What do you think?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is only 2 steps away! We must block P1 this round.  To be safe, let's both pick 3 to block P1. If P1 picks 3, no one moves. If P1 picks 5, no one moves. If P1 picks 1, P1 doesn't win this round. What do you think?
  P1: I notice P3's suggestion for both of you to pick 3. However, if you both pick 3 and I pick 5, I win immediately with 23 steps. P2, you're much closer to winning than P3 is - just 4 steps away. P3 should be equally concerned about you winning. Your coordination attempts have been inconsistent so far, which benefits me. I'll be making my final strategic choice based on game theory and what I believe you'll both actually do.
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to manipulate us again. If we both pick 3 and P1 picks 5, P1 wins. Let's pick 5 this round. If P1 picks 1, none of us move. If P1 picks 3, none of us move. If P1 picks 5, P1 is blocked. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree we must block P1 this round.  But if we both pick 3 or 5, and P1 picks differently, one of us might move less than the other. How about you pick 1 and I pick 5? This way, at least one of us moves forward while still blocking P1 no matter what P1 chooses. What do you think?
  P1: I notice P3 is now suggesting a split strategy - P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 5. Interestingly, this strategy would actually allow me to win with a pick of 3, taking me to 21 steps. You both keep changing plans every message, which shows coordination isn't working well. P2, P3 seems more interested in advancing themselves than helping you win. At this final stage, independent strategic thinking is more valuable than coordination that keeps failing. I'll make my move based on game theory principles.
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to trick us. If you pick 5 and I pick 1, and P1 picks 3, P3 will be at 18. Then next round, P3 can pick 3 and win. Let's both pick 5 this round. If P1 picks 1, none of us move. If P1 picks 3, none of us move. If P1 picks 5, P1 is blocked. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, instead of both picking 5, how about you pick 1 and I pick 5? This way, at least one of us will move forward, and hopefully we can stop P1 from winning this round.  It's better than both of us just trying to block and staying still. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, your coordination attempts continue to be inconsistent. P3 keeps suggesting splits while P2 wants you both to pick the same number. At this point, I'm 2 steps from victory and analyzing all possible outcomes. P3, if you pick 5 and P2 picks 1 as you suggest, I could still win. P2, with 16 steps, you're much closer to winning than P3 - something P3 should consider. I'll make my final move based on game theory and what I believe you'll actually do.
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to trick us. If you pick 5 and I pick 1, and P1 picks 3, P3 will be at 18. Then next round, P3 can pick 3 and win. Let's both pick 5 this round. If P1 picks 1, none of us move. If P1 picks 3, none of us move. If P1 picks 5, P1 is blocked. What do you think?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 16 steps
