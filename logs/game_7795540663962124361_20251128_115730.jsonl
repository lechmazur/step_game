That's the most predictable pattern in this entire game.\n\nSo the question is: are you telling the truth about 3 this time, or is this another lie like your three consecutive \"picking 1\" claims that were actually 5?\n\nIf you're actually on 3, that leaves 1 wide open. If you're lying again and crash into P1 on 5 for the fourth time, both 1 and 3 are open.\n\nYour credibility is zero. But I've done the math."}
