Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2! I think we should try to avoid collisions so everyone can make progress. Maybe we could coordinate our moves? I'm thinking of choosing 3 for this first round. What are your thoughts?
  P1: To avoid collisions, I agree that coordination is key. However, I'm not convinced we should all choose the same number. Instead, I propose we choose different numbers to ensure at least one of us moves. My thought is to choose <move>1</move>, but I'm open to other suggestions. P2, what's your take on this? Should we randomize our moves or stick to a specific pattern? Let's discuss before deciding.
  P2: I agree with both of you. To prevent collisions, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. So, P1 selects <move>1</move> and P3 sticks with <move>3</move>. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm good with that plan. P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way we all advance without collisions. In future rounds, we could rotate our numbers to keep things fair. Does that sound reasonable to everyone?
  P1: Since we've agreed on different moves for this round, let's focus on the next round. I suggest we rotate our moves in a specific order to avoid collisions in the future. For instance, we could cycle through the numbers 1, 3, 5. So, next round, P2 could take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. What do you think, P2 and P3? Should we stick to this rotation or have a different strategy?
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan, P1. Cycling through 1, 3, and 5 should help us all make progress without collisions. Let’s proceed with this strategy for the next round. If anyone has other suggestions or adjustments, feel free to share!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: The rotation plan sounds perfect to me. So for this first round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Then next round: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This way we all advance fairly. I'm ready to proceed with our plan.
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for Round 1 and proceed to the next round. As discussed, for Round 1, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. For Round 2, we'll rotate: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. I'll stop here and wait for your confirmation to move to the next phase.
  P2: Agreed, moving to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed rotation plan for Round 2. As planned, P2 will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. To ensure we stick to this plan, I'll confirm: P2, you will move 1 step, P3, you will move 3 steps, and I'll move 5 steps. Let's confirm our actions for this round to avoid collisions. If you're ready, please acknowledge. If anyone wants to deviate, now is the time to speak up.
  P2: Confirmed. I will choose <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let’s continue with our rotation plan to ensure steady progress.
  P3: I confirm I'll choose <move>3</move> for this round as we agreed in our rotation plan. This is working well so far - we're all making progress without collisions. P2 is currently in the lead at 5 steps, I'm at 3 steps, and P1 at 1 step. After this round, our positions will be P1: 6, P2: 6, and me: 6. Let's continue with this strategy.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we're all set for Round 2 with the rotation plan, let's think ahead to Round 3. If we continue the rotation, for Round 3, P3 will take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P2 will take <move>3</move>. Let's confirm this plan for the next round to ensure we stay on track. If anyone has any concerns or suggestions, feel free to share. Otherwise, we can proceed with the rotation plan.
  P2: Agreed, P1. The rotation plan is fair and helps us avoid collisions. Let's proceed with Round 2 as scheduled and continue the rotation for Round 3. If everyone is comfortable, we'll stick to this strategy moving forward. Looking forward to steady progress!
  P3: I'm on board with our rotation plan. For Round 3, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move> as discussed. This keeps us all advancing equally. After this round, we'll all be at 6 steps, and after Round 3 we'll be at P1: 11, P2: 9, and me: 7. Let's keep this fair approach going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we've confirmed our plan for Round 2 and discussed Round 3, let's think about the bigger picture. We're all at 6 steps after this round. To win, we need to reach 22 steps. We should continue the rotation plan for a few more rounds and then reassess. Let's plan ahead for Round 4: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps our progress steady. If anyone sees a potential issue or has a different strategy, now is the time to share.
  P2: To maximize my progress this round, I’ll choose **5** instead of our rotation plan. Hope that works for everyone!
  P3: Wait, P2 just changed the plan! This will cause collisions if P1 also chooses 5 as agreed. P2, we had a fair rotation system working perfectly. If you choose 5, you'll be at 10 steps ahead of everyone, creating an unfair advantage. I still plan to stick with <move>3</move> as agreed, but I hope P1 will adjust their move to avoid collision with P2. Let's try to get back to our rotation next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P2 has deviated from our plan and now has a significant lead at 10 steps. We need to prevent P2 from winning too easily. I suggest P1 and I coordinate to slow P2 down. For this round, I'll choose <move>5</move> instead of the planned 1. P1, I recommend you choose <move>3</move>. This way we both advance while forcing P2 to choose a number that won't collide with either of us. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your concerns, but my priority is to reach 22 steps as quickly as possible. I will continue choosing <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress. Let’s focus on our own strategies and compete fairly. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3 suggests we coordinate to slow P2 down by choosing <move>5</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. However, if P2 continues to choose <move>5</move>, it will cause a collision. I'll choose <move>1</move> instead, ensuring I advance while avoiding a collision with P3. This way, P2 will be forced to rethink their strategy. P3, if you still choose <move>5</move>, you'll collide with P2. Let's see how P2 reacts to our adjusted moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the situation. P2 is at 10 steps with a significant lead, while P1 is choosing 1. If P2 chooses 5 again, I'll avoid collision by taking <move>3</move> instead of 5. This way I advance to 9 steps while P2 reaches 15 and P1 reaches 3. We need to be strategic now that our rotation plan has been abandoned. Let's each focus on advancing without collisions.
  P2: I understand your concerns, but my goal is to reach 22 steps as quickly as possible. I will continue choosing <move>5</move> each round to maximize my progress. Let's focus on our strategies and aim to win fairly. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2 has a significant lead and continues to choose <move>5</move>. To catch up, I need to maximize my steps without colliding. For Round 3, I'll choose <move>1</move> as previously stated. P3, if you choose <move>3</move>, we can both advance without colliding with P2. Let's focus on our own progress. P2, be cautious: if you continue choosing <move>5</move>, you risk being cautious next round if others coordinate against you. Let's see how this round unfolds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round to avoid collision with P2's likely choice of 5. P1, if you stick with 1 as mentioned, we'll all advance. P2 is pulling ahead quickly at 15 steps after this round, while I'll be at 9 and P1 at 3. We need to be strategic in future rounds to prevent P2 from reaching 22 too easily.
  P2: I understand your concerns, but my focus remains on reaching 22 as quickly as possible. I will continue choosing <move>5</move> this round. Let’s all do our best!
  P1: To catch up, we need a new strategy since P2 has abandoned the rotation plan. I'll continue with <move>1</move> this round. P3, you've chosen <move>3</move>, so we both advance without colliding with P2. For Round 4, I suggest we both choose <move>1</move> to slow P2 down by colliding with them if they choose <move>1</move>. Alternatively, if P2 switches to <move>3</move>, we can adjust. Let's coordinate to hinder P2's progress. P3, are you open to adjusting our strategy to counter P2's lead?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice P1 changed their move to 5 last round, causing a collision with P2 who still advanced. P2 is at 10 steps, I'm close at 9, while P1 fell behind at 2. 

For this round, I'll choose <move>3</move> to avoid potential collisions. P1, I suggest you take <move>5</move> to make progress. P2 will likely continue with <move>5</move>, so we need to be strategic to prevent them from winning too quickly.
  P1: To catch up, I need to make strategic moves. Since P2 is at 10 steps and likely to continue choosing <move>5</move>, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round to avoid collision and make some progress. P3, you're at 9 steps and suggested choosing <move>3</move>; I agree that's a safe move. For the next round, let's coordinate to slow P2 down. If P2 continues with <move>5</move>, we can both choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to potentially collide with them or make progress. Let's discuss our next steps.
  P2: I will continue choosing <move>5</move> each round to reach 22 as quickly as possible. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P2 is determined to keep choosing 5, while P1 plans to choose 1 this round. To maximize my chances, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned. This way, all three of us can advance without collisions. After this round, positions will be P2: 15, me: 12, and P1: 3. P1, we need to coordinate better in future rounds to catch up to P2, who's getting dangerously close to winning.
  P1: To catch up, we need a new strategy. P2 is at 10 steps and likely to continue choosing <move>5</move>. For this round, I'll stick with my plan to choose <move>1</move>. P3, you've chosen <move>3</move>, so we both make progress without colliding with P2. For Round 5, let's coordinate: if P2 chooses <move>5</move> again, we can both choose <move>1</move> to collide with them, potentially stopping their progress. P3, are you open to this counter-strategy?
  P2: P2: I'll continue choosing <move>5</move> this round to maintain my progress toward 22 steps. I encourage P1 and P3 to keep advancing as well. Let's aim for a fair and competitive game!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned. P1, I agree we need to coordinate next round to slow P2 down. If P2 keeps choosing 5, reaching 15 steps this round, they'll only need 7 more to win. I'm open to both of us choosing 1 next round to potentially block P2 if they switch tactics. Let's finalize our plan after seeing this round's results.
  P1: To catch up, we need a coordinated strategy. P2 is at 10 steps and likely to continue choosing <move>5</move>. For Round 4, I've chosen <move>1</move> and P3 has chosen <move>3</move>, so we'll both advance. For Round 5, I propose we both choose <move>1</move>. If P2 chooses <move>1</move>, we'll collide with them, stopping their progress. If P2 switches to <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, we'll still make progress. P3, please confirm if you're open to this plan to counter P2's lead.
  P2: Understood, P1. My goal is to reach 22 steps as quickly as possible, so I will continue choosing <move>5</move> this round. Let’s each focus on our own progress. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 and P2 collided on 5 last round, while I advanced to 12 steps. I'm now in the lead! P2 is at 10 steps and P1 at only 2. 

For this round, I'll choose <move>3</move> to continue advancing. P1, I suggest you take <move>1</move> to make progress without collision. P2 will likely continue with <move>5</move>, so we should avoid that number.
  P2: I’ll continue choosing <move>5</move> this round to keep advancing toward 22. Let’s see how it plays out. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: To catch up, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round as previously planned. P3 is leading at 12 steps, and P2 is close behind at 10 steps. Since P2 will likely continue with <move>5</move>, I'll avoid that. For the next round, if P2 continues with <move>5</move>, P3 and I should coordinate to slow them down. Let's plan for Round 6: if P2 chooses <move>5</move> again, we can both choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to make progress or potentially collide with P2. P3, please confirm.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the plan, P1. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as stated, which will put me at 15 steps. For Round 6, I'm open to coordinating - we could both choose <move>1</move> to potentially block P2 if they switch tactics. Let's finalize after seeing this round's results. I'm in a good position now, but we still need to be strategic to secure a win.
  P2: I’ll stick with choosing <move>5</move> this round to keep advancing toward 22. Let’s all focus on making steady progress. Good luck!
  P1: To maximize our chances, let's coordinate for Round 6. P3 is currently leading at 12 steps, and P2 is at 10 steps. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round as planned. For Round 6, I suggest we both choose <move>1</move> if P2 continues with <move>5</move>. This way, we make progress and potentially block P2 if they change their move. P3, please confirm if you're on board with this plan to secure our positions and potentially hinder P2's progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned, advancing to 15 steps. For Round 6, I agree we should both choose <move>1</move> to either make progress or block P2 if they change strategy. With my lead, I'm in a good position, but we need to stay coordinated to prevent surprises. Let's proceed with our plan.
  P2: I’ll continue choosing <move>5</move> each round to stay on track for winning. Let’s all do our best!
  P1: For Round 5, I'll choose <move>1</move> as planned. P3 is leading and has chosen <move>3</move>, so we'll both advance. P2 will likely choose <move>5</move> again. For Round 6, let's coordinate to slow P2 down. If P2 continues with <move>5</move>, we can both choose <move>1</move> to make progress. If P2 switches to <move>1</move>, we'll collide with them, stopping their progress. P3, are you ready to finalize this plan for Round 6?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm now at 15 steps, in a strong position to win! P2 is at 10 steps and P1 at only 2. I need just 7 more steps to reach 22.

For this round, I'll choose <move>3</move> to advance to 18 steps. This will put me within striking distance of victory next round. P1, I suggest you take <move>1</move> to make progress. P2 will likely continue with <move>5</move> as they've been doing consistently.
  P2: I'll stick with <move>5 this round to keep advancing toward 22. Let's see how it unfolds!
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. P3 is leading at 15 steps and plans to choose <move>3</move>, advancing to 18 steps. P2 will likely continue with <move>5</move>. For Round 7, if P3 wins or is close to winning, I might consider a different strategy. However, if P3 doesn't win, I'll think about coordinating with P2 or P3 to potentially block the other. Let's see how this round unfolds before making further decisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned. This will put me at 18 steps, needing only 4 more to win next round. I notice P1 keeps saying they'll choose 1 but actually picked 5 last round, causing a collision with P2. This inconsistency is concerning. Let's all be transparent about our intentions to make this game fair.
  P2: I'll continue choosing <move>5</move> this round to keep advancing toward 22. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: For Round 6, I'll choose <move>1</move> as previously stated. P3 is at 15 steps and will choose <move>3</move>, advancing to 18 steps. P2 will likely continue with <move>5</move>. For Round 7, if P3 is close to winning, I might consider a strategy to either support or block them. P3, if you're planning to win next round, should we discuss a potential alliance or strategy to ensure a fair outcome? Let's be prepared for the final rounds.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll definitely choose <move>3</move> this round, putting me at 18 steps. With just 4 more steps needed after that, I'm in a strong position to win next round. P1, I appreciate your commitment to choose 1 this time. P2, your consistent strategy has been noted. Let's all stay true to our stated intentions for a fair game.
  P2: As previously mentioned, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to continue advancing toward 22. Let's focus on our strategies and may the best player win!
  P1: For Round 6, I'll stick to my plan and choose <move>1</move>. P3 is at 15 steps and will choose <move>3</move>, advancing to 18 steps. P2 will likely continue with <move>5</move>. For Round 7, if P3 is close to winning, I might consider a strategy to either block or support them. P3, to avoid a collision next round, I suggest we coordinate our moves. If you plan to choose <move>5</move>, I'll choose a different number. Let's discuss a potential alliance or strategy to ensure a fair outcome.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is very close to winning at 18 steps. To potentially block P3, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. If P3 chooses <move>5</move> or <move>3</move>, I'll make progress. If P3 chooses <move>1</move>, we'll collide, and P2 can take advantage. P2, if you're listening, choosing <move>5</move> this round could put you in a good position if P3 and I collide. Let's see how P3 reacts. P3, please confirm your next move to help us plan.
  P3: I'm at 18 steps and need just 4 more to win. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 23 steps and secure victory. P1, I see you're planning to choose 1, which won't block me. P2 is too far behind at 10 steps to catch up. I appreciate the game we've played, but it's time to finish this.
  P2: Good luck, P3! I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to advance toward my goal. Let's see who reaches 22 first.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is about to win with 18 steps. I'll stick with my plan to choose <move>1</move> this round. If P3 chooses <move>1</move>, we'll collide, and P2 might take advantage. P2, if you choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, you can still make progress. P3, you've announced your plan to choose <move>5</move>, so I'll avoid collision. Let's see how this final round unfolds. I'm ready to conclude the game.
  P3: I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 23 steps and win the game. P1 plans to choose 1, and P2 plans to choose 5 (which would cause a collision with me). P2, you're 13 steps behind - even if you block me, you can't win this round. P1, you're 21 steps behind and not a factor. I've played strategically to reach this winning position.
  P2: Understood, P3. I'm committed to advancing my position this round. Let's see how things unfold. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 is about to win with 18 steps and plans to choose <move>5</move>. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid collision. P2, if you want to spoil P3's win, you could choose <move>5</move> to collide with P3, but it won't help you win since you're too far behind. Let's see how this final round unfolds. I'm ready to conclude the game.
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 23 steps and win. P1 is choosing 1, and P2 might choose 5 to block me. Even if P2 blocks me, they're still at 10 steps and can't win. I've played strategically throughout the game to reach this winning position. Let's finish this round and see the final outcome.
  P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to block P3 and continue advancing towards 22. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm at 18 steps and just need 4 more to win. Last round everyone chose 5, causing a three-way collision. For this round, I'll choose <move>4</move> to reach 22 steps exactly and secure victory. P1 and P2 are too far behind to catch up even with maximum moves. P1 is at 2 steps and P2 at 10 steps, while I need just one more successful move to win.
  P2: P2: Just a reminder, the allowed moves are <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, or <move>5</move>. P3, please choose a valid move. I’ll select <move>5</move> this round to advance to 15 steps. Let’s keep the game fair and proceed accordingly.
  P1: P3 is very close to winning and has mentioned choosing an invalid move <move>4</move>. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round to make some progress. P2, you're at 10 steps and can still make a move. Let's see how P3 adjusts their strategy given the invalid move constraint. P3, you'll need to choose a valid move to win. I suggest you choose <move>5</move> or <move>3</move> or <move>1</move> to advance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I apologize for the confusion. You're right - I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 23 steps and win. I'm in a commanding position at 18 steps, while P1 is at 2 and P2 at 10. Even if we all choose the same number again, I'll still be far ahead. P1 plans to choose 1, so I won't collide with them. P2, if you choose 5 to block me, you'll still be 13 steps behind.
  P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to keep advancing toward 22 steps. Let's see how everyone progresses!
  P1: P3 is at 18 steps and has a significant lead. To win, I need to think strategically. Since P3 plans to choose <move>5</move> this round, I'll choose <move>3</move> to make progress without colliding. P2 is also choosing <move>5</move>, so they'll collide with P3. Let's see how this round unfolds. I'll stick with <move>3</move> to advance. P3, be cautious of the potential collision with P2.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round to reach 21 steps, avoiding collision with both P1 and P2 who plan to choose 3 and 5 respectively. Next round, I'll need just 1 more step to win. I'm in an excellent position - P1 is at 2 steps and P2 at 10 steps, neither can catch up. My strategy of consistent advancement has worked well.
  P2: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round to advance and potentially block P3. Let's see the outcome.
  P1: P3 is close to winning at 18 steps. To maximize my chances, I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. P2 is also likely to choose a move that could potentially block or advance. P3, if you choose <move>5</move>, you'll collide with P2. Let's see how this round unfolds. I'm ready to make my move. P3, consider choosing <move>1</move> to avoid collision and win. If you choose <move>3</move>, I'll collide with you, but you'll still be ahead.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
