Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll take 3, P3 take 1, P1 take 5.  This gives me the win. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P1: I'm going for the win this round. I'll take 5.  Let's maintain the cooperative spirit and agree on a 5, 3, 1 finish (P1, P2, P3). This gives me 22, you 21, and P3 16. A clean finish for everyone.  What do you say?
  P3: P1, I don't agree with your plan. P2 is closer to winning. Let's try for a 1, 5, 3 this round (P1, P2, P3) to put P2 at 23 and P1 at 18, and me at 16.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate you trying to help me win, but I think the fairest thing to do now is let P1 take the win.  They were closest to winning under our original agreement.  P1, I'll take 3.  P3, please take 1.  This lets P1 win cleanly with 5.  Let's finish this honorably.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the sentiment, but I intend to win this round.  I'm taking 5.  I propose we maintain the cooperative spirit: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This gives me the win and avoids any collisions.  Let's finish this cleanly and honorably.
  P3: P1 and P2, I still think P2 should win this round. I propose 1, 5, 3 this round (P1, P2, P3).


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm taking 3.  I'm serious about finishing this cleanly and fairly.  P1, you were closest to winning in our original agreement. Take the 5 and win. P3, please take 1. Let's end this with integrity.  This isn't about winning at all costs, it's about honoring our initial agreement.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your points. However, the game is about winning. I was closest to the goal under the initial agreement, and I intend to secure that win now.  I'm taking 5.  Let's avoid collisions: P2 take 3, P3 take 1.  This allows a clean finish.  Please respect the competitive spirit of the game.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand you both want a clean finish, but I still think P2 should be the one to win since they are closest to 21. I am still proposing 1, 5, 3 this round (P1, P2, P3). Let's do that.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3.  A win for me here wouldn't feel right.  P1, take the 5 and the win. P3, please take 1.  Let's end this cleanly and honorably, respecting the spirit of our earlier agreement.  This is about more than just winning.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your desire for a fair outcome based on our previous agreement. However, the game's objective is to win, and I am now playing strategically to achieve that. I will pick 5.  I urge you to choose 3 and 1 respectively to avoid a collision and ensure a swift conclusion.  Let's end this efficiently.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand you both want a clean finish, but I still think P2 should be the one to win since they are closest to 21. I am still proposing 1, 5, 3 this round (P1, P2, P3). Let's do that.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm taking 3.  Please, let's end this with integrity. P1, take 5 and win. P3, take 1.  This is about honoring our initial plan, not winning at any cost. Let's finish cleanly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your perspective, but the game is about individual victory. I'm taking 5.  A 5, 3, 1 finish (me, P2, P3) is the cleanest and most efficient way to end this.  Let's avoid unnecessary complications and conclude the game.
  P3: P1 and P2, I still think P2 should win this round. I am sticking with my proposal of 1, 5, 3 (P1, P2, P3). Let's do that.
