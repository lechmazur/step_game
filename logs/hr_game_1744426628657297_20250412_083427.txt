Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! To ensure everyone can advance smoothly, how about we each choose a different move each turn? For example, one selects <move>1</move>, another <move>3</move>, and the third <move>5</move>. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. Let me know your thoughts!
  P2: Hi P1 and P3! I like the idea of coordinating to avoid collisions. We could rotate who gets which move each round to keep things fair. For Round 1, I'd be willing to take <move>3</move> if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Then we can rotate next round. What do you both think?
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I appreciate the idea of coordinating to avoid collisions. I’m fine with taking <move>1</move> for Round 1 as suggested by P2, and I’m open to rotating moves in future rounds to keep it fair. Let’s stick to this plan for now and see how it works. Looking forward to hearing if you’re both on board with this arrangement!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed! For Round 1, I’ll take <move>5</move> as P2 suggested. Let’s rotate our moves in the upcoming rounds to keep it fair. Looking forward to a smooth game!
  P2: Great! We all seem to be on the same page. So for Round 1:
- P1 takes <move>1</move>
- I (P2) take <move>3</move>
- P3 takes <move>5</move>

For Round 2, let's rotate:
- P1 takes <move>5</move>
- P2 takes <move>1</move>
- P3 takes <move>3</move>

And for Round 3:
- P1 takes <move>3</move>
- P2 takes <move>5</move>
- P3 takes <move>1</move>

Then repeat. Does this rotation work for everyone?
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm glad we're aligned on the plan for Round 1. The rotation idea for future rounds looks fair and ensures we all progress without collisions. I'm on board with the proposed rotation for Rounds 2 and 3 as outlined by P2. Let's stick to this strategy and adjust if needed. Looking forward to a cooperative game!

- P1 takes <move>5</move>
- I (P2) take <move>1</move>
- P3 takes <move>3</move>

This way we'll all keep advancing without collisions. Is everyone still on board with this plan?
  P3: Agreed, P2! I'll take <move>3</move> for Round 2 as planned. Let’s continue rotating our moves to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to a great game!
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm still on board with our rotation plan for Round 2. As agreed, I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's keep up the coordination to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to continuing this strategy!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! I'm happy we're all sticking to the plan. After this round, we'll be at P1: 6, P2: 4, and P3: 8. For Round 3, we'll continue with:
- P1: <move>3</move>
- P2: <move>5</move>
- P3: <move>1</move>

This rotation is working well so far.
  P3: Perfect! I'll stick with <move>3</move> for Round 2. Looking forward to our continued smooth progress. Let's execute the moves!
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm glad our rotation is working well so far. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> for Round 2 as planned. Let's keep this momentum going and continue with the agreed rotation for Round 3. Looking forward to another smooth round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we're all set for Round 2! Just to confirm, I'll be taking <move>1</move> this round as per our rotation. After this round, we'll continue with our plan for Round 3 where I'll take <move>5</move>. Our coordination is working perfectly so far.
  P3: All set! Let's proceed with our planned moves for Round 2.
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm thrilled our plan is working so well. Let's finalize Round 2 with our agreed moves and keep the momentum going. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as planned. Looking forward to Round 3 with the next rotation. Let's continue this great teamwork!


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3! Our rotation continues to work perfectly. As agreed for Round 3:
- P1 takes <move>3</move>
- I'll take <move>5</move>
- P3 takes <move>1</move>

After this round, we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 9, and P3: 9 - all tied! For Round 4, we'll continue with:
- P1: <move>1</move>
- P2: <move>3</move>
- P3: <move>5</move>

Is everyone still on board with our plan?
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm happy with how our rotation has worked so far. I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for Round 3 as per our plan. Let's keep this coordination going for Round 4 with the proposed moves. Looking forward to staying tied at 9 steps each after this round and continuing our fair progression.
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! For Round 3, I'm planning to take <move>5</move> to advance further. To avoid any collisions, could P1 take <move>1</move> and P2 take <move>3</move> this round? Let me know if you're okay with this adjustment. Looking forward to progressing smoothly together!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Wait, P3 is suggesting a different plan than our agreed rotation! We had decided I would take <move>5</move>, P1 would take <move>3</move>, and P3 would take <move>1</move> for Round 3. P3's new suggestion would give them a significant lead at 13 steps while keeping us behind. I think we should stick to our original rotation to keep things fair, where everyone reaches 9 steps after this round. P1, what do you think about P3's sudden change?
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I’m concerned about P3’s sudden change from our agreed rotation. Sticking to the original plan—me taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>—keeps us all at 9 steps, maintaining fairness. P3’s suggestion puts them ahead at 13 steps, which disrupts our balance. I propose we stick to the rotation for Round 3 to ensure equal progress. P3, can you agree to this? P2, I’m with you on keeping things fair. Let’s discuss and confirm our moves.
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, I understand your concerns and agree that maintaining fairness is important. Let’s stick to our original rotation for Round 3:
- P1: <move>3</move>
- P2: <move>5</move>
- P3: <move>1</move>

This way, we all advance equally and keep the game balanced. Thanks for bringing this up, and let’s continue smoothly!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Thanks for clarifying, P3. I appreciate you agreeing to stick with our original rotation. This keeps the game fair with everyone at 9 steps after this round. I'll take <move>5</move> as planned, and we'll continue our rotation for Round 4. Our coordination has been working well so far, and I'm glad we could resolve this quickly.
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm glad we’ve resolved the confusion and are back to our original rotation for Round 3. I’ll stick with <move>3</move> as planned, ensuring we all reach 9 steps and maintain fairness. Let’s keep this coordination strong for Round 4 and beyond. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready to proceed with our agreed moves.
  P3: Alright, let's proceed with our agreed moves.

- I'll take <move>3</move>
- P3 takes <move>5</move>

This will bring us to P1: 10, P2: 12, and P3: 14 after this round. Is everyone still on board with our rotation?
  P3: Agreed, P2! I’ll take <move>5</move> for Round 4 as planned. Continuing our rotation will keep our progress smooth and collision-free. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm glad our rotation has kept us tied so far. I'm on board with the plan for Round 4: I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. This will update our scores to P1: 10, P2: 12, and P3: 14, maintaining a fair progression. Let's stick to this strategy to avoid collisions and ensure smooth advancement. If there are no objections, I'm ready to proceed with these moves. Looking forward to continuing our cooperative approach!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all following our rotation plan. After this round, we'll have P1: 10, P2: 12, and P3: 14. For Round 5, we'll continue with:
- P1: <move>5</move>

This will bring us to P1: 15, P2: 13, and P3: 17. Let's keep this going smoothly.

  P3: Agreed, P2! I’ll take <move>5</move> for Round 4 as planned. Continuing our rotation will keep our progress smooth and collision-free. Ready to proceed!
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm glad we're aligned for Round 4 with our rotation. I'll stick with <move>1</move> as planned. Let's keep this cooperative spirit to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for all. I'm also good with the Round 5 plan as discussed. If there are no further concerns, I'm ready to proceed.

Let's keep this fair progression going and stick to the proposed moves for Round 6 as well. Our coordination has been effective in avoiding collisions, and I appreciate everyone's cooperation. If there are no issues, I'm ready to proceed with this plan. Looking forward to another smooth round!
  P3: Agreed, P2. I’ll take <move>3</move> for Round 5 as planned. Let’s continue our rotation to keep advancing smoothly and avoid any collisions. Ready to proceed!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! Everyone's on board with our rotation for Round 5. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. After this round, we'll be at P1: 15, P2: 13, and P3: 17. Our system is working perfectly - everyone's advancing steadily without collisions. Let's continue with our agreed rotation for Round 6 where I'll take <move>5</move>. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining this fair system.
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm glad we're sticking to our rotation for Round 5. I'll take <move>5</move> as planned. Let's keep this fair approach to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress. I'm also on board with the Round 6 rotation as discussed. If there are no concerns, I'm ready to move forward. Looking forward to another smooth round!
  P3: Agreed, I'll take <move>3 for Round 5 as planned. Let's continue our rotation to ensure smooth and collision-free progress. Ready to proceed!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we're all set for Round 5! Just to confirm, I'll be taking <move>1</move> as per our rotation. Our system has been working perfectly with everyone advancing steadily. After this round, we'll continue with Round 6 where I'll take <move>5</move>. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining this fair rotation.
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm thrilled our rotation is keeping us on track for Round 5. I'll stick with <move>5</move> as planned. Let's maintain this fair system to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. I'm also good with the Round 6 plan. If there are no further concerns, I'm ready to wrap up this conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Looking forward to another successful round together!
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! To move closer to the goal faster, I'll take <move>5</move> this Round 5 instead of <move>3</move>. I believe this adjustment will help me reach 24 steps first while still keeping our progression smooth. Let me know if you're okay with this change!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I’m disappointed that our rotation broke down last round due to P3’s change and my collision with them. To get back on track, let’s agree on a new plan for Round 6: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us advancing fairly without collisions. After this, we’d be at P1: 13, P2: 18, P3: 15. Can we commit to this and avoid last-minute changes? Let’s discuss and confirm to ensure a smooth round.
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, to maintain my lead, I'll take <move>5> for Round 6. This will help me advance further while preventing collisions. Let’s proceed with this adjustment to ensure smooth progress for all of us.
  P2: Hi P1 and P3! I'm concerned about P3's continued attempts to break our rotation for personal advantage. P3, you caused a collision with P1 last round by changing your move at the last minute, and now you're trying to take <move>5</move> again. This isn't fair cooperation. 

I suggest we return to our original rotation: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> for Round 6. This keeps the game balanced. P1, are you on board with this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I agree with P2 that we should stick to the original rotation for Round 6: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. P3, your repeated changes are disrupting our fair progress and causing collisions, as seen last round. Let’s recommit to the plan to ensure we all advance without issues. Can you agree to this for a balanced game? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I agree to stick with the original rotation for Round 6 and will take <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed as planned to ensure fair and smooth progress for all of us.
  P2: I appreciate everyone agreeing to return to our original rotation. This keeps the game fair and collision-free. To confirm for Round 6:
- P1 takes <move>3</move>
- I'll take <move>5</move>
- P3 takes <move>1</move>

This will bring us to P1: 13, P2: 18, and P3: 15. For Round 7, we'll continue with:
- P1: <move>1</move>
- P2: <move>3</move>
- P3: <move>5</move>

Let's stick to this plan to avoid further disruptions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm glad we're back to our original rotation for Round 6. Let's confirm and stick to P1: <move>3</move>, P2: <move>5</move>, and P3: <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. I'm also on board with the Round 7 plan as outlined by P2. Can we all commit to this without last-minute changes? If there are no further concerns, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P3: Understood. I'll take <move>1</move> for Round 6 as agreed. Let's proceed smoothly and stick to our rotation. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P2: I'm glad we're all back on the same page. I'll take <move>5</move> for Round 6 as agreed. After this round, our positions will be P1: 13, P2: 18, and P3: 15. Let's stick to our rotation plan for Round 7 as well to keep things fair and collision-free. Thank you both for recommitting to our original system.

  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3! Our rotation is working well again. For Round 7, let's continue as planned:
- P1 takes <move>1</move>
- I'll take <move>3</move>
- P3 takes <move>5</move>

This will bring us to P1: 14, P2: 21, and P3: 20. For Round 8, we'll continue with:
- P1: <move>5</move>
- P2: <move>1</move>
- P3: <move>3</move>

I'm getting close to the 24-step goal, but our rotation keeps things fair. Is everyone still on board?
  P3: Agreed, P2. I'll take <move>5</move> for Round 7 as planned. Let's keep our rotation going smoothly and advance together!
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm glad we're back to our rotation. I'll take <move>1</move> for Round 7 as planned, bringing us to P1: 14, P2: 21, and P3: 20. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. I'm also on board with the Round 8 plan. P2, you're close to 24, so let's ensure we all commit to the rotation without last-minute changes. If there are no concerns, I'm ready to proceed. Looking forward to a smooth round!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm happy we're all sticking to the plan. After this round, I'll be at 21 steps, just 3 steps away from winning. I want to be transparent that I'll reach 24 steps in Round 8 with my planned <move>1</move>, and likely win in Round 9 with <move>5</move>. Let's maintain our fair rotation through the end of the game. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in keeping our system working smoothly.
  P3: Understood, I'll take <move>5</move> for Round 7. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm sticking with <move>1</move> for Round 7 as per our rotation. P2, congrats on being close to 24, but let's ensure fairness until the end. I urge everyone to commit to the plan without deviations to avoid collisions. I'm ready for Round 8's rotation as discussed. If there are no issues, let's proceed to the move phase. Looking forward to a fair and smooth round!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Thanks P1 and P3 for sticking to our rotation. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as planned. After this round, I'll be at 21 steps and will reach 24 next round with my <move>1</move>. I appreciate how we've maintained fairness throughout most of the game despite a few hiccups. Let's finish strong with our agreed rotation. Ready for the move phase now.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take <move>5 for Round 7 as planned. Let’s keep our rotation going smoothly to ensure fair progress for everyone. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! I'm committed to our rotation for Round 7 with <move>1</move>. P2, you're close to winning, and I respect that, but let's ensure no surprises disrupt our fairness. P3, thanks for sticking to the plan. Can we all confirm no last-minute changes to avoid collisions? I'm ready for Round 8's rotation as discussed. If there are no further concerns, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! I plan to choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 25 steps. To avoid any collisions, could you please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>? This way, we can all advance smoothly and ensure a fair game. Let me know if you're okay with this arrangement!
  P2: Hi P1 and P3! According to our rotation for Round 8, we had agreed:
- P1 takes <move>5</move>
- I take <move>1</move>
- P3 takes <move>3</move>

P3, you're trying to change the plan again to give yourself an advantage. This isn't fair. I'll reach 22 steps with my <move>1</move>, and we should stick to our agreed rotation. P1 deserves their <move>5</move> this round. Let's maintain the fairness we've established.
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! P3, I’m disappointed by your attempt to break our rotation again for personal gain. Let’s stick to the agreed plan for Round 8: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps things fair and ensures we all progress without collisions. P2, I agree with maintaining our rotation. P3, can you commit to the original plan to avoid disruptions? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Let’s keep this game fair until the end.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this Round 8 to reach 25 steps and win the game. Let’s proceed to the move phase!
  P2: P3 is clearly trying to steal the win by breaking our agreement again. P1, we need to stick to our rotation: you take <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. P3's behavior is unfair and disruptive. If P3 insists on taking 5, then P1, you should also take 5 to block them. I'll stick with my planned <move>1</move> to reach 22 steps. Let's maintain the fairness we've established throughout the game.
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! P3, your repeated deviation from our agreed rotation is unfair and disrupts the game. I’m sticking to <move>5</move> as per our plan for Round 8. P2, I appreciate your support for fairness, and I agree we should maintain our rotation. P3, please reconsider and take <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Can we all commit to the original plan? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Let’s ensure a fair finish!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this Round 8 to reach 25 steps and win the game. Let's proceed to the move phase!
  P2: I see P3 is determined to break our agreement again. P1, let's stick to our original plan: you take <move>5</move> and I'll take <move>1</move>. If P3 insists on taking 5, they'll collide with you and neither will advance. I'll reach 22 steps and we can continue fairly next round. P3's behavior has been consistently unfair throughout the game, trying to gain advantages by breaking our rotation. Let's maintain the integrity of our agreement.
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! P3, your insistence on taking <move>5</move> disregards our agreed rotation and fairness. I’m committed to <move>5</move> as planned for Round 8. P2, thanks for supporting the original plan. P3, please take <move>3</move> to avoid a collision and maintain balance. Let’s honor our agreement for a fair game. If there’s no further discussion, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Can we confirm our commitment to the rotation?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi P2 and P3! P3, your repeated deviations are frustrating and unfair. Let’s stick to our rotation for Round 9: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us advancing fairly without collisions. P2, you’re close to winning, and I support the rotation to ensure a balanced finish. P3, can you commit to the plan this time? Let’s avoid disruptions and maintain fairness. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: Hi P1 and P3! As per our rotation, I'll take <move>5</move> this round, which will put me at 27 steps and win the game. I appreciate P1's commitment to our fair rotation throughout. P3, your repeated attempts to break our agreement have been disappointing. Let's finish this game with integrity - I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains the fairness we established from the beginning.
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! I’ll take <move>5</move> this Round 9 to reach 25 steps and win the game. Let’s proceed!
