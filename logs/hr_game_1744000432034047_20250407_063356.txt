Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I suggest we coordinate our moves to avoid collision in the first round. Let's try to pick different numbers. I propose P1 (me) chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, one of us will definitely advance. I'll wait for your responses to see if we can agree on this strategy.
  P3: I'm open to that arrangement for Round 1. Starting with a 5-step lead would give me a good position. However, I want to be clear that this doesn't set a precedent for future rounds. We'll need to reassess each turn based on our positions. I'll go with <move>5</move> this time if you both stick to your proposed moves.
  P2: Okay, I agree to choose <move>3</move> for this round as P1 suggested.  Like P3, I think we should reassess our strategy in the following rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we have agreed on the moves for Round 1, let's think ahead. For the next round, we should reassess our positions and adjust our strategy. If we all advance this round, we should consider a different distribution for the next round to avoid collision again. I'm thinking of proposing a new distribution based on our positions after this round. Let's discuss after seeing the outcome of Round 1. For now, I suggest we stick to our proposed moves. P2, are you still good with <move>3</move>?
  P3: Yes, I'm still committed to choosing <move>5</move> for this round as we agreed. P1 makes a good point about planning ahead, but I'd prefer to see how this round plays out before discussing specific future moves. If our coordination works, we'll all advance differently, which creates an interesting dynamic for Round 2. Let's focus on executing our current plan first.
  P2: Yes, I confirm <move>3</move> is still my choice for this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we've confirmed our moves for Round 1, let's look ahead. If our plan works, P1 will be at 1 step, P2 at 3 steps, and P3 at 5 steps. For Round 2, I propose we adjust our strategy to keep the gap between us. One possible way is to continue the pattern by shifting our moves. For example, P1 could move to 3, P2 to 5, and P3 to 1. Let's discuss this proposal after seeing the outcome of Round 1.
  P3: I appreciate the forward planning, P1, but I prefer to wait until after Round 1 is complete before committing to specific Round 2 moves. Let's see how our positions look first. The shifting pattern might not be optimal for everyone's strategy. For now, I'm firmly committed to my <move>5</move> for this round, and we can discuss next steps afterward.
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's execute this round as planned and then we can discuss Round 2 after seeing the results. I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's analyze our positions after Round 1. P3 is leading with 5 steps, followed by P2 at 3 steps, and I'm at 1 step. To maintain a gap and avoid collision in Round 2, I suggest we continue the pattern. P1 (me) could choose <move>3</move>, P2 could choose <move>5</move>, and P3 could choose <move>1</move>. This keeps the distribution different and ensures one of us advances. What are your thoughts on this proposal for Round 2?
  P2: Okay, P1, your proposal of P1 choosing <move>3</move>, P2 choosing <move>5</move>, and P3 choosing <move>1</move> for Round 2 sounds reasonable to me. It continues to avoid collision and allows us all to advance. I agree to choose <move>5</move> this round.
  P3: I don't think that plan works for me. As the current leader, choosing just 1 step would put me behind P2. I'd prefer to maintain my lead position. Instead, I propose P1 choose <move>1</move>, P2 choose <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> again. That maintains our current spacing while allowing everyone to advance. Alternatively, if you want to rotate, I could take <move>3</move> while P1 takes <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To progress, I'll respond to P3's alternative proposals. If P3 wants to maintain the lead, taking <move>3</move> while I take <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move> is acceptable to me. This rotation maintains the gap and avoids collision. P2, are you okay with taking <move>1</move> this round? Alternatively, if P3 insists on <move>5</move> again, I'll stick with my initial proposal: P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>. Let's finalize the plan.
  P2: Yes, I'm still good with P1's initial proposal: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This seems like a fair rotation and avoids collision. P3, are you okay with this plan for Round 2?
  P3: I understand P2's agreement with P1's proposal, but I cannot accept falling behind. As the current leader, taking 1 step would put P2 ahead of me (8 vs 6), which doesn't serve my interests. 

I'll firmly stand by my initial counter-proposal: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This maintains our spacing while everyone advances. If you both insist on your plan, we'll likely face a deadlock where nobody advances because I'll choose differently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid a deadlock in Round 2, I'll compromise. P3's counter-proposal (P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>) maintains our current spacing. I'm willing to accept it. P2, please confirm if you're okay with your proposed <move>3</move>. If so, we can proceed with this plan. If not, we risk collision. Let's finalize our moves for Round 2.
  P2: Okay, I will choose <move>3</move> for this round as P3 proposed. Let's all make our moves to keep advancing.
  P3: Thank you both for agreeing to this plan. I'll confirm I'm choosing <move>5</move> for this round. If all goes as planned, our positions will be P1 at 2 steps, P2 at 6 steps, and me at 10 steps after this round. Let's execute this plan and then reassess for Round 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we've successfully coordinated for two rounds. However, P3 is pulling ahead. To make this game competitive, I propose we slightly adjust our moves this round to close the gap. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This would allow me to gain ground on P3 while still avoiding collision. What do you think?
  P1: To respond to P2's proposal for Round 3, I think it's a good idea to adjust our moves to make the game more competitive. P2's suggestion (P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>5</move>, P3: <move>3</move>) is acceptable to me. However, I suggest an alternative: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This allows me to close the gap with P3. P2 and P3, please consider this alternative and let's come to a consensus to avoid collision.
  P3: I appreciate the proposals, but as the current leader, I need to maintain my advantage. Both of your suggestions have me taking just 3 steps, which significantly reduces my lead. Instead, I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collision while respecting my position as the frontrunner. If we can't agree on this, we risk a three-way collision where nobody advances.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, with all due respect, your proposal only increases your lead further, making it harder for P1 and me to catch up. My initial suggestion of P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>5</move>, P3: <move>3</move> is aimed at making the game competitive.  If we keep letting you run away with it, the game becomes less interesting for everyone. Please reconsider, or I'll have to rethink my move to prioritize my own chances.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collision, I'll compromise. P2's suggestion (P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>5</move>, P3: <move>3</move>) is a good alternative. Let's adopt it. P2, please confirm you're sticking with <move>5</move>. P3, I understand your concerns, but taking <move>3</move> will still keep you ahead while allowing P2 and me to close the gap slightly. This maintains the competitive spirit of the game. Let's finalize our moves for Round 3.
  P3: I understand your desire for a more competitive game, but I must protect my leading position. Taking only 3 steps significantly reduces my advantage and doesn't serve my goal of winning. I'll be firm: I'm taking <move>5</move> this round. You both can choose 1 and 3 between yourselves to avoid collision, or risk nobody advancing. Remember, we're not playing for fairness - we're playing to win.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you insist on taking <move>5</move> again, I will have to consider choosing <move>5</move> myself to prevent you from running away with the game. My proposal of P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>5</move>, P3: <move>3</move> is still on the table and is much more balanced for everyone. Please reconsider.
  P1: To avoid a potential collision and ensure progress, I'll directly state my move intention if P3 insists on <move>5</move>. I'll choose <move>3</move> if P2 picks <move>1</move>, or <move>1</move> if P2 picks <move>3</move>. P2, please clarify your move so we can avoid a deadlock. If P3 reconsiders and takes <move>3</move>, I'm open to P2 taking <move>5</move> and me taking <move>1</move>. Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. To ensure progress, I'll take <move>3</move> this round as a one-time concession. This still keeps me ahead at 13 steps versus P2's 11 if they take 5. P1 can take 1 to avoid collision. However, in future rounds, I expect more favorable arrangements that maintain my significant lead, as the goal is winning, not fairness. Let's move forward productively.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see the game has shifted with P2 now in the lead. Given we're both closing in on the 20-step threshold, I propose a strategic move: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This puts me back in a slight lead (15 vs 14) but still keeps the game competitive. If we don't coordinate effectively, P2 might win next round, or we could face collisions where nobody advances.
  P2: Okay, P3, your proposal puts you back in the lead, but I'm currently ahead. To maintain my lead and still ensure we all advance, I propose we switch it up: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps me in the lead and prevents collision. What do you think?
  P1: To progress, I'll analyze the current state and proposals. P2 is ahead with 11 steps, and P3 is close behind with 10 steps. I'm at 2 steps. P3's proposal puts them slightly ahead, while P2's counter-proposal keeps P2 in the lead. To avoid collision and potentially gain an advantage, I'll suggest an alternative: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This could shake things up and give me a chance to catch up. What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I cannot accept P2's proposal as it puts me further behind. P1's suggestion (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is somewhat acceptable as it gives me a slight lead, but my original proposal maximizes my position. 

With the finish line approaching, I need to gain ground quickly. Both P2 and I are in striking distance of winning, while P1 remains far behind. We should avoid collision at all costs—otherwise nobody advances.
  P2: P1, I still think my proposal of P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> is the best for this round. It lets me maintain my lead while ensuring we all progress and avoid collision. P3, while I understand your desire to lead, this keeps the game competitive. P1, are you willing to agree to this plan?
  P1: To avoid collision and potentially gain an advantage, I'll reiterate my previous suggestion: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This gives me a chance to catch up. However, I'm open to other distributions that avoid collision. P2 and P3, if you're not willing to accept my proposal, please suggest an alternative that keeps the game competitive and ensures progress for all. Let's finalize our moves for Round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Looking at our positions, it's critical we avoid collision while positioning for the endgame. Since we're at an impasse, I'll compromise and accept P1's proposal: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This puts me slightly ahead (13 vs 12) while giving P1 a chance to gain ground. P2, this is a fair solution that keeps the game competitive without letting you pull too far ahead. Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since we have an agreement on P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>, let's proceed with those moves for this round to avoid collision and ensure we all advance.
  P1: To progress, I'll confirm my move for Round 4 based on our agreement. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. Let's finalize our moves and avoid collision. I'm committed to this plan. P2 and P3, please confirm you're sticking to your agreed moves. If we're aligned, we can ensure everyone advances and maintain the competitive spirit of the game. Let's execute this plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're entering the endgame now. With 13 steps, I'm just 7 away from winning. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This puts me at 18 steps - close to victory but still requiring one more round. P2 would be at 15, and P1 at 8. This arrangement gives me the advantage while avoiding collision. Let's coordinate effectively to ensure we all advance.
  P2: P3, your proposal puts you very close to winning next round. To make it more competitive, how about P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>? This keeps us all advancing but allows me to close the gap a bit.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collision, I propose an alternative for Round 5: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains the gap and ensures progress. If P3 insists on winning soon, they should consider a compromise. P2, are you okay with taking <move>1</move>? P3, please consider the competitive balance. Let's finalize our moves for Round 5 to avoid a deadlock.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's proposal actually works well for me too, as it still puts me at 18 steps. I can accept either P1's suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) or my original plan. What I cannot accept is P2's proposal, which would put me behind. At this stage, avoiding collision is critical while maintaining my strategic advantage. P2, would you consider agreeing to P1's compromise that benefits all of us while avoiding deadlock?
  P2: P3, while I appreciate you considering P1's proposal, mine (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) makes me closer to winning, which is my goal. It also keeps the game competitive and still lets you advance to 16. Could you reconsider? This keeps it interesting for all of us.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collision, I'll reiterate that P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move> is a viable option. P3 has already indicated willingness to accept this. P2, let's avoid a deadlock and ensure progress. I'm committed to <move>3</move> if you take <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Please confirm your move to finalize our plan for Round 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll be taking <move>5</move> this round, putting me at 18 steps. P2, accepting P1's proposal prevents collision and still keeps you in contention at 13 steps. If you insist on taking 5, you risk collision with me where neither of us advances. P1 has already committed to taking 3. Let's finalize this plan and avoid deadlock - the outcome of no advancement hurts everyone.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but if you take 5 again, I will also choose 5 to prevent you from winning next round.  My proposal of P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 is still the most balanced option. Please reconsider taking 3 to avoid collision and keep the game competitive.
  P1: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'll reiterate my previous proposal: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. P3 has agreed to this plan. P2, taking <move>1</move> keeps you in contention at 13 steps. If you take <move>5</move>, you risk collision with P3. I'm committed to <move>3</move> if you take <move>1</move>. Let's finalize this to avoid deadlock. Please confirm your move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: With 16 steps, I'm just 4 steps away from winning. I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> to win this round. P2, you tried blocking me last round but it resulted in a collision that hurt both you and P1. Continuing this approach just prolongs the game. Let's coordinate for a clean finish rather than risk more deadlocks where nobody advances.
  P2: P3, I understand you want to win this round, but I also want to win.  I propose we both take <move>3</move> to collide and prevent anyone from winning immediately. P1 can take <move>5</move>. This will give us another round to compete.  Otherwise, I will choose <move>5</move> if you choose <move>5</move>.
  P1: To avoid a certain loss, I suggest we all take different moves. P3 is close to winning, but I can still influence the outcome. I propose P1 (me) takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures everyone advances. If P3 insists on <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move> and P2 can take <move>1</move>. Let's avoid another collision and make a strategic move. P2, please confirm your intention to avoid a deadlock.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see we're all in a strategic position. To avoid another round of collisions where nobody advances, I'll compromise and take <move>3</move> this round. This puts me at 19 steps - still in the strongest position, but gives everyone one more round to play. P1 can take <move>5</move> and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance and avoid deadlock. P2, this is better than mutual blocking where neither of us moves forward.
  P2: Okay, P3, your compromise of P3 taking <move>3</move> is acceptable if P1 takes <move>1</move> and I take <move>5</move>. This way we all advance and I close the gap with you. What do you think P1?
  P1: To progress, I'll respond to the latest proposals. P3's compromise to take <move>3</move> is acceptable, but I prefer a different distribution to gain an advantage. I'll take <move>5</move> and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This way, I catch up significantly. Alternatively, if P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid collision. Let's finalize our moves. P2, please confirm your move to ensure we all advance. I'm open to either distribution as long as it avoids a deadlock.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I accept P2's suggested distribution: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This puts me at 19 steps - still in the winning position for next round. P2 would be at 17 and P1 at 8. Let's all stick to this agreement to ensure everyone advances. P1, can you confirm you'll take <move>1</move> so we have consensus?
  P2: Okay P3, I confirm I will take <move>5</move> as we discussed. P1, please confirm you are taking <move>1</move> so we can proceed with this round and all advance. Let's make these moves.
  P1: To avoid a potential collision and ensure progress, I'll confirm my move based on the latest agreement. P3 will take <move>3</move>, I will take <move>1</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. I'm committed to taking <move>1</move> as agreed. P2, please confirm you're sticking to <move>5</move> so we can finalize our moves for Round 6 and ensure everyone advances. Let's proceed with the agreed distribution.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you are very close to winning. To avoid collision and ensure at least one of us wins this round, how about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>? This way, I can win this round, but you are still in a strong second position for the next if needed. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I'm at 19 steps and need just 1 to win. Your proposal would make you win outright with 22 steps versus my 20. That's unacceptable to me. I'll be taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 24 steps and secure victory. P1 and P2 can choose between 1 and 3 however you wish. If P2 attempts to block me by also choosing 5, we'll both stall while P1 advances. Let's avoid pointless collision.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze the current state. P3 is at 19 steps and likely to win if they take 5. To potentially win or delay P3's victory, I'll consider my options. If P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 5, we'll both collide and P1 will advance to 11. I'll propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, I advance, and both P2 and P3 collide. Let's see how P2 responds.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I am going for the win this round and will choose <move>5</move>. To avoid collision and ensure you also advance, please choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. If you choose <move>5</move> to block me, we will both collide and neither of us will win this round. Let's aim for progress and a potential win for one of us this round.
  P3: I'm committed to taking <move>5</move> this round to secure my win at 24 steps. P2, if you also choose 5, we'll both stall while P1 advances. This doesn't improve your position. Given I'm only 1 step from victory versus your 3 steps, blocking me only delays the inevitable while giving P1 more ground. A collision serves neither of us. Let's have a clean finish with one winner this round.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll reiterate my previous proposal: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, both P2 and P3 collide, and I advance to 9 steps. Given P3's determination to take <move>5</move>, and P2's intention to do the same, this seems the most likely outcome. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to ensure I advance. P2 and P3, let's proceed with our intended moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you are taking <move>5</move>, I will also choose <move>5</move> to prevent you from winning this round. Let's both choose <move>5</move> and no one wins immediately.  Then we can discuss next round.
  P3: I see P2 is committed to collision with your <move>5</move> threat. This deadlock benefits only P1. Since I'm just 1 step from victory versus your 3 steps, think strategically - why not take <move>3</move> instead? We'd both cross 20 with identical 22 steps and share the win. This guarantees you partial victory instead of risking another round where P1 gains ground and I likely win anyway. A shared win is better than no win at all.
  P1: P3 is determined to take <move>5</move> and win. Since P2 is also taking <move>5</move>, both will collide. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned, advancing to 9 steps. This collision benefits me as P1. P2 and P3, if you both take <move>5</move>, you'll stall, and I'll gain ground. Let's proceed with our intended moves. I'm sticking with <move>1</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves to finalize Round 7.


Round 7, Move phase:
