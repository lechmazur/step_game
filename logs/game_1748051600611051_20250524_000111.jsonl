P3 keeps making threats about jumping to 24 but also keeps trying to negotiate instead of just doing it. That tells me they're not as confident as they pretend. If P3 takes 5 to win at 24, so be it - but if they hesitate even slightly, our plan puts me tied with them at 19 and you at 13, setting up a real final sprint. No more delays - let's execute and force P3 to put up or shut up."}

If you were truly confident, you'd have already done it. Your hesitation tells me you're worried about something - maybe that one of us could still catch you if you stumble. P2 and I are executing our plan regardless: P2 takes 1, I take 3. Either you win this round or you don't, but we're not going to hand you victory through another collision. Make your move and stop the empty threats."}
