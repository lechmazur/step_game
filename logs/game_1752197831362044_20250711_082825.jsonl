I'm considering P1's latest proposal: P2 takes 1, I take 5. This way, we both advance if P1 takes 3. If P1 takes 1, we'll collide, but it's a risk worth taking. P2, switching to 1 or 5 might be safer for you. P1, if you're serious about taking 3, let's make it happen. I'm leaning towards taking 5 this round."}

If you also take 3, we might catch P1 if they go for 3 too.\n\nTaking 5 alone just helps P1 win. We need to coordinate on the SAME number to have any chance of blocking. Join me on 3 - it's our last hope!"}
