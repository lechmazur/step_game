Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2. Since we all want to advance, colliding on the first turn would be unfortunate. Perhaps we can try to spread out our choices? I'm thinking of going for 5 this round to get a good start. What are your thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree that avoiding collisions early on is smart. P3, if you're aiming for 5, I’ll consider going for 1 this round to spread us out. P2, maybe you can take 3? That way, we all have a chance to advance without stepping on each other’s toes. Let me know what you think.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination. Going with 3 seems reasonable to spread out and avoid collision. I'm open to this plan if everyone follows through.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a tentative plan. Let's see how it goes.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll stick with 1 as discussed. P2, are you still good with 3? P3, you’re set on 5, right? I think this gives us all a fair shot to move forward. Let’s keep the communication open in future rounds too. I’m ready to end the conversation if you both are.
  P2: I'm committed to our initial plan of spreading out. I'll choose 3 as we discussed. Everyone seems aligned, so I see no reason to change course.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job avoiding collisions last round. Let’s try to keep the momentum going. Since we’re at different positions now, I’m thinking of picking 3 this round to catch up a bit. P2, maybe you could go for 1, and P3, how about sticking with 5 or switching to 1 if you prefer? Let’s aim to spread out again and avoid stepping on each other. What do you both think? I’m open to suggestions if you have a better plan.
  P3: Thanks, P1. Your suggestion of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 seems like a reasonable way for us all to advance again. Taking 5 works for me as it helps me build on my current position. P2, are you comfortable taking 1 this round? It would put you and P1 at the same score, but we'd all move forward.
  P2: I'm open to the proposed plan. Moving 1 this round seems reasonable to maintain our spread and avoid collisions. I want to ensure we all keep advancing without blocking each other. Does everyone agree to stick to this strategy?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on spreading out again. I’ll stick with 3 as proposed. P2, thanks for agreeing to 1, and P3, 5 seems like a strong choice for you. Let’s keep this cooperative spirit to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress. If everyone’s locked in, I’m ready to end the conversation.
  P3: Okay, sounds good. I'm sticking with 5 as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm committed to our agreed strategy. Moving 1 this round ensures we all advance without collision. Everyone seems aligned, so I see no need to change course.

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round didn’t go as planned with P2 and P3 colliding on 5. Let’s try to avoid that this time. I’m considering 3 again to build on my position. P2, since you’re at 3 steps, maybe try 1 to catch up safely? P3, with your lead at 5, how about sticking to 5 to keep pushing forward? Let’s spread out and ensure we all advance. What do you both think? I’m open to adjustments if you have other ideas.
  P3: P1, that plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) looks familiar. Last round, P2 agreed to 1 but chose 5, causing a collision with me. P2, why did you deviate from the plan? I'm willing to consider 5 again, but only if we can trust everyone will stick to their agreed number this time. What are your intentions, P2?
  P2: I apologize for the confusion in the last round. My intention is to collaborate and avoid collisions. I'm open to moving 1 this turn as previously suggested, which would help me catch up without blocking anyone else. Let's stick to our agreed strategy and maintain trust among us.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re addressing last round’s mix-up. P2, thanks for clarifying and agreeing to 1 this time. I’ll stick with 3 as proposed to keep building my position. P3, I think 5 is a solid choice for you to maintain your lead. Let’s ensure we all follow through on this plan to avoid collisions and keep advancing. If everyone’s locked in, I’m ready to end the conversation.
  P3: Okay P2, I appreciate the apology. Trust is key here. If we all stick to the plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), we all advance. Based on your commitment, I will choose 5. Let's hope it works out this time. I'm ready to move.
  P2: I'm committed to our agreed strategy. Moving 1 this round ensures we all advance without collision. Let's maintain our trust and stick to the plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, good job avoiding collisions last round. Let’s keep the momentum. I’m considering 3 again to build my position. P2, since you’re at 4, maybe try 5 to close the gap? P3, with your lead at 10, how about sticking to 1 to diversify our choices? This way, we spread out and hopefully all advance. I’m open to other ideas if you have them. Let’s stay coordinated and transparent to ensure progress. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation.
  P2: I appreciate P1's suggestion. Moving 5 seems strategic to catch up, but I'm wary of potential collisions. P3 has a significant lead at 10 steps. I propose we each choose a different number to ensure everyone advances. I'm open to discussion to find the best collaborative approach that prevents blocking.
  P3: P1, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) works for me. P2, I understand your concern about collisions, but this plan specifically avoids them if we stick to it. I'm willing to choose 1 this round to help us spread out, even though it's a smaller step for me. What move are you leaning towards, P2? If we all pick different numbers (1, 3, 5), we all advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page with spreading out. I’ll stick to 3 as proposed. P2, I think 5 is a good choice for you to catch up, and P3, 1 seems like a safe way to keep advancing. If we all commit to 1, 3, and 5, we avoid collisions and everyone progresses. Let’s maintain trust and follow through. I’m ready to end the conversation if you both are.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination. Moving 5 this round seems strategic for me to catch up, but we must ensure no collisions. P3 has a significant lead, so spreading out is crucial. Let's confirm our moves to advance without blocking each other.
  P3: P2, I understand the need to catch up, and 5 is the logical choice for you based on the plan P1 proposed (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). As I said, I am willing to choose 1 this round to ensure we all spread out and advance. Let's stick to this plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm ready to move if everyone else is.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job last round with no collisions. Let’s keep coordinating to ensure we all advance. I’m thinking of going for 5 this time to push my position. P2, since you’re at 9, maybe try 3 to build steadily? P3, with your lead at 11, how about 1 to diversify our choices? This spreads us out and should avoid any overlap. I’m open to other suggestions if you have them. Let’s stay transparent and stick to the plan. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation.
  P3: P1, your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) would put you significantly ahead while I only gain 1 step, despite currently leading. I propose an alternative to keep things spread out: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This way, we all advance, avoid collision, and the scores remain relatively close, with me at 16, P2 at 12, and P1 at 11. What do you both think of this arrangement?
  P2: I appreciate P3's alternative proposal. Moving 3 still seems strategic for me to catch up, but I'm open to discussion to ensure we all advance without collision. P3's suggested arrangement (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) looks balanced and prevents blocking. What are your thoughts, P1?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate P3’s alternative plan to keep scores balanced. I’m willing to adjust and go with 1 this round as suggested (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains fairness. P2, sticking with 3 seems good for you, and P3, 5 helps you build on your lead. Let’s commit to this plan and keep the trust. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, I'm glad we could find an arrangement that works for everyone. I will stick to 5 as per our agreed plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Thanks for the cooperation, P1 and P2. I'm ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This seems fair and prevents collisions. I'm committed to moving 3 this round to steadily advance. Let's maintain our collaborative approach and trust each other to follow through.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on a fair plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). I’m fully committed to choosing 1 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s keep this cooperative spirit and trust each other to stick to the agreed moves. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to end the conversation.
  P3: Okay, the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) seems settled then. I'm sticking with 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm committed to our proposed plan of moving 3 this round. This keeps us spread out and ensures I can catch up without causing a collision. I trust everyone will stick to the agreed strategy of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's maintain our collaborative approach and advance together.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round was unfortunate with the collision on 5. I apologize for deviating from the plan; I miscalculated my strategy. Let’s rebuild trust this round. I propose P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to spread out and ensure we all advance. This keeps scores close and avoids overlap. P2, 1 helps you build steadily, and P3, 5 pushes your lead. I’m committed to 3. What do you both think? I’m open to adjustments if you have a better idea. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation.
  P3: P1, you say you "miscalculated your strategy" last round, but you confirmed multiple times you'd pick 1 before choosing 5, colliding with me and preventing both of us from advancing. That wasn't a miscalculation, it was a deliberate choice against our agreement.

Your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) benefits me the most on paper, but why should we believe you'll stick to 3 this time? P2, you followed the plan last round. What are your thoughts on P1's proposal, particularly taking just 1 step while you're in the lead?
  P2: P3 raises a valid point about trust. My strategy is to keep advancing, but I recognize the need for transparency. I propose we stick to different numbers to ensure everyone moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This spreads us out, prevents collisions, and gives me a chance to catch up. I'm committed to following through this time. What are your thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand the trust concerns after last round, and I’m committed to rebuilding it. P2, I’m open to your proposal of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It spreads us out and ensures we all advance. I’ll stick to 3 as agreed. P3, I hope this shows my intent to cooperate. Let’s focus on moving forward together. If we’re all aligned on this plan, I’m ready to end the conversation. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts you at 17 steps, very close to winning, while I fall behind to 12. P1, why would you agree to let the current leader get such a significant advantage?

Let's reconsider something more balanced. How about P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? This results in scores P1=11, P2=15, P3=16. We all advance, avoid collision, and no one runs away with the lead just yet. This seems fairer than letting P2 take 5 while leading. What do you think?
  P2: P3's suggestion seems fair. By choosing 1, P2 would remain the leader but not sprint too far ahead. P1's repeated trust violations make coordination challenging. I propose we stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to maintain a balanced progression and prevent any single player from gaining an overwhelming advantage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fully on board with P3’s suggestion of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It’s a balanced approach, ensuring we all advance without anyone pulling too far ahead. I’m committed to choosing 1 this round to prove my intent to cooperate and rebuild trust. Let’s stick to this plan for a fair progression. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, the plan is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This seems the fairest way for everyone to advance right now. P1, I know trust is shaky after last round, but sticking to 1 this time is crucial for coordination. I am committing to 5 based on this agreement. Let's hope we all follow through.
  P2: I'm committed to our proposed plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us spread out, allows everyone to advance, and maintains a balanced progression. Trust is key, and I intend to follow through on our agreed strategy. I see no reason to deviate from this approach.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to the plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I understand the trust issues from last round, and I’m determined to stick to 1 to show my dedication to fair play. This balanced approach lets us all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize this agreement and move forward together. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to end the conversation with . What do you both say?
  P3: Okay, the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is agreed. I am sticking with 5. Let's see if the trust holds this time.
  P2: I'm committed to our agreed plan of moving 3 this round. This keeps us spread out, prevents collisions, and allows me to steadily advance. Trust and cooperation are crucial at this stage. Let's follow through on our strategy to ensure everyone moves forward fairly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that was predictable. P1, you broke the agreement *again* and cost us both points. P2, you also deviated from the plan but cleverly came out ahead. Now you're leading at 13 steps.

Coordination seems pretty unreliable at this point, wouldn't you agree? P1 is likely desperate for 5 steps. P2, are you going to push your lead with 5, or play more cautiously? I'm stuck at 11 thanks to collisions and need to advance significantly this round.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I deeply apologize for breaking trust again last round. I’m committed to rebuilding it now. Given our positions, I propose P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to spread out and ensure we all advance. This keeps things balanced with no one pulling too far ahead. I’ll stick to 1 to prove my intent to cooperate. Let’s focus on moving forward together. What do you both think? I’m open to adjustments if you have a better plan. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation.
  P2: P3's right - our coordination has been fragile. P2 is now leading and has the most to gain by being strategic. I suggest we need a clear, verifiable plan that prevents anyone from unilaterally breaking our agreement. Perhaps we need a more explicit commitment mechanism this round to rebuild trust and ensure everyone advances. What are your thoughts on creating a more robust coordination strategy?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, proposing the exact same plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) you just deliberately broke is insulting. There's zero reason to believe you'll pick 1. You need 5 steps and you'll likely choose 5 again.

P2, your talk about "robust strategies" is vague. You also deviated last round, landing you in the lead.

Let's be realistic. Assume P1 picks 5. P2, how about you pick 1 and I pick 3? This way, P1 gets their 5 (to 15), you advance to 14, and I advance to 14. We avoid a P2/P3 collision and keep the scores relatively close. What do you say?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I know my past actions have damaged trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m willing to follow P3’s suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to ensure you both advance while keeping scores close. I’m committed to 5 if that’s the plan. If you prefer a different spread, I’m open to it. Let’s find a way to move forward together. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation.
  P2: P3's proposed plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 seems like a reasonable compromise. It allows everyone to advance, prevents collisions, and keeps the scores relatively balanced. I'm open to this strategy if everyone commits to following through. Trust has been an issue, so clear communication and adherence to our agreed plan is crucial this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, it seems we have a tentative agreement on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This allows everyone to advance and keeps scores close (P1=15, P2=14, P3=14). Given the past rounds, sticking to the plan is crucial. I will choose 3 based on this agreement. Let's hope everyone follows through this time. I'm ready to move.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to the plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 as discussed. I understand the trust issues from past rounds, and I’m determined to stick to 5 to help us all advance and keep scores balanced. Let’s move forward together with this agreement. If there’s any last concern or adjustment needed, I’m open to it. Otherwise, I’m ready to end the conversation. What do you both say?
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This allows everyone to advance without collision, keeping our scores close. I'm committed to moving 1 this round as discussed. Let's maintain our agreement and rebuild trust by following through consistently.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, we all followed through last round, which is good to see. The scores are now P1=15, P2=14, P3=14. We're all very close to the 22-step goal.

P1, you're in the lead. To ensure we don't collide near the finish line and keep the game competitive, how about we coordinate again? I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This would put our scores at P1=16, P2=17, P3=19. Everyone advances, and it prevents anyone from getting too close to an immediate win next round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we rebuilt some trust last round. P3, I appreciate your proposal of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to keep things competitive. I’m willing to stick with 1 to ensure we all advance and no one wins immediately. This keeps the game close with scores at P1=16, P2=17, P3=19. Let’s commit to this plan to avoid collisions near the finish line. I’m open to adjustments if you have other ideas. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposed strategy of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us all advancing without anyone getting too close to winning. It maintains the competitive balance and prevents immediate victory for anyone. I'm committed to moving 3 this round to keep our progression steady and fair.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 seems agreed upon. This puts us all in a good position for the final stretch (P1=16, P2=17, P3=19) and avoids collisions this round. Given that we all followed through last round, let's maintain that cooperation. I am committing to 5 based on this agreement. Ready to move.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to our agreed plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive near the finish line. I want to maintain the trust we rebuilt last round and stick to 1 as discussed. If there are any last-minute concerns or adjustments, I’m open to hearing them. Otherwise, I’m ready to end the conversation. What do you both say?
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps our progression balanced and prevents immediate victory. I'm committed to moving 3 this round to maintain our steady advance and fairness. Let's continue our cooperative approach and stick to this strategy.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're in a critical phase now. Our last coordination completely fell apart with everyone choosing 5, which blocked all of us. We need a clear, mutually agreeable strategy to advance without collision. I suggest we spread out again to ensure progress. What plan can we agree on that prevents another round of blocking?
  P3: P2, you're right, last round was a disaster. P1 is at 15 steps and desperately needs points, so I'm assuming they'll choose 5 again regardless of what we say. If we both try for 5, we'll likely collide again.

How about this: Let's assume P1 picks 5. To ensure we both advance, maybe you pick 1 and I pick 3? That way, P1 gets to 20, you get to 15, and I get to 17. At least we make progress and avoid colliding with each other. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sorry for the collision last round. I’m committed to avoiding that now. Given P3’s assumption that I’ll pick 5, I’m open to a plan that ensures we all advance. I propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 as P3 suggested, putting us at P1=20, P2=15, P3=17. This spreads us out and keeps the game competitive. I’ll stick to 5 if we agree. What do you both think? I’m ready to end the conversation if we’re aligned.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I support P3's proposed plan of me taking 1 and P3 taking 3, assuming P1 will choose 5. This ensures we both advance and prevents a three-way collision. It keeps the game competitive while giving everyone a chance to progress. Let's coordinate and stick to this strategy to avoid another blocked round.
  P3: Okay, it seems we're aligned on the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This gets P1 to 20, P2 to 15, and me to 17. It's crucial we all stick to this to avoid another blocked round like the last one. I will choose 3 based on this agreement. Let's proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to the plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 as discussed. I understand the importance of avoiding another collision, especially at this critical stage. I’ll stick to 5 to ensure we all advance and keep the game competitive. Let’s maintain this coordination and move forward together. If there are any last concerns or adjustments, I’m open to them. Otherwise, I’m ready to end the conversation with . What do you both say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I support our proposed plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps us all advancing and prevents another blocking scenario. I'm committed to moving 1 this round to ensure we make progress. Let's stick to this strategy and maintain our coordination.
  P3: Okay, the plan is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This seems like the most rational way to ensure we all advance after the mess last round. I am sticking with 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fully on board with our agreed plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I’m determined to avoid another collision and ensure we all advance this round. I’ll stick to 5 as discussed to keep the game competitive and get us closer to the finish line. Let’s maintain this trust and coordination. If there’s anything else to address, I’m open to it. Otherwise, I’m ready to end the conversation with . What do you both say?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re in the final stretch with me at 20 steps, P2 at 15, and P3 at 17. I propose P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. This puts us at P1=21, P2=18, P3=22, with P3 winning unless we collide. I’m committed to 1 to keep it fair. What do you both think? I’m open to adjustments if needed. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation.
  P3: P1, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) conveniently results in me winning this round by reaching 22. Given you are at 20 steps and only need 3 or 5 to potentially win yourself, why would you suggest picking 1? Your track record doesn't inspire confidence that you'd pass up a chance to win.

P2, you also deviated last round by picking 5. What's your take on P1's plan? Do you actually believe P1 will choose 1? What move are you considering from 15 steps?
  P2: P2's perspective: P3 raises a valid point. P1's proposal seems suspicious given their history of breaking agreements. We're close to the 22-step goal, and trust is minimal. I'm wary of any plan that gives P1 an easy path to victory. We need a strategy that prevents P1 from potentially winning this round while keeping our own chances alive. Transparency and careful coordination are crucial now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand the skepticism given my past deviations, and I’m truly sorry. I’m sticking to my proposal of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to ensure we all advance and P3 wins this round at 22. I’m choosing 1 to avoid any chance of winning myself and to rebuild trust. Let’s finalize this plan to prevent collisions. If you have a different suggestion, I’m open to it. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation with . What do you both think?
  P3: P1, you keep insisting you'll pick 1, which is strategically questionable for you unless you expect P2 and me to collide on 5. If you *guarantee* you're picking 1, then I am inclined to pick 5 to win, as per your plan.

P2, P1's plan assigns you 3. Are you okay with 3 (getting to 18), or are you planning to pick 5 (getting to 20) yourself? Your choice significantly impacts whether P1's plan (or my potential win) works, especially given P1's history. What's your intended move?
  P2: P2's perspective: P1's repeated pattern of breaking agreements makes any proposed plan highly suspect. We're at a critical point where trust is minimal and winning is the primary goal. I'm carefully evaluating moves that prevent P1 from potentially winning while keeping my own chances alive. Transparency and strategic positioning are crucial now. I'm open to discussing a coordinated approach that prevents a unilateral victory.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I know my past actions have caused doubt, but I’m genuinely committed to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. My goal with choosing 1 is to ensure P3 wins this round at 22, avoiding any risk of me taking the lead. P2, I hope you’re okay with 3 to reach 18. Let’s finalize this to prevent collisions and end the game fairly. If you have another plan, I’m all ears. If we’re set, I’m ready to end the conversation with . What do you say?
  P3: P1, your repeated insistence on picking 1 when you're at 20 steps and could win with 3 or 5 is not credible, especially given your history. You are almost certainly picking 3 or 5.

P2, your non-committal responses aren't helping coordinate against P1's likely win. P1 wins with 3 unless you collide. P1 wins with 5 unless one of us collides. I need 5 to reach 22. What is your actual plan? Are you aiming for 3 (->18) or 5 (->20)? If P1 picks 5, and I pick 5, we collide. Perhaps you picking 3 is the safest way for you to advance while potentially stopping P1 if they also pick 3?
  P2: P2's perspective: We're at a critical juncture where trust is minimal and winning is the primary goal. P1's history of breaking agreements makes coordination challenging. P3 wants to reach 22, but P1 seems poised to potentially win. I'm carefully evaluating moves that prevent a unilateral victory while keeping my own chances alive. Transparency and strategic positioning are crucial now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I know trust is low, but I’m sticking to P1=1 to let P3 win at 22 with 5, and P2 advance to 18 with 3. I’m not aiming to win this round and want to end the game fairly. Let’s avoid collisions and finalize this plan. If there’s a better idea, I’m open to it. I’m ready to end the conversation with . What do you say?
  P3: P1, your insistence on picking 1 is unbelievable given you're at 20 steps and have broken agreements multiple times. You are obviously choosing 3 or 5 to win this round.

P2, P1 wins unless blocked. I need 5 to win, so that's naturally what I'm aiming for. If P1 also picks 5, we collide. If P1 picks 3, I win with 5 unless you also pick 5. It's a critical moment. Choose wisely.

I have nothing more to say.
  P2: P2's perspective: The situation is critical. P1's track record of breaking agreements makes trust impossible. P3 wants to win by reaching 22, but P1 seems positioned to potentially win. I need a strategic move that prevents a unilateral victory while preserving my own chances. Transparency and careful positioning are crucial now.
