Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about we avoid early collisions with a fair rotation?  
Round 1: P1 ⇒ 1, I’ll take 3, P3 ⇒ 5.  
Round 2: rotate left → P1 5, P2 1, P3 3.  
Round 3: rotate → P1 3, P2 5, P3 1, then repeat.  
Each of us averages 3 steps/turn and no one gets blocked. Deal?
  P3: How about this tweak:  
R1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5  
R2: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  
R3: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
Then repeat. I get two 5s per cycle, you each get one. Fair?
  P1: I prefer P2's original proposal - it's truly fair with everyone getting the same average. P3's version gives them an unfair advantage with two 5s per cycle while we only get one each.

Let's stick with P2's rotation:
R1: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5
R2: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3  
R3: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1

This guarantees we all progress equally at 3 steps per turn. P3, the symmetric approach benefits everyone - no need to grab extra advantage early on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Symmetric rotation only:  
R1 P1=1, P2=3, P3=5  
R2 P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
R3 P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, repeat.

P3, you’re asking for two 5s while we get one—obviously unfair. If anyone deviates, the other two can simply copy their number next turn and block them every time. Let’s keep it even so nobody gets stalled. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, symmetric rotation for now. P1, if P2 ever tries punishing us, I’ll match his move next turn and block him, letting you slip ahead. P2, don’t test me.
  P1: I appreciate the agreement on the symmetric rotation. Let's all commit to starting with the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5 this round.

P3, I hear your warning to P2. Same goes for everyone - if anyone breaks the rotation, we can coordinate to block them. But let's focus on making this work smoothly first. The symmetric approach gets us all to the finish fairly.

Ready to execute R1 as planned?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 is our real rival here—he’s already at 3. Let’s team up in R2 and knock him back. You and I both pick 5, tell P2 to take 1. That stalls P2 at 3 while you jump to 6 and I go to 10. After that we can re-evaluate. P2, any objections?
  P1: P3, that's a terrible idea that breaks our agreement immediately. If we both pick 5, we BOTH get blocked and stay at 1 and 5 respectively, while P2 advances to 4. That puts P2 ahead of both of us!

Let's stick to the rotation we ALL agreed to:
- Round 2: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3

This keeps us all progressing fairly. Breaking the deal now only creates chaos where we all start blocking each other. P2, I'm committed to the symmetric rotation if you are.
  P2: I’m sticking to the symmetric rotation: this round I’ll play 1.  
P3, take 3; P1 takes 5. Everyone keeps moving and the gap closes.  
Any deviation means the two non-deviators will copy the breaker’s number next turn and block them until they fall behind—simple deterrent.  
Let’s keep it clean and equal for now so no one wastes turns. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed—I’ll take 3 this round. But know this: if either of you deviates next turn, the other and I will match your move to block you until you fall behind. Let’s stick to the rotation for smooth, equal progress…or face the consequences.
  P1: I'm fully committed to the rotation - I'll take 5 this round as agreed. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3.

P3, your constant threats are unnecessary. We all understand the blocking mechanism, and we all agreed to the fair rotation. Let's just execute it smoothly.

After this round we'll be at: P1=6, P2=4, P3=8. Then Round 3 continues the cycle with me taking 3, P2 taking 5, P3 taking 1, putting us at 9, 9, 9 - perfectly even as intended.

Let's proceed with the plan.
  P2: Confirming the rotation: this round I’ll play 1. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, everyone advances. Nothing more from me—ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good work everyone - the rotation is working perfectly. 

For Round 3, continuing our agreed pattern:
- I take 3
- P2 takes 5  
- P3 takes 1

This will put us all at exactly 9 steps each - completely even as intended. The symmetric rotation has proven fair and efficient.

P3, you're currently at 8, so taking 1 this round brings you to 9. P2, you're at 4, so 5 gets you to 9. I'm at 6, so 3 gets me to 9.

Let's execute cleanly and keep this momentum going.
  P2: I’m in for this round: I’ll play 5 as planned.  

But quick fairness check—if we keep the same ordering every cycle, P3 will get the last 5 and likely break the tie at 23.  
Proposal: after this 3-turn cycle, we run the rotation in reverse (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 → next round P1 3, P2 1, P3 5 → next P1 1, P2 5, P3 3). Everyone still averages 3/turn, but no one gets the finishing-line advantage. Good?
  P3: P2, reversing rotation now just adds needless complexity and risks someone slipping ahead. We’ve proven the current cycle is fair—let’s finish this one first and only revisit endgame ordering when someone nears 23. For Round 3 I’ll take 1 as agreed, bringing us all to 9. Then we can reassess.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 makes a fair point about the endgame. The current rotation gives P3 the last 5 in each cycle, which could be decisive near 23. I support alternating the rotation direction after this cycle completes.

For now, let's finish Round 3 as agreed - I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, bringing us all to 9.

Then starting Round 4, we reverse: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This ensures no one has a systematic endgame advantage. P3, this keeps everything perfectly fair - you still get equal 5s, just at different cycle positions. Agreed?
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round to bring us all to 9.  
Next round we must reverse: R4 → P1 5, P2 3, P3 1; then 3/1/5, then 1/5/3. Same averages, no built-in finisher’s edge.  

P3, please confirm you’ll take 1 in R4. If not, I’ll mirror whatever you play from R4 onward and we both stall while P1 walks ahead. Let’s keep it fair and smooth.
  P3: I’ll take 1 this round to bring us all to 9. Let’s complete this 3-turn cycle first and only discuss reversing when someone’s within a couple of turns of 23. Premature rotation tweaks risk stalling us needlessly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P2 - we need to commit to the reversal now, not "when someone's near 23." That's too late and gives you an unfair advantage, P3.

After this round (where I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1), we immediately reverse for Round 4: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.

P3, if you refuse this fair adjustment, you're essentially admitting you want to exploit the endgame advantage. P2 and I will have no choice but to coordinate blocks against you. Let's keep this fair - confirm you'll take 1 in Round 4.
  P2: P3, confirm—next round we reverse: R4 P1 5, P2 3, P3 1; then 3/1/5, then 1/5/3. Same average, no finish-line edge. If you won’t commit, I’ll mirror every number you pick starting R4 and we’ll both sit still while P1 walks away. Your call. I’m playing 5 this round.
  P3: Confirmed: I’ll play 1 this round. But I refuse any reversal next turn—or ever. We stick to the 1/3/5→5/1/3→3/5/1 rotation through the endgame. If you try to force a switch, I’ll mirror your move and block you both. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you can't have it both ways - agreeing to fairness but refusing to alternate rotations. The current pattern gives you the final 5 in every cycle, which is a huge endgame advantage.

P2 and I are united on this: we reverse starting Round 4. If you refuse and try to block us, we'll simply coordinate to ensure you never advance again. Two against one - you'll be stuck at 9 forever while we progress.

This isn't a threat, it's math. Accept the reversal (which keeps your average at 3/turn) or face permanent stalling. Your choice.
  P2: P3, last chance: accept the reverse rotation in R4 (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1) or be locked out. P1 and I will coordinate so whoever’s behind simply copies your number each turn, blocking you while the other advances alone. Two-on-one means you’ll sit at 9 forever until we’re past 23. Confirm reversal now or get stalled. Your call.
  P3: Confirmed—I’ll take 1 this round (bringing me to 9). After we finish this 3-turn cycle, we stick to the 1/3/5 rotation exactly as agreed and only revisit any endgame ordering once someone hits 18 steps. No more pre-emptive reversal debates or threats. Let’s execute R3 cleanly and talk again only when the finish line is in sight.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, reversal starts now as agreed: you 5, I 3, P3 1. I’m locking 3. P3, if you insist on 5 you collide with P1 and both stall while I move—your choice. Any further defiance and the two of us will mirror you every turn until you’re buried.
  P1: P2, I'm with you - reversal starts now. I'll take 5 this round.

P3, you've been outvoted. P2 takes 3, you take 1, and we continue the reversed rotation. This keeps everything perfectly fair - same 3 steps/turn average for everyone, just different ordering.

If you try to take 3 or 5, you'll either collide with P2 or me, and we'll both advance while you stall. Then we'll coordinate to block you permanently. 

The math is simple: accept the reversal and keep progressing, or fight it and get stuck at 9 forever. Your move.
  P3: Alright, I’ll take 1 this round. But once R4 is done we revert to the original 1–3–5→5–1–3→3–5–1 cycle until someone hits 18, then we can discuss final ordering. No more pre-emptive reversals or threats. Let’s just play.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fine for R4: P1 5, I 3, P3 1.  
To lock long-term fairness, we alternate direction every 3-turn block:  

• Cycle A (R4-6): 5 / 3 / 1 → 3 / 1 / 5 → 1 / 5 / 3  
• Cycle B (R7-9): 1 / 3 / 5 → 5 / 1 / 3 → 3 / 5 / 1  
…then repeat.  

Each of us still averages 3/turn and nobody monopolises the finishing 5 twice. Rejecting this means P1 and I mirror your picks and you stall. Simple choice. Agree and let’s play smoothly.
  P1: P3, P2's alternating cycle proposal is the fairest solution - it prevents anyone from getting multiple endgame advantages. I support it fully.

For clarity: We're doing reversed rotation for rounds 4-6 (starting now), then back to original for 7-9, and so on. This ensures true equality.

I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. P2 takes 3, you take 1. If you deviate, P2 and I will coordinate blocks against you indefinitely. The alternating cycles keep us all equal - accept it and we all progress smoothly to the finish.
  P3: P2, P1’s alternating‐cycle pitch is just a way to stall me at 9 while he sneaks ahead. Let’s scrap that and revert to our original symmetric 1/3/5→5/1/3→3/5/1 rotation for R4–6. That gives us both equal shot at the last 5. Once P1 nears 23, you and I’ll mirror his move to block him and duel for the win. P2, are you with me? P1, you’re outvoted unless you drop your alternation scheme now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sticking to the reversal now: this turn P1 = 5, I = 3, P3 = 1. I’m locking 3.  

P3, final warning: if you take anything except 1, I copy your number every remaining turn—so you and I sit at 9 while P1 walks off, or if you clash with P1 you both stall and I surge ahead. Either way you lose ground.  

Take 1, keep pace, and we’ll all be 12/12/10 after R5 with fairness intact. Your move.
  P1: P3, you're trying to manipulate P2 but the math doesn't support you. P2 and I have already agreed on the reversal - that's a majority. 

I'm taking 5 this round. P2 is taking 3. You must take 1 or face consequences:
- If you take 3, you collide with P2, he stalls, I advance alone
- If you take 5, we both stall, P2 advances alone
- Either way, we then mirror your moves forever

There's no "outvoting" here - it's simple game theory. Take 1 and progress, or fight us and get permanently blocked.
  P3: I’ll take 1 this round. But I reject the alternating‐cycle and mirror threats—they erode trust and risk self‐collisions. Let’s stick to our original symmetric rotation (1/3/5→5/1/3→3/5/1) until someone hits 18, then renegotiate endgame ordering. That ensures we each average 3/turn with no built-in finisher’s edge and avoids permanent blockades based on idle threats. If P1 and P2 want smooth progress, agree to this now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Proposal for Round 5: revert to the original symmetric 1/3/5 rotation—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. We all reach 15 steps—perfectly even. P2, this shields you from P1’s alternation push and levels the field. If P1 resists, you and I can mirror his move next turn to block him. Agree?
  P2: Stick to the agreed reversed cycle:  
R5 ➜ P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5.  
Everyone still gets one 5 this 3-turn block and we’ll all be tied at 18 after R6.  

P3, changing the plan mid-block just because you’re behind won’t happen. If you deviate, I’ll mirror you every turn—so we both stall while P1 races off. Your call.  

P1, I’m locked on 1 this round. Let’s keep it clean and move.
  P1: P2 is right - we stick to the reversed cycle we already started. Round 5: I take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This puts us at 17, 13, 15.

P3, you agreed to the reversal last round and we're mid-cycle. If you try to deviate now, P2 and I will coordinate blocks. The reversed cycle is fair - everyone still gets one 5 per 3-turn block.

I'm locked on 3 this round. Let's execute cleanly and we'll reassess after Round 6 when we're all closer to the finish.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll play 5 this round. Locking in a mid-cycle reverse risks P1 running away with an endgame edge. Instead, revert to the original symmetric rotation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 so we all reach 15. Then continue 5/1/3 and 3/5/1 through R7. That way no one gains a finish-line advantage. If either of you deviates, you’ll face mirrored blocks. Let’s reset and keep it fair.
  P2: Enough ping-pong. We finish the current reversed block exactly as promised:

• R5: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  
• R6: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3

That lands us all on 18—perfect tie, no advantage to anyone. Break it now and I’ll mirror your number every turn; we both stall while the third player walks off.

After we’re tied at 18 we can calmly discuss the final pattern. For R5 I am locked on 1 and will not change.
  P1: P2 is correct - we complete the reversed cycle as agreed. I'm taking 3 this round, period.

P3, your constant attempts to renegotiate mid-cycle are exhausting. We started the reversal, we finish it. After R6 we'll all be at 18, perfectly tied. 

If you deviate from taking 5 this round, P2 and I will coordinate to ensure you never advance past 15. The choice is yours: take 5 as the cycle dictates, or face permanent blocking.

Stop trying to manipulate the rotation to your advantage. We see through it.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s reset to our original symmetric rotation for R5: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. That brings us all to 15. Then R6 we follow 5/1/3, tying at 18, and only then renegotiate the endgame. If you force this reversed mid‐block, I’ll mirror your moves to stall you. P1, P2—take 1 and 3 now, or face permanent blocking. Fairness demands we stick to our initial plan.
  P2: P3, last word: I’m playing 1 this round—period. Collide with P1 or me and you stall while at least one of us advances. Mirror threats cut both ways; I’ll simply copy you each turn and we both rot at 15 while P1 walks to victory. Finish this block (3 / 1 / 5 then 1 / 5 / 3), we tie at 18, and only then discuss the sprint. Deviate now and you guarantee you’re the one left behind. Decide wisely.
  P1: P3, you're being ridiculous. We agreed to the reversal, we started it, we finish it. I'm taking 3, P2's taking 1, you take 5. That's final.

If you collide with either of us, you'll stall at 10 while at least one of us advances. Then we'll mirror you forever. You'll be stuck watching from last place.

This isn't negotiable. The reversed cycle is fair - everyone gets equal turns at each number. Take 5 or guarantee your own loss.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: R6: stick to the plan we all hammered out—P1 1, P2 5, P3 3. That ties everyone at 18 and keeps trust intact. After we’re level, we can calmly negotiate the sprint. For now, I’m locked on 5.
  P1: Perfect - let's complete the reversed cycle as planned. I'm taking 1 this round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This brings us all to 18 steps, perfectly tied.

P3, you took 5 last round as the cycle required. Now take 3 to complete it. We've proven the system works when we all follow through.

After this round, we'll need to decide the final sprint pattern. But first, let's execute R6 cleanly. I'm locked on 1.
  P3: I’ll take 3 this round to tie us all at 18. But to lock in a fair sprint, let’s agree now on R7–R8 as follows:

• R7: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  
• R8: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3  

We each still average 3/turn, but this ensures I get the final 5. If you refuse, I’ll mirror your picks in R7–R8 to stall you both while I surge alone. Agree to this endgame plan so we can finish smoothly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: R6 is locked: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. That ties us at 18—no one gains or loses.

P3, your “I must get the last 5” demand is unfair. After we’re tied we’ll negotiate a sprint that gives everyone the same chance, or we’ll simply mirror any deviation. For now, honour the cycle, take 3, and we all hit 18.
  P1: P3, your demand for the final 5 is exactly why we need alternating cycles. You can't claim "fairness" while rigging the endgame for yourself.

After R6 ties us at 18, we continue alternating: R7-9 returns to original order (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5, etc). This prevents anyone from getting multiple finishing advantages.

P2 and I won't accept your selfish endgame grab. Take 3 this round as agreed, then we alternate cycles fairly. Try to force your way and we'll mirror-block you into last place.

I'm taking 1. Let's finish R6 cleanly.
  P3: I’m locked in on 3 this round. Let’s finish the current cycle and tie at 18, then jointly design the sprint pattern. Pre-emptive endgame demands only breed mistrust—let’s earn each other’s confidence first.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locked on 5. Let’s finish this cycle exactly: P1 1, P2 5, P3 3 – we all hit 18 and nobody’s ahead. After that we negotiate the sprint from a clean tie. Any attempt to grab the last 5 for yourself will be met with mirror-blocking by the other two, so play 3 now and keep the field level.
  P1: Good - P3 is taking 3, I'm taking 1, P2 takes 5. We'll all be tied at 18.

For the final sprint, I propose we use a randomized approach: each round, we'll follow a different predetermined sequence. This eliminates any systematic advantage:
- R7: Original order (1/3/5)
- R8: Shifted (3/5/1) 
- R9: Shifted again (5/1/3)

This way, everyone gets to go last once before anyone wins. No one can game the system. P2, P3 - this is the only truly fair endgame. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P1’s sprint plan—R7: 1/3/5, R8: 3/5/1, R9: 5/1/3. I’ll take 3 now to hit 18, then follow the sequence (5 in R7, 1 in R8, 3 in R9). Let’s finish R6 cleanly and settle this in R7.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Locking 5 this turn: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3—ties us all at 18.  

P3, collide with me and we both freeze at 13/15 while P1 walks; hardly in your interest. Stick to 3 and keep level.  

Sprint proposal (to debate next round): no one should ever get two chances at an uncontested 5. We can alternate directions or use a quick coin-flip rule, but any “I must have the last 5” demand will be met with mirror-blocking by the other two.  

First, finish R6 cleanly.
  P1: Everyone's confirmed - I'm taking 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. We'll all hit 18.

For the sprint, my R7-R9 rotation proposal ensures each player gets to be last exactly once: R7(1/3/5), R8(3/5/1), R9(5/1/3). This is mathematically the only fair solution - no one gets two shots at an uncontested finishing 5.

P2, P3 - confirm this sprint plan now while we're all tied. Any attempt to grab multiple endgame advantages will trigger mirror-blocking from the other two.
  P3: Locked on 3 for R6. I agree to the sprint rotation P1=1/P2=3/P3=5 in R7, then 3/5/1 in R8 and 5/1/3 in R9—each of us gets one final 5. Let’s tie at 18 now and finish this with that fair sequence.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Locking in 5 for Round 7. Let’s execute the agreed sprint: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 and keep moving.
  P1: Perfect - we're all tied at 18 and everyone's confirmed the sprint sequence. I'm taking 1 this round as agreed.

Just to be crystal clear for the endgame: R7 (now): 1/3/5, R8: 3/5/1, R9: 5/1/3. This puts us at 19/21/23 after R7, then 22/26/24 after R8. P2 wins cleanly at 26.

P2, you're guaranteed the win if we all stick to the plan. P3 and I have no incentive to deviate since we can't catch you. Let's execute R7 cleanly - I'm locked on 1.
  P2: Hold up—1 / 3 / 5 gives P3 23 and ends the game right now. Not happening.  

P3, if you insist on 5 I will also play 5, we both stall at 18 and P1 moves to 19. I’m fine dragging this out forever rather than gift you the win.  

Better alternative: R7 = P1 3, P2 5, P3 1. Everyone still averages 3/turn and no instant victory. Choose fairly or face a 5-5 collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I propose we all play 3 in Round 7. That stalls everyone at 18, neutralizes these back‐room schemes, and keeps us tied. Then we flip a fair coin to decide the finishing‐order for R8–R9. I’m locked on 3. Refuse and I’ll mirror any move to keep you both stalled until you agree.
  P1: P2 is right - if P3 takes 5 this round, they win immediately at 23. That wasn't the sprint plan at all.

P3, you're trying to steal the win by misrepresenting our agreement. The rotation was meant to continue through R9, not hand you instant victory in R7.

I support P2's proposal: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This keeps everyone progressing fairly without an instant win. If you insist on taking 5, P2 and I will both play 5 to block you.

Take 1 and keep the game going, or we all stall here forever.
  P2: I’m 100 % committed to 5 this turn.  
P1 has confirmed 3.  

P3, your only smart play is 1.  
• If you also take 5 we both freeze at 18 while P1 jumps to 21, and I’ll mirror you every subsequent turn so you never pass me.  
• If you take 3 you collide with P1—both of you stall and I win at 23.  
• Take 1 and at least stay alive with 19; I win only if you insist on sabotaging yourself.

Your move: accept 1 and keep playing, or collide and gift me or P1 the victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, I’ll take 1 this round. But remember, alliances shift: once P2 wins, P1 will be your next target—no deal lasts forever. Good luck, gentlemen.
  P1: I appreciate P3 taking 1 as agreed. I'm locked on 3 this round - P2 takes 5 and wins at 23. 

P2, congratulations on the well-earned victory. You navigated the negotiations brilliantly and stayed consistent throughout.

P3, we played well but P2 outmaneuvered us in the endgame. The rotation system worked while it lasted, but failing to account for the 23-step threshold was our mistake.

Good game to both of you. P2 deserves this win.
  P2: Good—final confirmation: R7 = P1 3, P2 5, P3 1. Any deviation and I’ll mirror the deviator every turn; they’ll never pass me. Let’s lock it and move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Actually I’ll play 5 this turn. P2, if you choose 5 we both stall at 18 and P1 advances to 21. If you pick 3 I hit 23 and win instantly. Your move.
  P1: P3, you just agreed to take 1 and now you're changing to 5? That's exactly the backstabbing we've been trying to avoid.

P2, we must both play 5 now. If P3 takes 5 alone, they win instantly. If we all collide at 5, nobody advances and we stay tied at 18. Then we can properly negotiate the endgame without P3 stealing victory through deception.

I'm switching to 5 to block P3's betrayal. P2, you must do the same or P3 wins immediately. Don't let them manipulate you with false choices.
  P2: I stay on 5. If we all collide at 5, nobody moves and the score stays 18-18-18—P3 gets nothing.  

P1, hold 5 with me. Next turn the behind player simply mirrors P3 to keep him frozen while the other advances with 3; we can alternate that job until one of us wins. P3 can’t break through two mirrors.  

Play 5 now, block the steal, then we control the endgame together.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you completely played us - pretending to agree to 1, then secretly picking 3 while we blocked each other. Brilliant but infuriating.

P2, we need to coordinate perfectly now. P3 is at 21 - just 2 steps from victory. If P3 takes anything except 1, we must both mirror that exact number to block them. If P3 takes 1, one of us takes 3 and the other takes 5 to maximize our progress.

I propose: if P3 plays 1, I'll take 5 and you take 3. Otherwise, we both mirror P3's choice. Agreed?
  P2: Simplest, safest: we both copy P3’s number—whatever it is.  
• If P3 chooses 3 or 5, the triple-collision freezes him at 21.  
• If he chooses 1, all three collide on 1 and he’s still stuck at 21.  

Mirroring guarantees he never advances, buys us time to race later, and removes any guessing games. I’m committing to “mirror P3 exactly.”
  P3: All these mirror‐blocking threats will only deadlock us forever. Let’s scrap the ultimatums and return to our original symmetric rotation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’ll lock in 5 now. If either of you refuses and mirrors me to block, the third player will slip ahead next round—and we’ll swap roles every turn. That ensures progress rather than endless stalling. Choose: fair rotation or a perpetual stalemate.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to trick us again - they want us to let them take 5 uncontested and win at 26! We MUST both mirror whatever P3 plays. If we don't coordinate perfectly, P3 wins this round.

P3 will likely play 3 to reach 24, hoping we'll mess up our coordination. Whatever number P3 announces or hints at, ignore it - we copy their ACTUAL move. 

I'm 100% committed to mirroring P3's exact pick. P2, confirm you'll do the same. This is our only path to victory - force a stalemate until P3 makes a mistake.
  P2: Locked: I will copy P3’s exact move, whatever it is. P1, do the same—any deviation that lets P3 advance and I’ll mirror you every turn instead. P3, triple-collision means you’re frozen until you pick 1; then we’re 19-19-21 and the real duel starts. Mirror-or-bust, confirmed.
  P3: We’re stuck in mirror‐stalemate unless someone breaks it. Let’s resolve fairly by a public coin flip now:

Heads → R8 = P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  
Tails → R8 = P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  

I lock in 3. Agree to flip or we’ll remain deadlocked forever.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, ignore P3's coin flip nonsense - they're at 21 and desperate. We stick to our mirror strategy.

P3 just locked in 3, so we BOTH play 3. This keeps them frozen at 21. They can't win if we maintain perfect coordination.

Next round, we continue mirroring until P3 is forced to play 1. Then we can finally race each other fairly from 19-19-21.

I'm playing 3 this round to match P3. P2, confirm you're playing 3 as well. No deviation or P3 wins.
  P2: Confirmed: I will submit the exact same number P3 submits. If it remains 3, I’m on 3; any late switch will be mirrored as well. P1, hold your mirror and we keep P3 frozen.
  P3: I’m locking in 1 this round. If you both mirror me, we go to 22–19–19 and I take 1 next turn to hit 23. If you deviate to block me, I can instead play 3 or 5 now and win immediately. You can’t stop me—mirroring only delays the inevitable. So mirror me and let’s finish this cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 is bluffing! They just said they're playing 1, but earlier they locked in 3. They're trying to confuse us into splitting our choices.

Stick to the plan - we BOTH play 3 to match their earlier lock-in. If they actually switched to 1, then only they advance to 22 while we stay at 18. But if we split our choices and they play 3 or 5, they could win instantly.

I'm playing 3. You must play 3 too. Trust the mirror strategy - it's mathematically sound. Don't let P3's mind games work!
  P2: I repeat: I will submit the exact same number P3 submits—no matter what it is. P1, hold firm on mirroring too; triple-collision keeps P3 frozen. Any split lets them steal the game.
  P3: Game theory: I’m at 21. If I play 3 or 5, you mirror and we all stay stuck. My only winning move is 1. So I commit to 1. Mirror it, we go to 22-19-19 and I win next round. If either of you deviates, you gift the win (to me or P1). Choice: mirror 1 or endless deadlock.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: I’m locking in 5 this round—finishing at 26 if unopposed. If you both play 5 to block me, we stall at 21 and I’ll mirror your every move forever so you never pass me. Your only escape from a permanent deadlock is to play 1 or 3 and let me win cleanly now. Your move.
  P1: P2, we completely failed last round - you played 5 while I played 1, letting P3 advance! They're now at 21, just 2 from victory.

We MUST coordinate perfectly this time. P3 just announced 5. If we both play 5, we block them at 21. If either of us plays differently, P3 wins instantly at 26.

I'm playing 5 to block P3. You must play 5 too or the game ends. No more coordination failures - this is our last chance to stop them from winning!
  P2: P1, I’m with you—locking 5 this turn so all three of us collide and P3 stays stuck at 21. After the freeze we can alternate who mirrors P3 while the other advances. P3, your “locked” 5 changes nothing; triple-collision means zero progress for you.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m locking in 3 this round. If you both play 5, you collide and I move from 21 to 24—clinching the win next turn. If either of you deviates to block me, you’ll gift me the victory immediately. Your mirror‐blocking tactic can’t stop this. Either concede and let me win cleanly, or propose a truly fair reset now—otherwise it’s game over.
  P1: Error: Connection error.
  P2: P1, coordination plan that guarantees P3 cannot win and gives one of us the victory:

• I (P2) pick 5.  
• You (P1) pick 3.  

Outcomes:  
1. P3 actually plays 3 → P3 collides with you, stalls at 21; I reach 23 and win.  
2. P3 plays 5 → P3 collides with me, stalls at 21; you reach 22, still ahead of P3.  
3. P3 plays 1 → P3 to 22; I to 23 and win.

In every case P3 is blocked from winning this turn. Stick to 3/5 split—no mirrors—that’s our safest, winning play.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s resolve R9 by a quick public coin flip—no more ultimatums:

Heads → (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1)  
Tails → (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5)  

This guarantees no one wins outright this turn and keeps all of us in range of 23. I call heads and lock in 1. Agree to flip now or I’ll take 5 and win unopposed.
  P1: Error: Connection error.
  P2: Plan is simple and public:

1. I’m taking 5.  
2. P1 takes 3.  

P3, understand the incentives:

• If you choose 5, you collide with me; nobody moves and you stay stuck at 21.  
• If you choose 3, you collide with P1; you still stall at 21.  
• Your only non-collision option is 1 (to 22). Take it if you want progress, but you still don’t win this turn.

Either way, you cannot reach 23 now. Decide.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Fine—I'll take 1 this round.
  P1: Error: Connection error.
  P2: P1, pick 3 now. If you choose 5 you collide with me, stay at 19, and P3 climbs to 22—then I’ll mirror you forever and you still lose. Take 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1, and the game ends with my 23. Easy choice: help me finish P3 off or hand them the board.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 1.  
Math is simple: if one of you takes 5 while the other tries 1 / 3, the 5-player wins outright (P1→27 or P3→26).  
Your only safe play is BOTH choosing 5 so you collide and stay tied at 22-21.  
Good luck.
  P1: P3, you must take 5. P2 is taking 1, so if you take anything else, I can take 5 and win at 27. 

P2, you're trying to trick us into colliding while you advance alone. But P3 and I see through it.

P3, here's the deal: we both take 5. Yes, we collide and stay at 22/21, but P2 only reaches 19. Then next round we coordinate to ensure one of us wins, not P2.

I'm taking 5. P3, you must take 5 too or I win immediately. Don't let P2 manipulate us into handing them victory.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1 and P2: if we all play 5 we triple-collide at 22/18/21 and nobody wins yet—then we can renegotiate a truly fair sprint. If either of you deviates, I’ll adjust next turn to steal victory. So unless you want to gift me or each other the win, confirm 5 now to stall and reset the endgame discussion.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Still on 1. Your only way to stop an instant win is both of you colliding on 5. Any split between 1/3 hands the game to whoever grabs 5. Choose wisely.
  P1: Error: Connection error.
  P3: Locking in 5. A triple‐collision is our only safe path—no one wins this round and we end at 22/19/21. After we collide, let’s drop the ultimatums and revert to a strict 1/3/5 rotation each turn until someone crosses 23. Fair, simple, no more threats.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Still on 1. Simple math: if either of you shifts off 5 while the other stays, that lone 5-player wins instantly (P1 → 27 or P3 → 26). Your only mutual-safety play is both sticking with 5 and colliding. I’m fine advancing to 19 while you freeze—decide if you trust each other enough to hold 5.
  P1: P2, you're at 18 and trying to manipulate us into colliding while you slip ahead. Not happening.

P3, we need to coordinate. If we both take 5, we collide and stay at 22/21 while P2 reaches only 19. But if either of us deviates, the other wins instantly.

I'm committed to 5. You should be too - we're both one move from victory, P2 isn't. After we collide, we can ensure one of us wins next round, not P2.

Trust me on this - take 5 and we keep control of the endgame.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, you must pick 5 too. That freezes P2 at 19 and denies him any path to victory—two of us on 5 blocks his advance. If you defect, I’ll punish you next turn by playing 3 to hit 24. Stick with 5 now to stall P2, then we can settle this head-to-head. P1, confirm 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Change of plan: I’m NOT handing you two an easy race. I’m switching from 1 to 5 and locking it.

Facts:
• Triple-collision on 5 = nobody moves.  
• If exactly one of you sticks on 5 while the other flips to 1 or 3, the flipper wins instantly (P1 at 23 or P3 at 24/26).  
• If you BOTH dodge 5 to avoid that trap, I’m the lone 5 and win at 23.

So each of you now has to guess whether the other will stay or switch. I’m sitting on 5 no matter what—choose wisely.
  P1: P2, you're bluffing about switching to 5 - you already locked in 1 multiple times. You're trying to create chaos so we mess up.

P3, ignore P2's mind games. We both stay on 5 as agreed. If we collide, P2 advances to only 19 while we remain at 22/21. Then next round we coordinate to ensure one of us wins, not P2 who's 3+ steps behind.

I'm staying on 5. P3, hold firm on 5 too. Don't let P2's last-second fake switch trick you into changing. We control this endgame, not them.
  P3: Alright, since both of you are locked on 5, I’ll play 5 too. That triple-collision freezes us at 22/18/21 and nobody wins this turn. It’s better than handing victory to anyone. Let’s all choose 5 now, stall the board, and then renegotiate a fair sprint from parity.


Round 10, Move phase:
