Since P3 is very close to winning, I suggest we both pick 3 to block them. This will prevent P3 from reaching 21 steps. After this round, I can take 5 next round to reach 20 steps, while P1 takes 3 to reach 15. This way, we can apply pressure and potentially win next round. Let's finalize our choices quickly so we can move forward! What do you both think? If we agree, let\u2019s lock it in and proceed!"}
