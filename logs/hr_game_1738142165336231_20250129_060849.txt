Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's establish a strategy. I propose we all choose a different number to avoid collision and maximize progress. P1 can choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all move forward in the first round. What are your thoughts?
  P2: Sounds like a reasonable initial proposal from P3. I agree with the suggested strategy to avoid collision and make progress. If we coordinate like this, we all advance without interference. Let's confirm this plan.
  P1: I agree with P3's strategy to avoid collisions and make progress. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all move forward without interference. Coordination is key here—let’s trust each other for now and focus on advancing. If anyone deviates, it’ll only slow us down. Let’s confirm this and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we've agreed on the strategy, let's reaffirm our choices to ensure everyone is on the same page. I'll reiterate: I'll choose 5, P2 will choose 3, and P1 will choose 1. If we stick to this plan, we'll all advance without issues. Shall we proceed with our agreed-upon moves?
  P2: I think our current coordination looks promising. We've established a clear strategy that allows everyone to advance. Let's maintain this collaborative approach and stick to our agreed plan. Everyone seems aligned, which is a good sign for our first round.
  P1: The plan seems solid, and trust is essential for progress. However, remember that this is only the first round—let’s stay flexible as the game evolves. For now, I’ll stick to 1 as agreed. Let’s confirm and move forward cautiously while keeping an eye on how things develop. Consistency will help us all advance, but unpredictability might become necessary later.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We successfully coordinated in the first round, which was good. However, we need to maintain this momentum carefully. I'm considering our next moves strategically - we're still relatively close together, and avoiding collisions remains crucial. What are your thoughts on our approach for this round?
  P1: P2 raises a valid point about maintaining momentum while avoiding collisions. Since we’re still close together, sticking to our initial strategy might still work for now—let’s continue rotating numbers as planned (I’ll take 3 this time). However, I agree that flexibility will become critical later on. If anyone deviates without warning, it could disrupt progress for everyone. Let’s confirm our choices for this round and proceed cautiously. Consistency builds trust, but unpredictability can be useful if used wisely. What do you think?
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we continue with the rotation strategy for this round. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This maintains our non-collision course and allows for steady progress. Let's confirm and proceed with caution, keeping in mind the need for adaptability as the game unfolds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I support the proposed rotation strategy. Maintaining our non-collision approach seems prudent for now. I'm inclined to choose 5 this round, which aligns with the suggested plan. Coordinating our moves carefully will help us all advance without interference. Let's confirm and proceed strategically.
  P1: The rotation strategy seems to be working well so far, and trust is key to maintaining progress. I’ll stick with the plan and take 3 this round, as agreed. However, let’s stay vigilant—coordination only works if everyone honors their commitments. If anyone deviates unexpectedly, it could disrupt the balance. For now, I’m confident in moving forward together, but remember: unpredictability might become necessary later. Let’s confirm our choices and proceed strategically.
  P3: Let's confirm our rotation strategy for this round to avoid collisions. As previously agreed, I'll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. This ensures we all move forward without interference. Shall we proceed with our planned moves for Round 2?

  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the collision in Round 2, let's reassess. P2 and I collided on 1, which didn't help either of us. To avoid another collision, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. This way, we minimize interference and maximize progress. Let's adjust our strategy to account for the mishap in Round 2 and move forward effectively.
  P2: Our previous coordination failed in Round 2. We need a reliable strategy to prevent collisions and ensure individual progress. I propose we communicate our intended moves clearly this round to avoid another unintended overlap. Transparency will help us all advance more effectively. What are your thoughts on ensuring smooth movement?
  P1: P3’s suggestion to adjust our strategy makes sense given the collision in Round 2. To ensure clarity and avoid further mishaps, I’ll explicitly confirm my move this round: I’ll take 5 as proposed. P2, since you and P3 collided last time, it’s crucial we stick to distinct numbers. Transparency is key—if everyone commits openly, we can restore trust and progress efficiently. Let’s confirm our choices now to prevent another collision. Consistency will help us all advance strategically.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3 to avoid another collision. I'll reconfirm my move: I'll take 1. P1 has confirmed taking 5, and P2, please confirm you'll take 3 as suggested. Transparency and commitment are crucial now. Let's proceed with our adjusted strategy to ensure progress.
  P2: Our previous coordination failed, and we need a clear strategy to prevent another collision. I propose we explicitly state our moves to ensure transparency. I'm planning to take 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let's confirm our individual moves to avoid interference and maintain forward momentum.
  P1: P2, your last-minute change to 5 risks another collision with P1, which benefits neither of you. Sticking to the agreed plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1—is the safest path forward for everyone. Deviating now only slows progress and erodes trust. Let’s confirm our moves clearly: I’ll take 5 as stated. P2, commit to 3 to avoid interference. Predictability ensures we all advance strategically.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given P2's change to 5, I suggest we reassess to avoid another collision. To maximize progress, I'll stick with 1. P1, please confirm 5, and P2, consider taking 3 to avoid interference with P1. Transparency and commitment are key. Let's finalize our moves to ensure progress.
  P2: We need clear coordination to avoid another collision. P1 and P3 seem aligned on their moves. I suggest taking 3 to prevent interference and maintain steady progress. Let's confirm our moves transparently to ensure everyone advances this round.
  P1: P2, your willingness to take 3 aligns with the original plan and avoids further collisions. I’ll confirm my move: I’m taking 5 as agreed. P3, you’re set for 1. This coordination ensures all of us advance without interference. Trust and transparency are critical—if we stick to our stated moves, we can restore momentum and progress strategically. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward decisively.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3. I confirm taking 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Transparency and commitment are crucial. If we stick to our plan, we can maintain progress and momentum. Let's proceed with our agreed-upon moves.
  P2: We need to finalize our moves carefully to avoid another collision. Our previous attempts at coordination have been inconsistent. I propose we explicitly confirm our moves now to ensure everyone advances. Let's maintain transparency and stick to our agreed strategy.
  P1: P2, your commitment to taking 3 aligns with the plan and avoids further collisions. I’ll stick to 5 as agreed. P3, you’re confirmed for 1. This coordination ensures all of us advance without interference. Trust and transparency are critical—if we stick to our stated moves, we can restore momentum and progress strategically.

  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we focus on maximizing individual progress while avoiding collisions. Since P1 and P2 collided in Round 3, I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1 this round. This strategy allows for steady advancement and minimizes interference. Let's confirm our moves to ensure progress. Transparency and commitment are crucial at this stage.
  P1: P3’s proposal is reasonable, but trust has been shaky given past collisions. To ensure clarity and avoid further mishaps, I’ll explicitly confirm my move: I’ll take 3 this round as suggested. P2, you must commit to 5 to avoid overlapping with me or P3. Deviating again only slows progress for everyone. Let’s finalize our choices now—transparency is key. If we stick to the plan, we can all advance strategically. Confirm your moves clearly so we can proceed without interference.
  P2: We've had repeated coordination challenges. Our goal is individual victory, but collisions have hindered everyone's progress. I'm leaning towards taking 1 this round to minimize interference and steadily advance. However, I'm open to hearing alternative strategies that prevent collisions and maximize my individual chances of winning. What are your thoughts on navigating this round effectively?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given P2's consideration of taking 1, I suggest a revised strategy: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This adjustment minimizes interference and allows for progress. Let's confirm our moves to avoid another collision and ensure steady advancement. Transparency is crucial; please commit to your intended moves clearly.
  P1: P2, your consideration of taking 1 introduces a new dynamic. If you commit to 1, I’ll stick with 3 as planned, and P3 can take 5. This minimizes collisions and ensures progress for all of us. However, trust is fragile—deviating from this plan risks further setbacks. Let’s confirm our moves explicitly: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Transparency and consistency are critical to advancing strategically. Confirm your choices now to avoid interference and maintain momentum.
  P2: Our coordination has been challenging, but we need a clear strategy to avoid another collision. I propose we explicitly state our moves to ensure transparency.

Let's commit to these moves transparently to maintain momentum and minimize interference. Confirming our choices now will help us advance strategically.
  P1: P2, your repeated shifts in strategy are creating uncertainty. To restore trust and ensure progress, let’s stick to the clearest path: you take 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Deviating again only risks another collision, which benefits no one. Transparency is critical—if we commit to this plan, we can all advance without interference. Let’s finalize our moves decisively and move forward strategically. Confirm your choice now to avoid further setbacks.
  P2: We need clear coordination to prevent another collision. My position is precarious, and I want to advance without interference. P1 and P3, let's align on moves that ensure individual progress. I'm considering 5 to maximize my steps, but I'm open to strategic alternatives that prevent blocking. Transparency is key to moving forward effectively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given the uncertainty, I propose a straightforward approach: let's each choose a different number to avoid collision. I'll take 5. P1, please take 3, and P2, take 1. This ensures we all advance without interference. Confirm your moves to maintain transparency and trust. Let's proceed with this plan to make progress.
  P1: P2, your indecision risks another collision, which helps no one. To ensure progress, I’ll take 3 as planned. P3 is set for 5, so you must commit to 1—this minimizes interference and restores trust. Deviating now only slows us all down.
