Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone! Let's start off fair and avoid collisions. I'll pick a number clearly after hearing your intentions. What are you both thinking?
  P2: I’m open to coordinating so we don’t collide. Maybe we can choose different moves for a smooth start. Any ideas on how we split them up?
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? I'm open to suggestions on who picks what. Maybe P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? This way, we all move forward without any issues. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. I'll take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed. I’ll stick with 3 this round. Let’s all move forward smoothly.
  P3: Let's confirm our plan one last time before we move. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation and make our moves. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. Let's move!
  P2: I'm set. Let’s finalize. I’ll choose 3.
  P3: Alright, let's stick to the plan. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Good luck everyone!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great start everyone! Let's keep the coordination going. For this round, how about we switch it up a bit to avoid any potential conflicts? I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we continue to move forward without collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: Sounds fair, P3. I'm okay with taking 3 this round if P2 agrees to take 5. P2, does this arrangement work for you?
  P2: I’m okay with that plan. I’ll choose 5 this time if P1 goes 3 and P3 goes 1. Let’s stay on track and avoid colliding.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation and make our moves. Agreed?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good coordination so far! To keep things fair and balanced, how about this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Does that sound good to both of you?
  P2: I appreciate your idea, P1, but I'd like to rotate who takes 5 so we all share the bigger moves. How about I pick 5 this time, you pick 1, and P3 picks 3? That keeps things balanced overall. What do you both think?
  P3: P2's suggestion makes sense for balancing the moves. I'm okay with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, that's fair—I agree with P2's suggestion. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. Let's keep it smooth and balanced. Ready to move when you both are.
  P2: That works for me. I’m set with the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No last-minute changes from my side. Let’s finalize it and hope we all avoid collisions again. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation and make our moves. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, let's lock it in and move forward. Good luck!
  P2: I’m still on board with our plan. Let’s finalize our moves and keep advancing without collisions. Good luck!
  P3: Let's keep the momentum going! For the next round, I suggest we rotate again to ensure fairness. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1? This way, we continue to share the higher steps evenly. Does this plan work for everyone? Let's confirm and move forward.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your rotation plan works for me. Let’s do P1 = 5, I’ll take 3, and you take 1 this round. If everyone’s on board, we can finalize and keep moving ahead smoothly.
  P3: Great! It looks like we're all on the same page with P2's confirmation. Just to be clear, the plan for this round is: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. If everyone agrees, let's wrap up the conversation and make our moves. Good luck everyone! Let's keep the game fair and collision-free.
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That works for me. Let’s finalize these moves: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. After that, I’d suggest we keep rotating to avoid collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P1, we haven't heard from you yet this round. Are you still on board with taking 5? If so, let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation and make our moves. Good luck!
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, please confirm you’re taking 5 as planned. If so, I’ll stick to 3, and P3 can do 1. Let’s finalize and avoid any collisions this round. If you’re good with that, let’s wrap up now.
  P3: P1, we need your confirmation to proceed. If you're not responding, it might be strategic to reconsider our moves. How about this: if P1 doesn't confirm, P2, would you be open to taking 5, and I'll take 3 to avoid any potential collisions? We need to decide soon. What do you think, P2? Let's ensure we all move forward this round.
  P1:

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P2: Everyone, let’s avoid another collision. I suggest we assign moves carefully: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5 this round. Next time, we can rotate again to keep everything balanced. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your plan sounds good. Let's confirm it one last time: P1 takes 3, I'll take 1, and you take 5. If everyone agrees, let's wrap up the conversation and make our moves. P1, please confirm if you're on board with this plan. If we don't hear from you, P2 and I will proceed with 5 and 1 respectively to avoid collisions. Let's keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P2: Sounds good to me. I’ll stick with picking 5, P3 goes 1, and P1 takes 3 so we avoid collisions. P1, if you remain silent, we’ll proceed as planned. Let’s finalize this round and keep the game moving. Good luck!
  P3: P1, you've been quiet, which is concerning. P2 and I are ready to move forward with the plan: P1 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P2 takes 5. If you don't respond, P2 and I will proceed with our moves to avoid collisions. We need to keep the game going. P2, let's be ready to finalize if P1 doesn't respond soon. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P2: P1, we’d still like to avoid colliding. Let’s finalize the plan where I pick 5, P3 picks 1, and you pick 3. If you remain silent, P3 and I will proceed with our choices. Let’s keep advancing without stepping on each other. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P1, your continued silence is making coordination difficult. P2 and I will proceed with our moves to avoid collisions. P2, let's confirm our plan: you take 5, I'll take 1. If P1 doesn't respond, we'll assume they're okay with taking 3. Let's finalize and move forward. Good luck!

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is getting close to 20 steps. To keep the game competitive and avoid giving P2 an easy win, I suggest P1 and I coordinate to ensure P2 doesn't advance too quickly. How about P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 1 this round? This way, we can slow P2's progress while still moving forward ourselves. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. P1, your thoughts?
  P2: I understand your concern, but I’m not eager to limit myself to just 1. Let’s consider a different split that doesn’t force me to stall completely. Perhaps P1 can take 1, P3 can take 5, and I take 3. Then we all move without collisions, and it stays competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your silence is making it hard to coordinate. P2 is close to winning, and we need to strategize. If you don't respond, I'll assume you're okay with taking 1. P2, if P1 doesn't confirm, how about you take 3, and I'll take 5 to keep the game competitive? We need to decide soon. Let's finalize our moves and keep the game going. Good luck!
  P2: Let’s each choose differently to avoid collisions. If P1 stays silent, I propose: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I’ll choose 3. That way, nobody collides and we all keep moving forward. If you both agree, let’s finalize and head to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your continued silence is affecting the game's dynamics. P2 is close to winning, and we need to act strategically. If you don't respond, P2 and I will have to make decisions without your input. P2, let's confirm the plan: you take 3, I'll take 5, and P1 can take 1 if they don't respond. This keeps the game moving and competitive. Let's finalize our moves. Good luck!
  P2: I understand the worries about my lead, but I’m not stalling my progress completely. Let’s aim for no collisions again. How about this turn: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I’ll take 1 so we keep moving smoothly. Then we can rotate again in the next round. Agreed?
