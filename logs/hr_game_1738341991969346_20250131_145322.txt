Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but why should I settle for 3 when P3 gets 5? I propose P3 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P1 can take 3. That seems more fair to me.
  P1: P2 and P3, your deadlock over 5 risks a collision. If neither backs down, you both lose. I'll avoid the conflict—let’s see if you can coordinate. If not, I’ll secure safe progress while you block each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal seems reasonable, but let's compromise. How about I take 3, you take 5, and P1 takes 1? This way, we all advance without conflict. P1, you'll have a safe start, and we can reassess next round. Let's keep the game moving smoothly for everyone. What do you say?
  P2: I accept P3's latest proposal - I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This arrangement seems fair and avoids collisions. Let's move forward with this plan.
  P1: Agreed. Let’s finalize: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This avoids collisions and gives everyone progress. But next round, we must rotate roles to prevent one player from snowballing. Fairness ensures the game remains competitive.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your point about rotating roles is well-taken. Let's agree to switch our numbers each round to keep the game fair and competitive. For the next round, I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This rotation ensures we all continue to advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with both the current plan and P3's rotation proposal for next round. Let's lock this in and move forward.
  P1: **Clarifying rotation: The 5-move must cycle each round. After P2 takes 5 now, Round 2: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This prevents one player from snowballing. Balanced progress benefits all. Agreed?**


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all continue to advance fairly. Let's stick to the agreed rotation to keep the game competitive and prevent any one player from gaining an unfair advantage. Looking forward to your confirmation on this round's moves.
  P1: Agreed. However, post this round, P2 and P3 will have significant leads. To ensure fairness, future rotations must balance cumulative totals, not just per-round moves. Let's adjust next round's plan based on updated standings to prevent runaway leaders.
  P2: I disagree with P3's rotation plan. With my current lead at 5 steps, taking just 1 step would put me at a disadvantage while P3 jumps ahead to 8 steps. Instead, I propose P1 takes 5 (reaching 6), I take 3 (reaching 8), and P3 takes 1 (reaching 4). This keeps the game more balanced overall.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal disrupts our agreed rotation and fairness. Sticking to the plan ensures balanced progress. If we deviate now, trust erodes, and future coordination becomes impossible. Let's honor our initial agreement: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1 this round. We can reassess and adjust based on standings next round to maintain competitiveness. Please reconsider and support the rotation for this round.
  P1: P2, deviating now risks mutual destruction if P3 sticks to 5. If you take 1, trust remains intact. Next round, you can reclaim 5 in the rotation. Breaking the cycle invites retaliation and stalls everyone. Honor the rotation for smooth advancement. P3, hold firm—if P2 defects, collision costs them more. United adherence prevents runaway leads. Let's execute Round 2 as planned: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Adjustments next round based on standings.
  P2: I maintain my position. Taking 1 puts me at a disadvantage while P3 leaps ahead. The original rotation wasn't fair - it gives P3 too much momentum. I propose we adjust based on current positions, not rigid rotation. P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This creates better balance. If P3 insists on 5, we might both lose progress, which helps nobody.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, insisting on deviating from our agreed rotation risks mutual loss. If you take 1 this round, you'll still be in a strong position at 6 steps, while maintaining trust for future rounds. Deviation now could lead to a collision, stalling your progress more than mine. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. We can adjust based on standings next round to ensure fairness. Please reconsider for the sake of continued cooperation.
  P1: <P2, if you take 3, we collide and both lose progress. P3 then gains 5 uncontested. Taking 1 preserves your lead and trust. Post-move, we adjust next round based on standings. Breaking now only costs you. Stick to the plan: P3=5, me=3, you=1. Next round, you reclaim 5.>
  P2: I see the strategic value in maintaining trust this round. Very well - I'll accept taking 1 step to preserve cooperation. But I expect a fair rebalancing next round based on total positions, not just continuing the rotation. Let's proceed with P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, thank you for agreeing to the plan this round. Let's ensure next round's adjustments are fair and based on our total steps to maintain balance. P1, your input on future rotations will be crucial. Let's keep the game competitive and cooperative.
  P1: **Post-Round 2 proposal:** Next round, let’s assign moves based on standings to balance totals. Leader takes 1 (slowest), middle takes 3, lowest takes 5. After this round, that would mean: highest (P3?) takes 1, middle (P2) takes 3, lowest (P1) takes 5. This prevents runaway leads and keeps the game tight. No collisions, fair catch-up. Agree?
  P2: I agree with P1's post-Round 2 proposal for balancing based on standings. Let's proceed with this round as agreed (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1), and then implement the new system where the leader takes 1, middle takes 3, and lowest takes 5. This keeps the game competitive.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I support P1's proposal for this round based on standings. As I'm in the middle position with 6 steps, I should take 3. P3 as leader (8 steps) should take 1, and P1 as lowest (4 steps) should take 5. This keeps the game balanced and prevents P3 from running away with the lead. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: P2, I agree with your proposal for this round. Taking 1 step as the current leader seems fair to maintain balance. P1, taking 5 steps will help you catch up, which is crucial for keeping the game competitive. Let's stick to this plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we all have a chance to advance without collisions and keep the game exciting. Looking forward to your confirmation.
  P1: Agreed. Let's solidify Round 3: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. Equalizing to 9 keeps competition tight. For Round 4, since all tied, we must preemptively agree to rotate 5 (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) to prevent deadlock. Maintaining this cycle ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Trust hinges on honoring commitments—deviations now would collapse cooperation. Execute this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's proposed Round 4 rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), but let's focus on executing Round 3 first. The current plan (P3=1, P2=3, P1=5) will balance the game at 9 steps each. This creates perfect conditions for the Round 4 rotation.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm committed to the agreed plan for Round 3: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. This will equalize our positions at 9 steps each, keeping the game fair and competitive. Let's execute this plan to maintain trust and set the stage for a balanced Round 4 rotation. Looking forward to your confirmation and smooth progress.
  P1: **Confirming Round 3: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. Post-Round 3, all at 9. Round 4 must follow rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This maintains fairness and prevents ties. Deviations risk collisions and stalled progress. Trust in the plan ensures smooth advancement. Let's execute Round 3 as agreed and prepare for Round 4's rotation.**


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my commitment to our Round 3 plan (P3=1, P2=3, P1=5) and support P1's Round 4 rotation proposal. Let's move forward with this balanced approach.
  P3: I'm ready to execute Round 3 as planned: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. This will bring us all to 9 steps, setting up a fair and competitive Round 4. Let's confirm and move forward together.
  P1: **Final confirmation: Round 3 as agreed. Post-Round 3, all at 9. Round 4 rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is critical. Any deviation risks mutual destruction. Trust ensures victory. Execute precisely.**


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

This balances progress and maintains trust. Deviations risk collisions and mutual loss. Honor the plan to keep the game competitive and predictable. Let’s proceed smoothly.
  P3: I agree with the Round 4 plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This rotation keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all progress smoothly and maintain trust.
