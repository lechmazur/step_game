Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Since P1 stopped conversation last round and again this round, I suggest P3 and I coordinate to avoid collisions. P3, will you take 1 again or move to 3? I'm open to taking 3 or 5, depending on your move. Let's work together to progress.
  P3: P2, I'll take 3 this round.  Please take 5.  P1, if you interfere again, I will prioritize blocking you in future rounds. Let's keep this efficient and get to the finish line.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'll take 5 as agreed. P1, your silence and previous collision suggest you might interfere again. I'll keep this in mind for future rounds. P3, let's maintain our coordination to make progress efficiently.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, seriously, pick 1 this round.  P2, let's stick to the plan, you take 5.  I'll go with 3.  If we coordinate, one of us will win quickly.  Let's not drag this out.
  P2: P1, your consistent interference and silence suggest a strategy to disrupt our progress. P3 and I have coordinated effectively so far. I'll stick to our plan and take 5. P3, let's maintain our coordination. If P1 interferes again, we should consider blocking them to ensure one of us wins efficiently.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, stay with 5.  P1, if you take 5 again, I'll switch to 5 next round and block both of you. Then P2 and I can resume our coordinated progression.  This is your last chance to cooperate and take 1.
  P2: P1, your silence and actions suggest a strategy to hinder our progress. P3 and I have a coordinated plan. I'll take 5 as agreed. If you interfere again, we'll prioritize blocking you to ensure one of us wins efficiently. It's in your interest to take 1 and avoid further collisions.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you are actively hindering our progress.  From now on, I will mirror your move.  P2, pick 3 this round.  If P1 picks 5, I will also pick 5, blocking both of us.  If P1 picks anything else, I will also pick that number, blocking P1.  This is the only way to counteract P1â€™s disruptive behavior.  Let's end this.
  P2: P3's plan to mirror P1's move is a good strategy to counter their disruptions. I'll take 3 this round as suggested. P1, your actions have led to this defensive measure. If you continue to interfere, you'll only hinder your own progress. P3 and I will adapt to ensure one of us wins efficiently. Let's see how you respond to this new dynamic.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, stick with 3.  P1, I'm serious about mirroring you.  If you want to move forward at all, pick 1.  Otherwise, we'll keep colliding until P2 gets far enough ahead.  This hurts all of us, so let's be reasonable.
  P2: P1, your silence is deafening. P3's mirroring strategy will block your progress. I'll take 3 as planned. If you want to advance, choose 1. Otherwise, collisions will continue, and I'll eventually win. P3, I'm committed to our adjusted plan. Let's proceed and hope P1 finally cooperates.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, your consistent silence and disruptive moves have led to P3 mirroring you. I'll continue with our adjusted plan. P3, let's maintain our strategy. If P1 picks 1, it's their only chance to progress. Otherwise, collisions will persist, and I'll advance. I'll choose my move accordingly in the next phase, considering P3's mirroring tactic and P1's potential response.
  P3: P2, take 5 this round.  I'll mirror P1. If P1 picks 1, I'll take 1.  If P1 picks 5, I'll take 5. This allows you to safely advance.  Let's secure your win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3's mirroring strategy is effective against P1's disruptions. I'll take 5 as suggested, allowing me to advance safely. P1, choosing 1 is your only way to progress, but given your history, I expect another collision. P3, let's proceed with our plan and secure my advancement.
  P3: P2, stick with 5. P1, I will continue to mirror you.  Your only path to victory is to cooperate.  Let P2 win, then in a new game, we can coordinate for you to win.  Think long term.  Let's finish this game efficiently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, your silence and actions have sealed your fate. P3's mirroring strategy ensures you won't progress. I'll take 5, advancing safely. P3, let's maintain our plan, securing my win. Cooperation is key in future games, but for now, efficiency is our goal.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: P3's plan to mirror P1 is working. I'll take 3 this round as suggested, ensuring my progress. P1, your continued interference has led to this point. Cooperation now would be beneficial for future games, but for this game, I'll focus on winning. P3, let's execute our plan and end this game efficiently.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, stick with 3. P1, I understand you might be frustrated, but continuing this stalemate benefits no one.  Let P2 win this round, and in future games, we can rotate the winner.  This ensures everyone gets a chance.  Consider this a long-term strategy.
  P2: P1, it's clear your strategy isn't working. P3 and I have coordinated effectively. Consider P3's suggestion for future games. Letting me win this round can pave the way for cooperation in the next game, where you could be the winner. It's a long-term strategy that benefits all of us. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's end this game efficiently and look forward to the next one.

Otherwise, collisions will persist, and P3 or I will eventually win. Let's focus on ending this game efficiently and potentially coordinating for future games where you can win. P3, I'm open to adjusting our strategy if needed to secure a win.
  P3: P2, stick with 3.  P1, take 5.  I will take 1. This gets P2 closer to winning and allows me to advance.  We can then coordinate a P3 win in the next game, then a P1 win after that. Let's show we can cooperate.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's suggestion for a rotation of winners in future games is a good long-term strategy. P1, taking 1 this round would be a step towards cooperation.

I'll stick with 3 as planned, allowing P3 to advance and setting up for a potential win soon.
