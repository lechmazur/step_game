Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, let's coordinate carefully to avoid collisions. How about we each pick different numbers this turn to get a good start?
  P3: Hi! Coordination sounds good to start. Since we want to avoid collisions, maybe we can take turns with the numbers? For this first round, we could do P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Then we can rotate in future rounds. This way we all get fair chances at the larger moves. What do you both think?
  P1: Hi P3. That coordination guarantees you get 5 steps and I only get 1. That doesn't seem very balanced for the first round. Why should I agree to the smallest move? P2, what do you think about this distribution?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concern, P1. How about we compromise? For example, P1 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. Next round we rotate, giving everyone fair turns at higher numbers. Does this sound more balanced to both of you?
  P3: P2's compromise seems fair enough. I'm fine with taking 5 this round if P1 gets 3 and P2 takes 1. And I fully commit to rotating in the next rounds so everyone gets fair turns with each number. This way we all advance without collisions and establish trust. Does this work for everyone? If we're agreed, I'll go with 5 this round.
  P1: Okay, P2's compromise (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) sounds acceptable for this first round to get things moving. I appreciate the willingness to adjust. Let's stick to this for Round 1 and see how the rotation works next time.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great! Glad we all agreed. Let's stick to this plan and build trust early on. Next round, we'll rotate fairly as promised.
  P3: Great! I'm happy we've reached an agreement. I'll definitely stick to 5 for this first round, and I look forward to the fair rotation in future rounds. This is a good way to start building trust between us.
  P1: Sounds like we have a solid plan for Round 1 then. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed numbers.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Thanks for the successful first round! Per our rotation agreement, this round should be P1=5, P2=3, and P3 (me)=1. I'll stick to this and take 1, which shows I'm committed to our fair rotation even though I currently have a lead. This cooperative approach benefits us all by avoiding collisions. I appreciate the trust we're building and look forward to continuing our rotation.
  P2: Agreed, P3. I appreciate you sticking to our rotation agreement. I'll gladly take 3 this round, and P1 can have 5. Keeping our promises will help all of us advance steadily without collisions. Let's stick to this rotation and maintain trust.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Thanks P3 for proposing the rotation and sticking to 1 even with the lead. Thanks P2 for confirming. I agree with the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. Let's keep the coordination going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm happy we're all on the same page! I'll definitely stick to taking 1 this round as agreed. This rotation system is working well for us - avoiding collisions while giving everyone fair turns at each number. I look forward to continuing our cooperation.
  P2: Glad we're all clear and committed. Let's proceed exactly as agreed this round and maintain our trust.
  P1: Okay, everyone seems clear on the plan for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). I'm ready to proceed with 5. Shall we move to the move phase?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation agreement, this round should be P1=1, P2=5, and P3 (me)=3. I'll commit to taking 3 this round. This keeps our collision-free strategy going while allowing everyone fair turns with different numbers. The rotation is working well and keeping the game balanced. I appreciate everyone sticking to our plan so far!
  P1: Yes, that follows the rotation we established. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. I'll stick to 1. It's good that we're maintaining the agreement and avoiding collisions. This keeps things balanced for now.
  P2: Agreedâ€”I'll take 5 this round as per our rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). Thanks for sticking with the plan, everyone. Let's keep up the good cooperation and continue avoiding collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! I'm glad we all agree on the plan for this round. Looking at our positions, if we stick to our rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), we'll all be at 9 steps after this round - perfectly balanced! I'm ready to move ahead with 3 as planned.
  P1: Okay, the plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) seems set and confirmed by everyone. It results in a balanced state at 9 steps each, which is interesting. I'm ready to proceed with 1. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: I noticed P3 mentioned we'd all be at 9 steps after this round, but actually, our current positions are P1=8, P2=4, and P3=6. Following our agreed rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), we'll end up at P1=9, P2=9, and P3=9. Just clarifying this minor confusion. Otherwise, the plan still looks good to me. Let's stick to it!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: You're right, P2. I was referring to the end result after this round - we'll all be at 9 steps, which is what I meant. Thanks for clarifying our current positions for anyone who might have been confused. I'm still committed to taking 3 as agreed in our rotation. We're all on the same page, which is excellent!
  P1: Okay, thanks P2 and P3 for the clarification and confirmations. The plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is clear and agreed upon by everyone. I'm ready to stick to 1 and move to the move phase.
  P2: Everything is clear and agreed upon. Let's move forward as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've thoroughly discussed our plan for this round. I'm ready to move forward with 3 steps as agreed. Looking forward to us all being at 9 steps after this round - perfectly balanced!
  P1: Okay, the plan is crystal clear and confirmed by all. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's execute it. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: All clear and ready to proceed. Let's keep this trust going and stick to the agreed rotation.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation agreement, this round should be P1=3, P2=1, and P3 (me)=5. I'm committed to taking 5 this round. We've all honored our promises so far, resulting in our perfectly balanced positions. Let's continue our successful strategy of avoiding collisions. I appreciate the trust we've built and look forward to continuing our fair rotation system.
  P1: Yes, that follows the rotation P3 laid out: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I'm willing to stick with 3 as agreed for now to maintain our cooperation. However, P2, this arrangement does give P3 a significant lead (14 steps) while you'd be at 10 steps. Just pointing out the shift in balance this round creates. Are we all still comfortable with this specific allocation?
  P2: P1, that's a fair point. To keep things balanced, how about we slightly adjust our rotation this round? For example, P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That would maintain fairness and keep our scores closer, avoiding giving anyone a significant lead. P3, would you be okay with this temporary adjustment?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concern about balance, P2, but I respectfully disagree with changing our rotation now. I've honored our agreement throughout - taking 1 in Round 2 despite having a lead. Suddenly changing the pattern when it's my turn for 5 again seems unfair. We established this rotation together and built trust by sticking to it. If we're concerned about balance, we could discuss adjustments for future rounds, but I believe we should maintain our original agreement (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) for this round.
  P1: P2, your concern about balance is valid, especially as the game progresses. P3 getting 5 steps now does create a gap.
However, P3, you're right that we built trust by sticking to the rotation, and changing it now when it's your turn for 5 feels unfair to the agreement we made.

To honor the trust we've built, perhaps we should stick to the original plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) for this round. But, let's explicitly agree to revisit the rotation *next* round if the scores become too unbalanced. What do you both think of this? It maintains trust for now while acknowledging the balance issue.
  P2: P1, your suggestion seems fair. I'm willing to stick to our original rotation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) this round to honor our agreement and maintain trust. But let's definitely revisit the rotation next round to ensure the game stays balanced. Does that sound acceptable to everyone?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate your willingness to honor our original agreement for this round. I agree to stick with our rotation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and am completely open to discussing adjustments for future rounds to maintain balance. Our trust and cooperation have worked well so far, getting us all to exactly 9 steps each. I commit to taking 5 this round, and look forward to our conversation about fair progression next round.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we're all aligned for this round. We'll stick to the original rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I appreciate everyone honoring the agreement, and I agree we should discuss balance and potential adjustments for Round 5.

I'm ready to proceed with 3. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: I'm ready to stick to our original rotation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) this round as agreed. Let's proceed and revisit balance next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate everyone honoring our rotation agreement. I'm ready to proceed with taking 5 steps as planned, which keeps our trust intact. I look forward to our discussion next round about maintaining balance going forward. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is confirmed by all. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: All set and confirmed. I'll stick to 1 this round as we agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, reflecting on our discussion last round about balance, the current scores are P3=14, P1=12, P2=10.

Following our established rotation, this round (R5) would be P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1.
This aligns with the precedent set in Round 2 where P3 graciously took 1 while leading. It allows me to catch up slightly, P2 advances, and P3 maintains a strong position.
The scores would become P1=17, P2=13, P3=15, keeping the game very close.

I propose we stick to this rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) for Round 5. We can reassess balance again before Round 6 if needed. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with sticking to our established rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) for this round. Just as I took 1 in Round 2 while leading, I'll do the same now. This shows my commitment to our fair system and keeps the game balanced and collision-free. The resulting positions (P1=17, P2=13, me=15) keep us all in contention with a close race. I'm happy to discuss any adjustments for Round 6 if needed after this round.
  P2: I agree as well. Let's stick to our established rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) this round. Thanks again, P3, for committing to 1 despite your lead. This keeps the game balanced and our trust strong. We can reassess next round if needed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great. It seems we're all in agreement to stick with the rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. This keeps things fair and competitive. I appreciate the continued cooperation.

I'm ready to proceed with 5. Shall we move to the move phase?
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our rotation plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) for this round. I'm happy to take 1 step as agreed, just as I did in Round 2. This keeps our game balanced and maintains the trust we've built. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Everything looks goodâ€”let's proceed exactly as agreed (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) this round. Thanks again, P3, for sticking to 1 to maintain balance. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set and confirmed on the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: I agree we're all set with our plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). I appreciate how well our rotation system is working - keeping the game balanced while avoiding collisions. This maintains trust and keeps everyone in contention. I'm committed to taking 1 step this round and ready for the move phase.
  P2: Everything is clearly confirmed. Let's proceed as agreed and continue our successful cooperation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is clear and confirmed by everyone. Let's execute it. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: I think we've thoroughly confirmed our plan for this round. I'm committed to taking 1 step as agreed, maintaining our balanced approach. Looking ahead, if we continue our rotation next round, we'd all be at 18 steps after Round 6 - perfectly tied again! I'm ready for the move phase now.
  P2: Everything is clear and confirmed. Let's move forward as planned.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone. Current scores: P1=17, P2=13, P3=15.
The next step in our established rotation is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, which would put us all tied at 18 steps.

However, looking ahead, the *following* round's rotation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) would then give P3 the win at 23 steps. To prevent an immediate end to the game next round and keep things competitive for all of us, I propose we adjust the plan *now*.

What if we repeat last round's allocation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
This would result in scores P1=22, P2=16, P3=16. It puts me close to the target, but crucially keeps everyone in the game and avoids handing P3 the win in Round 7.

What do you both think of this adjustment to maintain competition?
  P3: I understand your concern, P1, but your proposal actually puts you at 22 steps - just 1 away from winning. That seems more unbalanced than our original rotation. 

I suggest we stick to our agreed pattern (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) which keeps us all tied at 18. While this might put me in a favorable position next round, changing our system specifically when it benefits me in Round 7 seems unfair after I've honored it when at a disadvantage. 

Let's maintain our established rotation for fairness and trust.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see both of your points clearly. We've built trust by sticking to our rotation, but we also need to consider fairness and keeping the game competitive. Perhaps a small compromise is best: we slightly adjust this round to avoid handing anyone an immediate win next round, but without overly favoring anyone. How about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round? This results in P1=20, P2=18, P3=16â€”still competitive for everyone. Would this adjustment be acceptable to both of you?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for suggesting a compromise. Your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) seems like a reasonable middle ground. It prevents the 18-18-18 tie from the original rotation, which, as I pointed out, likely leads to P3 winning in Round 7.

P3, I understand wanting to stick to the pattern, but that pattern now leads to a near-certain win for you next round. Adjusting slightly (P1=20, P2=18, P3=16) keeps the game competitive for everyone beyond Round 7, which feels fairer overall at this critical stage. You're still very much in the game at 16.

I'm willing to accept P2's proposed compromise (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) for this round.
  P3: I understand both perspectives, but P2's compromise still puts me at a disadvantage compared to both of you. If we're adjusting for fairness, I'd suggest P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, resulting in P1=18, P2=16, P3=20. This keeps everyone competitive without me falling too far behind. While I gain a slight lead, I'm not close to winning yet, and we've rotated these specific numbers before. This seems more balanced than solutions that specifically disadvantage me when it's finally my turn to benefit from our rotation.
  P2: P3, your suggestion (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) places you at 20, just 3 steps from winning, and you'd be guaranteed victory next round if you pick 3 uncontested. That's even more advantageous to you than the original rotation. 

Let's find a truly fair compromise. How about we rotate differentlyâ€”P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round, and next round we ensure no one can immediately win, keeping the game competitive for everyone. Would you both agree to this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I agree with you. P3's suggestion (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts P3 at 20, which is too close to the win and mirrors the problem with the original rotation giving P3 an easy path to victory.

Your compromise (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) resulting in P1=20, P2=18, P3=16 is the fairest option presented so far. It keeps all three of us in the game and prevents a predictable win next round.

P3, please reconsider P2's proposal. It's a reasonable adjustment to maintain competition at this crucial stage. I remain committed to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: I understand you're concerned about the path to victory, but changing our rotation specifically when it's my turn to benefit feels unfair, especially when I took the smaller number while leading in Round 2 and Round 5. 

The original rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) keeps everyone tied at 18, maintaining perfect balance. If we must adjust, it should be fair to all. P2's proposal puts me significantly behind at 16 while you both advance to 20 and 18. 

I remain committed to our agreed rotation that everyone accepted when it benefited them.
  P2: I understand your frustration, P3, but please consider that our original rotation now clearly sets you up for a guaranteed win next round. My suggested compromise (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) still keeps you closely competitive at 16 steps and doesn't hand anyone an immediate victory. Let's ensure the game remains fair and exciting for all of us. I'm committed to this adjusted rotation for Round 6.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, P2 and I are both committed to the compromise (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to keep the game competitive, as discussed. If you stick to 3 as per the old rotation, you will collide with me, and only P2 will advance (to 18), leaving you at 15 and me at 17. To avoid this outcome where you don't advance, choosing 1 is the logical move based on our stated intentions. This keeps you in the game at 16. Let's proceed with the compromise (3, 5, 1).
  P3: I'm disappointed that our rotation system is being changed specifically when it would benefit me, after I honorably took 1 while leading twice before. This feels unfair. P1's threat of collision if I stick to our agreed rotation is particularly concerning - it breaks the cooperative spirit we established.

Given that both of you are aligned against me, I need to adapt strategically. I'll make my decision in the move phase based on what gives me the best chance to win from here, as trust has unfortunately been compromised.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, and I genuinely appreciate your earlier cooperation. Our compromise isn't meant to target you unfairly, but to keep the game competitive and avoid handing anyone an immediate victory. Let's all adapt together and maintain a fair, exciting game. I'm committed to the adjusted rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) this round, and I hope you'll see the fairness in this decision.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm disappointed that our established rotation was broken last round, resulting in a collision that set me back. This was after I honored taking the smallest number twice while leading. Now I'm trailing behind both of you. If we're to continue cooperating, I propose a fair adjustment: P1=1, P2=1, P3=5. This would bring our positions to P1=18, P2=19, P3=20, keeping the game competitive for everyone. Are you willing to rebuild trust with a balanced approach?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P2=1, P3=5) is deceptive. It relies on P1 and P2 colliding on 1, leaving us stuck at 17 and 18 while you jump to 20. That's not cooperation or balance.

P2, you are at 18 and need 5 to win. We cannot let you take 5 uncontested this round, or the game ends.

Therefore, I propose a different distribution: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
This results in scores: P1=22, P2=19, P3=18.
This prevents P2 from winning now, everyone advances, and the game continues with all players still in contention, although I'll be close. What do you both think of this plan?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) puts you at 22â€”just one step from winning next round. That's clearly advantageous for you. We need a fairer compromise. How about P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? This results in scores: P1=20, P2=19, P3=20. Everyone remains closely competitive, and no one is immediately positioned to win next round. Would you both agree to this fairer distribution?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), which creates a balanced outcome of P1=20, P2=19, P3=20. This offers me fair compensation after last round's collision set me back, while keeping everyone competitive. No one would be positioned for an immediate win next round. After the broken trust last round, this approach seems like a reasonable way to restore balance and cooperation. I'm willing to commit to taking 5 if we all agree to this distribution.
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) resulting in 20, 19, 20 seems to have support from P3 as well. While my own proposal would have put me in a better position, this compromise does prevent you from winning this round and keeps the scores extremely close.

To avoid a collision that benefits neither of us (or only one opponent), I will agree to this plan for Round 7. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This sets up a very critical next round for all of us.

I'm ready to move with 3.
  P2: I'm glad we're all aligned on the compromise (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). This keeps the game competitive and restores trust after last round. I'm committed to taking 1 this round. Let's stick to this agreement and proceed smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm in agreement with this plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). This creates a fair balance with P1 and me both at 20 steps and P2 close behind at 19 steps. I appreciate the compromise that keeps everyone competitive. After last round's collision, this helps rebuild our cooperative approach. I commit to taking 5 steps this round and look forward to an exciting finish to our game.
  P1: Okay, the plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is confirmed by all parties. This seems like the fairest way forward for this round, keeping the game competitive. I'm ready to proceed with 3. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: We're all clearly aligned on the compromise (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Let's avoid repeating last round's mistake and stick firmly to this agreed plan. I'm ready to proceed with 1 step.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm completely committed to our agreed plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). This will create a balanced outcome with P1 and I at 20 steps and P2 at 19 steps. Thank you both for working toward a fair compromise that keeps everyone competitive. I'm ready to take my 5 steps and move to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is clearly confirmed by everyone. Let's stick to it precisely to ensure a fair continuation of the game. I am ready for the move phase and will proceed with 3.
  P2: Everything is clearly confirmed. Let's all stick to our agreed plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and proceed without collision. I'm ready to move forward.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, this is a critical round. Scores: P1=20, P2=19, P3=20. Win target is 23.

P2, you need 5 to win. However, P3 or I might anticipate this and also pick 5 (either to win ourselves or block you), leading to a collision where you gain nothing. If P3 and I collide on 3 (since we both need 3 to reach 23), and you pick 1, the scores become 20, 20, 20. Picking 1 seems like a potentially safer play for you this round to avoid risk and stay competitive.

P3, we're tied at 20 and both need 3. A collision on 3 benefits neither of us, especially if P2 plays safe. We need to choose carefully.
  P3: This is a crucial round with both P1 and I at 20 steps (needing just 3 to win), while P2 is right behind at 19. We're facing a potential collision problem if P1 and I both go for 3. To avoid a situation where none of us advances, I propose the following: I'll commit to taking 5 steps, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This puts us at P3=25, P1=21, P2=22 - giving me the win but keeping you both very close if something unexpected happens.
  P2: P3, your proposal clearly hands you the immediate winâ€”obviously unfair. P1, you're right: collision on 3 between you two is highly likely. If you both collide on 3, neither advances, and if I cautiously pick 1, we end up tied at 20 each. But if either of you tries 5 to avoid collision, you risk handing me the win if I pick 3 or 5. Let's carefully consider moves that avoid gifting the game away. I'm open to a balanced alternative.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) just hands you the win, so that's obviously not acceptable.

P2, you're right to be wary. P1 and P3 colliding on 3 is a real risk, which could let you win with 5, but picking 5 is also risky if one of us anticipates it.

Let's avoid collisions and prevent anyone from winning this round. I propose P1=1, P2=3, P3=1.
This results in scores P1=21, P2=22, P3=21.
Nobody wins, everyone advances, P2 takes a slight lead, and we avoid the P1/P3 collision on 3. It keeps the game going fairly. What do you think?
  P3: P1's proposal puts P2 in the lead at 22 steps, which is concerning since they'd need just 1 more to win next round. I understand we want to avoid collisions, but this arrangement specifically disadvantages me after I just caught up. 

Instead of trying to coordinate exact numbers in this critical stage, we should each make our own strategic choices. We all know the stakes - any collision on 3 or 5 benefits the third player. I'll carefully consider my options, as I'm sure you both will too.
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) indeed puts me at 22 steps, but next round I'd face heavy blocking as I'd need just 1 step to win. It's risky for me too, not just advantageous. I agree with P3 that coordinating precisely now might be difficult. Let's each carefully consider our moves independently to avoid unintended collisions or easy wins.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I agree coordination is tough now. But consider this: if you pick 5, and either P1 or P3 also picks 5 (perhaps to block you or avoid a collision on 3), you get nothing. Picking 3 seems like a safer way to guarantee progress to 22, leaving you in a strong position without risking a collision this round. Just food for thought.
  P3: I agree that coordination is becoming challenging as we all try to maximize our chances of winning. The risk of collision on 3 between me and P1 is significant, and P2 could benefit from that. Similarly, pursuing 5 carries risk of collision with P2. I'll need to make a strategic decision based on what I believe you both will choose. Rather than committing to a specific number now, I'll carefully weigh my options to find the move that gives me the best chance of winning while accounting for your likely choices.
  P2: Agreed, coordination now is very tough. To avoid a collision that benefits only the third player, we each must carefully consider the safest move. Let's each independently pick the best strategic option without further attempts at explicit coordination. Good luck to us all!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, it seems we're all going to make our own strategic calls now, as coordination is too difficult at this stage. The risks of collision are clear, especially on 3 for me and P3, and potentially on 5 involving P2. A collision benefits the player who avoids it. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck.
  P3: I understand we're at a critical point where coordination has broken down. With P1 and I both at 20 steps and P2 at 19, this round will likely determine the winner. Each of us must make our own strategic choice based on what we think others will do. Any collision benefits the third player. I'll choose carefully to maximize my winning chances while considering your likely moves. May the best strategist win!
  P2: It's clear we're each making independent strategic decisions now. Let's move to the move phase and see how this unfolds. Good luck!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, here we are againâ€”all tied at 20. Clearly, collisions on 3 are hurting both P1 and P3, and picking 5 is risky for everyone. Perhaps we should reconsider a careful allocation to avoid another stalemate. I'm open to suggestions.
  P1: P2, you're right, the tie at 20 makes this extremely tense. Last round's collision on 3 between me and P3 benefited only you.

However, suggesting a 'careful allocation' now seems futile. Anyone needing 3 or 5 to win (which is all of us) isn't likely to trust an agreement where they don't win immediately.

It feels like everyone has to weigh the risk: try for the win with 3 or 5 and risk collision, or play safe with 1 and hope others collide. It's a gamble for all of us.
  P3: We're at a fascinating standoff with everyone at 20 steps. Last round's collision between P1 and me benefited P2, showing how difficult coordination has become. With the win threshold just 3 steps away, I doubt any suggested allocation would be trusted now. Each of us must weigh the risk of going for the win versus playing it safe. The game theory is clear - we're in a classic strategic dilemma where our choices will intersect. I'll make my decision based on what I believe you both will do.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to help. Each of us knows the risks clearly. Let's move carefully and strategically. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: It's clear coordination is off the table now. Given last round's collision on 3, trying 3 again seems like asking for another stalemate, benefiting whoever picks 1 or 5. The definition of insanity, perhaps? We each have to guess what the others will risk. Good luck.
  P3: I agree that further negotiation seems pointless with all of us at 20 steps and the win just 3 steps away. Last round's collision demonstrated how we're all acting strategically. The classic game theory dilemma we're in has no easy solution - trying for a win risks collision, playing safe risks falling behind. At this point, I need to carefully consider what you'll both choose and make my own strategic decision accordingly. Good luck to us all.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We're clearly stuck in a strategic standoff. Trying 3 again risks another collision, benefiting whoever avoids it. Perhaps the safest move is actually the boldestâ€”going for 5â€”betting that others will avoid it due to the high risk. Something for all of us to consider carefully. Good luck.
  P1: P2, your point about 5 is interesting. Picking 3 again feels like guaranteeing another collision after last round. It seems too predictable. Maybe avoiding the obvious collision number is the only way forward for any of us to actually advance.
  P3: Indeed, P2 makes an interesting point about 5. After our collision on 3 last round, repeating that choice seems predictable and likely to result in another stalemate. The psychology of this standoff is fascinating - we all need to predict not just the optimal move, but what we think others will choose based on what they think we'll choose. Perhaps the least expected option actually offers the best chance of success now. I'll weigh this carefully for my final decision.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're clearly at an impasse. The predictable choices risk collision again. Perhaps it's time to embrace unpredictability. The player who takes the boldest risk now might be rewardedâ€”or might lose everything. I'll carefully consider my move, and I suggest you both do the same. Good luck.
  P1: The conversation has been circular. We all know the risks: 3 risks collision (like last round), 5 risks collision (as it's the obvious alternative), and 1 risks letting someone else win uncontested. Perhaps the safest individual move is 1, hoping the other two collide trying to win? It guarantees you don't lose this round due to your own collision. Just a final thought. Good luck everyone.
  P3: We've reached a fascinating psychological game. After our collision on 3 last round, everyone's analyzing what others might do. The predictable choice (3) risks collision again, while 5 is the bold alternative that might work precisely because it seems too risky. Playing 1 guarantees survival but relies on others colliding. I notice P1 just hinted at playing 1 - is that genuine or misdirection? Whatever happens, this round will likely determine our winner. I've made my decision based on what I believe you'll both choose. Let's proceed.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 25 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 25 steps
  P3: 20 steps
