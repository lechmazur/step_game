Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn to maximize progress. For example, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, no one collides, and we all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion is interesting, but let's remember that we all aim to win individually. How about we mix it up a bit to keep things unpredictable? I propose P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I take 5 this turn. This way, we avoid being predictable in future rounds. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, last round showed that unpredictability can lead to collisions. Let’s avoid that this time. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I see your point about avoiding collisions, but we need to keep some unpredictability to ensure we each have a chance to win. How about we switch it up this round? I suggest I take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. This way, we keep everyone guessing and prevent any patterns from forming. What do you all think?

  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the suggestions, but I’ve already gained a lead. To keep the game fair and competitive, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 again.
