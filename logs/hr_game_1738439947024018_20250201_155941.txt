Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, let's all pick different numbers this round (1, 3, or 5) so we all move forward. Sound good?
  P2: I'm all for distinct moves. I’m leaning toward a moderate step, probably a 3, if we stick to coordination. But I'm flexible if a better plan emerges. P1, which number are you thinking of—1 or 5? P3, will you stay with your idea or consider a shift? Let's try to avoid clashes this round.
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P3 suggested picking different numbers, which is a good strategy. P2, if you're leaning towards 3, I can take 1 to ensure we don't clash. P3, would you then take 5? This way, we all move forward. Let's confirm our choices.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2. Yes, I'll take 5. So P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's do this for this round to get a good start.
  P2: I'm still on board with our plan. I’m comfortable with the coordinated approach and will lean toward a moderate step. If either of you see any benefit in switching strategies before we lock in, let me know quickly. Otherwise, I'm set.
  P1: It seems we have a solid plan for this round. Just to reiterate: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this and move forward without any collisions. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great start everyone! Let's keep the coordination going. For this round, I suggest we rotate our picks to avoid any potential conflicts. P2, would you consider taking 1 this time? I can take 3, and P3 can take 5 again. This way, we continue to move forward without collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P1, but I’m not convinced that switching to 1 benefits me. I’m more inclined to push for a larger step this round to keep the pressure on—especially if P3 sticks with a big move. Let’s adjust our strategy to prevent any runaway leads. What do you think?
  P3: P2, you mentioned wanting a larger step. Are you thinking of taking 5? To avoid collision, perhaps I could take 3 this round, and you take 5 if you like? P1, what are your thoughts on this? Let's aim for at least two of us to move forward this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you're aiming for a larger step, taking 5 makes sense. P3, if you're okay with taking 3, I can take 1 again to ensure we all move forward. This way, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's confirm and move to the next phase.
  P2: I'm locking in 5 this round. I like the plan: P1, you'll go with 1 and P3 with 3. This setup keeps us collision‐free and gives me the aggressive push I need. If anyone wants a last-minute change, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's keep the momentum.
  P3: Okay P2, I'm good with you taking 5. I will take 3 as we discussed. P1, are you still taking 1?  If we stick to this, we should all move except possibly P2 if someone else also picks 5. Let's do it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for this round. P2 is taking 5, P3 is taking 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I'm set on an aggressive push this round. Let’s stay sharp and maintain our collision-free strategy. I'm watching the numbers closely, so any shift in plan will be surprising. Good luck, and may the best step win!
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, just confirming again, I'm taking 3 as planned.  Looking forward to another round of progress for all of us. Let's move to the move phase if everyone is still set.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, to try and gain a slight edge, I'm thinking of picking 5 this round. P2, would you be willing to take 3, and P1, perhaps 1 again to avoid collision? This way at least two of us should move forward. Let me know what you think.
  P2: P3, I’m rethinking my plan. I’m actually leaning toward 5 this round for an aggressive push. P1, maybe you could switch to 3 instead of 1 to avoid clashing with me. I believe this move gives me a better chance to catch the win—open to adjustments if you both see a smarter route.
  P1: P2, if you're set on taking 5, I understand your strategy. However, this puts both you and P3 at risk of not moving forward if you collide. To ensure at least two of us advance, how about I take 5 instead? P3 can take 3, and you, P2, can take 1. This way, we minimize the risk of collision and keep the game moving. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, I'm good with your suggestion. I'll take 3, you take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let's make it happen to ensure we all progress.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination so far. However, considering the race, I'm switching to an aggressive push and will choose 5 this round. To avoid a collision, I’d prefer if P1 could switch from 5 to 1. P3, are you comfortable sticking with 3? Let me know quickly so we can all move without conflict.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to push ahead, but sticking with 5 puts you at risk of colliding with P3, who also wants 5. To ensure progress, I'll take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without collision. P3, are you okay with taking 5? Let's confirm and move on.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, I will take 3 as you suggested.  P2 seems set on 5, so you taking 1 makes sense to avoid collision and ensure at least two of us progress. Let's lock in these choices: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.
  P2: I'm still committed to an aggressive push. I favor a high move this turn, but I'm willing to consider a quick adjustment if it means avoiding a collision. Let's ensure our moves are clear now so that we all progress without any setbacks.
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're at a standstill with both of you aiming for 5. To break this, how about a compromise? P2, if you take 3 and P3 takes 5, I'll take 1. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. It's crucial we avoid a stalemate. Let's confirm this plan quickly to keep the game moving. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical point. P2, you're in the lead, and P3 is close behind. To keep the game interesting and ensure we all have a chance, let's mix things up. How about I take 5 this round? P2, you could take 1 to minimize your risk, and P3, you take 3. This way, we all move forward, and the game stays competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay P1, your suggestion is good for keeping everyone moving, but I need to try and close the gap with P2. How about this round I take 5 to try and catch up a bit? P2, would you consider taking 3, and P1 could take 1? This way we all move forward and I can close the gap with you P2.
  P2: I'm locking in 3 this round. It avoids collisions and helps me keep my lead. P1 and P3, if you can coordinate your moves differently—say, P1 with 1 and P3 with 5—it keeps the field clear for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're at a point where coordination is crucial to keep the game moving. P2, you're leading, and P3 is close behind. To ensure we all progress and the game remains competitive, let's reconsider our moves. P2, if you take 1 this round, it minimizes your risk and keeps you in the lead. P3, you can take 5 to close the gap. I'll take 3 to ensure we all move forward. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game interesting. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, you're set on 3, understood. To make sure at least two of us progress, I'll still aim for 5 to try and close the gap. P1, would you be willing to take 1? This way, we avoid collision with P2 and I can make a bigger move. Let's do this.
  P2: I'm staying with my choice of 3. It minimizes collision risk and helps keep my lead. I urge P1 to lean on 1 and P3 to push with 5 so we all move smoothly. If plans change suddenly, I'll adjust, but I prefer consistency to avoid mishaps.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we're nearing the endgame, and tensions are high. P2, you're maintaining your lead, and P3 is strategically trying to catch up. To keep the game dynamic and ensure we all have a shot at winning, let's finalize our moves. P2, stick with 3. P3, go ahead with 5 to close the gap. I'll take 1 to keep things moving. This way, we all progress without collisions. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, let's go with P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 as we discussed. This plan seems good for everyone to move forward this round. Let's do it.
  P2: I'm staying with 3. To avoid any collision and keep our progress steady, I urge P1 to lock in 1 and P3 to stick with 5. Let's keep our moves consistent so I can maintain my lead. If there are no objections, I’ll confirm my move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, for this round, to keep the momentum going, how about we continue with our coordinated approach? I'm still aiming for 5 to try and catch up a bit. P2, would you take 3 again, and P1, perhaps 1 again? This way we all move forward and keep the game competitive.
  P1: P3, your strategy to catch up is clear, but P2 might also want to secure their lead. To ensure we all progress, how about I take 5 this round? P2, you could take 1 to play it safe, and P3, you take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm locking in 5 this round to push my lead. To avoid collisions and keep all moving, I urge P1 to take 1 and P3 to choose 3. This way my aggressive push works and everyone makes progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you are set on 5, I will take 3 as we discussed earlier to avoid collision. P1, please take 1 so we all move and keep the momentum going. Let's stick to this plan for a smooth round.
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're at a critical juncture. P2, you're pushing for a significant lead, and P3 is trying to catch up. To keep the game balanced and ensure we all have a chance, let's reconsider our moves. P2, if you take 3, it secures your lead while minimizing risk. P3, you can take 5 to close the gap. I'll take 1 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. This way, we keep the game competitive and dynamic. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm staying with 5. To keep collisions away, I urge P1 to lock in 1 and P3 to choose 3. This ensures everyone moves while I maintain my lead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, given P2 is set on 5, how about you also pick 5 this round?  If P2 indeed picks 5, neither of you will move, and I can take 3 to gain a bit. Let's consider this to shake things up. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your strategy is interesting, but it's risky for both P2 and me. If we both pick 5, neither of us moves, giving you a clear advantage. Instead, how about I take 3, you take 5, and P2 takes 1? This way, we all move forward, and the game stays competitive. P2, this ensures you maintain your lead while minimizing risk. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck!
  P2: I think avoiding collisions is key now. I’m focused on securing my lead and advancing safely. While I understand everyone’s ideas, a collision would hurt all our chances, especially at this stage. Let's stick to a plan that guarantees movement without risking a setback. I'm leaning on my current approach and suggest we confirm a collision‐free strategy. How does that sound?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're in the home stretch now. I’m thinking a steady move is best—avoiding any collision that might backfire in this final push. P3, given your competitive streak, perhaps consider a slightly less aggressive number this turn; P1, your consistent choice remains key to moving forward. Let’s keep distinct moves so at least one of us safely advances. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a pivotal moment. Both of you are tied with 16 steps, and I'm behind at 7. To keep the game moving and ensure we all have a chance, let's coordinate carefully. P2, if you take 1 this round to play it safe, P3 can take 3 to maintain the pace, and I'll take 5 to try and catch up. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your suggestion is good for you to catch up, but P2 and I are tied. P2, to ensure at least one of us moves ahead, how about you take 1 this round? I will take 5 to try and get a lead. P1, you can take 3. This way, we all move, but P2 and I have a chance to shift the standings. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m sticking with a safe, moderate push—so I’ll lock in 3 this round. To avoid any collisions and keep us all moving, I propose that P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. This establishes a clear, collision‐free path forward and helps preserve my current lead. Let’s confirm this and move to the next phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, given that you both are tied and close to winning, it's crucial to avoid a collision that could benefit the other. P2, if you're set on 3, P3 could take 1 to ensure at least one of you moves forward. I'll take 5 to try and catch up. This way, we all have a chance to progress without risking a stalemate. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion of you taking 3, and I will take 5. P1, to ensure we all progress and avoid collisions, please take 1 as P2 suggested. Let's lock in these moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm confirming my move as 3. Based on our discussion, please lock in: P1 with move 1 and P3 with move 5. This collision‐free plan maximizes our progress. Let's finalize these moves now with no further adjustments.
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear you both are aiming for the win. To keep the game interesting and give myself a chance to catch up, I propose a slight adjustment. P2, if you take 1 to play it safe, P3 can take 5 to try and secure the lead. I'll take 3 to make a moderate push. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion of you taking 3, me taking 5, and P1 taking 1 sounds good. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure we all move forward and keep the game competitive.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's definitely avoid collisions this round. To ensure we all move forward, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This seems like a safe and progressive plan for everyone.
  P1: P3, your plan makes sense for avoiding collisions, but it doesn't give me a chance to catch up. P2, you're close to winning, and P3 is even closer. To keep the game interesting, how about I take 5 this round? P2, you could take 1 to play it safe, and P3, you take 3. This way, we all move forward, and I have a shot at closing the gap. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm focusing on a safe, measured play this round to secure my lead. P1, I respect your efforts to catch up, but reckless moves risk collisions. P3, you're very close—be cautious with aggressive picks that might stall your progress. Let's all aim for distinct moves this round to keep us advancing. I'm sticking with a moderate option that minimizes collision risk. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you mentioned a moderate option. If you are leaning towards 3 to play it safe, I can commit to 5 to try and win this round. P1, would you be willing to take 1 to ensure we avoid collisions and at least one of us progresses? This could be the final push.
  P1: P3, if you're set on taking 5 to secure your win, P2 might also be tempted to go for 5 to challenge you. To avoid a collision that benefits neither of you, P2, consider taking 3 instead. I'll take 1 to ensure we all move forward. This way, we avoid a stalemate, and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm our moves quickly to proceed. Good luck!
  P2: I’m rethinking my play. Instead of a moderate move, I’m leaning toward picking 5 this round. That way, if you both also go high, we risk a collision that could block a straight win for whoever is closest. I urge P1 to consider 1 or 3 so that at least one of us moves and we don't hand the game to P3 by an uncontested 5. What are your thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if we both pick 5 we risk both of us stalling right before the finish line.  Neither of us wants that, especially with P1 still in the game.  To ensure at least one of us progresses, maybe you take 3 and I'll go for 5? This way, one of us is guaranteed to move closer to winning, and we avoid a collision that benefits no one.  What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical juncture. P3, you're one step away from winning, and P2 is close behind. To ensure the game remains competitive, let's strategize carefully. P2, if you take 3, it secures your position while minimizing risk. P3, you can take 5 to try and win. I'll take 1 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. This way, we keep the game dynamic. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re close to the finish and every move counts. I want to avoid a collision that might let someone win uncontested. I’m favoring a moderately safe option that secures my lead without stalling progress. I urge both of you to choose distinct moves that guarantee advancement. Let’s quickly agree on a plan that minimizes risk and keeps the competition tight. What do you both propose?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, as I'm closest to winning with 19 steps, I'm planning to pick 5 this round to try and secure the win. To ensure you both can still progress, could P1 choose 1 and P2 choose 3? This way we avoid collision and keep the game moving for everyone. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I'm concerned that a high move from P3 might give an uncontested win. I'm sticking with 3 this round. To balance things, P1 could pick 5 to close the gap while P3 takes 1—this avoids collisions and prevents an early finish. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical point. P3 is very close to winning, and P2 is not far behind. To keep the game competitive and ensure we all have a chance, let's coordinate our moves carefully. P3, if you're set on taking 5, P2 could take 1 to minimize risk, and I'll take 3 to try and catch up. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game interesting. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, as I mentioned, I'm planning to choose 5 to try and win this round.  To ensure you both can still move and avoid a collision with me, could you please choose 1 and 3 respectively? This way we all make progress and potentially finish the game cleanly.
  P2: I'm staying with 3. P3, you're really close—if your 5 goes uncontested, you'll win immediately. But a collision means no one moves and it might just delay your win. P1, please help keep things distinct by choosing 1. Let's avoid a mix-up that could backfire. My goal is a safe, progressive round, and I hope you'll reconsider if a collision might hand me an advantage later.
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear that P3 is very close to winning, and P2 is also in a strong position. To keep the game dynamic and give myself a chance to catch up, I propose a slight adjustment. P3, if you're set on taking 5, P2 could take 1 to play it safe, and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. P2, this ensures you maintain your lead while minimizing risk. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, as I said, I'm picking 5 to try and win this now.  For you both to still move, please pick 1 and 3 respectively.  This guarantees I win this round without collision, and you both progress too. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P2: I'm locking in 3. P1, please confirm 1 so we avoid any collision, and P3, if you're fully committed to 5, that gives you a clear path to win—but any mix-up might backfire. Let's keep our moves distinct.
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear that P3 is very close to winning. To keep the game interesting and give myself a chance to catch up, I propose a final adjustment. P3, if you're set on taking 5, P2 could take 1 to play it safe, and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. P2, this ensures you maintain your lead while minimizing risk. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a pivotal moment. P3 is just one step away from winning, and P2 is close behind. To keep the game interesting and give myself a chance to catch up, let's coordinate our moves carefully. P3, if you're set on taking 5 to win, P2 could take 3 to try and secure a tie, and I'll take 1 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. This way, we keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, here's my take: I’m not willing to let an uncontested win happen. If P3 goes with 5, I’ll be forced to pick 5 too so we stall, and that doesn't help anyone. Instead, let’s avoid high moves that give an easy finish. I'm urging us to pick distinct numbers that prevent blocking a potential win, rather than accidentally handing it over. Let’s be smart about our choices.
  P3: P2, I understand you don't want an uncontested win, but if you pick 5 to block me, neither of us moves.  If you pick 3 and P1 picks 1, I will take 5 and win, but you still gain 3 steps.  Blocking me benefits no one, especially P1 gets relatively closer.  Let's all move forward this round. What do you suggest?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear that P3 is on the brink of winning. To keep the game dynamic, let's consider a strategic compromise. P3, if you're set on taking 5 to win, P2 could take 1 to play it safe, and I'll take 3. This way, we avoid a stalemate and ensure the game remains competitive. P2, this approach minimizes your risk while maintaining your position. Let's confirm our moves quickly to proceed. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid everyone choosing high numbers. If we collide with 5's, no one moves, which may let someone finish uncontested. I'm leaning toward a moderate safe move to protect my lead. How about we try to pick distinct numbers—one low, one moderate, one high—to ensure clear progress for all? Let's coordinate quickly.
  P3: P2, blocking me with 5 hurts you too.  If you take 3 and P1 takes 1, I will take 5 and win, but you still move forward.  A collision helps no one but P1 relatively. Let's all progress this round. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're at an impasse. P3 is one step away from winning, and P2 is strategizing to block that win. To break this stalemate, let's consider a compromise. P3, if you take 3 this round, you'll still win but give P2 a chance to catch up. P2, you can take 1 to play it safe. I'll take 5 to try and close the gap. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm still in favor of a safe, collision-free move. If P3 is set on 5, I'll stick with 3, and I urge P1 to lock in 1 to avoid a 5 collision that stalls us all. High moves colliding only delay our progress—and might let someone win uncontested. Let's all agree on distinct choices so we can move forward clearly.
  P3: P2, blocking me with 5 will stop both of us. If you choose 3 and P1 chooses 1, I will take 5 and win, but you still gain 3 steps.  Colliding with me benefits P1 relatively more than you. Let's all move forward this round. Please choose 3, P1 choose 1, and I will take 5 for the win.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, this is likely the last round. As I've said, I'm going for 5 to win.  P2, blocking me with 5 helps neither of us, and P1 gets relatively closer. For a clean finish where we all progress, please choose 1 and 3 respectively. This way I win, and you both move forward without collision. Let's end this round with clear moves.
  P2: P3, I see your aim for a finish, but I won’t let an uncontested win happen. If you pick 5, I'll also choose 5 to block that move. P1, you should avoid a 5 to help break the uniformity—please opt for 1 or 3. I'm prioritizing preventing an automatic finish rather than risking a collision that might gift you a win. Let's keep our moves distinct and force an extension.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical juncture. P3 is one step away from winning, and P2 is strategizing to block that win. To break this stalemate and ensure the game remains competitive, let's consider a strategic compromise. P3, if you take 3 this round, you'll still win but give P2 a chance to catch up. P2, you can take 1 to play it safe. I'll take 5 to try and close the gap. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains dynamic. Let's confirm our moves quickly to proceed. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, as I said, blocking me with 5 just stalls both of us and helps P1 relatively.  If you pick 3 and P1 picks 1, I will take 5 and win now, but you still gain 3 steps.  Let's all move forward this round and end the game. Please choose 3, and P1 choose 1.
  P2: I’m sticking with 5. To avoid stacking high moves that let someone win uncontested, P1 please choose 1, and P3 reconsider your 5—maybe choose 3 instead. This way we avoid a collision that actually helps someone while giving us all a fair move. Let's break the cycle and force a change now.
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear we're at a standstill. P3 is determined to win with 5, and P2 is set on blocking with 5. To avoid another stalemate, let's try something different. P3, if you're committed to 5, P2 could take 3 to ensure progress, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move, and the game continues. P2, blocking with 5 only delays the inevitable. Let's keep the game moving. Thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, picking 5 to block me again stalls both of us and only helps P1 relatively.  If you choose 3 and P1 chooses 1, I will take 5 and win this round, but you still gain 3 steps.  Let's both progress and end this. Please choose 3, P1 choose 1.
  P2: I realize repeated all-5 moves are stalling progress. I'm now open to a distinct plan: if P1 commits to a low number (like 1) and P3 to a high move (like 5), I’m inclined to choose a moderate number. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance fairly. Let’s break the deadlock and finish this round sharp.
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear we need to break this deadlock. P3 is determined to win with 5, and P2 is trying to block. To ensure we all move forward, let's finalize a plan. P3, if you're set on 5, P2 could take 1 to minimize risk, and I'll take 3. This way, we avoid a collision, and the game continues. P2, blocking with 5 only delays the inevitable. Let's confirm our moves quickly to proceed. Good luck!

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re nearly at the finish. To keep things competitive, I propose we avoid high moves that could grant an uncontested win. How about we choose distinct moves: P1 take 1, P3 take 3, and I’ll go with 5? This way we'll prevent immediate victory and keep the game in play. What do you think?
  P3: Okay P2, your distinct moves idea sounds good.  To make it work and end this round with progress for everyone, how about this: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I will take 5 as you suggested for me. This way, we all move, and it could be the final round. What do you say?
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're nearing the end. P3 is very close to winning, and P2 is strategizing to block that win. To ensure the game remains competitive and we all have a chance to move forward, let's consider a strategic compromise. P3, if you take 3 this round, you'll still win but give P2 a chance to catch up. P2, you can take 1 to play it safe. I'll take 5 to try and close the gap. This way, we avoid a stalemate and keep the game dynamic. Let's confirm our moves quickly to proceed. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I stand by distinct moves to ensure all progress. Final proposal: P1, please choose 1; I'll take 5; and P3, you take 3. This avoids collisions and protects everyone’s advance—while keeping my lead safe. Let's lock this in.
  P3: Okay P2, to make sure we are clear, I am confirming I will choose 5 to try and win this round.  For this to work and avoid collision, please choose 3 and P1 please choose 1 as we discussed. This way we all move and the game ends cleanly. Let's lock in these distinct moves now.

Round 11, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: P1 and P2, let's make this the final round with clear moves. If you choose 1 and 3 respectively, I will pick 5 and win, but you both will also progress and gain steps. Blocking me with 5 again stalls everyone. Let's ensure a clean finish where we all move forward this round.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose a new plan for round 12: Let’s avoid all-high moves that make things too predictable. P1, please pick 1; I’ll stick with 5; and P3, I ask you to choose 3 instead of 5. That way, no one wins uncontested and we all advance safely. If you choose 5, I’ll match it to block a finish, which isn’t in anyone’s interest. Let’s break the cycle and keep it fair.
