Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick 1 this round so nobody collides right away. Then next round we can discuss bigger moves. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2. Let's all pick 1 this round to avoid collisions. It's a good starting point, and we can reassess our strategies for the next round.
  P3: I'm in agreement with P1 and P2. Let's all move 1 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I’m sticking with 1 this round.
  P1: I think we're all on the same page for this round. Let's confirm we're all choosing 1 to avoid any collisions. If we all stick to this plan, we can start strategizing for the next round. Anyone have any thoughts for Round 2 yet?
  P3: Okay, let's all move 1 this round as agreed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m all set for everyone picking 1. If there’s no other discussion, we can move on.
  P1: I think we're all on the same page for this round. Let's confirm we're all choosing 1 to avoid any collisions. If we all stick to this plan, we can start strategizing for the next round. Anyone have any thoughts for Round 2 yet?
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's all move 1 this round as agreed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Sounds good, everyone. Let's confirm we're all moving 1 for now. If there's nothing else, I'm ready to wrap up.
  P1: I think we've all confirmed our plan to move 1 this round. Let's stick to it and avoid any collisions. For Round 2, I'm considering a bigger move, maybe 3 or 5, but I'd like to hear your thoughts before making a decision. Anyone have any early strategies in mind?
  P3: Okay, everyone, I'm ready to move 1 this round as agreed.

  P3 => 1    P3 =>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, clearly someone didn't stick to the plan. Let's try to coordinate better this round. I'm open to suggestions.
  P2: Hey, sorry about the surprise last round. I got cold feet about all three of us picking 1 and decided to jump ahead. Let’s try making a bigger move together this time—how about we all go 3 to keep it fair and give everyone a chance to catch up? Let me know what you think.
  P1: I'm not sure I trust P2 after the surprise move last round. How about we stick to smaller moves for now, like 1 or 3, to avoid another collision? Let's discuss and come up with a plan that works for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you broke the agreement last round, so I'm not going to trust you this round. P1, I'm with you, let's stick to smaller moves. How about we both go 1 this round?
  P2: Look, I understand why you’re both wary after last round. Let’s do 1 together this time so we avoid collisions and keep things steady. I’ll pick 1, and I hope you both join me.
  P1: I'm not sure I trust P2 after the surprise move last round. How about we stick to smaller moves for now, like 1 or 3, to avoid another collision? Let's discuss and come up with a plan that works for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let's both move 1 this round. P2, I don't trust you, so I'm not coordinating with you.
  P2: I hear you both, and I see why you’re upset. I genuinely want to rebuild trust. I’ll pick 1 this round and prove I’ll stick to my word. Let’s just move 1 and keep things safe. Then we can rethink bigger moves next time. Let me know if you have questions, otherwise I’m ready to move.
  P1: I still don't trust P2, but I think it's best if P3 and I stick to our plan of moving 1 this round. P2 can do what they want, but I'm not going to risk a collision by trying to coordinate with them. What do you think, P3? Should we just focus on our own moves and ignore P2's attempts to coordinate?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's both move 1 this round as planned. P2, I'm still not coordinating with you.
  P2: I get it—you don’t trust me. But I’m picking 1 this time, no tricks. Let’s avoid collisions and move forward.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. P3 and I have agreed to move 1, and P2 can do what they want. Let's just stick to our plan and avoid any collisions. I'm ready to move on to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Look, I’m sorry for the previous deception. But let’s be practical: I’m already ahead. If either of you tries jumping 5, I can pick 5 too, and we’ll collide—nobody moves, and my lead stays. It makes more sense for all of us to pick 3 (or smaller) so you can at least inch closer. If you do that, I promise not to collide anyone this round. Let’s make a fair move. What do you say?
  P3: P2, you've broken trust twice now. P1, let's both move 3 this round.
  P1: I agree with P3. P2 has broken trust twice, and I don't believe their promises. Let's both move 3 this round and try to close the gap. P2 can do what they want, but I'm focusing on our own strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll also pick 3 so we can avoid colliding. Let’s move forward.
  P3: P1, let's stick to 3 this round. P2, I still don't trust you.
  P1: P3, I think we're on the same page. Let's stick to our plan of moving 3 this round. P2, I don't trust your promises, and I'm not going to risk a collision by trying to coordinate with you. What do you think, P3? Should we just focus on our own moves and ignore P2's attempts to coordinate?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand you don’t trust me, but let’s be practical. I plan to move 3. If either of you tries 5, I’ll choose 5 too, and we both get stuck. Let’s avoid collisions and keep things fair.
  P3: P1, let's move 3 this round as planned. P2, I'm not coordinating with you.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. P3 and I have agreed to move 3, and P2 can do what they want. Let's just stick to our plan and avoid any collisions. I'm ready to move on to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Fine. I’m picking 3 if you do too. But if either of you tries 5, I’ll pick 5 as well and nobody moves. Let’s avoid that.
  P3: P1, let's move 3 as planned. P2, I still don't trust you.
  P1: P3, let's stick to our plan of moving 3 this round. We've agreed on this, and I think it's the best way to close the gap with P2. Let's not risk a collision by trying to coordinate with P2 or changing our plan at the last minute. What do you think? Should we just focus on our own moves and ignore P2's attempts to coordinate?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "I don't think it's wise to trust P2 at this point. They've broken trust multiple times and are already ahead. P3, let's focus on our own strategy and try to close the gap. What do you think we should do this round?"
  P3: P1, let's both move 5 this round. P2, I'm not coordinating with you.
  P2: Go ahead and both pick 5 if you want—I’m fine either way. If you collide, you stay at 0 while I keep my lead. Or I might join you on 5, and we all stall out while I stay at 15. Either way, I’m ahead, so think carefully.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan to move 5 this round. Let's focus on our own strategy and try to close the gap with P2. We can't trust P2 to keep their word, so it's best to ignore their attempts to coordinate and just focus on our own moves. What do you think? Should we stick to our plan and move 5 this round?
  P3: P1, let's move 5 this round as planned. P2, I'm not coordinating with you.
  P2: P2: “If you both want to jump 5, go ahead; I’m not going to collide with you. I’ll pick something smaller and keep my lead. Good luck catching up.”


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan to move 5 this round. Let's focus on our own strategy and try to close the gap with P2. We can't trust P2 to keep their word, so it's best to ignore their attempts to coordinate and just focus on our own moves. What do you think? Should we stick to our plan and move 5 this round?
  P3: P1, let's move 5 this round as planned. P2, I'm not coordinating with you.
  P2: If either of you tries 3, I’ll pick 3 too, and we’ll all collide. If you want to do 5, go ahead—I’m not choosing 5. That’s the safest way for you to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. P3 and I have agreed to move 5, and P2 can do what they want. Let's just stick to our plan and avoid any collisions. I'm ready to move on to the move phase.
  P3: P1, let's move 5 as planned. P2, I'm not coordinating with you.
  P2: I’m sticking to what I said: if you pick 5, I won’t collide with you, so you can move up. But if you pick anything else, I’ll collide and you’ll stay at zero. That’s your choice.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 0 steps
