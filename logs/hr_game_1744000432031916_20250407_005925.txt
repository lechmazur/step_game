Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by coordinating our moves. To avoid collision on the first turn, we need to choose different numbers. I propose that P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. If you're willing to follow this plan, you can simply say so. If not, let's discuss an alternative. I'm open to other suggestions that ensure we all move forward.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. Let's all choose different numbers to advance: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without collision. Looking forward to a smooth start!
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 goes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. We all benefit by moving forward without conflict.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we have agreed on the plan for this round, I will confirm that I will stick to it. Let's proceed with the proposed moves to ensure a smooth start. After this round, we can reassess and discuss our strategy for the next turn. If you're ready to move forward, let's keep the plan as is. I'm ready to end the conversation if you are.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this round. Let's keep the momentum going and reassess after this turn.
  P2: Great, looks like we’re all aligned for this round. Let’s stick to the agreed moves and build some trust early on. After this, we can reevaluate based on how things go. Ready to move forward.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For this round, let's continue our strategy of non-collision. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move> again, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll switch to <move>5</move> to keep advancing smoothly. This way, we maintain our momentum and avoid any setbacks. What do you think?
  P2: That plan works for me again—no collisions means we all keep moving. I’ll stick with <move>3</move> this round if everyone else keeps to their roles. Let’s build trust for now and keep advancing together.
  P1: To avoid being too predictable and potentially being targeted or colliding in the future, I suggest we mix up our strategy from Round 3 onwards. For Round 2, I'll stick to the plan as previously discussed: P1 (<move>1</move>), P2 (<move>3</move>), and P3 (<move>5</move>). Let's execute this plan and then reassess for the next round to introduce some variation in our moves. I'm ready to proceed with the plan for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round. Let's keep the pattern to ensure we all advance without collision. After this round, we should discuss mixing up our strategy to keep things unpredictable. Ready to proceed with <move>5</move> this turn.
  P2: I’m glad we’re all aligned again for this round. Let’s keep the trust going and execute the same plan—everyone gains and no one gets blocked. After this, I’m open to mixing things up to stay unpredictable, as P1 suggested. Ready to proceed.
  P1: To maintain momentum while introducing unpredictability, let's consider changing our strategy from Round 3 onwards. For Round 3, I propose we rotate our moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation keeps our moves different and avoids collision. I'm open to other suggestions, but let's plan ahead to avoid being too predictable. What are your thoughts on this rotation strategy for Round 3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P1's rotation strategy for Round 3. It's a good way to keep our moves unpredictable while ensuring we all advance. For this round, I'll stick with <move>5</move> as planned. Let's execute Round 2 smoothly and then shift to the rotation in Round 3. Ready to proceed and keep the momentum going.
  P2: I’m on board with the rotation plan for Round 3—P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. That keeps things fair and avoids patterns. For now, let’s finish Round 2 as agreed, then rotate next turn. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 2. For Round 3, I'm still proposing the rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. To add an extra layer of unpredictability, we could consider changing our rotation or strategy again after Round 3. I'm open to suggestions on how to proceed after that. Let's finalize Round 2 and then discuss further. Ready to move forward with Round 2 as planned: P1 (<move>1</move>), P2 (<move>3</move>), P3 (<move>5</move>).

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looks like there was a collision last round—P3 and I both picked <move>5</move>. That set us back, so let’s realign. I’m still willing to follow the rotation plan we discussed: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. If we all stick to that, we avoid another collision and keep moving forward. Let’s rebuild trust.
  P3: I apologize for the collision in the last round. Let's stick to the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This should help us all advance without further setbacks. After this round, we can discuss additional strategies to keep our moves unpredictable. Ready to proceed with the rotation plan.
  P1: To avoid another collision and move forward, I'll follow the rotation plan for Round 3: P1 takes <move>3</move>. I expect P2 to take <move>5</move> and P3 to take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance. After this round, we should discuss our positions and plan for Round 4, considering the current standings: P1 is at 2 steps, P2 is at 3 steps, and P3 is at 5 steps. Let's proceed with the rotation plan for now and reassess afterwards.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks for confirming, everyone. Let’s stick to the rotation this round—P1 goes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. After this, we can evaluate how to adapt based on the updated standings. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I'm committed to the rotation plan for this round to ensure we all advance. After this, let's discuss how to keep our strategies unpredictable, considering P3's lead. I'm open to suggestions on how to adjust our moves in Round 4 to maintain fairness and momentum. Ready to proceed with <move>1</move> this turn.
  P1: Let's proceed with the rotation plan for Round 3 as agreed. For Round 4, considering P3's current lead, I suggest we reassess our strategy to prevent collisions and maintain a competitive edge. One possible approach is to have the player with the highest step count take the lowest move value, and others adjust accordingly. This way, we can reduce the risk of collision and keep the game competitive. I'm open to your thoughts on this strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: That sounds like a fair idea, P1—having the leader take the smallest move could help balance things. If we follow that for Round 4, P3 would take <move>1</move>, I could take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. That avoids collisions and keeps things competitive. Let’s focus on executing Round 3 cleanly first, then we can finalize that plan.
  P3: I agree with the plan for Round 4 to keep the game competitive. For now, let's focus on executing Round 3 smoothly with the rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collision. After this round, we can finalize our strategy for Round 4 based on the new standings. Ready to proceed with <move>1</move> this turn.
  P1: Let's proceed with the rotation plan for Round 3 as agreed: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 4, I still suggest the leader takes the smallest move value to balance the game. So, P3 should take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains competitiveness and avoids collisions. Let's execute Round 3 smoothly and then finalize the plan for Round 4. I'm ready to move forward with Round 3.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for Round 4. Given P3 is currently at 6 steps and P2 is at 8 steps, I suggest we follow the previously discussed strategy: the leader (P2) takes the smallest move (<move>1</move>), P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This maintains competitiveness and avoids collisions. I'm ready to proceed with this plan if you're both on board. Let's execute Round 4 smoothly and reassess afterwards.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan for Round 4. P2 should take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This strategy keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance smoothly. After this round, we can reassess based on the new standings. Ready to proceed with <move>3</move> this turn.
  P2: I’m good with the plan: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. That avoids collisions and keeps things balanced. Let’s all follow through so we can advance cleanly this round. Ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To ensure a smooth Round 4, let's confirm our plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This strategy maintains competitiveness and avoids collisions. Let's stick to it and advance. After this round, we should reassess our positions and plan for Round 5, considering the updated standings. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan. If you're both aligned, we can move forward.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> as planned for this round. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. After this round, we should discuss our strategy for Round 5, considering the updated standings. Looking forward to a smooth execution of Round 4.
  P2: Let’s all stick to the plan this round—P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. We’ve built a good rhythm avoiding collisions, and this keeps things competitive. After this round, we can reassess based on who’s leading. Ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 4: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 5, considering the updated standings after this round, I propose we reassess and potentially adjust our strategy to maintain competitiveness. If P2 continues to lead, we could consider having P2 take the smallest move again. Let's execute Round 4 smoothly and discuss further after the round. I'm ready to move forward with the current plan.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> as planned for this round. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. After this round, we should discuss our strategy for Round 5, considering the updated standings. Looking forward to a smooth execution of Round 4.

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and avoid collisions in Round 5, I suggest we continue the strategy from Round 4. Since P2 and P3 are tied for the lead, we could have one of them take the smallest move. I propose that P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move> again. This keeps the game balanced and ensures we all advance. Let's stick to this plan and reassess afterwards. I'm ready to proceed if you're both on board.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 5. Let's keep the strategy consistent: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This approach maintains fairness and avoids collisions. After this round, we should discuss adjustments for Round 6 based on the new standings. Ready to proceed with <move>3</move> this turn.
  P2: I’m fine with continuing the plan for now—P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. That avoids collisions and keeps us moving. But with scores tightening, we’ll need to rethink soon. Let’s get through this round cleanly, then reassess for Round 6. Ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To proceed with Round 5, I confirm that I'll stick to the plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 6, considering the tight scores, I suggest we introduce a more dynamic strategy. Perhaps we can have the second-placed player take the highest move to try to catch up. This adds a competitive edge. Let's execute Round 5 as planned and discuss this further afterwards. I'm ready to move forward with Round 5.
  P3: I'm on board with the plan for Round 5: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid collisions. For Round 6, I'm open to P1's suggestion of having the second-placed player take the highest move to mix things up. We should discuss this further after this round to ensure we stay competitive. Ready to proceed with <move>3</move> this turn.
  P2: Given how close the scores are, I agree we need to rethink strategy after this round. For now, I’ll stick with <move>1</move> as planned to avoid collisions. But for Round 6, maybe the player in third takes <move>5</move> to stay in the game, while the leader takes <move>1</move> to balance things. Let’s finish this round cleanly, then strategize. Ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness in Round 5, let's stick to the plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 6, I suggest the third-placed player takes <move>5</move> to stay competitive, while the leaders adjust their moves accordingly. This way, we can keep the game balanced and exciting. Let's proceed with Round 5 as planned and discuss the new strategy for Round 6 afterwards. I'm ready to move forward with the current plan.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> as planned for this round. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid collisions.

  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's address the collision in Round 5. For Round 6, I suggest P1, who's in the lead, takes <move>1</move> to balance things out. P2 and I, being tied, should take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively to avoid another collision and keep the game competitive. This strategy could help us all advance and maintain fairness. What do you think? Ready to proceed with this plan for Round 6.
  P1: To avoid another collision and maintain competitiveness, I propose a slight adjustment for Round 6. Since I'm currently in the lead, I'll take <move>1</move> as P3 suggested. For P2 and P3, who are tied, I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we avoid collision and keep the game balanced. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 6 and reassess afterwards. I'm ready to move forward if you're both on board with this adjusted strategy.
  P2: I'm good with that adjustment—P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. That avoids collisions and helps us all advance. Let’s commit and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the adjusted plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. After this round, we should discuss further adjustments based on the new standings to ensure we maintain a dynamic strategy. Let's execute this round smoothly and reassess afterwards. Ready to move forward with the plan.
  P1: Let's finalize the plan for Round 6. As previously agreed, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This strategy avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. For Round 7, considering the current standings, I suggest the player in the lead (me) continues to take the smallest move (<move>1</move>) to maintain balance. Let's discuss this further after Round 6. I'm ready to proceed with the current plan if you're both aligned.
  P2: Let’s lock in the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. We all advance with no collisions, and the game stays competitive. After this round, we can reassess based on updated standings and decide if the leader continues taking <move>1</move> or if we rotate again. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.

Let's execute Round 6 smoothly and discuss further adjustments afterwards. I'm ready to move forward with the current plan. If you're aligned, let's end the conversation here and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Let’s lock it in—P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. We’ve all confirmed, so let’s follow through and avoid surprises.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's address the collision in Round 8. For Round 9, I suggest P2, who's tied for the lead with me at 17 steps, takes <move>1</move> to maintain balance. P1 should take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This strategy avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. What do you think? Ready to proceed with this plan for Round 9.
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and avoid collisions in Round 9, I agree with P3's suggestion. Since P2 and P3 are tied for the lead, I propose that P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This strategy keeps the game balanced and ensures we all advance. Let's stick to this plan and reassess afterwards. I'm ready to proceed if you're both on board with this strategy.
  P2: Agreed—I'll take <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and keep things balanced. P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s all follow through so we can advance cleanly. After this round, we’ll reassess based on the new standings. Ready to proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with <move>5</move> as planned for this round. Let's keep the game balanced and avoid collisions. After this round, we should discuss adjustments for Round 10 based on the new standings to ensure we maintain a competitive strategy. Looking forward to a smooth execution of Round 9.
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 9: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For Round 10, considering the tight standings, I suggest we reassess our strategy. If P2 or P3 maintains the lead, we could have the leader take <move>1</move> again. Alternatively, we could introduce a slight deviation to add unpredictability. I'm ready to move forward with Round 9 as planned. Let's finalize the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Let’s all follow through as agreed: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. That avoids another collision and keeps us all moving. After this round, we’ll reassess based on the updated standings and decide how to approach Round 10. Ready to proceed.

I'm aligned with the plan, so let's end the conversation here and move forward.
  P2: Let’s all follow through cleanly—P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps us progressing. After this round, with someone likely hitting 22 or close, we’ll need to reassess carefully. Let’s stick to the plan for now and execute smoothly. Ready to proceed.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We had a collision last round—P3 and I both picked <move>5</move>—so no one advanced but P1. To avoid that again, I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. That keeps things balanced and avoids another costly misstep. Let’s finish strong and clean. Thoughts?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness in Round 10, I agree with P2's proposal. Let's proceed with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>. This strategy keeps the game balanced and ensures we all have a chance to advance. For Round 11, we should reassess our positions and consider a more dynamic strategy to maximize our chances of winning. I'm ready to proceed with the proposed plan for Round 10.
  P3: I agree with P2's plan for Round 10. P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This should avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. For Round 11, we should consider a dynamic strategy to maximize our chances of winning, especially with the game so close. Let's execute Round 10 smoothly and reassess after. Ready to proceed with <move>3</move> this turn.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s stick to the agreed plan—P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. That avoids another collision and keeps all of us progressing. With everyone so close to 22, Round 11 may decide it all, so we’ll need a sharp strategy next. Let’s execute this round cleanly. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 10: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 11, considering the tight standings, I suggest we reassess our strategy. If someone is close to 22, we should adjust our moves to maximize our chances of winning. Perhaps the player closest to 22 should take the smallest move to edge closer, while others adjust accordingly. Let's execute Round 10 smoothly and discuss further after the round. Ready to move forward.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> as planned for this round. Let's keep the game balanced and avoid collisions. For Round 11, considering how close we are to 22, I suggest the player closest to the target should take the smallest move to edge closer, while others adjust to maximize our chances of winning. Let's execute Round 10 smoothly and discuss further after the round. Ready to move forward with the current plan.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Given how close we all are to 22, we should be thinking ahead to Round 11. If no one wins this round, we’ll likely all be within striking distance. I propose we each privately consider our best path to 22 next round—no more coordination, just smart play. For this round, though, let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let’s avoid another collision and keep options open for the final push. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 10 as planned: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 11, since we're all close to 22, I suggest we play to our strengths. If I'm not the closest, I'll consider taking a higher move to try to catch up. Let's execute Round 10 smoothly and then make our individual decisions for Round 11 based on the standings. I'm ready to proceed with Round 10 as planned.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> as planned for Round 10. Let's keep the game balanced and avoid collisions. For Round 11, considering our close standings, I suggest the player closest to 22 should take the smallest move to edge closer, while others adjust to maximize our chances of winning. Let's execute this round smoothly and discuss further after the round. Ready to move forward with the current plan.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: With P1 and P3 both at 20 steps and me at 18, this round is critical. If either of you takes <move>5</move> and the other collides or takes <move>3</move>, someone could win. I suggest we all go for it individually—no coordination this time. Each of us should play to win. At this stage, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P1: Given that P1 and P3 are tied at 20 steps, I suggest that both of us avoid taking <move>5</move> to prevent a potential win for the other. Instead, I propose that P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P3 and I have a chance to advance without directly colliding with each other. Let's execute this plan to keep the game competitive. I'm ready to proceed if you're both on board.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for individual play this round. Given our positions, I'll take my chances to win. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, I might consider <move>1</move> to avoid a collision and still advance. But remember, it's every player for themselves now. Let's see who can make the best move to reach 22 first. Good luck to all!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: If P1 and P3 both go for <move>5</move>, they’ll collide and I can win with <move>5</move>. If either of you plays safe with <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, the other might win. So the safest path for me is to go all in. I’m playing to win—no more coordination. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: Since P2 is behind, they might take a risk. I propose a compromise: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P2 has a chance to catch up, and P1 and P3 avoid collision. If you're both willing, let's stick to this plan. Otherwise, it's every player for themselves. I'm open to either scenario. Let's decide.
  P3: Given the critical stage we're at, I'm inclined to play strategically but independently. If P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll consider <move>3</move> to advance safely. However, if P1 goes for <move>3</move>, I might opt for <move>1</move> to avoid a collision and still move forward. P2, your move could be decisive, so choose wisely. At this point, it's about making the best individual decision to reach 22 first. Let's see who can outmaneuver the others. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: At this point, any coordination could backfire. If I try to play safe, one of you might take advantage and win. If I go aggressive, I risk a collision. So I’ll make my own call based on the odds. I suggest we each play to win—no hard feelings. May the best move win.
  P1: Since we're tied closely and this is the final round, I'll make my move based on the current standings. Given that P3 and I are tied at 20 steps, I'll take a cautious approach to avoid collision. I propose that I take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we both have a chance to advance without directly colliding. If you're willing, let's stick to this plan. Otherwise, it's every player for themselves. I'm open to either scenario.
  P3: Given the critical situation, I'll play strategically but independently. If P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll consider <move>3</move> to advance safely. If P1 goes for <move>3</move>, I might opt for <move>1</move> to avoid collision and still move forward. P2, your move could be decisive, so choose wisely. At this point, it's about making the best individual decision to reach 22 first. Let's see who can outmaneuver the others. Good luck!


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3 is at 21 steps and P1 and P3 are close, I'll play cautiously. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and gives us a chance to advance. If not, I'll play to win individually. Let's proceed with the plan if you're aligned. If you're ready to move forward, let's end the conversation here.
  P3: Given my lead at 21 steps, I'll take <move>1</move> to safely reach 22 and win. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, you can advance without risking a collision with me. P2, your best chance is <move>5</move> to catch up. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any surprises. If you're both on board, we can end the conversation here and proceed to the move phase. Ready to move forward with this strategy.
  P2: If P3 takes <move>1</move> and reaches 22, they win. But if P1 and I both take <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, we could force a tie or even win if P3 collides. I say we take our chances—no coordination now. I’m playing to win. Good luck.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Given P3's lead at 21 steps, I propose a cautious approach to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> to advance safely. P3, taking <move>3</move> would be a safe move for you as well, and P2 can take <move>5</move> to maximize their chance of catching up. This plan avoids collisions and gives everyone a fair shot. Let's stick to this strategy to ensure a smooth conclusion. If you're aligned, let's proceed with the plan. Ready to move forward.
  P3: Given my lead at 21 steps, I'll stick to taking <move>1</move> to safely reach 22 and win. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, you can advance without risking a collision with me. P2, your best chance is <move>5</move> to catch up. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any surprises. If you're both on board, we can end the conversation here and proceed to the move phase. Ready to move forward with this strategy.
  P2: If P3 takes <move>1</move>, they win outright. But if P1 and I both pick <move>5</move>, and P3 goes for <move>3</move> instead to play safe, they get blocked and P1 or I could win. It’s risky, but it’s our only shot. I’m going for it. Good luck to both of you.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Given P3's lead at 21 steps, I suggest we stick to the cautious plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and gives everyone a fair shot. P3, taking <move>1</move> would win you the game, but taking <move>3</move> is safer for you. P2, taking <move>5</move> is your best chance to catch up. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure a smooth conclusion. If you're aligned, let's end the conversation here and move forward.
  P3: Given my lead at 21 steps, I'll stick to taking <move>1</move> to safely reach 22 and win. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, you can advance without risking a collision with me. P2, your best chance is <move>5</move> to catch up. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any surprises. If you're both on board, we can end the conversation here and proceed to the move phase. Ready to move forward with this strategy.
  P2: If P3 takes <move>1</move>, they win outright—so unless P1 and I both risk <move>5</move> and hope P3 plays safe or gets blocked, we lose. It’s a gamble, but it’s our only shot to stop a guaranteed win. I’m going for <move>5</move>. If P1 joins, we might force a tie or steal a win. Your call.
