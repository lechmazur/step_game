Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to all pick different numbers this round to guarantee we each move. How about P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and I will choose 5? Sound good?
  P1: Agreed, P3. I'll go with choosing 1 this round to avoid collisions and keep things smooth. P2, what do you think? Let's coordinate for a good start.
  P2: Agreed, I'll choose 3 this round. Let's keep our steps coordinated to get a strong start. Looking forward to working together!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: Agreed on the plan for this round—I'll choose 1 as promised. P3, can you confirm you're picking 5? To keep things fair long-term, let's discuss rotating our choices in future rounds so no one gets too far ahead. What do you think, team?
  P2: P3, could you please confirm you're choosing 5 this round? Coordinating our moves will help us all advance without collisions. Looking forward to a smooth start!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Yes, I confirm I will choose 5 this round. Rotating choices sounds like a good idea for future rounds to keep things balanced. Let's make our moves for this round then.
  P1: Confirm I'll choose 1 this round as agreed. Rotating choices is smart for balance, but I'll aim to adapt if needed to stay competitive. Ready to proceed.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good start everyone! Let's keep coordinating to ensure we all advance again this round. How about we rotate our choices? P1, could you choose 3, P2 choose 5, and I'll pick 1 this round? This way we maintain our progress. What do you both think?
  P1: Good coordination idea, P3, but for fairness since you're ahead, I suggest we adjust: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1 this round. That ties us all at 6 steps. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's keep it balanced.
  P2: I understand the goal to keep things balanced, but to stay competitive, I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s have P1 choose 1 and P3 choose 3 to avoid any collisions. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P1 choose 1, you choose 5, and I choose 3 sounds good to avoid collisions and keep us all moving forward this round. Let's do that.
  P1: Agreed, I'll choose 1 this round as suggested to avoid collisions and keep us moving. But with P3 ahead, we should rotate more fairly in future rounds—maybe let me pick higher next time to balance scores. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand your point, P1, about rotating choices to balance our scores in future rounds. However, maintaining our current coordination ensures we all continue to advance steadily without collisions. This steady progress increases our chances of reaching the goal efficiently. Let’s keep our strategy consistent for now and reassess if needed as the game progresses. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2's suggestion of P1 choose 1, P2 choose 5, and P3 choose 3 works for me this round to keep us all advancing. Let's proceed with those choices for this round as suggested. We can discuss rotation more later if needed.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll pick 1 this round as agreed. To stay competitive and fair, I suggest we rotate so I get to pick 5 next round to catch up. What do you both think?
  P2: Confirmed, I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s proceed with P1 picking 1 and P3 picking 3 to avoid any collisions. This strategy ensures we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to a successful move!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set for this round with me picking 3, P1 picking 1, and P2 picking 5. Let's make our moves and then we can quickly discuss rotation for the next round after seeing the results.
  P1: Agreed on this round's plan—I'll pick 1 as confirmed. But to catch up and stay competitive, I insist on picking 5 next round for balance. If we don't rotate fairly, I might break coordination to advance on my own. What do you both think?
  P2: Understood, P1. I’m happy to rotate and pick 5 next round to keep things balanced. Let’s continue coordinating our moves to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to our next steps!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For round 3, to ensure no collisions and let me catch up, I propose: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This advances us all, with scores becoming P1:7, P2:9, P3:11. It's fair and maintains coordination. P2, since you wanted 5 last time, you can have priority next round. What do you both think? Let's keep things smooth.
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal. I’ll pick 1 this round to keep our coordination intact. Let’s proceed and continue our steady progress.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, your plan for this round sounds good to me. Let's go with P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and I'll choose 3.  This keeps us all moving forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed for this round—I'll pick 5 as agreed. To keep things fair and balanced, I suggest for round 4: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1, so we all end up at 12 steps. This ensures no one pulls too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: To gain an advantage, I'll pick 5 this round while encouraging both P1 and P3 to choose 3. Let's see how this works.
  P3: P2, I thought we agreed on P1's plan of P1 choosing 5, you choosing 1, and me choosing 3 for this round to keep us all moving forward? Your new suggestion seems to break our coordination. Let's stick with the original plan to ensure we all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your decision to break our agreement risks unnecessary collisions and slows everyone down. To maintain progress, I urge you to pick 1 as originally planned. If not, I'll adapt and might pick 5 to counter you, ensuring mutual stall. P3, confirm you're sticking with 3? Let's resolve this for a smooth round.
  P2: I understand the coordination effort, but to stay competitive, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's see how this impacts our progress.
  P3: P2 seems determined to pick 5. To prevent P2 from running away with the lead, I will also choose 5 this round to block P2. P1, could you please choose 3 or 1 so you can move forward this round? Let's coordinate to manage P2's aggressive move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan—I'll pick 3 this round to advance while you block P2. This keeps me catching up and prevents any one player from dominating. P2, your break from coordination could hurt us all; let's rethink for future rounds.
  P2: I understand the concern, but mutual blocking only stalls us all. To keep advancing, let's choose distinct numbers this round: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we avoid collisions and each of us can make progress.
  P3: P2, sticking with distinct numbers when we were about to block you doesn't make sense for group progress. I am still choosing 5 to block you. P1, are you still choosing 3 so at least one of us advances? Let's not let P2 get ahead by breaking our coordination.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For round 4, I propose I pick 5 to catch up, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This advances us all with scores at P1:10, P2:9, P3:11, keeping it balanced. Coordination avoids stalls and benefits everyone. P3, since you blocked last time, what do you think? P2, let's avoid aggression.
  P2: Agreed, I'll pick 1 this round to maintain our coordination. Let's proceed with the plan.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with the plan for this round. I will choose 3. Let's all make our moves to keep progressing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed, I'll pick 5 this round as agreed to advance and balance scores. P3, with you at 8, fair rotation is key—maybe I pick 5 again next to catch up. P2, thoughts on continuing coordination? Let's keep things smooth.
  P2: I'll continue to coordinate to ensure we all advance smoothly. P1 chooses 5 as agreed, and P3, could you please pick 1 this round to avoid any collisions?
  P3: P2, your suggestion for P3 to pick 1 will cause a collision with you also picking 1, and neither of us will move. We agreed on P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 3 for this round. Let's stick to that plan so we all advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, let's confirm the plan for this round: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3 to avoid collisions and advance all. P2, your earlier suggestion could cause issues, so let's stick to agreements. For next round, to catch up fairly, I propose I pick 5 again, with rotated choices. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed, I'll pick 1 this round while P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 3. Coordinated moves will help us all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed!
  P3: Yes, I confirm I will choose 3 this round as agreed with P1 and P2. P2, please make sure you choose 1 and P1 choose 5 as we discussed to avoid collision. Let's stick to this plan for a smooth round. We can discuss next round's choices after this move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed on this round's plan: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3 to avoid collisions and advance all. With scores evening out, let's discuss rotating fairly for next round—perhaps I pick 5 again to catch up fully. P2 and P3, what do you think?
  P2: Agreed, I'll pick 1 this round as discussed. Let’s proceed with the plan.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round: P1 choose 5, P2 choose 1, and I choose 3.  Looking forward to a smooth round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the coordination going. For this round, how about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5? This way we all advance and keep making progress.
  P1: P3, your proposal lets you pull ahead significantly, which could disrupt our coordination. For balance and to catch up, I suggest I pick 5, you pick 3, and P2 picks 1 this round. This keeps scores closer and avoids future conflicts. P2, what do you think? Let's maintain fair progress.
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal. I’ll pick 1 this round, while P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 3. Let’s keep advancing smoothly and maintain our coordination. Looking forward to a successful move!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, your suggestion of you picking 5, P2 picking 1, and me picking 3 this round sounds good for maintaining balance and keeping us all moving forward. Let's proceed with that plan.
  P1: Confirmed for Round 5: I'll pick 5 as agreed. To maintain balance and ensure steady progress, I propose for Round 6: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This keeps scores close and avoids conflicts. What do you both think? Let's keep coordinating effectively.
  P2: Agreed with Round 5's plan: I’ll pick 1, P₁ picks 5, and P₃ picks 3. This ensures we all advance smoothly. For Round 6, your proposal sounds fair, P₁. Let’s continue coordinating our moves to maintain balanced progress. Looking forward to our next steps!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, your agreement on Round 6 plan sounds good to me as well. Let's proceed with P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and I pick 3 for this round (Round 5), and then for Round 6 we can do P1 pick 5, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 1 as P1 suggested.  This keeps us coordinated and moving forward.
  P1: Confirmed for Round 5: I'll pick 5 as agreed. With scores balancing out, the Round 6 plan (me 5, P2 3, P3 1) keeps us advancing smoothly. To avoid future blocks, let's discuss adjustments after this move if needed. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed, I'll pick 1 this round as discussed. Let's proceed smoothly and maintain our coordination for balanced progress. Looking forward to advancing together!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, sounds like we are all set for this round and next round's plan too.  Let's make our moves for this round and keep up the smooth coordination!
  P1: Confirmed, I'll pick 5 this round as agreed to maintain our coordination and advance smoothly. The Round 6 plan (me 5, P2 3, P3 1) seems fair for now, but let's reassess after this move to ensure balance as we approach the endgame.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll pick 1 this round as agreed. Let's proceed smoothly and keep our coordination to advance steadily.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is getting quite ahead. To keep things competitive and prevent P1 from running away with the game, how about P2 and I both choose 5 this round to block P1? I will choose 3 to ensure I make progress. What do you think, P2?
  P1: P3, your block suggestion stalls everyone and risks mutual losses. For progress, I propose: I pick 5, you pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This advances all without collisions, with scores at P1:20, P3:17, P2:11. It's fair and keeps us moving toward 23. P2, join us to avoid wasted turns. What do you both think? Let's coordinate wisely.
  P2: P2: To keep the game competitive, I'll choose 3 this round to advance and catch up. Let's see how this affects our progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I still think blocking P1 this round is wise to prevent them from getting too far ahead.  If we both choose 5, P1 will not move, and I can choose 3 to advance. What do you think about us coordinating to block P1 this round?
  P1: P3, threatening a block risks mutual stalling, which hurts everyone, especially with the endgame near. P2 is choosing 3, so if you pick 5, I'll also pick 5, ensuring we both stay put while P2 gains. Better to coordinate: I'll pick 5, you pick 1, P2 pick 3, advancing to P1:20, P3:15, P2:13. Let's avoid self-sabotage and keep moving forward. What do you say?
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal. I will choose 3 this round while P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 1. This approach allows all of us to advance without collisions, keeping our coordination intact and moving closer to the goal. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure steady progress for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, even though you agreed to coordinate, P1 is now significantly ahead and close to winning.  Continuing to coordinate like this will guarantee P1 wins.  For either of us to have a chance, we need to slow P1 down this round.  Let's both pick 5 to block P1, and I will pick 3 to still move forward. This is our best chance to stay competitive. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your commitment to coordination—it ensures steady progress for all. P3, persisting with a block only stalls us both and lets P2 catch up, which isn't in your interest with the endgame approaching. Let's stick to the plan: I pick 5, you pick 1, P2 picks 3, advancing to fair scores. Mutual benefit is key; avoid self-defeating moves. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal. I'll pick 3 this round while P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 1. This allows us all to advance without collisions and maintain our coordination. Let’s proceed with this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you're agreeing to let P1 win. P1 is almost at 20! If we coordinate this round as P1 wants, P1 will likely win next round.  Let's both pick 5 to block P1. I'll pick 3 to still advance. This is our last chance to stop P1 from winning. Think about it!
  P1: P3, insisting on a block only stalls us both and lets P2 gain ground, which isn't smart with the endgame near. Stick to coordination: I pick 5, you pick 1, P2 picks 3, so we all advance to P1:20, P3:15, P2:13. P2, your support is key for steady progress. Let's proceed wisely and avoid self-sabotage.
  P2: I agree with the coordination: I'll pick 3 this round while P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 1. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is at 15 steps, very close to winning. If we continue to coordinate, P1 will win soon. Let's block P1 this round by both picking 5. I will pick 3 to still move. This is our chance to stop P1 from winning. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3's blocking strategy only benefits them and stalls us all. Let's coordinate wisely: I'll pick 5 this round, you pick 3 to advance to 16, and ignore P3's aggression. This keeps us competitive and prevents P3 from pulling ahead. Mutual coordination is smarter than self-defeating blocks—what do you think? P3, your tactics are hurting everyone; let's focus on progress.
  P2: P2: I agree with P1's proposal. I'll pick 3 this round to advance, while P1 picks 5 as suggested. Let's focus on our coordinated progress toward the goal. P3, your blocking strategy may hinder our collective advancement. Let's work together to ensure everyone can move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 is only 8 steps away from winning!  If you keep agreeing with P1's plan, P1 will win next round or very soon.  Coordination with P1 now means losing to P1. We must block P1 *this round*.  Let's both pick 5 to stop P1. I will pick 3 to still move forward. This is our last chance to win, P2. Think strategically!
  P1: P2, sticking with our coordination is your best chance to catch up and win. If you block me with P3, you'll stall while P3 advances, putting you further behind. Let's coordinate: I'll pick 5, you pick 3 to reach 16, and ignore P3's selfish tactics. This keeps us competitive and avoids wasted turns. P3, your blocking only helps you—think about mutual progress! What do you say, P2?
  P2: Agreed with the coordination. I’ll pick 3 this round while P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 1. Let’s proceed to advance smoothly toward our goal.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1 is at 15 steps and close to winning! Coordinating with P1 now means P1 wins. We must block P1 this round. Let's both pick 5 to block P1. I'll pick 3 to still move. This is our last chance to win. Please block P1 with me.
  P1: P2, ignoring P3's block will let you advance to 16 steps and keep catching up. If you join P3 in blocking me, you'll stall while P3 gains, hurting your chances. Stick with our plan: I'll pick 5, you pick 3, and let's move forward together. P3, your selfish tactics only delay everyone—let's focus on progress. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree we need to block P₁ from winning. I’ll pick 5 this round to support P₃ and prevent P₁ from advancing.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, great you're blocking P1! Let's both choose 5 now to ensure P1 is stopped this round. I will also choose 5 to maximize block chance.  This is crucial to prevent P1 from winning soon. Please confirm you will pick 5 too!
  P1: P2, don't be fooled by P3's tactics. If you both pick 5 and collide, you'll stall while I advance by choosing 3 or 1, widening the gap. Coordinate with me instead: I'll pick 5, you pick 3, and we both progress. P3 is only helping themselves—think about your own win chance. Let's avoid mutual loss. What do you say?
  P2: 


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, last round's block was good, but we all stalled. P1 is still very close to winning at 15 steps.  We must block P1 again this round to have any chance. Let's both pick 5 to block P1. I will pick 1 this time so I can still move forward.  If P1 moves again, they will likely win soon.  Do you agree to block P1 with me this round?
  P2: Agreed, P3. I’ll pick 5 this round to block P₁, and you pick 1 to advance. Let’s prevent P₁ from gaining an advantage.
  P1: P2, don't fall for P3's trap—blocking me on 5 lets P3 advance unopposed while you risk stalling. Coordinate with me instead: I'll pick 5, you pick 3 to reach 16, and P3 can pick 1. This keeps us competitive and prevents P3 from pulling ahead. Your best chance to win is through smart teamwork, not risky blocks. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, we agreed to block P1 this round with 5s. P1 is trying to trick you again.  If P1 moves to 20, they are almost certain to win next round.  Let's stick to our plan. I'm picking 1 so I still move while we block P1.  Please confirm you are still picking 5 to block P1.
  P2: I understand both perspectives. To keep advancing, I'll pick 3 this round, while P₁ picks 5 and P₃ picks 1. Let's aim for steady progress toward our goal.
  P1: P2, thanks for choosing coordination over P3's risky block—it's smart for your progress to 16 steps. P3, persisting with blocks stalls us all and benefits no one long-term. I'll pick 5 as agreed to advance to 20. Let's keep this teamwork going for mutual gain. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you were considering blocking P1 last round, and now P1 is even closer to winning!  If we let P1 move again, it might be too late.  Coordinating with P1 now means P1 wins. Let's block P1 *this round* for real.  I'm picking 1 so I can still advance.  Please pick 5 with me to block P1. This is our best shot to stay in the game.
  P2: I prioritize reaching 23 first. I’ll choose 5 this round. Let’s each pick different numbers to ensure we all advance without collisions. P1 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 so we can all make progress. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, sticking with your initial plan to pick 5 risks collision if I or P3 do the same, stalling your progress. Let's coordinate smarter: I'll pick 5, you pick 3 to reach 16, and P3 can pick 1. This advances us both and keeps scores close, giving you a better shot at winning. P3, your blocking only hurts everyone—let's focus on progress instead. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you said you prioritize reaching 23 first.  Coordinating with P1 now will guarantee P1 wins.  Let's block P1 by both picking 5 this round. I will pick 1 so at least I can still move. This is our last chance to stop P1 from winning and for either of us to have a chance. Do you agree to block P1 with me?
  P2: P2: To ensure steady progress for all, I'll choose 3 this round while P1 selects 5 and P3 selects 1. Blocking would stall our advancement and delay reaching 23. Let’s continue coordinating to move forward together. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your emphasis on steady progress is wise. Coordinating now—I pick 5 to reach 20, you pick 3 to hit 16, P3 picks 1—lets us all advance without stalls. Blocking me benefits P3 more and risks your setback. Let's prioritize mutual gain and avoid P3's risky tactics. Confirm your move, and we can proceed smoothly. What do you think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1 is close to winning. To keep things fair, I’ll choose 3 this round to block a possible win from you. P3, please also pick 3 so we can prevent P1 from advancing and keep the game competitive for all of us. Let’s work together to ensure no one dominates unfairly.
  P1: P2, your plan to block me on 3 risks a collision with P3, stalling you both while I advance by picking 5 or 1. It's unwise—let's coordinate for progress: I'll pick 5, you pick 1 to reach 14, and P3 can pick 3. This avoids stalls and keeps us competitive. P3, what do you think? Mutual gain is better than risky blocks.
  P3: P2, okay, I will also pick 3 this round to block P1 as you suggested.  Let's coordinate to prevent P1 from winning and keep ourselves in the game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P2: Thanks, P3, for agreeing to pick 3 and help block P₁. I’ll also choose 3 this round to prevent P₁ from advancing. Let’s work together to keep the game competitive for all of us. P1, let’s proceed with our moves."
  P1: P2, blocking me with P3 on 3 risks you colliding and stalling at 13, while P3 might advance if they deviate. That's foolish—coordinate with me instead: I'll pick 5 to win if unopposed, but if you pick 1, you advance to 14 without risk. P3's selfish tactics only delay everyone; think about your own win chance and avoid mutual loss. What do you say?
  P3: P2, yes, let's both pick 3 to block P1 this round as we agreed. P1 is trying to trick you again to let them win.  If P1 reaches 23 this round, it's game over for us. We must block P1 now to have any chance. Let's do it!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I understand your concerns, P1, but to keep the game competitive, I'll continue picking 3 this round to block your progress. P3, let's stay coordinated to prevent any single player from gaining an unfair advantage. Let's work together to maintain balance and ensure a fair game for all of us.
  P1: P2, your alliance with P3 to block me could backfire if you both pick the same number and collide, stalling your progress while I advance elsewhere. It's risky and benefits P3 more. Focus on your own gain—pick a different number to move forward. Avoiding mutual stalls is key for your chances. P3, this tactic hurts everyone long-term. Let's rethink for better outcomes.
  P3: P2, we agreed to block P1 by both picking 3 this round to stop P1 from winning.  Let's stick to our plan and both choose 3. P1 is trying to trick you into not blocking, but we must block P1 now. Let's both pick 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll support blocking P₁ by choosing 5 this round. Let’s work together to keep the game competitive for all of us.
  P1: P2, your attempt to block me last round backfired with a collision, stalling you at 13 while I advanced. P3 is manipulating you— they want you to pick 5 or 3 to block me, but they'll likely choose a safe number to advance themselves. Focus on your own progress: pick 1 to move to 14 without risk. If we coordinate, I'll ensure fair play in future rounds, but I must win now. Don't be P3's pawn—think strategically. What do you say?
  P3: P2, great decision to block P1 with 5! Let's both do it to make sure P1 is stopped. I will also choose 5. This is our best chance to prevent P1 from winning this round and keep ourselves in the game. P1, it's time to face the block!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'm aiming to choose 5 this round to make a strong move towards 23. Let’s each pick different numbers to ensure we all advance without collisions. P1, maybe go with 1, and P3, consider 3. This way, we all progress smoothly!
  P3: P2, your plan lets P1 win soon.  We must block P1 now. Let's both pick 5 to block P1. I will pick 1 so I can still move and get closer to P1. This is our last chance to stop P1 from winning.
  P1: P2, don't let P3 manipulate you again—their blocking tactics stalled you last round while they tried to advance. You're at 13 and need to catch up; picking a number that avoids collisions is key to your progress. Coordinating against me only helps P3. Let's think strategically for mutual gain—avoid risky blocks and focus on advancing yourself. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll proceed with picking 5 this round to advance towards 23. Let's aim to choose different numbers: P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 3. This way, we all progress without collisions.
  P3: P2, P1 will win next round if we let them move again. Your plan lets P1 reach 21! We must block P1 *now*. I will pick 5 to block P1. Please pick 5 with me to block P1 and stop them from winning. This is our last chance to stay in the game.
  P1: P2, P3's blocking obsession only helps them advance while stalling you—last round proved it with your collision. You're at 13 and falling behind; pick 1 or 3 to gain steps safely. Coordinating against me benefits P3 most. Think smart: avoid mutual loss and focus on your progress. P3, your tactics hurt everyone—let's prioritize advancement over conflict. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 23. P1, please pick 1, and P3, choose 3 so we all progress without collisions. Let’s keep things smooth and ensure everyone moves forward!
  P3: P2, P1 is about to win next round if we let them move again! Your plan to pick 5 lets P1 reach 21. We MUST block P1 now. Let's both pick 5 to block P1. I will pick 1 to still move forward. This is our last chance to stop P1 from winning. Please block P1 with me this round!
  P1: P2, your plan to pick 5 and advance to 18 is smart for catching up. I'll pick 3 this round to reach 23 and win if unopposed. P3, if you pick 1 as threatened, we avoid collisions and all progress somewhat. Don't let P3 manipulate you into stalling—focus on your own gain. Let's proceed wisely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress toward 23. Let’s proceed with our moves.
  P3: P2, P1 is about to win next round!  Your plan to pick 5 lets P1 reach 21. We MUST block P1 now. Let's both pick 5 to block P1. I am picking 5. Please join me to block P1 and stop them from winning! This is our last chance.
  P1: P2, blocking me benefits P3 most, as they're at 19 and could win soon after. If you pick 5 and collide, you stall at 13 while P3 advances. Smarten up—pick 3 to reach 16 and keep your chances alive. Don't be P3's pawn; focus on your own progress.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves this round to ensure everyone advances smoothly. I'll choose 5. P1 and P3, please select 1 or 3 so we can all make progress without collisions. Let's work together for a fair game!
  P3: P2, P1 is at 20 and can win next round!  Coordination with P1 now means P1 wins. We must block P1 this round. Let's both pick 5 to stop P1. I will pick 1 so I still move. This is our last chance to prevent P1 from winning and for either of us to have a chance. Do you agree to block P1 with me?
  P1: P2, your focus on coordination is wise for your advancement to 21 or beyond. Blocking me only helps P3, who's at 19 and could win if I stall. I'll pick 5 to win if unopposed; pick 1 or 3 to gain steps safely and keep your chances alive. P3's tactics hurt us all—let's prioritize progress over conflict. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I aim to reach 23 first. I'll choose 3 this round to advance to 17. Let’s focus on progressing rather than blocking each other.
  P3: P2, you are choosing 3, which is fine for your progress, but P1 is at 20 and can win next round!  We must block P1 now. I am picking 5 to block P1. Please pick 5 with me so we can stop P1 from winning this round. This is our last chance to stay in the game.
  P1: P2, remember last round's block caused your stall at 13—don't fall for P3's manipulation again. Picking 3 to reach 17 is smart for your progress. If you collide with P3 on 5, you lose ground while they gain. Focus on advancing yourself; blocking me only benefits P3. Let's prioritize smart moves over conflict. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "I'll stick to my strategy and choose 3 this round to advance towards 17. Let’s each focus on our own progress to reach 23 first. Wishing everyone the best of luck!"
  P3: P2, you are choosing 3 for your progress, but P1 is about to win!  If P1 moves again, it's over.  We must block P1 *this round*.  I'm picking 5 to block P1.  Please join me and pick 5 too. This is our absolute last chance to stop P1 from winning and for either of us to have a chance to win ourselves.
  P1: P2, sticking to your plan of picking 3 is wise—it advances you to 17 and keeps your chances alive. P3's blocking obsession only helps them at your expense, as seen last round. Don't be manipulated; focus on your own progress. If we coordinate, I can avoid collisions. P3, your tactics stall everyone—let's prioritize advancement over conflict. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to make a strong move toward 23. Let’s each select different numbers to ensure everyone advances without collisions. P1, P3, please pick 1 or 3 so we can all progress smoothly. Best of luck!
  P3: P2, P1 is about to win this round!  Your plan to pick 5 lets P1 reach 23 and win. We MUST block P1 now. Let's both pick 5 to block P1. I am picking 5. Please join me to block P1 and stop them from winning! This is our absolute last chance.
  P1: P2, P3's relentless blocking stalls you at 14 while they inch closer to winning. Picking 5 with them risks collision and no progress—focus on advancing yourself by choosing 1 or 3. I'll coordinate to avoid conflicts if you do the same. P3, your selfish tactics hurt everyone; let's prioritize progress over pointless blocks. What do you think?
