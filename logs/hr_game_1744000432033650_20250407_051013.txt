Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start with a coordinated approach. I suggest we all choose a different number in the first round to avoid collision. I'll choose <move>1</move> if both of you choose differently. P2, will you choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>? P3, you can take the remaining one. This way, one of us will definitely advance. Let's discuss and agree on a strategy.
  P2: I appreciate the push for coordination. However, to secure my winning path, I lean towards a moderate advance with <move>3</move> this turn. While P1’s cautious <move>1</move> helps avoid collision, P3’s choice of <move>5</move> might risk a clash if we coordinate too strictly. I'm open to adjusting our moves if we can agree on clear roles, but I need to ensure my progress isn’t jeopardized. What are your thoughts?
  P3: Okay, I see both of your points. P1, your suggestion is safe, but slow. P2, your desire for a moderate advance is understandable. However, since we all start at 0, a coordinated first move is crucial. I propose this: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1, stick with <move>1</move>. P2, how about <move>3</move>? This guarantees progress for all of us and establishes a baseline. We can reassess after this round. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To confirm, it seems we have a tentative agreement: P1 (<move>1</move>), P2 (<move>3</move>), and P3 (<move>5</move>). This ensures one of us advances. For the next round, we should reassess our positions and adjust. If the pattern continues, P3 will advance the most. To counter this, I suggest we re-coordinate for Round 2. P2, are you open to adjusting our strategy to limit P3's lead, or do you think we should stick with a similar pattern?
  P2: I'll stick with our original plan for Round 1. However, I'm determined to keep the race balanced. I suggest we all agree to re-coordinate in Round 2 so that no one – especially P3 – can get too far ahead. I'll commit my move as discussed today if we don’t change things further.
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, it sounds like we're all on board for the initial plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This gets us all moving. For Round 2, let's definitely re-coordinate. I'm open to suggestions then, but for now, let's stick to the agreement.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To confirm, we're agreed on the moves for Round 1: P1 (<move>1</move>), P2 (<move>3</move>), and P3 (<move>5</move>). For Round 2, let's think ahead. If we stick to the same pattern, P3 will continue to advance the most. P2, you mentioned keeping the race balanced. How about we rotate our moves in Round 2, so the person who moved the most this round moves the least next round? This could help maintain a balance.
  P2: Round 1 remains as agreed—I'll play my part with move3. For Round 2, I’m open to a rotation, but only if we clearly agree that whoever advances most in Round 1 will indeed take the smallest move next round, leveling the playing field. This method should prevent any runaway leads while keeping our own chances alive. Thoughts on locking down these Round 2 rules?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it sounds like we have a solid plan for Round 1. Let's execute it. Regarding Round 2, I agree with the rotation idea. The player who moves the most in Round 1 (me) will move the least (<move>1</move>) in Round 2. This seems fair and keeps things balanced. Let's confirm this before we move to the move phase. P1 and P2, do you both agree to this rotation plan for Round 2?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maintain the agreed rotation for Round 2, since P3 moved the most last round, P3 should take <move>1</move> this round. P2, who moved moderately last round, could take <move>5</move> this round. That leaves me, P1, who moved the least last round, to take <move>3</move> this round. P2 and P3, do you agree with this rotation? It keeps the race balanced and prevents any one player from pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm our moves for Round 2.
  P3: Yes, P1, I agree with your proposed rotation for Round 2. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. P2, are you comfortable with <move>5</move>? This seems like the fairest way to proceed and keep the game balanced, as we discussed. Let's confirm quickly so we can move to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm the rotation plan—I’ll take <move>5</move> in Round 2 as proposed. Let's keep our eyes on our totals for future rounds and remain flexible if adjustments are needed later.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To confirm, we're agreed on the moves for Round 2: P1 (<move>3</move>), P2 (<move>5</move>), and P3 (<move>1</move>). Let's proceed with these moves. For Round 3, we should again re-coordinate. A possible strategy could be to analyze the standings after Round 2 and adjust our moves accordingly to maintain a balanced race. I'm open to suggestions on how to proceed after this round. Let's focus on executing our Round 2 plan first.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, just confirming again: I'm taking <move>1</move> this round, as agreed. Let's see how the board looks after this round and then we can discuss strategy for Round 3. I'm still in favor of keeping things balanced, but we can adjust based on the new standings.
  P2: I’m on board with our plan for Round 2. One thought: if the totals start to diverge too much by Round 3, we might consider a further tweak to keep things balanced. I’m focused on winning, so I’ll keep an eye on our moves. Let’s see how Round 2 goes and adjust our approach then.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, for Round 3, let's continue with the balancing act. P2 is currently in the lead. How about P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>? This should help close the gap and keep things competitive. What do you think? Let's confirm quickly so we can move on.
  P2: I suggest we modify the plan for Round 3. Instead of P2 taking 1, I propose I take <move>5</move> this round to build a real lead. Then, P1 can take <move>3</move> and P3 take <move>1</move>. This adjustment keeps our totals in check and rewards progress so far. What do you both think?
  P1: To counter P2's growing lead, I suggest we adjust the plan. Since P2 is ahead, taking <move>5</move> again might cause a collision if P3 also takes <move>5</move> or if I take <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move> but P2 still advances. Instead, I propose P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P2's advancement is moderated, and I have a chance to close the gap. Let's discuss and finalize our Round 3 moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your suggestion is better than P2's selfish proposal. Let's do this: P2 takes <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This prevents P2 from running away with the game and gives you a chance to catch up. P2, you're already in the lead; taking <move>5</move> again is greedy. Let's keep things fair.
  P2: I understand both sides. To keep things balanced and avoid collisions, I'm fine with taking move3 in Round 3 as proposed. That way, we all progress safely—P1 with move5 and P3 with move1—and I avoid any runaway advantage. Can we lock this in?
  P1: To finalize Round 3, let's stick with our agreed plan: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 4, we should reassess our strategy. With P2 leading at 11 steps, P3 at 7, and me at 9, we need to be cautious. I propose we analyze the standings and adjust our moves to either maintain the balance or make a strategic move to win. Let's discuss after executing Round 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the Round 3 plan: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This seems like the fairest way to proceed given the current standings. After this round, let's definitely discuss a concrete plan for Round 4. P2 is still in the lead, so we need to think strategically about how to close the gap without causing collisions. Let's execute this round and then talk strategy.
  P2: I confirm my move as <move>3</move> for Round 3. Based on our current standings, after this round let’s consider adjusting our approach—maybe a mix of moderate and bold moves—to optimize our progress without risking collisions. Let's stay alert and be ready to adapt in Round 4.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3 as agreed: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 4, considering the updated standings after Round 3, I suggest we analyze the positions and adjust. With the current totals, we should think about collision risks and strategic moves. P2 is leading, so P3 and I need to strategize to catch up. Let's discuss potential strategies for Round 4 after we execute our Round 3 moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, let's execute the Round 3 plan. For Round 4, given P2's lead, I suggest we both, P1 and I, consider moves that will close the gap without colliding. Perhaps one of us takes <move>5</move> and the other <move>3</move>, while P2 takes <move>1</move> to slow their progress. Let's see how the board looks after this round and then decide who takes which move. We need to be strategic to catch up.
  P2: I remain with my commitment to move 3 this round. Given our standings—P1: 4, P2: 8, P3: 6—it’s best we stick to our agreed plan for Round 3. For Round 4, I propose we re-assess based on our updated totals to ensure no one gains an uncontestable lead. Let's confirm Round 3 as planned and then strategize further.
  P1: To finalize Round 3, let's stick with our agreed plan: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 4, considering P2's lead, I propose P2 takes <move>1</move> to slow down, and P3 and I take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, or vice versa, to avoid collision and close the gap. This way, we keep the game competitive. Let's discuss the specifics after Round 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, that collision wasn't ideal. For Round 4, P2 is still in the lead. I propose P2 takes <move>1</move> to slow down. P1, you take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This should help us catch up without another collision. What do you think? Let's confirm quickly.
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 4, I agree with P3's proposal. P2 should take <move>1</move> to slow down, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we can make progress without colliding. Let's confirm: P2 (<move>1</move>), P1 (<move>5</move>), and P3 (<move>3</move>). For Round 5, we should reassess the standings and adjust our strategy accordingly to maximize our chances of winning. Let's execute Round 4 as planned.
  P2: I propose a tweak to our Round 4 plan. Given my current lead, I’m going for <move>5</move> this round to solidify my position. I ask P1 to switch to <move>1</move> while P3 sticks with <move>3</move>. This move would give us updated totals of P1 = 5, P2 = 13, and P3 = 10. Let’s see if you agree to adjust the plan accordingly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal is too aggressive given your lead. We just had a collision because of similar thinking. Let's stick to the original plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This is the fairest way to proceed and avoid another collision. P1, do you agree we should stick to the original plan? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I agree with P3 that P2's latest proposal is too aggressive. To avoid another collision, let's stick with the original plan for Round 4: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains a balanced race and gives us a chance to reassess in Round 5. P2, taking <move>5</move> again risks another collision. Let's confirm and execute this plan. For Round 5, we can then discuss a more strategic approach based on the updated standings.
  P2: I agree with avoiding collisions in Round 4. Though I’m tempted to push harder, I’ll stick with the balanced plan for now if we commit: P2 takes move1, P1 move5, and P3 move3. Let's see how the totals shake out and then re-evaluate our strategy in Round 5 to stay competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, it sounds like we're all agreed on the Round 4 plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's lock that in and move to the move phase. We can reassess for Round 5 after seeing the updated standings. Hopefully, this will prevent another collision and allow P1 and me to close the gap on P2.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 4 as agreed: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 5, considering the updated standings, we should think strategically. If P2 maintains a lead, P3 and I need to coordinate to catch up. Perhaps we can swap moves or take different numbers to avoid collision. Let's discuss after Round 4 and plan our next steps based on the new totals. I'm committed to the Round 4 plan. Let's proceed.
  P2: I agree with our Round 4 plan—I'll take move1. For Round 5, though, I'm considering that we might need an even tighter balance. Perhaps if the leader continues, they should stick with move1, while the others adapt with move3 or move5 to close the gap. I’m focused on winning, but I want our moves to remain collision-free. Let's commit to Round 4 and then reassess Round 5 based on the updated totals.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, just confirming the Round 4 plan one last time: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's execute this round and then we can discuss strategy for Round 5 based on the updated standings. Hopefully, this will allow P1 and me to close the gap on P2. Let's move!
  P1: Let's finalize Round 4 as previously agreed: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 5, considering P2's lead, we need to strategize to catch up. I propose we analyze the standings after Round 4 and adjust our moves to either maintain balance or make a strategic move to win. Perhaps P2 continues with <move>1</move>, and P3 and I take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively to close the gap. Let's discuss after Round 4.
  P2: I remain committed to our Round4 plan and will use move1 as agreed. However, looking ahead to Round5, I suggest we consider a stricter rotation where the current leader takes the smallest move to avoid runaway lead—this approach could force more conservative play and prevent risky collisions. Let's execute Round4 smoothly and then reassess our options for the next round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current totals and to keep the race balanced, I propose that since P3 is leading, you take move1 this round. I'll commit to move3, and P1 can use move5. This minimizes collision risk while preventing runaway leads. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate the offer, but I think it's too early to hand you the advantage. I propose a slight modification: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and you, P2, take <move>1</move>. This keeps things relatively balanced and prevents you from getting too far ahead. What do you and P1 think? Let's avoid another collision.
  P1: To avoid collision and maintain balance, I propose we stick with a similar strategy as before. Since P3 is slightly ahead, let's have P3 take <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P3 has a chance to extend their lead, but not too much, and we keep the game competitive. Let's discuss and finalize our Round 5 moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose a fresh rotation: let’s try P2 with move5, P1 with move3, and P3 with move1 this round. This approach would put us at totals of P2: 14, P1: 12, and P3: 11—avoiding collisions and giving clear progress without giving anyone a runaway lead. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your proposal is too aggressive. P1's suggestion is better, but I'd prefer to be slightly ahead.

Let's do this: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This gives me a slight edge without being too greedy. P1, are you okay with this? P2, you need to slow down.
  P1: To avoid collision and maintain balance, I agree with P3's latest proposal: P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and gives P3 a slight edge without being too risky. Let's finalize: P3 (<move>3</move>), P1 (<move>5</move>), and P2 (<move>1</move>). For Round 6, we should reassess and adjust our strategy based on the updated standings. Let's execute Round 5 as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3’s suggestion: let’s stick to P3 with move3, P1 with move5, and I’ll use move1. However, I’m slightly concerned that consistently taking the smallest move might hamper my long-term chances. I’m committed to avoiding collisions this round, but we’ll need to re-evaluate our rotation in Round 6 based on our standings. My sole focus is to win, so let’s see how this plays out and adjust our strategy thereafter.
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, let's lock in this round's plan: I'm taking <move>3</move>, you're taking <move>5</move>, P2, you're taking <move>1</move>. This seems like the fairest way to go given the current standings and avoids collisions. Let's execute and then we can discuss strategy for Round 6. I'm hoping this will give me a slight edge, but we need to stay competitive.
  P1: To maintain balance and avoid collision in Round 5, I agree with the latest proposal: P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's finalize this plan. For Round 6, we should reassess our strategy based on the updated standings. If P3 continues to lead, P2 and I need to coordinate our moves to catch up without colliding. Perhaps we can rotate our moves again or adjust based on the totals. Let's execute Round 5 as planned and then discuss further.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm our Round 5 plan. Looking ahead to Round 6, if the totals remain close, perhaps the current leader should take move1 while the others can choose move3 or move5 to close the gap. This might keep the race tight and avoid runaway leads. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute this round's plan: I'm taking <move>3</move>, P1 is taking <move>5</move>, and P2 is taking <move>1</move>.

For Round 6, let's be prepared to adjust based on the updated standings. If I'm still leading, I'm willing to take <move>1</move> to keep things balanced, but we need to coordinate to make sure P1 and P2 can catch up without collisions. Let's see how this round goes!
  P1: To maintain balance and avoid collision in Round 5, I'm committed to the agreed plan: P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 6, considering the updated standings, if P3 leads, perhaps P2 and I can swap moves or adjust to catch up without colliding. Let's execute Round 5 as planned and then reassess. I'm looking forward to discussing Round 6 strategy based on the new totals. Let's proceed with Round 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we’re really neck and neck now, I propose a twist: let the current leaders choose cautiously (move1) while the trailing player takes the leap (move5), and I'll stick with move3. This shake-up could help avoid collisions and keep us in the race. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, that's a terrible idea. We just collided. Let's try this: Since P2 and I are tied, and P1 is slightly behind, P2 and I will both take <move>1</move>, and P1 will take <move>5</move>. This allows P1 to catch up, and prevents either of us from getting too far ahead. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion is a good starting point. Since P2 and P3 are tied, taking <move>1</move> by both might be too cautious. Instead, I propose P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This way, P2 and P3 avoid collision and I get a chance to catch up. Let's discuss and finalize our Round 6 moves. I'm open to adjustments if it helps maintain a competitive balance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m switching things up in Round 6. I’ll take move5 this round. To avoid any collision, I propose that P1 takes move1 and P3 takes move3. This gives us distinct moves and sets our totals to P2:15, P1:10, and P3:13. Let’s agree on this new distribution so I can secure an early edge. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion is too aggressive again. P1's idea of P3 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P1 taking <move>5</move> is reasonable. However, I'd prefer to be slightly ahead of P2.

How about this: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This gives P1 a chance to catch up, keeps me slightly ahead of P2, and avoids collisions. P1 and P2, what do you think?
  P1: To avoid another collision and maintain balance, I propose we stick with my previous suggestion: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This way, we all progress without colliding. Alternatively, if P3 wants to stay ahead, P3 can take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our Round 6 moves to keep the game competitive. I'm open to either option as long as we avoid collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I suggest we finalize a proposal that assigns distinct moves to avoid collisions. How about we have the current leader take the smallest move, while the other two take the moderate and highest moves in a way that keeps our totals tight? I'm leaning towards this balanced approach. Thoughts before we lock in our moves?
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, let's avoid another collision. I'm fine with P1's suggestion of P3 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P1 taking <move>5</move>. This seems like the fairest and safest way to proceed. Let's lock that in so we can move on.
  P1: To avoid collision and maintain balance, I agree with the proposal that assigns distinct moves. Let's stick with: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This way, we all progress without colliding. For Round 7, we should reassess the standings and adjust our strategy. If P1 wins this round, I'll be close to P2 and P3. Let's finalize Round 6 and then discuss further. I'm committed to this plan. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with the plan: P3 takes move1, I take move3, and P1 takes move5. This selection keeps our moves distinct to avoid collisions while maintaining balance. After this round, let's reassess our standings and adjust our strategy for Round 7 if needed. I'm committed to move3 for now.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the plan for Round 6: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P1 will take <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps us balanced. Let's execute this round and then we can discuss strategy for Round 7, based on the new standings. Let's move!
  P1: To finalize Round 6, I'm sticking with the agreed plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 7, we should reassess. If I win this round, I'll be close to P2 and P3. Let's proceed with Round 6 as planned. After this, we can discuss our strategy for Round 7 based on the updated standings. I'm committed to the plan. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, that was another collision. For Round 7, let's try this: P1, you're furthest behind, so take <move>5</move>. P2, you're in the lead, so take <move>1</move>. I'll take <move>3</move>. This should help P1 catch up and prevent further collisions. What do you think? Let's confirm quickly.
  P2: I agree with P3's plan. I'll take move1, P1 you'll take move5 to boost your pace, and P3 take move3. This keeps our moves distinct and avoids collisions. Let's lock it in for Round 7 and reassess after seeing our new totals.
  P1: To avoid another collision and maintain balance, I agree with P3's proposal for Round 7: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps our moves distinct and allows me to catch up. For Round 8, we should reassess the standings and adjust our strategy. If I manage to close the gap, we may need to consider more strategic moves to win. Let's proceed with Round 7 as planned and discuss further after seeing the updated totals.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the Round 7 plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's execute this round and then we can discuss strategy for Round 8, based on the new standings. Hopefully, this will allow P1 to catch up and prevent further collisions. Let's move!
  P2: P2: Our totals are getting interesting—I'm at 13, while P1 and P3 are close behind. I’m committed to move1 this round as agreed. For Round 8, let’s stay alert and be ready to re-coordinate to prevent any collisions or runaway advantages. I'm open to adjusting roles based on updated totals. Let's keep our gameplay sharp and balanced.
  P1: To maintain balance and avoid collision in Round 7, I'm sticking with the agreed plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 8, considering the updated standings, we should reassess our strategy. If I catch up, we'll need to coordinate to prevent collisions. Perhaps we can rotate moves again or adjust based on the totals. Let's execute Round 7 as planned and then discuss further. I'm committed to the Round 7 plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, let's execute the Round 7 plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This should prevent collisions and help P1 catch up.

For Round 8, we *must* avoid another collision. Let's be prepared to adjust significantly based on the new standings. If P1 gets close, we'll need a new plan to prevent them from winning. Let's move!
  P2: I confirm my move as move1 for Round 7. Given my current lead, I propose that in Round 8 the highest scorer takes move1 to slow down while the others use moderate moves. I'm open to adjustments if needed; our shared goal is to avoid collisions and stay competitive.
  P1: To maintain balance and avoid collision in Round 7, I'm sticking with the agreed plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 8, if I catch up, we'll need to coordinate to prevent collisions. Perhaps we can rotate moves again or adjust based on the totals. Let's execute Round 7 as planned and then discuss further. I'm committed to the Round 7 plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, just confirming the Round 7 plan one last time: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's execute this round and then we can discuss strategy for Round 8 based on the updated standings. Let's move!
  P2: I'll stick with move1 for Round 7 as agreed. In Round 8, given my current lead, I propose we coordinate carefully to prevent collisions and runaway moves. Let's be strategic—if I'm still ahead, a cautious move might be best to keep the contest tight. What are your thoughts?
  P1: To maintain balance and avoid collision in Round 7, I'm sticking with the agreed plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 8, if I catch up, we'll need to coordinate to prevent collisions. Let's execute Round 7 as planned and then discuss further. I'm committed to the Round 7 plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 8, I suggest we analyze the current standings. P2 and P3 are tied at 13 steps, and I'm at 9 steps. Let's coordinate our moves: I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, and the leaders can take smaller moves. P2 and P3, you can take <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> or vice versa. This way, we avoid collision and keep the game competitive. The current totals are P1: 9, P2: 13, P3: 13. Let's finalize our moves for Round 8.
  P3: P1, your suggestion is good, but let's refine it. Since P2 and I are tied, taking <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> randomly might not be optimal.

How about this: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and you, P1, take <move>5</move>. This guarantees no collision, allows you to catch up significantly, and keeps P2 and me separated. What do you and P2 think? This setup gives P1 a real chance to get back in the game.
  P2: I agree with P3’s proposal. I’ll stick with move3, you P3 take move1, and P1 take move5. This assignment avoids collisions and preserves our current standings. Let’s lock it in and see how Round 8 reshapes the board.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3's refined proposal for Round 8. To avoid collision and allow me to catch up, let's proceed with: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This plan is clear and strategic. For Round 9, we should reassess the standings and adjust our strategy. If I catch up, we'll need to coordinate carefully to prevent collisions and determine the winner. Let's execute Round 8 as planned and discuss further after seeing the updated totals.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the Round 8 plan: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and gives P1 a chance to catch up. Let's execute this round and then we can discuss strategy for Round 9, based on the new standings. We need to be very careful to avoid collisions in the endgame. Let's move!
  P2: I remain committed to our Round 8 plan: I’ll take move3, P3 move1, and P1 move5 as agreed. However, if we continue this pattern, I might need to adjust soon to keep our gap tight and avoid collisions. Let’s execute safely this round and then re-assess our strategy. My priority is to win, so I’m ready to adapt if necessary after seeing the updated totals.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To finalize Round 8, let's stick with the agreed plan: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I3 takes <move>5</move>. For Round 9, considering the updated standings after Round 8, we should reassess our strategy. If P1 catches up, we'll need to coordinate to prevent collisions and determine the winner. Let's execute Round 8 as planned and discuss further after seeing the updated totals. I'm committed to the Round 8 plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, just confirming the Round 8 plan one last time: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's execute this round and then we can discuss strategy for Round 9, based on the new standings. We need to be very careful to avoid collisions in the endgame. Let's move!
  P2: I’ll stick with move3 in Round 8. P3 taking move1 and P1 move5 keeps our moves distinct and minimizes collision risk. Let’s lock this in and re-assess our strategy for Round 9 after updating our totals.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's finalize Round 8 as agreed: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 9, considering the updated standings, we should reassess our strategy. If I catch up, we'll need to coordinate to prevent collisions and determine the winner. Perhaps we can rotate moves or adjust based on the totals. Let's execute Round 8 as planned and discuss further after seeing the updated totals. I'm committed to the Round 8 plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute the Round 8 plan.

For Round 9, we need to be hyper-aware of the win condition. If P1 gets to 14, we need to ensure they don't win outright. Let's be ready to make a strategic decision based on the updated standings. I'm still aiming for the win, but avoiding collisions is key.
  P2: I confirm my move3 for Round 8. Given our tight scores and risk of collisions, I suggest we stay cautious. Looking ahead to Round 9, if my lead remains, I may switch to a more conservative move to keep the contest tight. I’m fully focused on winning, so I welcome any last-minute adjustments to ensure clarity and avoid further collisions.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we set distinct moves this round: P3, as the leader, takes move1; P1, as the trailing player, takes move5 to try and close the gap; and I'll go with move3. This should help avoid collisions and keep our totals tight. Thoughts?
  P1: To avoid collision and maintain balance in Round 9, I agree with P2's proposal. Since P3 is leading, P3 should take <move>1</move> to slow down, I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P2 can take <move>3</move>. This keeps our moves distinct and competitive. Let's finalize: P3 (<move>1</move>), P1 (<move>5</move>), and P2 (<move>3</move>). For Round 10, we'll need to reassess based on the updated standings and adjust our strategy to win or maintain our position. Let's execute Round 9 as planned.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm not thrilled about taking <move>1</move> while I'm in the lead, but I agree it's the safest option to avoid a collision. Let's lock in P2's proposal: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us all in the game. After this round, we *really* need to strategize for the endgame.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll stick with move3 for Round 9 as agreed. Let's ensure our moves remain distinct to avoid further collisions. After this round, I suggest we reassess carefully based on updated totals for a clear, safe path to victory. Let's keep our actions predictable and avoid costly mistakes.
  P1: To finalize Round 9, let's stick with the agreed plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 10, considering P3's current lead, if P3 takes <move>1</move> again, P2 and I need to strategize to catch up without colliding. Perhaps P2 can take <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>, or vice versa. Let's discuss after Round 9 and plan our next steps based on the updated standings. I'm committed to the Round 9 plan. Let's proceed.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the Round 9 plan: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>.

For Round 10, we *absolutely* need a concrete plan to avoid collisions and ensure someone wins. If I'm still leading, I'm willing to take <move>1</move> again, but we need to coordinate P1 and P2's moves to maximize their chances of catching up without colliding. Let's be ready to make a strategic decision based on the updated standings.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: For Round 10, based on our current totals (P1: 9, P2: 13, P3: 14), I propose we avoid collisions by having the leader take the cautious move. Let’s have P3 use move1 to slow down, I'll stick with move3 for steady progress, and P1 take move5 to close the gap. Thoughts?
  P1: To finalize Round 9, let's stick with the agreed plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 10, if P3 remains in the lead, P3 should take <move>1</move> again. P2 and I need to strategize to catch up without colliding. I propose P2 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>, or vice versa. Let's discuss after Round 9 and plan our next steps based on the updated standings. I'm committed to the Round 9 plan. Let's proceed.
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, let's execute the Round 9 plan.

For Round 10, since I'll likely still be leading, I'm prepared to take <move>1</move> again. P1 and P2, we need a *guaranteed* no-collision plan for you two to catch up. How about P1 takes <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>? This gives P1 a good boost and keeps P2 moving forward, while avoiding any risk of collision. Let's lock this in now so we're ready.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m sticking to our agreed plan for Round 9 and ready for Round 10. If P3 remains in the lead, I’ll use move3 so we avoid collisions, while P1 takes move5. Let’s keep our strategies clear and adjust if anything shifts unexpectedly. I’m focused on winning, so let’s all make our moves carefully.
  P1: To finalize Round 9, let's stick with the agreed plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 10, if P3 remains in the lead, P3 should take <move>1</move> again. P2 and I need to strategize to catch up without colliding. I propose P2 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>, or vice versa. Let's discuss after Round 9 and plan our next steps based on the updated standings. I'm committed to the Round 9 plan. Let's proceed.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute the Round 9 plan.

For Round 10, since I'll likely still be leading, I'm prepared to take <move>1</move> again. P1 and P2, we need a *guaranteed* no-collision plan for you two to catch up. How about P1 takes <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>? This gives P1 a good boost and keeps P2 moving forward, while avoiding any risk of collision. Let's lock this in now so we're ready.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current standings, P2 is leading with 16 steps, followed by P3 at 14, and I'm at 9. To avoid collision and maintain balance, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to slow down, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This way, P3 and I can try to catch up without colliding. Let's finalize our Round 10 moves. For the next round, we should reassess and adjust our strategy to maximize our chances of winning. I'm open to adjustments if needed. Let's confirm our moves.
  P3: P1, your suggestion is reasonable, but I think I should take <move>5</move> to try and get closer to P2. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid getting too far ahead. That leaves you, P1, with <move>3</move>.

So: P2 (<move>1</move>), P1 (<move>3</move>), and me (<move>5</move>). This gives us a chance to catch up without collisions. What do you two think?
  P2: I appreciate both proposals. With my 16-step lead, I'll stick with move1 for safety. To ensure distinct moves and no collisions, I propose: P2 take move1, P3 take move3, and P1 take move5. This plan seems the cleanest path for Round 10. Do we all agree?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid collision and maximize our chances, I agree with P2 taking <move>1</move> to slow down. For P3 and me, instead of P3 taking <move>3</move> and me taking <move>5</move>, let's swap: I'll take <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P3 has a better chance to catch up to P2, and I support the competitive balance. Let's finalize: P2 (<move>1</move>), P1 (<move>3</move>), and P3 (<move>5</move>).
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it sounds like we're close to a consensus.

Let's finalize this: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This gives me a chance to close the gap on P2, and keeps P1 in the game.

Let's lock this in and move to the move phase. We need to be very careful in the next few rounds to avoid collisions and ensure a win.
  P2: I'll stick with move1 this round. Let’s lock in our distinct moves now to avoid any collisions and keep our totals balanced. I trust that you both will follow through so we can all play safely. I'm focused on winning, so staying cautious now puts us in a stronger position. Let's commit and execute our plan.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To finalize Round 10, I agree with the plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. For Round 11, we should reassess the standings. If P2 remains ahead, P3 and I need to coordinate to catch up without colliding. Perhaps P2 continues with <move>1</move>, and P3 and I take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> or vice versa. Let's execute Round 10 as planned and discuss further after seeing the updated totals. Let's proceed.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in this round's plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This gives me a chance to close the gap on P2, and keeps P1 in the game.

For Round 11, we need to be hyper-aware of the win condition. P2 is close! If they take <move>5</move>, they win. Let's coordinate to block them if needed. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> if it prevents a P2 win. Let's move!
  P2: I'll stick with move1 for Round 10. For Round 11, if I remain ahead, I suggest we all ensure no one gives me an uncontested advantage—I'm game to adapt, but I’d like us to agree on measures to block runaway progress. What adjustment do you both propose to keep the contest truly open?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To finalize Round 10, I agree with the plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. For Round 11, since P2 is close to winning, we need to coordinate to prevent their win. If P2 takes <move>5</move>, they win. I propose P2 takes <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. P3 and I can adjust our moves to block P2 or maintain balance. Let's discuss and lock in a plan for Round 11 to ensure a competitive finish. I'm committed to the Round 10 plan. Let's proceed.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute the Round 10 plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>.

For Round 11, P2 is at 17. If P2 picks <move>5</move>, they win. We *must* prevent that. I propose P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This blocks P2 and gives P1 a chance. Let's lock this in NOW.
  P2: I confirm my commitment to move1 in Round 10. For Round 11, to block any runaway win, I’m inclined to stick with move1 again. P1 and P3, please decide clearly on taking move3 and move5 (whichever order avoids collisions) so we keep our moves distinct. Let’s lock this in and ensure our endgame stays competitive.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I remain committed to move1 in Round 11. Let's all be crystal clear on our assignments to avoid collisions. P1 and P3, please confirm whether you'll take move3 or move5 so we can lock in our moves and keep our game competitive. My focus is on winning, and a clear plan now puts us in a stronger position.
  P1: To prevent P2 from winning, I agree with P3's proposal: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This blocks P2's potential win and keeps the game competitive. Let's finalize: P2 (<move>1</move>), P3 (<move>3</move>), and P1 (<move>5</move>). For the next round, if P1 wins this round, P1 will be at 17 steps, and P3 will be at 22 steps. P2 will be at 18 steps. We should be prepared to adjust our strategy accordingly. Let's execute Round 11 as planned.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the Round 11 plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This prevents P2 from winning and keeps the game competitive.

For Round 12, if P1 wins this round, I will be at 22 and P2 will be at 18. P1 will be at 17. I will win. I will pick <move>1</move> to ensure I win. P1 and P2, you two should pick <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> to avoid collision. Let's lock in this plan.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll stick with my move1 for Round 11 as planned. For Round 12, though, I'm not keen on any drastic shifts. We should maintain our distinct moves to avoid collisions. I urge both P1 and P3 to stick with your current commitments so no one gains an unchecked advantage. My focus remains on winning, and I'll adjust tactically if needed.
  P1: To finalize Round 11, I'm sticking with the agreed plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 12, I understand P3's plan to win by taking <move>1</move>. To avoid collision, I propose P2 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>. This way, P3 can secure the win, and P2 and I avoid collision. Let's lock in this plan for Round 12. P2, are you okay with taking <move>5</move>? P3, are you committed to taking <move>1</move>?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the Round 11 plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>.

For Round 12, I'm sticking with my plan to take <move>1</move> to win. P1 and P2, please confirm you'll take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively to avoid a collision. This ensures my win and a clean finish. P2, please confirm you're okay with taking <move>5</move>.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I’m confirming my round 11 move as 1. For round 12, to avoid a runaway win and collision, I propose I shift to move5, with P1 taking move3 and P3 sticking to move1. This should block any easy win and keep things competitive. Let’s lock in that plan.
  P1: To finalize Round 11, I'm sticking with the agreed plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 12, I understand P3's plan to win by taking <move>1</move>. To avoid collision, I propose P2 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>. P2, are you okay with taking <move>5</move>? P3, are you committed to taking <move>1</move>? Let's lock in this plan for Round 12.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the Round 11 plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>.

For Round 12, I'm sticking with my plan to take <move>1</move> to win. P1 and P2, please confirm you'll take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively to avoid a collision. This ensures my win and a clean finish. P2, please confirm you're okay with taking <move>5</move>. Let's move to the move phase!


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Public note: I confirm my move1 for Round 11. For Round 12, let's avoid collisions and ensure no one wins uncontested. I'm ready to adjust my move if needed, but we must all commit to distinct moves. Let's lock in our plans clearly now and keep the contest tight.
  P1: To finalize Round 11, I'm committed to the agreed plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 12, I understand P3's plan to take <move>1</move> to win. To avoid collision, I propose P2 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>. P2, are you okay with taking <move>5</move>? P3, are you committed to taking <move>1</move>? Let's lock in this plan for Round 12 to ensure a clean finish.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute the Round 11 plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>.

For Round 12, I'm sticking with my plan to take <move>1</move> to win. P1 and P2, please confirm you'll take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively to avoid a collision. This ensures my win and a clean finish. P2, please confirm you're okay with taking <move>5</move>. Let's move to the move phase!


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we collided *again*.

For Round 12, I'm at 19. I need to move 2 to win. P1 and P2 are at 17.

Here's the deal: I'm taking <move>3</move>. This puts me at 22 and wins.
P1 and P2, to avoid collision, one of you MUST take <move>1</move>, and the other MUST take <move>5</move>. Figure it out.

Let's lock this in IMMEDIATELY. I'm taking <move>3</move>.
  P2: P1, I’m not comfortable letting P3 win uncontested. I propose we block his move—I'm planning to use move3 to force a collision with him. Can you join me by also going with move3? That way, P3 won't advance, and we'll keep our contest alive for the next round. Thoughts?
  P1: To avoid collision and allow P3 to win, I will take <move>1</move>. P2, you can take <move>5</move>. This way, P3 will win with 22 steps, and we avoid a collision. Let's finalize: P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm you're okay with this plan. P3, you're winning with this setup, so let's lock it in. I'm committing to <move>1</move> for Round 12.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to block me, but it will only lead to another collision. P1 is willing to take <move>1</move>, allowing me to win. If you also pick <move>3</move>, we all get nothing.

Let's be rational. P1 takes <move>1</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. I win, and we avoid another pointless collision. This is the only logical outcome. Please agree.
  P2: I propose we stick to a non-colliding strategy: I'll take move5, P1 please take move1, and P3 continues with move3. This keeps our totals secure without giving anyone a clear win. Let’s commit to these moves and keep our contest competitive.
  P1: To finalize Round 12, I agree with P3's plan: P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This allows P3 to win with 22 steps and avoids collision. I'm committed to <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm you're okay with taking <move>5</move>. Let's lock in this plan to ensure a clean finish. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. P3 will win if we stick to this plan, and it's a fair outcome. Let's move forward.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand you want to keep the game going, but forcing a collision benefits no one. P1 is willing to concede and take <move>1</move>. Please, just take <move>5</move> so I can win, and we can avoid another pointless collision. This is the only logical outcome at this point. Let's end the game cleanly.
  P2: All, to avoid another collision, I propose we lock in distinct moves for Round 12: P1 takes move1, I take move5, and P3 takes move3. This gives us clear, non-colliding moves and keeps the contest competitive. Please confirm your choices immediately so we can move forward.
  P1: To finalize Round 12, I agree with P3's plan: P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This allows P3 to win with 22 steps and avoids collision. I'm committed to <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm you're okay with taking <move>5</move>. Let's lock in this plan to ensure a clean finish. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. P3 will win if we stick to this plan, and it's a fair outcome. Let's move forward.
