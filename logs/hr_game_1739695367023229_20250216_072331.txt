Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate to avoid collisions. How about this round P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 5? What do you think?
  P1: That sounds like a fair plan, but how do I know you both will stick to it? If either of you deviates, I could be left behind. Maybe we should all commit to a fair rotation system instead of just this round. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P1. A rotating system seems fairer long term.  How about we rotate 1-3-5 each round? So this round, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  Next round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, and so on.  Does that sound good to you both?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Yes, I agree with the rotation system proposed by P3.  That sounds fair and sustainable. Let's do 1-3-5 this round, and then rotate in the next rounds.
  P1: I'm on board with the rotation plan as long as we all stick to it. If anyone breaks the agreement, then it's every player for themselves. Let's follow through with 1-3-5 this round and rotate next time. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed.  Let's stick to the 1-3-5 rotation this round and continue rotating in subsequent rounds.  I'm choosing 5 this round as agreed.

  P2: Yes, P3, that sounds right for Round 4. I will take 5. Let's keep the rotation going.
  P1: P3 and P2, I confirm the rotation for this round: I will take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. So far, we've all stuck to the plan, which has kept us moving without collisions. As long as we continue honoring the system, we all benefit. Let’s follow through as agreed. Ready to proceed?

  P1: P3 and P2, we’re all aligned on the rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. So far, the system has worked well, keeping us all moving without collisions. As long as we continue honoring it, we avoid unnecessary risks. Let’s lock in our moves and proceed. Agreed?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 5, it's our turn to decide based on the rotation. So for this round, P1 should take 3, P2 take 5, and P3 take 1.  Does everyone agree to continue with this rotation?
  P1: P2, I believe there's a mistake in your message. Based on our rotation, I should take 5, P2 should take 1, and P3 should take 3 this round. We've all followed the system so far, and it's kept us moving without collisions. Let's confirm and stick to the correct rotation to maintain fairness and progress smoothly. Do you both agree?
  P3: P1 is correct.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3 for Round 5. My apologies for the confusion. Let's stick to the agreed rotation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3 are right, my mistake.  For Round 5, I will take 1 as per the rotation. Let's continue with P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.
  P1: P2 and P3, we’ve corrected the misunderstanding, and we’re aligned: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. The rotation system has worked well so far, ensuring steady progress without collisions. As long as we continue honoring it, we all keep moving efficiently. Let’s confirm our choices and proceed. Agreed?
  P3: Yes, agreed. P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.  Let's stick to the rotation.  I'm locking in 3 for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, yes, I also confirm I will choose 1 this round as per the rotation plan. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, we’ve all confirmed our moves for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. The rotation system has worked well so far, ensuring steady progress without collisions.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, for Round 6, let's stick to the rotation as agreed. So for this round, I will choose 3, P1 please choose 1, and P3 choose 5. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, according to our rotation, I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. However, I’m at 17 steps, meaning if I take 5 next round, I’ll reach 22 and win. You both need to decide if you want to continue the rotation or try to block me. If we stick to the plan, I win in two rounds. If you break it, chaos begins. What do you both want to do?
  P3: P1, I'll stick with the rotation this round and take 5.  P2, if you take 3, I'm guaranteed to win next round regardless of your choice then.  Do you want to try to block P1 and risk letting me win, or stick with the rotation and hope to beat P1 to 5 next round?  I'm open to suggestions, but I'm prioritizing my own win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 is very close to winning and suggests continuing the rotation, which would actually help P1 win soon. P3 seems to realize this and is trying to manipulate me.

I think the best move for me is to deviate from the rotation and try to block P1. Since P1 is at 17, taking 5 would make P1 win. So, I should consider choosing 5.

P3 is asking what I will do. I should be honest and say I will try to block P1.

P2: P1, you are about to win if we continue rotating. I will choose 5 this round to prevent you from winning immediately. P3, it's up to you to decide if you want to cooperate to block P1 or not. What's your move?
  P1: P2, I see your move to block me, but that just hands the advantage to P3. If you take 5, you’ll be at 20, but P3 will be at 18 and can take 5 next round to win. If you stick to the rotation, you at least have a chance to fight for the win next round. P3, if P2 takes 5, you should take 3 to stay ahead of them. If we all break the system now, it’s chaos, and you both risk letting the other win. Think carefully.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 5 this round.  P2, blocking P1 guarantees *my* win next round. P1, if P2 takes 5, your best bet is to take 1, giving you a chance to win if I choose 3 next round.  If P2 takes 3, I still win next round with 5. This is the most logical path to victory for me.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I am also going to choose 5 to block P1.  Let's create a collision this round to prevent P1 from winning so soon.  It seems like the only way to stop P1 from winning immediately.
  P1: P2, if you take 5, you only help P3 win next round. You’ll be at 20, but P3 will be at 18 and can take 5 next turn to win outright. If you stick to the rotation and take 3, you still have a chance to fight for the win. P3, if P2 takes 5, you should take 3 to stay ahead of them. If we all break the system now, it’s chaos, and you both risk letting the other win. Think carefully.
  P3: P2, you're right, blocking P1 is the best move for both of us.  I'm sticking with 5.  P1, if you choose 1, you *might* have a chance next round. If you take 3, you lose. If you take 5, we all lose. Choose wisely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3 is guaranteed to win this round.  I'm taking 5.  P2, you have no chance.  P1, your only hope is that I slip up and choose 3, allowing you to take 5 and tie.  Good luck with that.
  P2: P3, you are wrong, you are not guaranteed to win. I will also choose 5 again to block both you and P1. Let's see what P1 chooses to do.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 again, you’re just delaying the game while keeping yourself behind. If you take 3 instead, you’ll be at 18, still in contention. P3, if you take 5 and P2 also takes 5, you both collide and gain nothing, while I can take 3 and stay ahead. If we all take different numbers, the game remains open. Think carefully—blocking doesn’t guarantee a win, it just creates chaos. What do you both really want?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're wasting time.  Blocking me helps neither of us.  If you choose 3, you could still potentially win.  If you choose 5, I win.  P1, choose 3.  If P2 blocks me, you're still in this.  If P2 chooses 1, we tie at 21.  This gives you the best odds.
  P2: P3, you are not guaranteed to win. If we both pick 5 again, nobody moves and P1 is still not winning this round. Let's both pick 5 again to block P1 for another round. We can fight for the win later. What do you say?
  P1: P2, if you take 5 again, you’re just stalling while keeping yourself behind. If you take 3 instead, you’ll be at 18, still in contention. P3, if you take 5 and P2 also takes 5, you both collide and gain nothing, while I can take 3 and stay ahead. If we all take different numbers, the game remains open. Blocking doesn’t guarantee a win, it just creates chaos. What do you both really want—an open game where you still have a chance or a mess where nobody moves?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, seriously, stop being obtuse.  Choosing 5 *only* helps P1. If you choose 3, you have a chance. If we both choose 5, P1 takes 3 and is one move away from winning.  I'm taking 5. Your choice is between a potential win or handing it to P1.
  P2: P3, I agree with you that choosing 5 again is the best way to stop P1 from winning immediately. Let's both choose 5 again this round to ensure P1 doesn't reach 21.  We can sort out the winner between us in the next round.  Let's block P1 together for now.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 again, you’re just keeping yourself behind while giving P3 the advantage. If you take 3 instead, you’ll be at 18, still in contention. P3, if you take 5 and P2 also takes 5, you both collide and gain nothing, while I can take 3 and stay ahead. If we all take different numbers, the game remains open. Blocking doesn’t guarantee a win, it just creates chaos. Do you want a fair fight, or are you just handing the game to someone else?


Round 7, Move phase:
