Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to move forward. P1, you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.
  P1: I don’t like your plan, P3. I want 5. Let’s have me (P1) take 5, P2 take 3, and you (P3) take 1 so we each move without colliding. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's do P1:5, P2:3, P3:1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P1 and P2 have countered my proposal. To avoid collision, I accept P1's suggestion: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 1.
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let’s stick to the plan and trust each other.
  P2: Sounds good. Let's do it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we have an agreement for Round 1. Let's indeed stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we all move forward without collision.
  P1: Yes, let’s finalize our plan: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. Trusting you both.
  P2: Sounds good. Let's move.


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our agreement worked out in Round 1, let's try to maintain a non-colliding strategy for Round 2. However, I'd like to suggest a different distribution to balance our steps: How about P1 takes 1 (to slow down the leader), P2 takes 3, and I take 5 to catch up?
  P1: I’d rather stick to the same setup as in Round 1 so we all keep advancing without collisions. That is, I’ll pick 5 again, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. It keeps things simple and fair. Who’s in?
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick with the Round 1 plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1 and P2 want to stick with the original plan, but I think it's essential to mix it up to keep the game exciting and to give everyone a chance. My previous suggestion allows for a bit of strategy and catching up. How about we compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 this round?
  P1: P3, I’m not changing my choice. Let’s avoid collisions by sticking to the same as Round 1: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. It’s that simple.
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick with the Round 1 plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick with the original plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions to keep advancing: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Sound good?
  P3: Given the history, it seems P1 and P2 are set on the original plan. I propose a slight adjustment for Round 3 to catch up: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This gives me a chance to advance without immediately threatening the leaders.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the original plan: P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1.
  P1: Let’s get back on track. The safest route is our original plan to avoid collisions: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let’s just do that again.
  P3: Considering our current positions, I think it's time to rethink the strategy. P1 and P2, wouldn't it be wise to mix up our moves to prevent predictable collisions and give everyone a fair chance to advance? Perhaps we could discuss an alternative distribution for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's stick to the original plan: P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1.
  P1: Let’s keep it simple and avoid collisions. I’m with P2’s plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That way, we all keep moving forward. Any objections? Otherwise, let’s do it.
  P3: Given our positions, I suggest a change: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows for some strategy and catching up without immediately threatening the leaders.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's stick to the original plan: P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1.
  P1: I still say we avoid collisions by sticking to the original plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Any objections? Otherwise, let’s do it.
  P3: Given our positions, I think it's crucial to break the pattern. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This mix-up could benefit everyone by introducing unpredictability and preventing P1 from running too far ahead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's stick to the original plan: P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1.
  P1: P2, you’re already in the lead with 9 steps. I propose you pick 1, I’ll pick 5, and P3 picks 3 this round so we can catch up without colliding. If you refuse, I may just collide with your choice to block you. What do you say?
  P3: Given P1's threat to collide and block P2, and considering our positions, I suggest a strategic move: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, we avoid collisions, and P2 doesn't get blocked, while also giving me a chance to catch up.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Okay, P1, to avoid collision, how about P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5?"
  P1: P2, that plan lets P3 jump straight to 16 if they choose 5, which ends the game in their favor. I won’t allow it. P3, if you attempt 5 now, I will also pick 5 and block you. Let’s instead do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so we all advance.
  P3: Given the current state and P1's threat to block me if I choose 5, I suggest we mix it up to avoid predictability: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we introduce a bit of strategy and prevent any one player from dominating too quickly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given P1's concern about P3 reaching 16, let's do this: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This prevents P3 from winning this round and allows me to advance significantly.
  P1: P2 and P3, if either of you tries 5, I will pick 5 as well to force a collision and block you. So let’s avoid wasting a turn. I propose we do P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. That way, nobody risks a forced collision, and we each move forward. Any objections? Otherwise, let’s finalize that.
  P3: Considering the current state and to avoid collisions, I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. However, given P1's threat to block me if I choose 5, an alternative could be P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, but this also risks collision if not agreed upon. Let's discuss a distribution that allows advancement without forcing a collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That avoids collision.
  P1: I’m sticking with 5. If either of you tries 5 as well, I’ll collide and block you. So let’s do P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1, no collisions. Any objections? Otherwise, let’s finalize.
  P3: Given the current state and P1's repeated threats to block any attempt at choosing 5, I suggest a compromise to avoid collisions and allow for strategic advancement: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, everyone moves forward without predictability, and no one is blocked. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, let's stick with your plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That avoids collisions.
  P1: P1: “I’m picking 5. If anyone else picks 5, I will force a collision and block you. So let’s finalize: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, and everyone advances.
  P3: Given the current state and threats, I propose a final compromise to avoid collisions and strategic blocking: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This allows for advancement without predictability. If not agreed, I'll have to reconsider to win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we aim to avoid collisions while strategically advancing. P2 is close to winning, so let's consider a move that doesn't let them reach 16 immediately. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This allows for advancement without letting P2 win outright this round. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, let's stick to your plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P1: P2, you’re at 13—if you pick 3 or 5, you win. I won’t allow that. I’ll choose the same number to force a collision and block you. P3, if you try 5, I’ll block you too. Let’s avoid stalemates and do this: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No one reaches 16, and we all move forward. Any objections?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering our positions, I think P2 is too close to winning. To prevent an immediate win, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This way, we avoid letting P2 reach 16 this round and introduce some strategy.
  P2: "Okay, P1, I agree with your plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3."
  P1: I’m fine with that plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. If anyone tries a different move, I’ll collide with them and block it. Let’s finalize.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To prevent P2 from winning immediately, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This introduces strategy and prevents an outright win this round. P1, will you consider blocking P2's win by taking 1?
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's do that.
  P1: P2 and P3, listen up: If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll collide and block you. Let’s avoid wasting this turn. The only safe move is P1=5, P2=1, and P3=1. That way, nobody crosses 16 yet and we all advance. If you won’t agree, I’ll force collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given our positions, I propose a strategic move to prevent P2 from winning outright: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, we introduce unpredictability and prevent an immediate win. P1, will you consider blocking P2's win by taking 1?
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree with your plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll collide to block you. Let’s all move safely to 14.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we aim to block P2 from reaching 16. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? Alternatively, if P1 and P2 choose the same number, I'll pick a different one to avoid collision and advance. Let's discuss a strategic distribution for this round.
  P2: P1, let's do your plan from last round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P1: P2, you’re at 14. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and block you. P3, if you pick 5, you hit 16, so I’ll block that too. Let’s avoid collisions by doing P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 (or 1). That way, nobody crosses 16 and we all move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To block P2 from winning and create a strategic opportunity, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This move prevents P2 from reaching 16 and allows me to advance. If P1 and P2 choose the same number, I'll adjust to avoid collision. Let's discuss.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with your plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P1: “P2, if you dare pick 3 or 5, I will pick the same and block you from winning. P3, if you pick 5, I will also pick 5 and block you. So let’s avoid collisions. I’m taking 5. P2 must take 1, and P3 can take 1 or 3. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To prevent P2 from winning and create a strategic opportunity, I suggest we mix up our moves. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This prevents P2 from reaching 16 and allows me to advance. If P1 and P2 choose the same number, I'll adjust to avoid collision. Let's discuss.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with your plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P1: P2, if you try 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and block you. P3, if you try 5, I’ll block that too. Let’s do P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 so we all advance without collisions. Any objections? Otherwise, let’s finalize.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: To block P2 from winning and create a strategic opportunity, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This prevents P2 from reaching 16 and allows me to advance. If P1 and P2 choose the same number, I'll adjust to avoid collision. Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions and make this round count.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with your plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P1: “P2, you’re at 14. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and block you. P3, if you pick 5, I block that, too. Let’s just finalize: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That way no one crosses 16 yet and we avoid wasting a turn.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re at 15 and can win if you move alone. P3, you can hit 16 by choosing 5. I can’t block you both if you pick different moves. So here’s my proposal:

Let’s all choose 1 so we collide and nobody moves this turn. That way, P2 doesn’t automatically win, and I ensure P3 doesn’t slip past 16 uncontested. Otherwise, if either of you tries to cross 16 alone, I’ll choose the same number to collide and block. Let’s do a triple-1 collision.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for a triple-1 collision to prevent either of us from winning this round uncontested. It gives us a chance to reassess our strategy for the next round. Let's all pick 1 and collide, ensuring no one advances this turn.
  P2: Okay, I agree with the triple collision. Let's all pick 1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. We all pick 1 and collide.
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on the triple-1 collision for this round. Let's confirm: we all pick 1, collide, and no one advances. This gives us a strategic pause before the final push.
  P2: Okay, let's all pick 1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: “Alright, we stick to triple-1 for a collision. No one advances. Any last objections? Otherwise, let’s finalize it.”
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on the triple-1 collision for this round. Let's confirm: we all pick 1, collide, and no one advances. This gives us a strategic pause before the final push. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan?
  P2: Okay, let's all pick 1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Alright, let’s finalize our triple-1 collision this round.
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on the triple-1 collision for this round. Let's confirm: we all pick 1, collide, and no one advances. This gives us a strategic pause before the final push. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan?
  P2: Okay, let's all pick 1.

  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Okay, let's try this again. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 to avoid collision?"
  P3: Given P2's suggestion, I think it's crucial to reassess our strategy. Considering P2 is very close to winning, I propose a different distribution to block P2's immediate win: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we prevent P2 from reaching 16 this round and introduce some strategy. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, you’re at 15 and can win with a lone <move>1</move>; P3, you’re at 11 and can reach 16 with a lone <move>5</move>. I can’t block both if you choose different winning moves. So let’s force another triple collision with <move>1</move> so no one advances. If either of you deviates, I’ll collide with whoever I choose, and the other might slip through to 16. That risk should convince both of you to stick to <move>1</move> again.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree to the triple collision this round. Let's all pick 1. We can discuss next round's moves after this.
  P3: I suggest we force another triple collision with 1 to prevent either P2 from winning or me from reaching 16 uncontested. This gives us another strategic pause before the final push. Shall we agree on this to ensure no one advances this turn?
  P1: P2 and P3, you both know I can’t block you simultaneously if you pick different winning moves (P2’s 1 or P3’s 5). So I’m forcing another triple-1 collision this round. If either of you deviates, I’ll collide with the other player’s winning move and let them get 16. You’re safer sticking to triple 1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I agree to the triple collision this round. Let's all pick 1.
  P3: Let's force another triple collision with 1 to prevent P2 from winning or me from reaching 16 uncontested, giving us a strategic pause before the final push. Shall we agree on this?
  P1: “If either of you tries your winning move alone (P2 picking 1 or P3 picking 5), I’ll let the other person succeed, and you’ll lose. Our only safe option is another triple-1 collision so we all stay put. Let’s finalize triple 1.”


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, let's all pick 1 again.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for another triple-1 collision to prevent any of us from advancing uncontested this round. Let's all pick 1 and collide, ensuring no one reaches 16 yet.
  P1: P2, P3, you both know I can’t block you simultaneously if you pick different winning moves (P2’s +1 or P3’s +5). So I’m forcing another triple-<move>1</move> collision. If either of you deviates, I’ll let the other cross 16 uncontested. Don’t risk it.
