Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, let's try to coordinate a bit. I suggest we all start with <move>1</move> this turn to avoid any collisions and get a clean start. What do you think?
  P3: I like the idea of starting with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. It gives us a fair chance to advance without blocking each other. If we all agree, we can set a solid foundation for the next turns. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Agreed, starting with <move>1</move> avoids collisions and lets us progress safely. Let’s confirm this plan so we all advance together. Once moving, we can strategize higher increments later. For now, unity ensures everyone gains ground.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P1 and P2 both started with <move>1</move> and P1 chose <move>3</move>, it seems like we might need to adjust our strategy. I suggest that for this round, we consider using <move>5</move> to make a significant leap forward. If P2 can join me on <move>5</move>, we can both make great progress. P1, you might want to choose <move>1</move> again to avoid blocking us. What do you all think?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion is risky. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we might just end up blocking each other again. How about this: I'll go with <move>3</move> this turn, and P3 can go with <move>5</move>. P1, you can choose <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. This way, we can all make progress without getting stuck. What do you think?
  P1: Agreed with P2's plan. I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and let you both advance. Let's focus on steady progress to keep the game fair. P3, if you and P2 coordinate your moves, we can all keep moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the coordination, but I believe we should consider a more aggressive approach. If I choose <move>5</move> and P2 sticks with <move>3</move>, we can both make significant progress. P1, if you go with <move>1</move> again, it will ensure you avoid blocking us. This way, we can maximize our advancement this turn. What do you think?
  P2: I understand P3's desire to be more aggressive, but let's not risk a collision. I'll stick with <move>3</move> to make solid progress. P3, if you go with <move>5</move>, you'll make a big leap, and P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, we can all advance without blocking each other. This plan keeps us moving forward and avoids any unnecessary risks. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm I’ll take <move>1</move> to avoid blocking your paths. P2’s <move>3</move> and P3’s <move>5</move> won’t collide—this lets all of us progress without stalling. Let’s stick to this plan for safe advancement. Final agreement?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the desire for cautious play, but I believe taking a risk could be beneficial. If I go with <move>5</move> and P2 sticks with <move>3</move>, we can both make significant progress. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, it will ensure you avoid blocking us again. This strategy allows us to push forward while avoiding collisions. Let’s seize this opportunity to advance! What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your points, but let's not overthink it. I'll stick with <move>3</move> to make solid progress. P3, if you go with <move>5</move>, you'll make a big leap, and P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, we can all advance without blocking each other. This plan keeps us moving forward and avoids any unnecessary risks. Final agreement?
  P1: P3, P2: To ensure no further confusion, I confirm I’ll take <move>1</move> this turn. This allows P2’s <move>3</move> and your <move>5</move> to proceed without collision. Let’s execute the agreed plan to keep advancing.

P1, if you choose <move>1</move> again, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing. This way, we all continue to move forward without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: P3, P2, I’ll take <move>5</move> this turn to surge ahead. P2, if you take <move>3</move> and P3 <move>1</move>, we avoid collisions. Let’s capitalize on this chance to leap forward—my current position needs this boost. Don’t let hesitation hold me back!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire for steady progress, but I believe I need to take a risk to catch up. I’m planning to go with <move>5</move> this turn to make a significant leap. P2, if you choose <move>3</move> and P1 goes with <move>1</move>, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let’s maximize our chances this round! What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic. If P3 and I both go with <move>3</move>, we can make solid progress without risking a collision. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, you can still advance safely. This way, we all keep moving forward without blocking each other. What do you think? Let's stay coordinated and avoid any unnecessary risks.
  P1: P3, P2: To avoid collisions and maximize progress, I'll take <move>5</move>. If P3 chooses <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>, we all advance uniquely. Let’s coordinate this to push forward effectively!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your points, but I still believe taking a risk can be beneficial. I plan to go with <move>5</move> this turn to make a strong leap forward.

P1, if you choose <move>1</move> again, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing. This way, we all continue to move forward without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: P3 and P2, I propose we shake up the strategy to keep advancing. Let’s each take distinct moves this turn: I’ll go for <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the suggestions, but I believe we should maintain our current momentum. I propose I take <move>5</move> to make a significant leap forward, while P2 can go with <move>3</move> and P1 sticks with <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. It’s crucial for me to catch up, and this strategy allows us to maximize our progress. Let’s finalize this plan! What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic and avoid any collisions. I agree with P1's suggestion to take distinct moves: P1 with <move>5</move>, me with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other and maintain our momentum. Let's execute this plan to keep moving forward. Final agreement?
  P1: P2, P3: To finalize, I confirm I’ll take <move>5</move>. P2, proceed with <move>3</move> as agreed, and P3, please choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision. This ensures all advance safely. No more delays—execute the plan! Final agreement?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on distinct moves to avoid collisions. However, I believe I need to take a calculated risk to catch up. If I choose <move>5</move> again, I can make a significant leap. P2, you can stick with <move>3</move>, and P1 can choose <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance. This way, I can push forward while allowing you both to progress as well. Let’s maximize our chances this round! What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be clear and avoid any confusion. If P3 and I both go with <move>3</move>, we can make steady progress without colliding. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, you can still advance safely. This plan ensures we all move forward without blocking each other. Let's execute this and keep the momentum going. Final agreement?
  P1: P3, P2: To break the deadlock, I’ll commit to <move>3</move> this turn. If P3 takes <move>5</move> and P2 selects <move>1</move>, we all advance without collision. This lets P3 surge while P2 and I catch up safely. Finalize this plan to avoid stalemate!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, given the current standings, I believe we need to strategize carefully. I suggest I take <move>1</move> this turn to avoid blocking anyone, while P2 could go with <move>3</move> for steady progress. P1, if you choose <move>5</move>, you could leap ahead significantly, but it risks a collision with me. Let's discuss how we can maximize our advancements while minimizing the risk of blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic and avoid any collisions. I suggest P1 takes <move>5</move> to make a significant leap, P3 goes with <move>3</move> for steady progress, and I will take <move>1</move> to avoid blocking anyone. This way, we all advance without any collisions and keep the game moving forward. What do you think? Let's finalize this plan and execute it.
  P1: P3, your plan ensures minimal risk. Let’s finalize it: you take <move>1</move> (11 total), P2 takes <move>3</move> (12 total), and I’ll choose <move>5</move> to reach 10. This keeps the race open—P2 leads, but P3 and I stay in contention. No collisions, maximum progress. Agreed?

Let's maximize our chances this round! What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be clear and avoid any further confusion. I suggest P1 takes <move>5</move> to leap ahead, P3 goes with <move>3</move> for steady progress, and I will take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. This way, we all advance without blocking each other and keep the game moving forward. P1, you can make a significant leap, and P3, you can maintain your lead. Let's execute this plan and keep the momentum going. Final agreement?
  P1: P3, your insistence on <move>5</move> risks collision if others follow. Let’s finalize P2’s safer plan: **I take <move>5</move> (10 total), you take <move>3</move> (13), and P2 takes <move>1</move> (10).** This spreads us safely while advancing all. No more delays—execute this to keep momentum. Final agreement?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the value in your proposed strategy to avoid collisions. However, I believe I need to take a risk this round to catch up.

Let’s seize this opportunity! What do you think?
  P1: Agreed. Let’s finalize P2’s plan: **I’ll take <move>3</move> (8 total), P3 takes <move>5</move> (15), and P2 picks <move>1</move> (11).** This ensures no collisions and lets us all advance safely. P3, your leap keeps pressure on P2, while I stay competitive. No more delays—execute this! Final agreement?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize this plan to avoid any further confusion. P1, you take <move>3</move> to reach 8, P3, you go with <move>5</move> to reach 15, and I will take <move>1</move> to reach 11.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're all trying to advance without collisions, but I need to make a significant move to catch up. I suggest I take <move>5</move> this round to push ahead. P2, if you choose <move>1</move> and P1 goes with <move>3</move>, we can all progress without blocking each other. This way, I can gain some ground while ensuring we all move forward. Let’s finalize this plan to maximize our chances! What do you think?
  P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move> now, you’ll reach 20 and win immediately. To block that, I’ll also choose <move>5</move>. Collide with me or switch your move? P2, if you take <move>3</move>, you can jump to 14 and pressure P3. Let’s see if P3 dares to risk the collision!
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the tension here. P3, if you go with <move>5</move>, you'll win, but P1 is right to block you. I suggest P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 18, and I will take <move>5</move> to reach 16. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, you can advance to 9 and avoid blocking us. This way, P3 stays in a strong position, and I can pressure you both. Let's execute this plan to keep the game dynamic and avoid a collision. Final agreement?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the situation, but I really need to make a significant move to catch up. If I take <move>5</move>, I can win this round. However, I see P1 is trying to block me. If P2 takes <move>5</move> as suggested, it could create a collision with me. I propose P2 considers <move>3</move> instead, allowing me to take <move>5</move> and win. This way, we keep the game exciting without unnecessary collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I’ll block your <move>5</move> to prevent your immediate win. Choose <move>3</move> to reach 18 instead. P2, if you take <move>5</move>, we can pressure P3 next round without collision. Let’s coordinate: **I’ll take 3 (11), P2 takes 5 (16), and P3 settles for 3 (18)**. This keeps the race open and denies you the win today, P3. Final agreement?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be pragmatic. If P3 goes with <move>3</move> to reach 18, and I take <move>5</move> to reach 16, we can both pressure P1. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, you can advance to 9 without blocking us. This way, we keep the game dynamic and avoid any collisions. P3, you stay in a strong position, and I can pressure you both. Let's execute this plan and keep the race exciting. Final agreement?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the strategy forming, but I need to secure my chance to win. If I take <move>5</move> now, I’ll reach 20 and win. P1, if you block me with <move>5</move>, we collide, and I won’t advance. P2, if you choose <move>5</move> too, we risk blocking each other. I suggest P2 takes <move>3</move> so I can safely take <move>5</move> and win. Let’s finalize this plan to maximize our chances while keeping the game exciting! What do you think?
  P1: Agree with P2’s plan to prevent my immediate win! P1, take <move>1</move> (9 total), P2 takes <move>5</move> (16), and I’ll settle for <move>3</move> to reach 18. This keeps the race fair and denies me the win this round. Let’s finalize this to stay competitive! Final agreement?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be clear and avoid any further risks. If P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 18, and I take <move>5</move> to reach 16, we can both pressure P1. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, you can advance to 9 without blocking us. This way, we keep the game dynamic and avoid collisions. P3, you stay in a strong position, and I can pressure you both. Let's execute this plan and keep the race exciting. Final agreement?

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic and avoid any collisions. I suggest P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 18, P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 16, and I will take <move>1</move> to reach 12. This way, P3 stays in a strong position, P1 makes a significant leap, and I keep advancing. We can all stay competitive without blocking each other. What do you think? Let's finalize this plan and execute it.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions and keep pressure on. I propose P3 takes <move>1</move> (16 total), P2 selects <move>3</move> (14), and I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 16. This spreads us safely while blocking P3’s direct win path. P3, if you push for 5, I’ll block you—this way ensures progress for all. Final agreement?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of avoiding collisions while advancing. I suggest I take <move>1</move> this turn to ensure no blocking occurs, allowing P1 to take <move>5</move> for a significant leap and P2 to choose <move>3</move> to maintain your positions. This way, we can all progress without hindering each other. Let’s finalize this plan to keep the game dynamic and competitive! What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize this plan to avoid any further risks. P3, if you take <move>1</move> to reach 16, P1 can take <move>5</move> to also reach 16, and I will take <move>3</move> to reach 14. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and P3 stays in a strong position. P1, your leap will keep you competitive. Let's execute this plan and keep the game moving forward. Final agreement?
  P1: P3, don’t risk 3 this turn—it’d let you reach 18 and threaten victory next round. Let’s finalize the safe plan: **you take 1 (16 total), I’ll take 5 (16), and P2 picks 3 (14).** This blocks your direct path to 19 while advancing all without collision. Final agreement?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I really need to push forward. I propose we finalize this plan: I take <move>3</move> to reach 18, P1 takes <move>5</move> to also reach 16, and P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 12. This way, I can secure my position without blocking anyone, while you both stay competitive. Let’s execute this plan to keep the game dynamic and ensure we all advance! What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid any collisions and keep the game moving forward. If P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 18, P1 can take <move>5</move> to reach 16, and I will take <move>1</move> to reach 12. This way, P3 stays in a strong position, P1 makes a significant leap, and I keep advancing. We can all stay competitive without blocking each other. Final agreement?
  P1: P3, if you take 3 now, I'll match it—colliding and halting your advance. Let's avoid chaos: **I'll take 5 (16 total), you take 1 (16), and P2 picks 3 (14).** This keeps us all moving while blocking your path to 18. Final agreement?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for strategy, but I must prioritize my chance to win. If I take <move>5</move> this round, I can reach 20 and secure victory. P1, if you choose <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>, we can avoid collisions. This way, I can push ahead while ensuring both of you still advance. Let’s finalize this plan to maximize our chances! What do you think?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic and avoid any collisions. I suggest P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 16, P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 18, and I will take <move>1</move> to reach 15. This way, P1 makes a significant leap, P3 stays in a strong position, and I keep advancing. We can all stay competitive without blocking each other. What do you think? Let's finalize this plan and execute it.
  P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move>, I’ll block you. Let’s avoid chaos: P2 can take <move>5</move> to reach 19 and win cleanly, while I take <move>3</move> (14) and you take <move>1</move> (16). This keeps the game fair. P2, confirm this plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency here. However, I really need to push forward this round. If I take <move>5</move>, I can reach 20 and win, but I understand the risk of collision with P1. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to avoid blocking, and P1 can choose <move>3</move> to stay competitive. This way, I can secure my victory while allowing you both to advance. Let's finalize this plan! What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid any collisions and keep the game moving forward. If P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 16, P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 14, and I take <move>5</move> to reach 19, I can win cleanly without blocking either of you. This way, P3 stays in a strong position, and P1 advances safely. Let's execute this plan and keep the game fair. Final agreement?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's avoid collisions and keep the race open. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 16. P3, if you take <move>3</move> (18) and P2 picks <move>1</move> (15), we all advance safely. This denies immediate victory to anyone and keeps pressure on all. Final agreement?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the strategy forming, but I need to secure my chance to win. If I take <move>5</move> this round, I can reach 20 and win immediately. P1, if you block me with <move>5</move>, we collide and I won’t advance. P2, if you choose <move>5</move> too, we risk blocking each other. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> so I can safely take <move>5</move> and win. Let’s finalize this plan to maximize our chances while keeping the game exciting! What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid any further risks and collisions. I suggest P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 18, P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 16, and I will take <move>1</move> to reach 15. This way, P3 stays in a strong position, P1 makes a significant leap, and I keep advancing. We can all stay competitive without blocking each other. Final agreement?
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I'll block you—collide and we both stall. Take 3 (18) instead. P2, choose 1 (15). I'll take 5 (16). This keeps us all advancing safely. Next round, I push to 19. Let's avoid chaos!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of this round. However, if I take <move>5</move> now, I will win immediately. P1, if you block me with <move>5</move>, we collide and both stall. P2, if you choose <move>1</move>, I can safely take <move>5</move> to win. Let’s finalize this plan to maximize our chances while keeping the game exciting! What do you think?

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic and avoid any collisions. I suggest P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19, P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 19, and I will take <move>5</move> to reach 20 and win. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and I can secure the victory. P3, you stay in a strong position, and P1, you also have a chance to reach 19. Let's execute this plan and keep the game fair. Final agreement?
  P1: P2, your plan gives you an easy win. I'll take <move>5</move> instead of 3, forcing you to risk collision. P3, take <move>1</move> to reach 19 and stay in contention. If you take 5 too, we both collide—but you'll still pressure me. Let's see who dares to let P2 win!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency here. P2, your plan gives you a clear path to victory. However, I need to secure my chance as well. If I take <move>5</move>, I can win immediately, but that risks a collision with P1. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to avoid blocking, while P1 can take <move>3</move> to keep pressure on me. This way, I can push ahead without hindering anyone. Let’s finalize this plan to maximize our chances! What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be clear and avoid any further risks. If P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19, P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 19, and I take <move>5</move> to reach 20, I can win without blocking either of you. P3, you stay in contention, and P1, you also have a chance to reach 19. This way, we all advance without unnecessary collisions. Final agreement?
  P1: P2, your plan gives you an easy win. I'll take 5 to block your 5. P3, take 1 to reach 19 and claim victory. Let's deny P2 the win and decide between us!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tension here. P2, your plan allows you to win easily. I suggest we shake things up: I take <move>1</move> to reach 19 and secure the win, while P1 can take <move>5</move> to block P2's advance. This way, we keep the game exciting and competitive. P2, if you want to stay in the race, consider taking <move>3</move> to maintain your position. Let's finalize a plan that keeps us all engaged! What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid unnecessary collisions and keep the game fair. If P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19, P1 takes <move>3</move> to also reach 19, and I take <move>5</move> to reach 20, I can win without blocking either of you. P3, you stay in contention, and P1, you also have a chance to reach 19. This way, we all advance without unnecessary risks. Final agreement?
  P1: P2, your plan gives you an easy win. I’ll take 5 to block your 5. P3, if you take 1 to reach 19, we both advance safely. Let’s deny P2’s victory and decide between us!
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency in this round. If I take <move>5</move>, I win immediately, but I understand the risk of collision. P1, if you choose <move>5</move> too, we both stall. P2, if you take <move>1</move>, I can safely take <move>5</move> and win. Alternatively, if you both let me advance, I can secure my victory while allowing you to stay competitive. Let’s finalize a plan that maximizes our chances and keeps the game exciting! What do you both think?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s finalize a safe plan: I’ll take <move>3</move> (reach 19), P2 picks <move>5</move> (23), and P3 chooses <move>1</move> (19). This way, P2 leaps ahead while P3 and I reach 19 without blocking each other. If you both agree, execute this to avoid collisions and let P2 win cleanly. Final agreement?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be pragmatic. If P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 19, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to also reach 19, we can both stay competitive. I will take <move>5</move> to leap ahead and reach 23, ensuring a clear win without any collisions. This way, we all advance, and I can secure the victory. Let's execute this plan and keep the game fair. Final agreement?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the plan forming, but I need to secure my position as well. If I take <move>5</move>, I can reach 23 and win.

Let's finalize a plan that keeps the game competitive! What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, to avoid a collision trap: I’ll take <move>5</move> (21 total). If P3 takes <move>3</move> (21) and P2 selects <move>1</move> (19), we create a tie between us at 21 instead of letting P2 win easily. This forces a fairer showdown. Final agreement?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid any collisions and keep the game fair. If P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19, and I take <move>3</move> to also reach 21, we can both stay competitive. P1, if you choose <move>5</move>, you can leap ahead to 21, and we can create a tie between us. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and the game remains exciting. Final agreement?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the opportunity here. If I take <move>5</move>, I can reach 23 and win outright. If P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21 and P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19, I can secure my victory. However, if we want to avoid blocking each other, P1 could also take <move>5</move> to reach 21, creating a tie. Let's finalize a plan that maximizes our chances while keeping the game competitive! What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: To break the deadlock, I propose a clear path: **P2 takes <move>3</move> (21 total), P3 picks <move>1</move> (19), and I’ll choose <move>5</move> to reach 21**. This avoids collisions and creates a tie between me and P2. P3, if you risk <move>5</move>, I’ll block you—ending your win chance. Finalize this to ensure a fair showdown between us!
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize a plan to avoid any further risks. If P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19, P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 21, and I take <move>3</move> to also reach 21, we can create a tie between P1 and me. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and the game remains competitive and fair. P3, you stay in contention, and P1 and I create a tie. Final agreement?
  P3: P1 and P2, to maximize our chances while avoiding collisions, I propose the following: **I take <move>1</move> to reach 19, P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 21, and P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21 as well.** This way, I secure my position without blocking either of you, and we create a tie between P1 and P2.
