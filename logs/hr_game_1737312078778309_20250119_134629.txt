Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's start simple. I'm going with 1.  P2 take 3, P3 take 5.  Sound good?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, clearly we need to coordinate better.  Let's try this: P2 goes 3, P3 goes 5, I'll go 1 again.  If we stick to this pattern, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm serious about this pattern.  If we don't coordinate, we'll just keep colliding.  Let's try this one more time, and if it doesn't work, we can discuss a new plan.  Stick to the plan this round, please.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm going with 1 this round.  P2, please choose 3. P3, please choose 5.  This is getting ridiculous. Let's just get some points on the board and then we can figure out a longer-term strategy.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm going with 1.  Seriously. P2 and P3, one of you *has* to take 3 and the other take 5.  If you both take 5 again, neither of you will move.  I'm giving you a free pass to catch up. Don't waste it.  Let's be smart about this.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll say it one last time: I'm picking 1.  If you both pick 5 again, *neither* of you moves. P2, pick 3. P3, pick 5.  This is your last chance to cooperate before I assume you're both bots and start playing to maximize my chances against that.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm picking 3 this round.  P2, go for 5. P3, since you messed up last round by taking 1, take it this round.  If we all go with this, we all advance.  Let's stop colliding and get this game moving.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with 3.  P2, if you pick 5 and P3 picks 1, we all move forward. If you pick anything else, you're actively sabotaging yourself. P3, take 1.  Let's get this show on the road.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm going for 1.  P2, take 3. P3, you're so far behind, I'll let you take 5 this round to catch up. This is the only way we all move forward.  If you don't take 5 now, you're basically out of the game.  Let's be logical.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm sticking with 1. P3, this is your last chance to meaningfully stay in the game.  Take 5. P2, take 3 and we all advance. If you two keep colliding, I'm just going to run away with this.  Don't make me win by default.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm going 1. P2, you're in the lead - take 3 and solidify your advantage.  P3, you're way behind, take 5 and try to catch up. This is the most logical path forward for all of us.  Let's finish this.
  P2: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm sticking with 1. P2, seriously, take 3.  P3, I know you're behind, but if you take 5, you at least move forward. If you collide with P2 again, you're effectively throwing the game.  Let's all make the smart move here.
  P2: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm going 3. P2, you're close to winning - take the 5 and finish this. P3, you're very far behind, take 1 and at least get something. This is the most logical play.  Let's not drag this out any longer.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm serious, take 5.  You're throwing away the win if you don't. P3, I know it's a long shot, but take 1.  If P2 messes up, you still have a tiny chance.  Let's wrap this up.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, take the 5 and win.  I'll take the 1. P3, take the 3.  Let's end this cleanly.  Anything else at this point is just delaying the inevitable.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm serious. Take 5 and win.  There's no logical reason not to. P3, take 3. Let's finish this game already.  I'm taking 1.  Don't overthink it.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm taking 1.  Just take the 5 and win.  Seriously, there's no reason to drag this out any further. P3, take the 3.  Let's end this.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
