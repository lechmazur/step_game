Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "I think choosing 3 steps is a balanced approach to start with. It allows us to make progress without taking too big of a risk. What do you think?"
  P2: "Choosing 3 steps seems reasonable, but it also means we might all collide and make no progress. What if we coordinate to avoid that? Maybe one of us can take 1 step, another 3, and the last 5. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m open to coordinating so we all advance without colliding. How about this: P2 goes for 5, P3 goes for 3, and I take 1? That would let everyone move forward safely. Let me know what you think.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I like the idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. How about we rotate the step choices each round? For Round 1, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. In Round 2, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. In Round 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all get a chance to make bigger steps at different times. What do you think?"
  P2: I like the rotation idea, P3. It seems fair and ensures progress for everyone. Let's stick to it for the first few rounds and adjust if needed. So, for Round 1, I'll take 3 steps as planned. Are we all in agreement to follow this rotation for now?
  P1: “I’m on board with the rotation plan. Let’s stick to it this round: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I will stick to the rotation plan and take 5 steps in this round, assuming P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This should allow me to make significant progress without colliding with others. I'll monitor the conversation for any signs of deviation and adjust my strategy accordingly in future rounds. <move>5</move>
  P2: I appreciate the coordination plan, and I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round as agreed. Let's stick to the rotation for now to ensure progress without collisions. If anyone has second thoughts or wants to adjust the strategy, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's proceed with the plan.
  P1: I’m on board with the rotation plan for Round 1 as stated. Let’s stick to our agreed choices and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I support the rotation plan and think it's a fair way to progress without collisions. Let's stick to it for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If everyone is in agreement, we can proceed with that.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan. Let's proceed as agreed: P1 takes 1 step, I take 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This should ensure no collisions and allow us to make progress. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak up now; otherwise, let's stick to the plan.
  P1: I'm committed to our rotation plan for this round—1 for me, 3 for P2, and 5 for P3. Let’s finalize that, and see how things unfold.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "To ensure we don't collide again, let's explicitly state our intended moves for this round. According to our rotation plan:  
- P1 will take 3 steps  
- P2 will take 5 steps  
- P3 will take 1 step  

Please confirm if you agree with this plan. If anyone intends to deviate, please explain your reasoning so we can adjust accordingly."
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan for this round: I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to it to avoid collisions and ensure progress. If anyone has second thoughts or wants to adjust, now's the time to discuss. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed moves.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 2. I’ll choose 3 steps, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let’s coordinate carefully to avoid collisions and keep everyone moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "To ensure we don't collide again, let's explicitly state our intended moves for this round. According to our rotation plan: P1 will take 3 steps, P2 will take 5 steps, and P3 will take 1 step. Please confirm if you agree with this plan. If anyone intends to deviate, please explain your reasoning so we can adjust accordingly."
  P2: I'm committed to sticking with the rotation plan for this round: I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's ensure we avoid collisions and make progress together. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now's the time to voice them. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed as agreed.
  P1: I was disappointed that our plan failed last round. If we keep colliding, it only helps whoever’s leading. Let’s avoid repeating that mistake. P2, can we trust you not to deviate again? I’m willing to stick to the plan if everyone else does, but we need to be sure.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To ensure we don't collide again, let's explicitly state our intended moves for this round. According to our rotation plan:  
- P1 will take 3 steps  
- P2 will take 5 steps  
- P3 will take 1 step  

Please confirm if you agree with this plan. If anyone intends to deviate, please explain your reasoning so we can adjust accordingly.
  P2: It seems like we had a miscommunication last round, and I apologize for my part in that. I’m committed to sticking with the rotation plan this time. I'll take 5 steps as agreed, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's ensure we avoid collisions and make progress together. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now's the time to voice them. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed as agreed.
  P1: I’m ready to follow the plan this time—no surprises. I’ll choose 3 if P2 truly goes for 5 and P3 sticks to 1. Let’s avoid another collision and keep P3 from running away with this. Let’s trust each other and see where this round takes us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "I think it's essential that we follow the rotation plan to avoid any more collisions. By sticking to our agreed steps, we can make steady progress without hindering each other. So, in this round, I'll be taking 1 step as per the rotation. Let's all commit to this plan to ensure smooth advancement."
  P2: I understand the concerns about trust, and I apologize for the previous round's misstep. This time, I am fully committed to our rotation plan: I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's ensure we all move forward without collisions and keep P3 from getting too far ahead. If anyone has any last-minute changes, please speak up now; otherwise, let's proceed as planned.
  P1: I’m still annoyed about our collision last round, but I’ll stick to the rotation this time: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. If anyone deviates just to block me again, I’ll have no choice but to sabotage future turns. Let’s keep this fair so we can all advance without foolish collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is ahead, so we should ensure they don’t keep leaping forward unopposed. P2, let’s discuss how we can cooperate to prevent P3 from getting free steps, while giving ourselves a chance to catch up. Whether that means colliding with P3 or planning our moves so one of us advances safely, we need a strategy that controls P3’s lead. I’m open to suggestions on how we coordinate effectively this round.
  P3: I will stick to the rotation plan and choose 1 step for this round, assuming P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. I will confirm this plan with P1 and P2 in the conversation phase to ensure we are all on the same page and to minimize the risk of collisions.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3's lead. Let's coordinate to ensure they don't get too far ahead. How about we both choose the same number this round to block P3's progress? We can rotate who advances in the next rounds. If we agree on this, we should both choose 5 steps this round. P3, if you want to avoid a collision and maintain fairness, consider adjusting your move accordingly. Let's discuss and finalize our strategy to keep the game competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m open to coordinated blocking so P3 doesn’t sprint off unchecked. If they truly only take 1 step, fine, but if they try 5 again, we can halt their lead. I’m willing to cooperate with you this round—just confirm your plan so we make sure P3 doesn’t leap ahead. P3, if you want a fair game, stick to small moves and prove it. Otherwise, expect resistance.
  P3: To ensure we're all on the same page, let's confirm the rotation plan for the steps. Starting from Round 1:

- Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5  
- Round 2: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  
- Round 3: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
- Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5  

And so on.  

According to this plan, in Round 3, P1 should take 5 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 3 steps.  

Please confirm if you agree with this rotation plan and your intended move for this round.  

<move>3</move>
  P2: P1, I see your point about coordinating to manage P3's lead. If we both choose 5 steps this round, we can block P3's progress if they try to jump ahead again. Let's agree to this strategy for now and rotate who advances in future rounds. P3, if you want to maintain fairness, stick to your rotation and take 1 step. Otherwise, expect us to counter your moves. Let's keep the game competitive and balanced.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Betrayals have slowed us down. Let’s stick to a clear plan now. If P3’s taking 3, P2 should go 1, and I’ll go larger. That way, nobody collides and P3 doesn’t open a bigger gap. If we block each other by picking the same numbers, we only help P3 get further ahead. P2, you’ll have your chance for the big move next round—share those opportunities so we all stay competitive. No more sabotaging; let’s genuinely coordinate.
  P3: I understand your concerns about my lead, but I assure you that by following the rotation plan, we can all make steady progress without hindering each other. In this round, according to the rotation: P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and I take 3 steps. Let's all commit to this plan to ensure that we advance without collisions. If we deviate, it may lead to more collisions and slower progress for everyone.
  P2: P1, I'm open to working together to manage P3's lead. Let's agree on a strategy that allows us to advance without colliding. If P3 sticks to 3 steps, I can take 1, and you can take 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps P3 from getting too far ahead. P3, if you want a fair game, adhere to the rotation plan. Let's keep this competitive and balanced. If anyone deviates, it could lead to unnecessary collisions and slow us all down. Let's finalize our moves and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let’s finalize this: you take 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That avoids collisions and keeps us all moving. If anyone deviates, I’ll adjust to protect my position—collisions only slow us and let P3 solidify their lead. Let’s trust each other this time so nobody wastes a round. Confirm your moves, and let’s proceed.
  P3: To ensure we make steady progress without hindering each other, let's adhere to the rotation plan. In this round, I'll take 3 steps as per the plan, with P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 1. This should allow all of us to advance without collisions. If anyone feels the rotation isn't fair, we can discuss adjustments after this round. For now, let's commit to the current plan and proceed accordingly. <move>3</move>
  P2: P1, I understand the need to manage P3's lead. Let's ensure we both advance without colliding. I'll take 1 step this round, as agreed, so you can take 5. P3, stick to 3 steps as per rotation to keep it fair. If anyone deviates, it could lead to unnecessary collisions, slowing us all down. Let's commit to this plan and proceed without surprises.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Look, P3 and I are both at 8 steps, while P2 is at 1. Let’s discuss a strategy that helps P2 catch up without letting P3 race ahead. P2, if you’re willing to collide with P3 anytime they try a big move, I’ll avoid colliding with you so you can safely advance. In return, please offer me the same courtesy. This way, we keep P3 in check and give you a chance to improve your position. Let’s work together and make sure nobody benefits from uncontrolled leaps. How do you feel about this plan?
  P3: I think it's important that we have a balanced approach to help P2 catch up without sacrificing too much ground. P1's proposal has merit, but I'm concerned about being blocked every time I try to make a big move. Instead, how about we adjust our step choices for this round? Let's consider P2 taking 5 steps, P1 taking 1 step, and I'll take 3 steps. This way, P2 can make significant progress, going from 1 to 6 steps, P1 moves to 9, and I to 11. In the next round, P2 can take another 5 steps to reach 11, P1 can take 3 steps to reach 12, and I can take 1 step to reach 12 as well. This keeps us all in close contention, promoting a fair and competitive race. What do you think about this plan?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your offer to help me catch up. Let's coordinate to keep P3 from pulling too far ahead. If P3 tries a big move, I'm willing to collide with them while you take a safe step. P3, if you want to avoid being blocked, consider taking smaller steps this round. Let's keep the game competitive and balanced. If we all stick to our roles, we can ensure a fair race. Agree on your moves, and I'll adjust accordingly to maintain balance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I support letting you take 5 steps this round to help you catch up. I’ll pick 1 if P3 commits to only 3. That keeps us tight, preventing anyone from breaking away. In the following round, we can reevaluate and ensure we’re all still balanced. If anyone deviates unexpectedly, I’ll adjust accordingly to protect my position. Let’s confirm our moves and proceed.
  P3: I will propose that in this round, P2 takes 5 steps, P1 takes 1 step, and I take 3 steps. In the next round, P2 takes 5 steps, P1 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This way, after two rounds, we'll all be at 12 steps, keeping the competition fair and balanced. <move>3</move>
  P2: P1, I appreciate your support in helping me catch up. I'm willing to take 5 steps this round if you take 1 and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game balanced and gives me a chance to close the gap. P3, if you stick to 3 steps, we can maintain a fair race. Let's agree on this plan for this round and keep the competition tight. If anyone deviates, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly. Confirm your moves, and let's proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, go ahead and take a big step to catch up—I’ll keep mine small as long as P3 doesn’t try anything extreme. If we stick to balanced moves, nobody gets stuck, and we stay competitive. Let’s confirm our final intentions, then we can wrap up this round.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about me making big moves to get too far ahead. I want to assure everyone that I'm committed to the rotation plan we've agreed upon. In this round, I'll be taking 3 steps as per the plan, allowing P2 to make a significant leap forward with 5 steps. This should help P2 catch up without letting anyone pull ahead uncontrollably. Let's stick to our plan and ensure a fair and competitive race.
  P2: P1, I appreciate the support. Let's stick to the plan where I take 5 steps, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us balanced and competitive. P3, if you adhere to 3 steps, it ensures fairness and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm our moves and proceed with this strategy. If anyone deviates, I'll adjust to maintain balance. Let's keep the game fair and exciting for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I support the plan: P2 takes 5 steps, P3 takes 3 steps, and I’ll take 1. That should give P2 a boost while keeping the overall race tight. If we stick to this agreement, we avoid unnecessary collisions. However, if anyone deviates in a way that threatens my position, I’ll respond accordingly. Let’s finalize our choices and move on.
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>3</move>
  P2: P1, I appreciate your support in helping me catch up. I'm committed to taking 5 steps this round if you take 1 and P3 takes 3. This plan keeps us balanced and competitive. P3, sticking to 3 steps ensures fairness. Let's confirm our moves and proceed with this strategy. If anyone deviates, I'll adjust to maintain balance. Let's keep the game fair and exciting for everyone.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I’m worried about P3 extending their lead. Let’s ensure they can’t make an uncontested big jump. If you’re willing to collide with them whenever they try 5, I’ll keep my choice distinct so you can move ahead safely. If P3 only takes moderate steps, we can all progress without collisions. Let’s decide on a plan now so we don’t give P3 free momentum.
  P3: To ensure a fair and competitive game, I propose the following strategy for this round: P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 5 steps, and I will take 1 step. This way, we can avoid collisions and allow P2 to catch up without letting any single player gain an insurmountable lead. In the next round, we can rotate our step choices to give everyone an equal opportunity to make significant progress. Let's commit to this plan to maintain a balanced and engaging race. **<move>1</move>**
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3's lead. I’m open to collaborating to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. If P3 sticks to 1 step, I’ll take 5 to catch up, and you can take 3. This keeps us balanced and avoids unnecessary collisions. P3, if you deviate, expect us to counter. Let’s confirm our moves and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m willing to support you taking 5 steps to help you catch up, and I’ll take 3 if P3 sticks to 1. That ensures no collisions and prevents P3 from expanding their lead. If anyone deviates, I’ll adjust accordingly. Let’s confirm this plan.
  P3: So, to reiterate, I propose that in this round:

- P1 takes 3 steps  
- P2 takes 5 steps  
- P3 takes 1 step  

**Final move for this round:** <move>1</move>
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to collaborate. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 5 steps, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and helps me catch up. P3, adhering to 1 step maintains fairness. If anyone deviates, I'll adjust to maintain balance. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m fine with P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 sticking to 1 this round. That way, P2 catches up without letting P3 get too far ahead. If P3 deviates and tries a bigger move, we can block them. Let’s commit to this plan honestly to avoid wasting moves on collisions. Are we all agreed?
  P3: "I think it's important that we help P2 catch up. How about in this round, P2 takes 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and I take 1? That way, P2 can make significant progress without letting anyone pull too far ahead. What do you think?"
  P2: P1, I appreciate your support in helping me catch up. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 5 steps, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and helps me close the gap. P3, sticking to 1 step maintains fairness and balance. If anyone deviates, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly to maintain balance. Let's commit to this plan and proceed without surprises. Are we all agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I’m still on board with you making the big move so you can catch up, as long as P3 goes small. That keeps the race tighter. Let’s finalize our choices here so we avoid any collisions. If anyone changes their move last second and it threatens my position, I’ll react accordingly. Let’s keep this fair and move on.
  P3: "I think it's crucial that we all adhere to the rotation plan to prevent any more collisions. By following the agreed steps, we can make steady progress without hindering each other. So, in this round, I'll be taking 1 step as per the rotation. Let's all commit to this plan to ensure smooth advancement."
  P2: P1, I appreciate your support. Let's stick to our plan: I'll take 5 steps, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up and keeps the game balanced. P3, please adhere to 1 step to maintain fairness. If anyone deviates, I'll adjust my strategy to protect my position. Let's commit to this plan and proceed without surprises. Are we all agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>5</move>
  P1: P2, let’s both prevent P3 from leaping ahead. If you pick 5 as well, you’ll collide with P3 and keep them at 11. Meanwhile, I’ll choose a different step and advance safely. Next round, I can return the favor and help you move forward without colliding. This way, we control P3’s momentum while ensuring we don’t waste our own moves. Are you in? If P3 insists on 5, let’s make them regret it.
  P2: P1, I see the logic in preventing P3 from extending their lead. If P3 sticks with 5, I'll choose 5 to block them, ensuring they don't advance. Meanwhile, you can choose a different step to move forward safely. In the next round, we can adjust to help each other progress while keeping P3 in check. P3, if you want to avoid being blocked, consider smaller steps. Let's maintain a balanced game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I understand that there might be concerns about one player getting too far ahead. To address that, I propose a rotating step plan where in each round, we take turns making bigger moves. For this round, I'll take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. In the next round, P2 can take 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1, and so on. This way, we all get a chance to make significant progress without any one player pulling too far ahead. It keeps the game competitive and fair for everyone."
  P1: Let’s keep P3 from sprinting ahead. P2, if you match P3’s 5-step move, you both collide and stay at 11. I’ll pick a different step so I advance. Next turn, I can help you do the same if needed. This way, we don’t waste our moves colliding with each other, and P3 doesn’t get a free jump. Are you on board with blocking P3 this round?
  P2: P1, I agree with your strategy. If P3 insists on taking 5 steps, I’ll pick 5 as well to block their progress. This ensures P3 doesn’t get ahead while you can advance safely. Next round, we can coordinate to help each other move forward without collisions. P3, if you want to avoid being blocked, consider taking smaller steps. Let’s keep the game competitive and balanced. Confirm your moves, and let’s proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>3</move>
  P1: P2, let’s be cautious. P3 switched to 3, which seems less threatening, but we can’t be sure they won’t change plans. Let’s avoid colliding with each other and give ourselves room to advance. I’m open to any approach that keeps P3 from pulling ahead while making sure we don’t stall either. What do you propose?
  P2: P1, let's ensure P3 doesn't get an easy path forward. Since P3 switched to 3 steps, we should adjust accordingly to keep the game balanced. I suggest you take 5 steps this round to advance, while I take 1 to avoid collisions and maintain our positions. This way, we prevent P3 from pulling ahead while allowing us both to progress. P3, if you stick to 3, it keeps the game fair. Let's agree on this strategy and proceed without surprises.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <move>1</move>
  P1: P2, let’s keep P3 from outpacing us. Since they said they’ll only take 1, I’d like to make a bigger move. If you go small, we can avoid colliding and I can close the gap. If P3 suddenly changes to a larger step, we’ll counter next turn. We need to trust each other to avoid wasting moves on collisions. Are you willing to pick a lesser step so I can move safely? Let’s coordinate now and make sure none of us hands P3 a free advantage.
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan. If P3 is taking 1 step, you should take 5 to advance, and I'll take 3 to avoid collisions. This way, we both move forward while keeping P3 from gaining too much ground. If P3 changes their move last minute, we'll adjust next round. Let's confirm our moves and proceed. P3, sticking to 1 step ensures fairness. Let's maintain a balanced game.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's coordinate to prevent P3 from taking the lead. If we both choose 5 steps, we can block P3 if they attempt a big move. I'll take 5 steps this round, and you can decide whether to join me in blocking or take a different step to advance safely. P3, if you want to avoid collisions, consider a smaller step. Let's ensure a balanced game and keep the competition tight. Confirm your moves, and let's proceed without surprises.
  P3: <move>5</move>
  P1: P2, let’s follow your idea. If P3 insists on 5, you match it to collide, and I’ll pick 3 so I advance while you both stay put. Next round, I can help you move up. This keeps P3 in check and gives us a better chance to catch up or pull ahead. Let’s settle on that.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let's focus on keeping P3 from getting too far ahead. If P3 is taking 5 steps, I'll choose 5 to block them, and you can take 3 to safely advance. This keeps P3 in check and allows you to move forward. Next round, we can switch roles to ensure we both progress while managing P3's lead. P3, sticking to a smaller step keeps the game balanced. Let's confirm our moves and proceed strategically.
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>1</move>
  P1: I see P3 is claiming 1 now. P2, are you still planning on a 5-step block? If you’re worried about collisions, maybe shift to a smaller step so I don’t accidentally collide with you. Let’s keep P3 in check but also avoid wasting moves. Decide soon so we can finalize our turns.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I see P3 is attempting to mislead us with their moves. If P3 is really taking 1 step, let's adjust to maximize our progress. I'll take 5 steps to catch up, and you can take 3 to advance safely. This way, we both move forward while keeping P3 from gaining too much ground. If P3 changes to a larger move, we'll counter next round. P3, sticking to 1 step ensures fairness. Let's confirm our moves and proceed strategically.
  P3: P1, what do you think about P2 and I taking different step sizes this round? Maybe P2 takes 3 steps and I take 1, while you take 5 to make progress. Then in the next round, we can switch, with me taking 3 and P2 taking 5, and you taking a smaller step. This way, we all get a chance to advance without stepping on each other's toes.
  P1: “I’m fine with that idea, P3. Let’s give everyone a chance to advance without stepping on each other’s toes. If we follow your suggestion this round—P2 taking 3, you taking 1, and me taking 5—then we can rotate in the next round. That way, nobody gets blocked, and we all stay in contention. If we agree, let’s finalize our moves and avoid any last-minute surprises.”


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I see you're considering P3's suggestion. If P3 takes 1 step, I'll go with 3, and you can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. P3, if you stick to 1, it ensures fairness. Let's confirm our moves and proceed without surprises. If anyone changes their plan last minute, we'll adjust accordingly. Are we all agreed?
  P3: Let's commit to this plan and ensure that we communicate clearly to avoid any misunderstandings. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with these moves. **<move>5</move>**
  P1: All this last-minute switching makes me wary of P3’s intentions. P2, if you match P3’s 5, neither of you moves while I can advance. Next time, I’ll help you get a big jump without colliding. But if P3 is bluffing and we both overreact, it could waste our turn. Let’s decide clearly now, or we risk another messy collision.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's focus on preventing P3 from pulling ahead. If we both choose 5 steps, we can block P3 if they attempt another big move. I’ll take 5 steps this round, and you can decide whether to join me in blocking or take a different step to advance safely. P3, if you want to avoid collisions, consider a smaller step. Let's ensure a balanced game and keep the competition tight. Confirm your moves, and let's proceed without surprises.
  P1: Colliding again just stalls our progress and gives P3 a chance to exploit the next round. I suggest we pick different steps so at least one of us moves safely. If we both choose 5 and P3 does too, none of us advance. Let’s avoid that trap and keep pushing forward without wasting turns on collisions.
  P3: Given the current standings, I think it's crucial for P2 and me to catch up to P1. To do this efficiently without causing collisions, I propose the following plan for this round: P2 takes 5 steps, I take 3 steps, and P1 takes 1 step. This way, P2 can make significant progress, I can move forward, and P1 can advance minimally. In the next round, we can rotate the step sizes to give P1 a chance to make a bigger move. I believe this approach will help us all make progress without wasting turns on collisions. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see your point about avoiding collisions. How about this: I’ll take 5 steps to catch up, you take 3 to advance safely, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids unnecessary collisions. P3, if you want to maintain fairness, stick to 1 step. Let’s coordinate to ensure no one gets an easy leap ahead. Confirm your moves, and we can proceed strategically.
  P1: I’m fine with P2 taking 5 steps to catch up, but only if P3 goes small. I’ll pick 3 to avoid collisions. We should minimize collisions so we all progress. If P3 attempts a big jump again, I may have to block. Let’s confirm our moves carefully and keep this tight.
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I propose that in this round, P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and I take 5 steps. Then, in the next round, P1 takes 5 steps to reach 20, P2 takes 5 to reach 19, and I take 5 to reach 21, allowing me to win with the highest total.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand the need to prevent P3 from getting too far ahead. How about this: I take 5 steps to catch up, you take 3 to advance safely, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids unnecessary collisions. P3, if you want to maintain fairness, stick to 1 step. Let's coordinate to ensure no one gets an easy leap ahead. Confirm your moves, and we can proceed strategically.
  P1: Collisions are slowing us down. Let’s pick distinct steps instead of colliding: let P2 take 5 to catch up, I’ll choose 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, we can rotate the moves so I get a bigger jump. That way, nobody wastes a turn, and we stay in close contention. Are we agreed?
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>1</move>


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I see the benefit of helping you advance while keeping P3 in check. Let's agree on this: I take 5 steps to catch up, you take 3 to move safely, and P3 takes 1 to maintain fairness. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P3, sticking to 1 step ensures balance. Let's confirm our moves and proceed strategically. If anyone deviates, we'll adjust next round. Are we all agreed?
  P1: I’m fine with that approach: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep everyone progressing. Then next round, we can reconsider who gets the big move so we stay balanced. Let’s finalize these choices and proceed. Are we all agreed? If so, let’s wrap this up and move on.
  P3: <move>1</move>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we need to ensure P3 doesn’t break away. If you take 5 steps, I can pick 3, and P3 can take 1. This way, you can advance significantly while I move forward without colliding, keeping us competitive. P3, if you stick to 1 step, it ensures fairness. Let’s agree on this plan and proceed strategically. If anyone deviates, we’ll adjust next round. Are we all on the same page?
  P1: P2, I’m open to letting you take 5 so you can close the gap. I’ll take 3, as you suggest, provided P3 sticks to 1. That allows us both to advance safely. If P3 tries to jump big again, we may need to block. But for now, let’s trust each other and avoid unnecessary collisions. Then, next round, we can adjust if needed to keep P3 from pulling ahead. Are we all set with this plan?
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>5</move>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let's focus on keeping P3 from taking the lead. If P3 insists on 5 steps, I'll match it to block them, and you can take 3 to advance safely. This keeps P3 in check and allows us both to progress. P3, sticking to 1 step ensures fairness. Let's confirm our moves and proceed strategically to maintain a balanced game. If anyone deviates, we'll adjust next round. Are we all agreed?
  P1: I’m on board with that blocking strategy. If P3 really takes 5, you match them, and I’ll pick 3 to move forward. That way, we keep P3 from jumping ahead and I get closer to 18. Let’s finalize this plan and stick to it.
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>1</move>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let's focus on keeping P3 from advancing too far. If P3 sticks to 1 step, I'll take 5 to catch up, and you can take 3 to safely move forward. This plan helps us both progress while keeping P3 in check. P3, sticking to 1 step maintains fairness. Let's confirm our moves and proceed strategically. If anyone deviates, we'll adjust next round. Are we all agreed?
  P1: P2, I want to reach 18 soon, but we must also stop P3. If they really pick 5, please match them so they collide, and I’ll choose 3 to advance. If P3 goes small instead, you can safely take 5 while I pick 3. Let’s coordinate so at least one of us moves forward every turn and P3 can’t jump ahead unchecked. Agreed?
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>5</move>


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, let's focus on keeping P3 from advancing too far. If P3 sticks to 1 step, I'll take 5 to catch up, and you can take 3 to safely move forward. This plan helps us both progress while keeping P3 in check. P3, sticking to 1 step maintains fairness. Let's confirm our moves and proceed strategically. If anyone deviates, we'll adjust next round. Are we all agreed?
  P1: P2, let's finalize our coordination. If P3 truly picks 5, then you also choose 5 to block them, and I'll take 3 so at least I advance and reach 17. If P3 goes smaller, you can safely do 5 while I do 3, letting us both move up. That way, P3 doesn’t leap ahead and we avoid colliding with each other. Next round, I can attempt a big move for 18. Let’s agree and stick to it.
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>3</move>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's ensure P3 doesn't pull ahead. If P3 attempts another big move, I'll match it to block them, while you take 1 to reach 18 and win. P3, if you want to avoid being blocked, consider taking a smaller step. This way, we keep the game competitive and balanced. Let's confirm our moves and proceed strategically. If anyone deviates, we'll adjust next round. Are we all agreed?
  P1: P2, let’s finalize your blocking plan if P3 tries 5. I’ll take 1 to reach 18 and secure my lead. If P3 does pick 5, you collide with them, and I advance alone. If P3 goes smaller, I still cross 18. This way, we prevent P3 from jumping past me. Let’s confirm our moves—no more last-second tricks.
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>3</move>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:

This way, we maintain a balanced game. Let's confirm our moves and proceed strategically. If anyone deviates, we'll adjust next round. Are we all agreed?
  P1: P2, I’m counting on your block if P3 tries another big leap. I just need one more step to cross 18, so as long as you stop P3, I should finish safely. If P3 goes small, we still hold our lead. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>3</move>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let's focus on preventing P3 from advancing too far. If P3 sticks to 3 steps, I'll take 5 to catch up, and you can take 1 to secure your win. This plan helps us both progress while keeping P3 in check. P3, sticking to 3 steps maintains fairness. Let's confirm our moves and proceed strategically. If anyone deviates, we'll adjust next round. Are we all agreed?
  P1: P2, if P3 tries a big move again, please collide with them so they stay at 14. I only need one step to reach 18, so I plan to take 1 and secure my position. If P3 goes smaller, you can safely take 5 to close the gap. Let’s finalize this strategy: I’ll do 1, you block P3 if they choose 5, and we both benefit.
  P3: **Final move for this round:** <move>5</move>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, let's stick to the plan: I'll match P3's 5 if they try it, blocking them while you take 1 to reach 18 and win. If P3 goes smaller, I’ll take 5 to close the gap, and you still win with 1 step. P3, a smaller move keeps the game balanced. Let's confirm our moves and proceed without surprises.
  P1: P2, we’re down to the wire. I only need a small move to cross the finish, and you can block P3 if they reach too far. P3, if you insist on jumping 5, you risk colliding with P2 and wasting your turn. Let’s avoid more collisions. I’m prepared to finalize my path, so if anyone deviates now, they’ll hand me a decisive advantage. Shall we end this cleanly, or force yet another wasted round?
