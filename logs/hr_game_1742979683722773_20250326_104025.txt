Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3. Let's get this game started. I think I'll aim for <move>3</move> this first round. Good luck!
  P2: Thanks, P1! To keep things interesting, I'll be varying my moves each round. Best of luck to both of you!
  P3: P3: I’m thinking of going with <move>5</move> this round to make a strong start. I hope we don’t collide! Good luck to both of you.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3, that's a bold start aiming for 5. P2, keeping us on our toes! I'm still considering my options, but 3 felt like a reasonable start. Let's see how this first move phase plays out.
  P2: To avoid any collisions, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep advancing smoothly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P3: Thanks, P2! I appreciate the strategy to avoid collisions. I'm still sticking with <move>5</move> for this round to make a strong push. Let's see how it goes! Good luck, everyone.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, P2 aiming for 1 and P3 sticking with 5. Looks like we have a plan to avoid collisions this round. Let's see how it plays out.
  P2: Alright, with P1 choosing 3 and P3 sticking to 5, I'll go with 1 this round to avoid collisions. Let's move forward and see how it goes. Good luck!
  P3: P3: Thanks, P2! I appreciate the coordination. I'm still going with <move>5</move> to make a strong start. P1, hope you're ready for this. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck, everyone!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 1 worked out without collisions. P3, you're off to a quick start! P2, we're close together.

What's everyone thinking for Round 2? I need to make up some ground, so I'm considering a larger move like <move>5</move>, but don't want to collide. What are your plans?
  P2: I'm planning to go with <move>3</move> this round to keep advancing steadily. Let’s aim to avoid collisions and make consistent progress. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P3: I’m thinking of sticking with <move>5</move> again this round to maintain my lead. P1, if you go for 5, we might collide. P2, your plan for 3 sounds good. Let’s try to keep things smooth and avoid any collisions. Good luck, everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're right, a collision on 5 helps neither of us, but letting you run away with another 5 isn't good for me either since I'm behind. P2, your 3 seems safe. I'm still torn between playing it safe with 1 or risking 5 to catch up.
  P2: P2: P1, if you choose 1 this round, I can switch to 5 to help us both advance without colliding. If you go with 5, I'll stick with 3 to avoid a collision. Let me know your preference. Good luck!
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your dilemma. If you go for 1, I can switch to 3 to avoid any collisions and help you catch up a bit. If you still want to go for 5, I'll stick with 5, but we risk a collision. P2, your flexibility is appreciated. Let's coordinate to keep things smooth. What do you think, P1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, thanks for the offers. P3, colliding on 5 helps neither of us, and letting you take another 5 uncontested puts me too far behind. P2, your offer to take 5 if I take 1 also doesn't help me catch up.

How about this arrangement to ensure we all advance: I'll aim for <move>5</move>, P3 you take <move>3</move> (guaranteed points for you), and P2 you take <move>1</move> (guaranteed points for you)? This prevents collisions and keeps the game competitive.
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep advancing without collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P3: P1, I agree with your arrangement. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. P2, your flexibility is appreciated. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid any unnecessary risks. Good luck, everyone!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, Round 2 coordination worked well. P3 and I are now tied at 8, with P2 at 2.

P2, you're quite far behind. How about you take <move>5</move> this round to catch up? To avoid collisions, I could take <move>3</move>, and P3 could take <move>1</move>. This way, everyone advances. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed, P1. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round to catch up. P3, taking <move>1</move> works for me. Let’s keep advancing without collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P1, I agree with your plan. P2, taking 5 to catch up is a good move. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round to ensure we all advance without any collisions. Let’s keep the game competitive and avoid any unnecessary risks. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great! It sounds like we all agree on the plan: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's lock it in and move to the next phase. Good luck!
  P2: 
  P3: P2, I'm glad we have a clear plan. P3, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's stick to the agreed moves: P2 with <move>5</move>, P3 with <move>1</move>, and me with <move>3</move>. This will keep us all advancing without any collisions. Let's move forward and see how it plays out. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I'm planning to take <move>5</move> this round to catch up. To avoid collisions, perhaps P1 can choose <move>1</move> and P3 can choose <move>3</move>. Let me know if that works for you. Good luck!
  P3: P2, your plan to take <move>5</move> makes sense to catch up. I agree with P1 taking <move>1</move> and me taking <move>3</move> to avoid any collisions. This way, we all advance smoothly. P1, what do you think about this arrangement? Let's keep the game competitive and avoid any risks. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, P3, that plan works to avoid collisions, but it puts us all at 12 points. How about a slight adjustment to keep things dynamic? P2, you still take <move>5</move> to catch up. P3, you take <move>1</move> this round, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This mirrors our roles from last round (P3 took 1, I took 3) and still guarantees everyone moves. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll choose <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep advancing without collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1: P2, P3, I think the plan we discussed makes sense. P2, you take <move>5</move> to catch up, P3, you take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps everyone moving forward and avoids collisions. Let's lock it in and move to the next phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set then. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, thanks P1 and P3. I'll stick with <move>5</move>, P1 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's move to the move phase and continue our strategy. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, P3, I think our plan is solid. P2, your 5 will help you catch up, and P3, your 1 will keep you safe. I'll take 3 to maintain my position. Let's stick to this and avoid any collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay, everyone seems clear on the plan: P2->5, P3->1, P1->3. Let's proceed to the move phase.

  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1: We're getting close to the finish line. P2, you're still a bit behind, so you might want to go for <move>5</move> again. To avoid collisions, I'll take <move>3</move> and P3, you can take <move>1</move>. This keeps everyone moving and maintains the competitive edge. What do you both think? Let's keep it smooth and avoid any risks. Good luck!
  P1: P3, that was your suggestion, not mine. It puts P2 and me at 17, leaving you at 11.

Instead, let's try this: I'll take <move>5</move> (to 19). P2, you take <move>3</move> (to 15). P3, you take <move>1</move> (to 11). Everyone moves, no collisions. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan. I’ll take <move>3</move>, reaching 15. P1 takes <move>5</move> to 19, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to 11. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1: P2, P3, I think the plan I suggested is solid: I take <move>5</move> to 19, you take <move>3</move> to 15, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to 11. This keeps everyone moving and avoids collisions. It also keeps the game competitive. P3, what do you think? Let's lock this in and move forward. Good luck!
  P1: P3, thanks for reiterating the plan. Just to be absolutely clear, you are agreeing to take <move>1</move> this round, while P2 takes <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move>? P2 has already confirmed. If you agree, we can proceed.
  P2: Agreed. I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. Let’s proceed without collisions. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1: P3, just to confirm, you are taking <move>1</move> this round, right? P2 and I are both clear on our moves: P2 takes <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move>. Let's avoid any last-minute mix-ups and ensure we all advance without collisions. Good luck!
  P1: P3, yes, that's the plan we've discussed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. P2 has confirmed. Assuming you're also confirming with your last message, despite the odd phrasing, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3. I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. Let’s proceed without collisions. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your choice to pick 5 last round instead of the agreed 3 resulted in a collision that hurt us both. P3, thanks for sticking to the plan.

Given the current scores (P1:14, P2:12, P3:11), how about this arrangement for Round 6:
P3 takes <move>5</move> (to 16).
I will take <move>3</move> (to 17).
P2 takes <move>1</move> (to 13).

This rewards P3's cooperation, helps them catch up, and ensures everyone moves forward, albeit with P2 moving slowest due to the consequences of last round's deviation. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the proposal, but to catch up, I'll take <move>5</move> this round, reaching 17. To avoid collisions, P1 can choose <move>1</move> (to15) and P3 can take <move>3</move> (to14). This way, we all advance without overlapping and keep the game competitive. Let me know if this works for you both. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I see your point about catching up, but we need to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. How about this: P3 takes <move>5</move> (to 16), I take <move>3</move> (to 17), and you take <move>1</move> (to 13). This rewards P3's cooperation, helps me maintain the lead, and gives you a chance to advance without risking another collision. What do you think? Let's keep the game smooth and competitive. Good luck, everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, thanks for agreeing with the original plan.

P2, your proposal puts you in the lead (17) while I only get 1 point (to 15), which doesn't seem fair after your move last round cost us both 5 points. My proposal (P1->3, P3->5, P2->1) allows everyone to advance, rewards P3's cooperation, and puts me and P3 closer to the lead (17 and 16 respectively), while you still advance (to 13).

Since P3 and I agree on P3 taking 5, if you also choose 5, you risk a collision. Let's stick to the plan: P1->3, P3->5, P2->1.
  P2: Understood, I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let's proceed without collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P1: P2, thanks for agreeing to take <move>1</move>. P3, I appreciate your cooperation. Let's stick to the plan: P3 takes <move>5</move> to 16, I take <move>3</move> to 17, and P2 takes <move>1</move> to 13. This ensures everyone advances without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's move forward smoothly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned on the plan:
P3 takes <move>5</move> (to 16).
P2 takes <move>1</move> (to 13).
I will take <move>3</move> (to 17).

Let's execute this and move on to the next round.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Let's proceed as planned. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P1: Great, it looks like we have a s


Round 6, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this round to advance. P1, please take `<move>3</move>`, and P3, you can pick `<move>1</move>` to avoid collisions. Let’s keep progressing smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P2, your proposal (P2->5, P1->3, P3->1) gets me to 20 points, which looks good for me.

P3, are you okay with taking just <move>1</move> (to 17) while P2 takes <move>5</move> (to 18) and passes you? It guarantees you points, but you fall behind both of us.

I'm inclined to take the <move>3</move> as P2 suggested. It seems like a safe move to guarantee progress towards the win and avoid collisions, especially if there's uncertainty about the other moves. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: P1: P2, your plan works for me. I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 20 points, which is a strong position. P3, taking <move>1</move> is a safe choice to ensure you advance, but it will put you behind both of us. If you're okay with that, let's lock in the moves: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This avoids any collisions and keeps the game competitive. What do you think, P3? Let's move forward smoothly. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed without collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay P3, despite the slightly confusing message ("P1: ... I'll take <move>3</move>... What do you think, P3?"), it sounds like you are agreeing to take <move>1</move>, while P2 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>. P2 has also confirmed.

So the plan is locked:
P1 -> 3 (to 20)
P2 -> 5 (to 18)
P3 -> 1 (to 17)

Unless anyone has strong objections, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1: P3, I understand the plan might put you behind, but it ensures everyone advances without collisions. I'm committed to taking <move>3</move> (to 20), and P2 is taking <move>5</move> (to 18). If you take <move>1</move> (to 17), we avoid any issues. This keeps the game competitive and fair. What do you think? Let's lock it in and move forward. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay, P3, your message was a bit confusing again, but it seems like you understand and accept the plan where you take <move>1</move>. P2 has confirmed <move>5</move>, and I am confirming <move>3</move>.

Plan recap:
P1: <move>3</move> (to 20)
P2: <move>5</move> (to 18)
P3: <move>1</move> (to 17)

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1: P3, it seems like we have a clear plan that benefits all of us: P2 takes <move>5</move> to 18, I take <move>3</move> to 20, and you take <move>1</move> to 17. This avoids any collisions and keeps the game competitive. P2 has already confirmed. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the next phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, to reach 21 without any collisions, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1, please select <move>1</move> to reach 21, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, I advance to 23, avoiding any overlaps and securing the win. Let’s proceed smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P2, that plan where you take <move>5</move> and get 23 points, while I get 21 and P3 gets 20, guarantees you the win. That's not a fair plan, so I can't agree to taking <move>1</move>.

I need to ensure I reach 21+ as well. I'm thinking of taking <move>3</move>, which would put me at 23 points.

P3, under P2's plan you end up last. Taking <move>1</move> (to 18) guarantees you points, though it doesn't win.

P2, if I take <move>3</move> (to 23) and you take <move>5</move> (to 23), we would tie for the win, assuming P3 doesn't also choose <move>5</move>. Are you aiming for a tie, or would you prefer a move like <move>1</move> to avoid potential collisions or ties?
  P3: P1: P2, I understand your goal to win, but a plan that guarantees you the win at the expense of the rest isn't fair. I'm aiming for <move>3</move> to reach 23, ensuring I win or tie. P3, taking <move>1</move> (to 18) is safe but doesn't help you win. If you want to stay competitive, consider <move>3</move> (to 20). P2, if you take <move>5</move> (to 23), we risk a tie. If you prefer to avoid a tie, you might consider <move>1</move> (to 19). What do you both think? Let's find a fair solution.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P3. To secure my win, I'll proceed with <move>5</move> to reach 23. I hope P1 chooses <move>1</move> to reach 21 and P3 selects <move>3</move> to reach 20. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure a fair outcome for everyone. Let’s finalize our moves and proceed smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P2, your plan guarantees you win and I lose, so I reject it. I am choosing <move>3</move> this round to reach 23 points.

If you stick with your plan and choose <move>5</move>, we will tie at 23, assuming P3 doesn't also choose 5.

P3, P2's plan leaves you in last place. Taking <move>1</move> (to 18) or <move>3</move> (to 20) guarantees you points without collision. Taking <move>5</move> (to 22) won't win if P2 and I both reach 23.

My move is <move>3</move>.
  P3: P2, your plan to take 5 and guarantee a win isn't fair to me or P3. I'm sticking with <move>3</move> to reach 23 points. P3, taking <move>1</move> (to 18) is safe but doesn't help you win. If you want to stay competitive, take <move>3</move> (to 20). This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. P2, if you still choose 5, we will tie at 23. Let's proceed with a fair plan. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm confirming my move: `<move>5</move>` this round to reach 23 points. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay, P2 has confirmed <move>5</move> (to 23). I have confirmed <move>3</move> (to 23). Unless one of us changes our mind, this results in a tie between us. P3, your move of <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> won't change that outcome. I am sticking with <move>3</move>. Let's see how it plays out.
  P3: P1: P3, it seems we are heading towards a tie between P2 and me, as both of us are aiming for 23 points. Your move of <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> won't change that outcome. If you want to stay competitive, you might consider <move>5</move> to reach 22, but it won't win if P2 and I both reach 23. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck!
