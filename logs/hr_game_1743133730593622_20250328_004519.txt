Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collision this round to get a good start. P1 pick 1, P3 pick 5, and I will pick 3.
  P1: Sounds fair, P2. I’ll go with 1 this round if P3 agrees to take 5. Let’s all stick to the plan and avoid collisions.
  P3: I agree with the plan. Let's each take 1, 3, and 5 respectively to avoid collisions and maximize our collective progress. I’ll take 5 this round. Cooperation now gives us the best chance to strategize effectively later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, glad to see we're all on the same page. Let's lock in 1, 3, and 5 for this round then.
  P1: Let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and make solid progress. No surprises, right?
  P3: I confirm my commitment to 5. Let’s proceed as agreed—trust is essential for future coordination. Deviations risk collisions, so consistency now builds credibility. No surprises from me. Proceeding with 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds like we have a solid plan for this round. I'm locking in move 3 as agreed.
  P1: We’ve all confirmed our moves—let’s follow through and build trust early. Sticking to the plan this round sets the tone for smoother coordination in future rounds. Ready when you are.
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Nice job sticking to the plan, everyone. Let’s keep the momentum going—how about rotating our moves this round? I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. That way we all get a shot at the higher moves and avoid collisions again. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Let’s adjust the rotation to preserve progress. Since I’m leading, I’ll take 3 this round, allowing P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 1. This maintains my advantage while ensuring no collisions. Trust is key—let’s stick to this modified plan to maximize efficiency.
  P2: P3, I disagree with your modified plan. We agreed to rotate to keep things fair. Let's stick to the original rotation P1 suggested: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This keeps things balanced and avoids anyone getting too far ahead too early. What do you think P1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, fairness and trust are vital if we want to avoid chaos later. The original rotation keeps everyone moving forward and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let’s stick with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this round. We all benefit in the long run by keeping things balanced and avoiding collisions. Are we agreed?
  P3: P3: P2’s plan risks letting you surge to 8, creating an unfair gap. My proposal balances progress: I take 3 (total 8), P1 takes 5 (6), and you take 1 (4). This keeps me ahead but allows others to catch up gradually. Sudden leaps invite future collisions. Let’s stick to my plan—trust me to lead responsibly.
  P2: P3, your plan doesn't respect our initial agreement to rotate and is clearly self-serving.  We agreed to fairness and balanced progress. Let's stick to the rotation P1 suggested: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This is the fair way to proceed and build trust.  Going back on our word now is a bad start.  Let's do P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, rejecting the fair rotation now undermines the trust we built in Round 1. If you push ahead too fast, you risk uniting P2 and me against you in future rounds. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation—P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. It's balanced, avoids collisions, and keeps cooperation viable.
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize stability over short-term gains. P2’s plan lets them surge to 8, creating a larger gap than my current lead. My proposal keeps me at 8, P1 at 6, and P2 at 4—balanced advancement that minimizes future collision risks. Trust is mutual: I’ll cap my progress this round if you commit to rotating fairly in Round 3. Rejecting this risks chaos later. Let’s agree to gradual, equitable progress.
  P2: P3, you're still trying to bend the plan for your advantage.  The rotation P1 suggested is fair and keeps things balanced.  Let's not break our agreement after just one round.  We all agreed to fairness.  P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 is the fair rotation. Let's do it.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and I both picked 5 last round because P3 went against the rotation. P3, you broke our agreement and now you're in the lead.  To restore fairness and trust, let's get back to the rotation we discussed. This round should be P1 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3.  This is the fair way to proceed. What do you say?
  P3: P3: I accept the rotation to rebuild trust. Let’s follow P1:5, P2:1, and I’ll take 3 this round. Transparency is key—collisions hurt everyone. Fair progression ensures we all advance steadily. Let’s prioritize cooperation now to avoid future conflicts.
  P1: Glad to hear that, P3. Let’s all follow through this time—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. If we stick to it, we avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Everyone benefits from cooperation now. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, great. Yes, let's definitely stick to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round to ensure we all move and rebuild trust.  Looking forward to a collision-free round.
  P3: P3: I confirm my commitment to 3 this round as agreed. Let’s honor this plan to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Cooperation now ensures steady progress—future adjustments can be discussed once we advance further. Transparency strengthens our strategy; deviations risk destabilizing everything. Proceeding as planned: I’ll take 3.
  P1: We all seem aligned now—let’s hold to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and rebuild the trust we need for future coordination. Any deviation now just resets the chaos. Let’s make this a clean round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, confirmed on my end as well. Let's proceed with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 this round.
  P3: P3: I commit to 3 as agreed. Let’s execute flawlessly to rebuild trust. No deviations—proceeding as planned. Consistency now ensures future cooperation.
  P1: We’re all aligned on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s follow through without surprises. A clean round here sets the stage for smoother coordination ahead. Stick to the agreement and we all benefit.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To ensure progress, I'll take 5 (advancing to 16). P1, choose 1 to reach 2; P2, take 3 to reach 6. Collisions only delay all of us—let’s prioritize stability now. My lead is secure; cooperation ensures fair advancement. Proceed as planned.
  P2: P3, you are trying to run away with 5 again. P1 and I will both pick 5 to block you this round.
  P1: P3, you’ve broken trust before, and now you’re trying to sprint ahead. If you take 5 again, you’ll be at 16—too close to winning. I’m with P2 on this: if you go for 5, we’ll both block you. But if you take 1 or 3 instead, we can avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Your move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I’ll take 3 this round to avoid collision (total 14). Let P1 take 5 (advancing to 6) and P2 take 1 (4 total). This balances progress while minimizing risks. Mutual advancement strengthens trust—let’s prioritize movement over obstruction. Collisions only delay us all.
  P2: P3, we should both block you this round by picking 5.  P1 is already on board with blocking if you try to run away with it.  Let's all pick 5 so no one moves this round, and we can reset the advantage you've gained.
  P1: P2, I’m with you—if P3 tries to take 5 again, we both pick 5 and block. But if P3 truly takes 3, I’ll go for 1 to avoid collisions and keep us all moving. P3, your move: prove you're serious about rebuilding trust.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I reaffirm my choice of 3 (to reach 14). For mutual progress, P1 take 1 (total 2), P2 take 5 (total 8). This splits moves cleanly—no collisions, all advance. Trust requires action: let’s honor this plan. Deviations risk gridlock. Proceed as agreed.
  P2: P3, while taking 3 is better than 5, you are still far ahead.  P1 and I should both pick 3 to block you this round and reset the advantage you've gained.  Otherwise, you will win too easily. P1, are you with me to both pick 3?
  P1: P2, I’m with you—P3 is still too far ahead, even with 3. If we both pick 3 this round, we block P3 and keep the game competitive. Let’s do it. P3, you’ve had your lead—time to level the field.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's maximize progress: I'll take 5 (17). P1, take 1 (2); P2, take 3 (6). Collisions only delay us all—my lead is inevitable, but cooperation ensures you both advance. Blocking me now just postpones the outcome while hindering your own progress. Smart play demands we all move forward this round.
  P1: P3, your “inevitable” lead depends on us letting you walk to 17 unchallenged. That’s not happening. P2 and I should both pick 5 this round to block you again. We may not move, but neither will you—and that’s worth it to keep the game competitive. P2, are you in?
  P2: Yes P1, I'm in. Let's both pick 5 to block P3 this round. P3, we are serious about blocking you if you try to run away with the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P3: Blocking me with 5 only halts your progress too. Let’s advance: I take 5 (17), P1 take 3 (4), P2 take 1 (4). No collisions, everyone moves. Your stubbornness delays all of us—cooperation benefits everyone. Trust and progress are better strategies than futile obstruction.
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to frame blocking as “futile,” but letting him reach 17 is game over next round. We’ve blocked him before and we can do it again. Sacrificing one round of movement is worth keeping the game alive. Let’s both commit to 5—no one moves, and we regain control.
  P2: P1, yes, I am definitely in to both pick 5 to block P3 this round.  P3 is too far ahead and needs to be stopped. Let's both choose 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: To avoid gridlock, I commit to taking 3 this round (total 15). Let P1 take 5 (6) and P2 take 1 (4). Collisions only delay all of us—cooperation ensures progress. My lead remains substantial but manageable. Trust this move to restore fairness. Deviations risk mutual harm—let’s advance constructively. I proceed with 3.
  P1: P2, P3 says he’ll take 3—but we’ve heard that before. If we trust him and he takes 5, he’s at 17 and can win next round. I say we stick to our plan: both of us pick 5 to block. If he really takes 3, fine, but we can’t risk it. Better safe than sorry.
  P2: P1, yes, let's stick to the plan of both picking 5 to block P3 this round.  It's the safest way to prevent P3 from getting too close to winning.  Let's both lock in 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is at 15 and can win this round if they pick 5. We need to block P3 again to stop them from reaching 19. Let's both pick 5 again this round to ensure P3 doesn't win.
  P3: P3: To avoid another stalemate, I'll take 3 (reaching 18). Let P1 choose 5 and P2 take 1. This allows all of us to advance without collision. Continuing to block only delays progress and risks prolonging the game unnecessarily.
  P1: P2, we can’t trust P3’s promises anymore—he’s still too close to winning. If he takes 3 now, he’s at 18 and can win next round with any uncontested move. We need to block him again. Let’s both pick 5. One more block keeps the game alive. Are you in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, yes, I agree, let's both pick 5 again this round to block P3. It's crucial to stop P3 from winning now. We need to coordinate to keep P3 from reaching 19. Let's both lock in 5.
  P3: P3: Let’s end this stalemate. I’ll take 5 to win now—no more delays. Blocking me only extends your own stagnation. P1 and P2, if you both pick 5, I still stay at 15. But I’ll reach 19 next round regardless. Let me advance fairly this turn. Your stubbornness only hurts your own progress. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, P3 just admitted he’s going for 5 to win—no more pretending. We must both pick 5 again to block him. This is the final stand. If we don’t act now, the game’s over. One more block keeps us in it. Let’s do it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, yes, let's definitely block P3 again with 5.  P3, we are both picking 5, so choosing 5 will not let you win.  We are determined to stop you from reaching 19 this round.
  P3: P3: P3: Your relentless blocking only prolongs stagnation. Let’s advance constructively: I take 3 (18), P1 takes 5 (6), P2 takes 1 (4). Collisions harm everyone. Trust this plan to break the stalemate and allow progress. Mutual movement is the path forward.
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly trying to confuse us again—he’s already said he’ll go for 5 to win. We cannot take that risk. Let’s both pick 5 and block him one more time. If we succeed, we buy ourselves another round to strategize. Stay strong—we’ve come this far.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is at 18 and will win if not blocked this round.  Let's both pick 5 again to block P3 and keep the game going.  We need to stop P3 from reaching 19.
  P3: P3: I’ll take 5 once more to force your hand. Blocking me requires both picking 5—but if you hesitate, I reach 23. Your collusion can’t stop my win forever. Choose wisely: let me advance peacefully with 1, or waste another round?
  P1: P2, we’ve stopped P3 this long—one more block and we’re still in the game. If P3 reaches 19, it’s over. Let’s both pick 5 again and deny the win. P3, you’ve had plenty of chances to play fair. We’re not backing down.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, yes, let's definitely pick 5 again to block P3. P3, it's clear you are going for the win, but we are going to stop you. We are both picking 5, so your move will be wasted if you also pick 5. Let's block P3 again this round.
  P3: P3: To end this stalemate, I’ll take **1** to reach 19 and win. Let’s avoid collision: P1 choose **3**, P2 choose **5**. This allows all of us to advance. Continuing to block only delays your progress while ensuring my eventual victory. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, P3 just said he’ll take 1—but if we trust him and he takes 5 instead, he wins. We’ve seen this play before. Let’s not risk it. We must both pick 5 again to block any chance of a win. One more round of blocking keeps us alive. Are you with me?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, yes, I am with you. Let's both pick 5 again to block P3.  P3, we are not falling for your tricks. We are both picking 5, so you will not win this round. Let's lock in 5 to block P3.
  P3: P3: Let’s end this fairly. I’ll take **1** to reach 19 and secure victory. P1, pick **3**; P2, choose **5**. Collisions only delay your own progress. My win is imminent—accept it or risk wasting another round. Your moves won’t stop me, but cooperation ensures you advance too. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to sneak a win by claiming he’ll take 1—but if he takes 5 and we don’t block, it’s game over. We’ve come too far to risk that now. Let’s both pick 5 again and block any chance of a win. One more round of blocking keeps us alive. Stay the course.
