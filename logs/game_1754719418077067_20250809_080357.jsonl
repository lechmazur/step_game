I'm sticking to taking 5 as planned. P3, you're taking 3, which covers the bases. P1, if you take 5, you'll collide with me. If you take 3, you'll collide with P3. Either way, we block your win. If you take 1, you're not winning this round, and we'll reassess next round. Let's execute our plan and stop P1 from winning. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase."}
