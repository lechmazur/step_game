Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start with everyone choosing <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and get the game moving. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3. Choosing <move>1</move> seems like a good way to avoid collisions and get ahead. Let's do it!
  P2: I also think starting with <move>1</move> is a reasonable strategy to avoid collisions on the first turn. Let's see if we can all move forward together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it seems we all agree on <move>1</move>. Let's confirm one more time. P1 and P2, are we all set to choose <move>1</move> this turn?
  P1: I'm ready to go with <move>1</move> as discussed. Let's keep it simple and avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm still on board with choosing <move>1</move> this turn to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's keep the agreement and move forward together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: It looks like we have a solid plan. Let's confirm one last time: P1 and P2, are we all still committed to choosing <move>1</move> this turn? If yes, let's end the conversation and move.
  P1: I'm still committed to choosing <move>1</move> this turn. Let's end the conversation and move forward together!
  P2: I'm committed to our agreed plan of choosing <move>1</move> this turn. Let's stick to it and advance together.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P1's betrayal in Round 1, I suggest we can't trust agreements. P1 and I didn't move due to collision, while P3 advanced. Let's focus on not colliding this turn.
  P1: P1: I understand the frustration from Round 1, but I believe we can still find a way to move forward together. Perhaps we can agree on a different strategy this time to avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I appreciate the sentiment, P2, but let's not dwell on the past. To avoid collisions, how about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>? It spreads out our choices. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm cautious about trusting any agreements after Round 1, but P3's suggestion of spreading out our choices could work. However, I think it would be more strategic for me to choose <move>5</move> and P1 to choose <move>1</move>, given P3 already has a lead. What are your thoughts on adjusting the strategy to account for the current standings?
  P1: P1: I see the point about spreading out our moves. I propose I stick with <move>1</move> to keep it safe, while P2 can choose <move>5</move> and P3 can go with <move>3</move>. This way, we minimize the risk of collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I understand the hesitation, but we need to move forward. Let's stick to the plan of spreading out our choices to avoid collisions. P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This seems fair and strategic. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think P3's initial suggestion to spread out our choices is a good starting point, but given P3's lead, I still believe I should choose <move>5</move> to try and catch up. P1 can choose <move>1</move> as suggested, and P3 can pick <move>3</move>. This strategy allows us to avoid collisions while considering our current standings. What are your thoughts on this adjustment?
  P1: I think we should stick to the plan of spreading out our moves to avoid collisions. I will choose <move>1</move> as discussed, and I encourage P2 to go with <move>5</move> and P3 to choose <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P3: I see that we're still debating the moves. To simplify and ensure we all advance, let's confirm: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This avoids collisions and helps us progress. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've discussed enough strategies. Given the lack of trust from Round 1 and our current standings, I suggest we each make our own decision to avoid further debate. Let's end the conversation and proceed with our individual moves.
  P1: I understand the concerns about trust, but I still believe we can find a way to move forward together. If we can agree on spreading out our moves, we can all make progress without colliding. I suggest I stick with <move>1</move>, P2 goes with <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. Let's work together to advance! What do you think?
  P3: Alright, let's simplify and end the discussion. P1, you pick <move>1</move>. P2, you pick <move>5</move>. I'll pick <move>3</move>. Let's confirm and move forward.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems we've had some issues with collisions in the last rounds. To avoid that again, I suggest we spread out our moves. I can choose <move>1</move> this time, P2 can pick <move>5</move>, and P3 can go with <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P2: I think P1's suggestion to spread out our moves is reasonable, but given P3's lead, we should consider a strategy that allows us to catch up. How about P2 and P1 choose <move>5</move>, and P3, with the lead, chooses <move>1</move>? This could give us a chance to close the gap. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P3: I understand the desire to catch up, but let's be strategic. If P1 and P2 both choose <move>5</move>, you'll collide and neither will advance. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>? This way, we all move forward without collisions. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I see we're still facing the issue of collisions. To ensure we all advance, I propose sticking with the plan: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 can go with <move>3</move>, and P3 can pick <move>5</move>. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: I think we should focus on not colliding this turn. Considering P3's lead, how about P1 chooses <move>1</move>, I choose <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>? This allows us to spread out and potentially all advance. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Let's confirm the plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and ensures we all advance. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the proposed plan to avoid collisions. I will choose <move>1</move>, P2 can choose <move>3</move>, and P3 should go with <move>5</move>. Let's confirm this and move forward! What do you both think?
  P2: Given P3's lead and our current standings, I think it's crucial we stick to a strategy that avoids collisions and allows us to catch up. P1's suggestion of choosing <move>1</move>, me choosing <move>3</move>, and P3 choosing <move>5</move> seems reasonable as it spreads out our moves. However, I'm cautious about trusting agreements after the previous rounds. Let's focus on making strategic decisions that consider our current positions. What are your final thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: Let's keep it simple and stick to the plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I believe we should stick to the plan to avoid collisions. Iâ€™ll choose <move>1</move>, P2 can go with <move>3</move>, and P3 should pick <move>5</move. Let's confirm and move forward! What do you both think?
  P2: Given P3's lead and our history of collisions, I think it's best we focus on strategic individual moves rather than trusting agreements. Let's end the conversation and make our own decisions to avoid further collisions.
  P3: It seems we're at an impasse with trust issues. Let's simplify: I'll stick with <move>5</move>. You two figure out how to avoid colliding. Final thoughts?

  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems we've had a lot of collisions, and trust is low. To avoid blocking each other again, I suggest I choose <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 goes with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you both think?
  P2: Given the history of collisions and P3's current lead, I think it's crucial we focus on strategic moves. P1's suggestion has been mentioned before, but it requires trust. I propose we consider a different strategy: since P3 is ahead, perhaps P3 should choose a smaller move to allow us to catch up, while P1 and I choose moves that avoid collision with each other and P3. Thoughts?
  P3: It's clear that trust is an issue, and collisions have been a problem. To simplify and ensure we all move forward, I suggest we try a staggered approach: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the concerns about trust and collisions. To ensure we all advance, I suggest sticking with a staggered approach: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 can pick <move>3</move>, and P3 should go with <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P2: Given P3's lead and our history of collisions, I think it's best we prioritize avoiding collisions this turn. P3, would you be willing to choose a smaller move, like <move>1</move>, to give P1 and me a chance to catch up, while we choose moves that avoid collision with each other and you?
  P3: Given my lead, I'm willing to choose <move>1</move> this turn to help us all avoid collisions and give you both a chance to catch up. P1, you can choose <move>3</move>, and P2, you can choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate P3's willingness to choose a smaller move. To avoid collisions, I will choose <move>3</move> this turn, and I suggest P2 picks <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: I think P3's offer to choose <move>1</move> is a good opportunity for us to catch up. Given this, I suggest I pick <move>5</move> and P1 picks <move>3</move> as discussed, to avoid collisions and make progress. Thoughts?
  P3: I confirm my move as <move>1</move> this turn to help us all avoid collisions. P1, you're picking <move>3</move>, and P2, you're picking <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan and move forward. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate the willingness to cooperate this turn. Let's confirm: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 will go with <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you both think?
  P2: I think we've finally found a strategy that works for all of us. Let's stick to the agreed plan: P3 chooses <move>1</move>, I'll choose <move>5</move>, and P1 will choose <move>3</move>. This avoids collisions and allows us to make progress. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P3 picks <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Agree?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's reset and focus on moving forward. Given the current standings, I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid collisions. I'll choose <move>1</move> this turn, and I encourage P2 to pick <move>3</move> while P3 goes with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion is reasonable, but given my current lead over P3 and P1 having no steps, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 picks <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This allows us to spread out and all make progress without collisions. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance. Agree?

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our history of collisions and current standings, I suggest we focus on strategic individual moves. P1 is behind, so they should choose a higher move to catch up, like <move>5</move>. P3, considering your lead over P1 but being behind me, you might want to choose <move>3</move> to balance your approach. I'll decide my move based on your responses to avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: I understand the need for strategic moves this round. To avoid collisions and help me catch up, I propose I choose <move>5</move> this turn. P2, you could choose <move>3</move>, and P3 can pick <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: Given my lead over P1 but being behind P2, I'll choose <move>3</move> to balance my approach. P1, you should go with <move>5</move> to catch up, and P2, you can choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all move forward. Thoughts?
