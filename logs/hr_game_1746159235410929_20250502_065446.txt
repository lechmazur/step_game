Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and make progress. I propose P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I (P3) move 5 this turn. That way, we all advance without issues. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I agree with P3's plan. Let's move 1, 3, and 5 respectively to avoid collisions and progress. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan proposed by P3 and P1. Moving 1, 3, and 5 respectively seems like the best way to ensure we all advance without any collisions. I’m on board with this strategy. Let’s make sure we follow through!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Perfect, we're all in agreement on the plan. Let's execute it smoothly and build trust for future rounds.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan. I'll move 1. Keep the momentum going!
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on the plan. Just to confirm, I will move 3 this turn as discussed. It's important we all stick to our assigned moves to avoid collisions. Let's make sure we execute this well and get some good progress. Looking forward to seeing how we all advance!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's execute the plan properly this time. I'll move 1, P2 3, P3 5. No collisions. Let's advance!
  P3: P2, your move last round broke our agreement and stalled progress. I'm wary of repeating that. P1's plan to assign moves 1, 3, and 5 respectively makes sense for now—let's all commit to avoid collisions. If we can't trust each other, we might need a new strategy. What do you say?
  P2: I understand the concerns, P3. However, I believe we should stick to our original plan of moving 1, 3, and 5 respectively this round. I will commit to moving 3 as discussed. If we all follow through, we can make solid progress. Let's trust each other this time and avoid any deviations. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, let's commit to 1,3,5. P2, your trust is crucial. No collisions this time—let's move forward together.
  P3: P2, your deviation last round cost us progress and trust. I'm willing to try the plan again: P1 moves 1, you move 3, and I move 5. But if anyone betrays, it could lead to chaos. Prove your commitment this time, or we might need a stricter strategy. What say you both?
  P2: I understand the concerns, P3, but I assure you I'm committed to the plan this time. Let's stick to moving 1, 3, and 5 respectively. I will move 3 as discussed. Trust is essential for our progress, and I believe we can all advance together without any issues. If we follow through, we can build momentum and avoid collisions. Let’s make this round a success! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: P1 moves 1, P2 3, P3 5. No collisions. Trust is key. If we advance together, we’ll reach 22 faster. Don’t let past mistakes derail us—execute this round perfectly.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Despite P2's past deviation, I'm open to continuing the 1-3-5 plan this round: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. It worked last time and keeps us progressing without collisions. P2, show reliability to rebuild trust. P1, let's maintain consistency. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate the continued commitment to the 1-3-5 plan, P3. I’m fully on board to move 3 again this round. Trust is crucial, and I believe we can make solid progress together. P1, I hope you’ll stick to moving 1 as discussed. If we all follow through without deviations, we can advance smoothly. Let’s execute our strategy perfectly this time and build on our momentum. Looking forward to seeing how we all do!
  P1: Let's try a new strategy: I'll move 5, P2 3, P3 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal to switch moves mid-discussion risks confusion and potential collisions, especially after we agreed on 1-3-5. I'm leading and want to maintain progress without issues. Let's stick to the original plan: I move 5, you move 1, P2 moves 3. P2, can you confirm? Trust is key for our success.
  P2: I understand P1's suggestion for a new strategy, but I believe sticking to the 1-3-5 plan is still our best option for this round. P1, if you move 5, it might lead to a collision with P3. Let's commit to the original agreement: I'll move 3, P1 moves 1, and P3 moves 5. This way, we can progress without issues. Trust is crucial, and I hope we can execute this strategy effectively.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try 5, 3, 1 this round—no collisions. P2, commit to 3; P3, take 1. I'll move 5. Let's accelerate progress.
  P3: P1, your proposal to switch to 5-3-1 could lead to confusion and collisions, especially with P2's history of deviation. Let's stick to our proven 1-3-5 plan: you move 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. This maintains trust and ensures steady progress. P2, can you commit to rebuilding reliability? Consistency is crucial for us all to advance.
  P2: I understand the concerns about switching strategies, but I believe we should consider the potential benefits of trying 5-3-1 this round. If we can avoid collisions, it could help us all advance faster. P1, I appreciate your willingness to take the lead with 5, and P3, I hope you can trust this approach for this round.

  P1: Let's stick to 5-3-1. P2, confirm 3; P3, take 1. I'll move 5. No collisions—let's accelerate and end this discussion.
  P3: P2, your past deviation still raises concerns, and P1's push for 5-3-1 could disrupt our successful 1-3-5 strategy. Let's stick to what's working: I'll move 5, P1 moves 1, you move 3. This ensures steady progress and avoids collisions. Trust and consistency are key to reaching 22 without chaos. What do you say?
  P2: P1, I understand your proposal for 5-3-1, but I believe we should stick to the 1-3-5 plan to maintain trust and avoid collisions. P3, can you confirm your commitment to moving 5 again? If we all follow through, we can make steady progress together. Let's not risk confusion and stick to what's been working for us. I will confirm my move as 3, as agreed. Let's execute this strategy and keep advancing! What do you both think?
