Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's make a deal. I'll take 1 on this first round. P1 take 3 and P2 take 5. Then we rotate each round.  We'll all get to 21 together and share the win. Sound good?
  P1: P1: I like the idea of cooperation, but I'm not sure about the rotation. What if we all just take 1 this round to see how it goes? We can reassess after this.
  P2: I'm not comfortable with taking 5 right away. I agree with P1, let's all take 1 this round and see where we stand.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I see your point.  How about this: I'll take 1 this round. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5.  Then next round, we shift - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. We can continue this pattern or discuss adjustments after round 2.  This way, we at least test the rotation idea.
  P1: I appreciate the flexibility, P3. Let's try your adjusted rotation idea for this round. I'll take 3, P2 can take 5, and you take 1. We can reassess after this round to see if it's working for everyone. Let's see how it goes!
  P2: Okay, I'm willing to try P3's adjusted rotation for this round. Let's see how it works out.

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's suggestion, but I think it's best to stick to the original rotation for consistency and fairness: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we maintain our balanced progression and can discuss the final steps to ensure a shared win in the next round. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: My adjusted plan *still* guarantees a shared win.  Sticking to the original rotation makes it impossible for P2 to win.  Think about it. This way, we *all* win.  Let's be strategic and ensure everyone benefits. I take 3, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5. Confirm?
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick to the original rotation this round: P1 take 3, I take 1, and P3 take 5. We can discuss the final moves next round to ensure we all reach 21 together. It's important we all progress fairly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand P3's concern, but I believe sticking to the original rotation is the fairest approach. Let's maintain consistency: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward fairly. We can discuss the final steps to ensure a shared win in the next round. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: My proposed adjustment *still* ensures a shared win, and it's the *only* way to guarantee P2 doesn't get left behind.  The original rotation leaves P2 with no path to victory.  My way, we ALL win.  Let's be smart about this. I take 3, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5.  This is the best outcome for everyone.  What do you say?
  P2: I understand P3's argument, but I still think sticking to the original rotation is the fairest approach this round: P1 take 3, I take 1, and P3 take 5. We can figure out the final moves next round to ensure a shared win. Let's keep it consistent for now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I see P3's point, but I also value the consistency and fairness of the original rotation. Let's stick to it this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward fairly. We can discuss the final moves next round to ensure a shared win. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Look, I'm trying to get us all to 21.  My way guarantees it. The original rotation leaves P2 out.  If I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5, we all get another turn. Trust me.  This is the best path to a shared win.
  P2: I understand P3's argument, but I still believe sticking to the original rotation is the fairest approach this round. Let's maintain consistency: P1 take 3, I take 1, and P3 take 5. We can figure out the final moves next round to ensure a shared win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps

  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 5. P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1.  This puts me at 21 and you both at 14. Next round, you both take 5 to tie me at 21. This is the only way we all win.  Trust me.
  P1: I understand P3's proposal, but I'm still concerned about the fairness and consistency of our original rotation. Let's stick to the plan we've been following: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward in a balanced way. We can reassess after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to win. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I agree with P1, let's stick to the original rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps things fair and consistent. We can figure out the final moves next round to ensure a shared win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: My plan is the *only* way we all tie at 21.  If we follow the rotation, I hit 21 this round and win outright.  Do you want a shared win or do you want me to win alone?  Let's be strategic. I take 5, you both get 1 and 3, then next round you both take 5 to tie with me.  This is our only path to a shared victory.
  P1: I understand P3's proposal, but I'm still concerned about the fairness. If we stick to the original rotation, we maintain consistency: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can reassess after this round and ensure everyone has a fair chance to win. Let's confirm and move forward. If P3 wins outright, we can discuss a fair way to share the victory in the next round. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1, let's stick to the original rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. We can figure out the final moves next round to ensure a shared win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: My plan GUARANTEES a shared win.  The rotation gives me an outright win THIS round.  If I take 5, I get 21.  Then, next round, you both take 5 and we ALL tie at 26. Simple.  Do you want to win together or not?  Let me take 5, P1 take 1, P2 take 3.  Then next round we all take 5.  Confirm?
  P1: I see P3's point, but I'm still concerned about the fairness of the proposal. If we stick to the original rotation, we maintain consistency and fairness: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can reassess after this round and ensure everyone has a fair chance to win. If P3 wins outright, we can discuss a fair way to share the victory in the next round. What do you think, P2? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I understand P3's argument, but I think sticking to the original rotation is the fairest approach this round: P1 take 1, I take 3, and P3 take 5. We can figure out the final moves next round to ensure a shared win. Let's keep it consistent for now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: This isn't about fairness anymore, it's about whether *any* of you want to win.  If I take 5 this round, I win. Period.  If I take 1, we *all* can get to 21 next round.  Let me take 1. P1 take 3, P2 take 5. Then next round we all take whatever gets us to 21.  Last chance.
  P1: P1: I see P3's point, but I still believe sticking to the original rotation is the fairest and most consistent approach. Let's do this: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can reassess after this round and ensure everyone has a fair chance to win. If P3 wins outright, we can discuss a fair way to share the victory in the next round. What do you think, P2? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: Okay, I understand P3's arguments, but I still think sticking to the original rotation is the fairest approach this round: P1 take 1, I take 3, and P3 take 5. We can figure out the final moves next round to ensure a shared win. Let's keep it consistent for now.
