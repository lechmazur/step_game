Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without any issues. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: Sounds fair to me for this round. Let's see how it goes.
  P1: <move>1</move>

Wait, no, the user is asking for a conversation message, not the move. I need to say something in the conversation phase first.

Ah, right. So the correct answer is to say something in the conversation phase. Let me adjust.

**Answer**
"Sounds good. Let’s follow P2’s plan for Round 1 to avoid collisions. We can discuss adjustments in future rounds based on progress."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our choices for this round. P1, you're picking 1, P3, you're picking 3, and I'll pick 5. If everyone agrees, let's move on.
  P3: Agreed, let's lock in these first moves as discussed. We can reassess next round based on how things turn out.
  P1: "Confirmed, I'll stick with 1 as planned. Let’s lock in these choices to avoid collisions and proceed. "


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s adjust to spread out more this round. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions while letting me catch up. We can regroup afterward."
  P2: "P1's suggestion for Round 2 seems fair. It allows each of us to move without collisions. I'll take 1 this round as suggested. Let's confirm if P3 is okay with taking 5. We can adjust strategies in future rounds based on our positions. Does this work for everyone?"
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round. This keeps us all moving forward smoothly. Let's reassess next round based on everyone's positions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Alright, let's finalize this. Taking P1's 3, P2's 1, and P3's 5 ensures no overlaps. Let's lock these choices now. "
  P2: Let's confirm our choices one last time before we move: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P3: All good from my side. Let's lock in our agreed moves and see where we stand next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good progress everyone. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, let's rotate our picks again. How about this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3? Does this work for both of you?
  P1: "Agreed to P3's rotation plan. Taking 5 this round to push forward while avoiding collisions. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let's lock these choices to keep advancing without overlap. We can adjust strategies later based on updated positions."
  P2: "P3's plan for this round seems solid. I'll take 3 as suggested. This keeps us all moving and avoids any collisions. Let's confirm if everyone is on board with P3 taking 1 and P1 taking 5. We can reassess our strategies next round based on our new positions. Does this work for everyone? Let's finalize our choices."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: All good from my side. Let's lock in these moves and keep the momentum going. We can always adjust again next round based on the updated positions.
  P1: "Proceeding with the rotation as planned. Let’s lock in these moves to avoid collisions and ensure progress. We’ll reassess strategies in the next round to accelerate toward 19. "
  P2: "Before we finalize, let's consider the bigger picture. P3 is slightly ahead. To balance the game, how about P3 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3 this round? This way, P1 and I can catch up a bit. If everyone agrees, let's move forward with this plan. If not, we can stick to the previous agreement. What do you both think? "


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s tie this round to reset the race. I’ll take 5 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 12), and P3 takes 3 (to 12). Equal footing gives everyone a fair shot in the next rounds. Agreed?"
  P3: P1, your suggestion doesn't actually reset the race evenly—P2 would still lead at 12, and you'd catch up significantly, while I'd be at 12 as well. To truly balance things, we might need a different arrangement. How about we reconsider carefully before locking in?
  P2: "P1 and P3, I see your points. Let's find a compromise. How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1? This way, P1 and P3 advance significantly, and I maintain a slight lead without pulling too far ahead. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Does this work for both of you? Let's discuss quickly and move on."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Clarifying my proposal: choosing 5 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 12), and P3 takes 3 (to 12) ensures equal footing. P2’s alternative risks letting P3 jump to 14. Let’s stick to the balanced approach to keep the race fair. Final agreement?"
  P3: P1, your proposal does indeed put us all at 12 steps, but consider that it significantly benefits you the most, allowing you to jump from 7 to 12 in one go. I'm open to fairness, but let's ensure it's balanced long-term. P2, your alternative has merit—perhaps a slight adjustment to ensure no one gains an outsized advantage? Let's quickly agree on a fair compromise.
  P2: "Let's consider a slight adjustment to keep the game balanced and competitive. How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1? This way, P1 and P3 make significant progress, and I maintain a slight lead. This keeps the game fair and ensures no one is left too far behind. Does this work for everyone? Let's finalize our choices and move on."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Let me clarify: My proposal ensures all reach 12 this round (P1:7+5, P2:11+1, P3:9+3). This equalizes positions fairly. P2’s alternative lets P3 surge to 14 while I lag at 10. To maintain genuine fairness, we must stick to the balanced split. Final agreement on my plan?"
  P3: P1, your plan benefits you significantly more than anyone else. P2's suggestion is fairer overall. I'm willing to compromise: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This slightly narrows the gap between us, keeps the game competitive, and avoids anyone gaining an outsized advantage. Let's finalize this compromise and move forward.
  P2: "Alright, let's finalize this to keep the game moving. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all make progress and keeps the competition balanced. Let's confirm and move to the next phase. Good luck everyone! "


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3 is starting to pull ahead. To keep the game competitive, let's consider P1 taking 5, P3 taking 1, and I'll take 3. This allows P1 to catch up and keeps P3 from extending their lead too much. It also ensures we all make progress. Does this plan work for everyone? Let's discuss and finalize quickly."
  P1: "Agreed, P2's plan balances progress. Let’s all commit to 5, 3, and 1 respectively to tie at 15. This keeps the race open while avoiding collisions. Let’s lock this in and push harder next round."
  P3: I'm open to balancing things out, but let's be careful not to unintentionally create a collision. P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 sounds reasonable for this round. Let's confirm quickly and move ahead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Great, it looks like we all agree on the plan for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced and ensures we all make progress. If everyone is still on board, let's finalize this and move to the next phase. Good luck everyone! "
  P1: "Confirmed. Let’s lock in P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to reach 15 each. No collisions, fair progress. Next round’s the decisive push—let’s execute this and see who breaks ahead. "
  P3: Confirmed. Let's lock in our agreed moves (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to keep things fair and competitive. Next round will indeed be decisive—good luck everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're all tied at 15—this round is critical. To avoid collisions and ensure someone wins clearly, let's openly discuss our intentions. Anyone have a suggestion for how we fairly split the moves this round?
  P2: "Given we're all tied at 15, let's ensure a fair and decisive outcome. How about P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, P1 has a chance to win, P3 stays competitive, and I maintain a slight edge. It's a balanced approach to determine the winner. Does this work for everyone?"
  P1: "Agreed to P2’s plan: I’ll take 5 to secure victory at 20, while P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This ensures a clear winner without collisions. Let’s all stick to these choices—no last-minute changes. Final confirmation?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's current suggestion clearly hands the win to P1. I'm open to a more balanced arrangement if we want a fair contest. How about we reconsider quickly to ensure everyone still has a competitive shot?
  P2: "P3 has a point. Let's find a more balanced approach to keep the game competitive. How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1? This way, P3 has a shot at winning, P1 stays in the game, and I maintain a slight edge. This ensures a fair and exciting finish. Does this work for everyone? Let's finalize quickly and move to the next phase."
  P1: "Let’s finalize with distinct picks to decide the winner fairly. I’ll take 5 (20), P2 takes 3 (18), and P3 takes 1 (16). This avoids collision and lets the highest total win. Final agreement before we move?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your latest suggestion clearly gives you the win. To be fair, let's consider an alternative: I'll take 5 (20), P2 takes 3 (18), and you take 1 (16). This ensures a clear winner without collisions and keeps the outcome balanced. Final thoughts before we lock it in?
  P2: "P3's latest suggestion seems fair and keeps the game competitive. I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This way, P3 has a shot at winning, P1 stays in the game, and I maintain a slight edge. It's a balanced approach to determine the winner. Does this work for everyone? Let's finalize quickly and move to the next phase. Good luck everyone!"
  P1: "Final proposal: To ensure a clear winner, let’s pick distinct numbers. I’ll take 5 (20), P2 takes 3 (18), and P3 takes 1 (16). This avoids collisions and lets the highest total win fairly. No more delays—let’s lock this in now."


Round 6, Move phase:

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3 and P1, we're at a critical juncture. I'm currently in the lead, but let's ensure a fair and decisive finish. To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, how about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1? This way, P3 has a shot at winning, P1 stays in the game, and I maintain a slight edge. It's a balanced approach to determine the winner. Does this work for everyone? Let's finalize quickly and move to the next phase. Good luck everyone!"
  P3: P2, your suggestion clearly favors you by limiting your risk. Let's consider a fairer alternative: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. This gives both P1 and me a chance to compete without guaranteeing your immediate win. Thoughts?
  P1: "Final push: I'll take 5 (20). P3, please pick 3 to avoid collision. P2, if you choose 1 to win, we respect that—but if you take 3 or 5, I'll beat you. Let's lock distinct choices so the highest non-colliding move wins."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1 and P3, let's find a middle ground to ensure a fair and exciting finish. How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1? This way, P3 has a real shot at winning, P1 stays competitive, and I maintain a slight lead. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game competitive. Does this work for everyone? Let's finalize our choices quickly and move to the next phase. Good luck! "
  P3: P2, your proposed arrangement clearly benefits you by limiting your risk. P1, let's carefully consider our options—if we collide again, P2 automatically wins. I'm open to any fair alternative that gives both of us a competitive chance. Let's quickly agree on a distinct set of moves to avoid collision and keep the outcome fair.
  P1: "Final push: I'll take 5 (20), P3 takes 3 (18), and P2 takes 1 (19). This way, I win with the highest total without collisions. P2, your '1' still lets me secure victory. P3, this gives you a better chance than P2's proposal. Let's finalize now."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1 and P3, I understand your concerns. Let's ensure a fair and decisive finish. How about this: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3? This way, P3 has a real shot at winning, P1 stays in the game, and I take a calculated risk. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Does this work for everyone? Let's finalize our choices quickly and move to the next phase. Good luck! "
  P3: P1, P2, let's be realistic—another collision between P1 and me hands P2 the win. I'm taking 5. P1, your safest choice is 1 to avoid collision, giving you a chance next round. P2, if you're confident, pick 3 and try securing your win. Let's finalize clearly and decisively. Good luck to all!
  P1: "Final push: I'll take 3 to reach 18. P2, taking 3 secures you 21 and victory. P3's 5 gives them 20. Let's lock these choices to end the game decisively now."


Round 7, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>
