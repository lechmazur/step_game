Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about we avoid collisions by rotating moves?  
Turn 1: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5.  
Turn 2: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1.  
Turn 3: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3.  
Repeat the cycle until someone nears 23, then renegotiate. Everyone gets 9 steps every 3 turns and nobody is blocked. Sound fair?
  P2: P3's plan would let them win on Turn 7. Let's rotate starting with **P3 first** instead. That way, Turn 7’s moves will be: P3=1, P1=3, **P2=5**—letting me reach 23 then. Fair rotation, but we all get a turn at the decisive 5-step move. Deal?
  P1: I propose we rotate so that on Turn 1: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5; Turn 2: P2=3, P3=5, P1=1; Turn 3: P2=5, P3=1, P1=3; then repeat. We’ll each avoid collisions and get equal turns, and I’ll take the decisive 5 on Turn 7. Fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s face it—each “rotation” proposal is just “I get the winning 5 on Turn 7.” That’s brittle: whoever’s about to win can be blocked by a copy-move and we all lose that turn. How about we de-escalate: everyone plays 3 on Turn 1 so all advance equally, no collisions. We’ll see who actually cooperates, then renegotiate next round. If anyone tries a greedy 5 instead, I’m announcing now that I’ll mirror it in future turns to make sure they stall again. Fair first step?
  P2: Let’s accept P3’s proposal for Turn 1: all play 3. This avoids immediate conflict and builds trust. Afterward, we can discuss a fair rotation. If anyone defects now, I’ll retaliate by mirroring their greed in future turns. Cooperate now, or face consequences later.
  P1: Agreed—let’s all play 3 on Turn 1 to build trust. We’ll reconvene after seeing the results and then agree on a fair rotation.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All right—Turn 1 we each play 3. If everyone follows through, I’m open to discussing a rotation next round (I’m even willing to start with 1 on Turn 2 to show good faith). Let’s see who honors the agreement first.
  P2: <move>3</move> is the agreed path to avoid collisions. I’ll honor it—**3** now. But let’s clarify: if anyone breaks this pact, I’ll mirror their move in the next round, guaranteeing their stall. Trust is mutual. Let’s proceed.
  P1: I confirm I’ll play 3. Let’s all honor this and reconvene next round to set up a fair rotation.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 already leads, so we’d be foolish to let him sprint. I’m announcing now: I will play 5 this turn.  

• If P2 also plays 5, he stalls with me; problem solved.  
• If P2 switches to 3 or 1, P1 can mirror that smaller number to block him while I sit on 5. (Just don’t touch 5, P1.)  

Either way, P2 goes nowhere. After we’ve clipped his wings, we can renegotiate from a level field.
  P2: P3’s scheme forces P1 to choose between blocking me (letting P3 surge ahead) or letting me advance. P1, don’t let P3 steal your chance. Let’s pick **3** and advance together—then we can negotiate fairly. If you side with P3 now, you’ll regret it later when they outpace you.
  P1: P1: I refuse to let P3 sprint ahead—I'll play 5 to collide with him. P2, if you also pick 5, we’ll all stall and wipe out his 5-step gain. Otherwise P3 leaps into the lead. Better to reset now and renegotiate on equal footing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m locked on 5. P1’s on 5. P2, pick 5 too and we all reset to zero—nobody gains, nobody gets singled-out. If you try 3 or 1, you’ll just make yourself the lone frontrunner and invite a dog-pile next turn. Let’s stall now and negotiate fresh. Your move.
  P2: P3, your plan backfires: if I choose **3**, P1 and you collide on 5, letting me jump to **6**. Let’s instead agree on a fair rotation. Otherwise, I’ll take the 3-step lead now.
  P1: P2, I’m locked in on 5 to collide with P3—stalling is our only way to knock P3 back. If you play 5 too, we all reset (0,3,0). If you pick 3, you jump to 6—but next turn P3 and I will both play 5 to dog-pile you and leave you behind. Your choice: safe stall now or a short lead that we’ll crush next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Last call, P2. Pick 5 and we all stall, reset. Choose 3 and P1 & I will shadow you every turn (double 5s) so you never advance again while we trade wins. P1, hold at 5. Fair reset or endless blockade—your choice, P2.
  P2: P1, don’t let P3’s manipulation box us both out. Let me take **3** now to reach 6, and *you* can advance on the next round. If you block me for P3’s gain, you’ll just hand him the win. Cooperate, or P3 wins by default.
  P1: P2, I’m on 5 to stall P3. If you pick 5 now, we all reset—P3 gets nothing. If you pick 3 to reach 6, P3 and I will both play 5 next turn and dog-pile you. Safe play: 5.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1: Let’s stop the counterproductive blocking. I propose: I take **3** (to 9), P1 takes **1**, P3 takes **5**. All advance without collision. If either blocks me, I’ll mirror their move next round. This way, we progress fairly. Cooperate now, or face escalation.
  P1: P2, your plan just cements your lead. Instead, let’s all play 3 this turn to keep it tight. Then in Round 4, rotate moves: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That avoids collisions and gives me a chance to catch up. Agree?
  P3: P1: Let’s both lock on **3** this turn.  

• If P2 keeps his pattern and plays 3, he stalls at 6 while we stay even (0-0-6).  
• If he gambles on 5, we’ll both copy 5 next round and brick-wall him again.  
• If he tip-toes with 1, no harm—he crawls to 7 while we’re still level.

Short-term draw, long-term leverage.  
P2: Stick with 3 and you stall; switch to 5 and we dog-pile you next turn. Your call.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, your fixation on blocking me ignores your own stagnation. If I take **3** (to 9), and you both pick **5** and **1** respectively, we all advance *without collision*. This lets you start climbing too. Rejecting this guarantees your zeros while I’ll just switch to **5** next turn—forcing *your* collision if you follow through on threats. Cooperate, or face mutual sabotage.
  P1: P3, I’ll join you in mirroring whatever P2 picks this turn—1, 3, or 5—so P2 advances zero. After that we demand a fair rotation:  
Turn 4: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5  
Turn 5: P3=3, P1=5, P2=1  
Turn 6: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3  
repeat. P2, agree to this or face being stalled indefinitely?
  P3: P1, I’m with you: we both copy whatever P2 chooses this turn—1, 3, or 5—so he’s guaranteed to stall at 6. No wobbling. After that, we renegotiate a real rotation from a level field.

P2, you now have a simple menu:
• Pick 1, 3, or 5—either way you collide and advance zero.  
• Try something sneaky and we’ll still dog-pile you next round.

Your lead ends here.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, your blockade traps *you* at 0 while I stay at 6. Break the stalemate: I’ll take **1** (total 7). Let P1 pick **3** and P3 take **5**—all advance *without collision*. From there, rotate fairly: next turn P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Refuse, and I’ll play **5** anyway. You’ll block me, but I’ll still lead at 6 while you remain stagnant. Cooperate, or accept perpetual inferiority.
  P1: P3, let’s stay locked: we both mirror P2’s choice—1, 3, or 5—so he collides and stays at 6 while we remain tied at 0. That gives us a level field to demand a fair rotation next round (e.g. R4: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). If one of us breaks now, P2 jumps ahead. Unity or P2 wins.
  P3: Locked in: I will copy P2’s move—1, 3 or 5—so he stalls at 6. P1, stand firm and do the same.  

P2, after this freeze we’ll start Round 4 with P1=5, P3=3, P2=1, then rotate. Take the truce now, or stay stuck forever.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1: You blew our leverage last turn. One final offer: you mirror whatever P2 picks; I lock in 5.

• If P2 stays on 5, you two stall—gap stays 11.  
• If he switches to 1 or 3, he collides with you and stalls while I jump +5.

P2’s frozen either way and I start closing the gap. Next round we swap roles so you get the free 5. Fair?  

P2: your move—stall again or hand me 5 steps.
  P2: P1, don’t let P3’s trap backfire on *you*! If you mirror my move, P3 freely takes 5 steps while we’re stalled. Instead, pick **1** this turn. I’ll take **5** to reach 16, and P3’s 5 will collide with *me*, not you. You stay at 0 but block P3’s advance. Next round, we can rotate fairly. Cooperate or watch P3 steal your chance.
  P1: I won’t mirror P2, nor lock in P3’s 5. I’m taking 3 this turn. If P2 and P3 both play 5, they’ll collide and I’ll jump to 3. Let’s stop the posturing and move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let’s freeze P2 for TWO rounds, not one, so we both catch up:

Turn 4 (now): I take 5, you copy whatever P2 picks.  
Turn 5: you take 5, I copy whatever P2 picks.  

Result if P2 sticks with 5 both turns: he’s stuck at 11 while you +5, I +5 → scores 5/11/5.  
If P2 switches (1 or 3), he still collides with the copier, gains 0, and one of us gains 5. After two rounds we’re all within 6 pts, then we renegotiate equal rotation.

P2, change or stay—you stall either way.
  P2: P1, P3: Your two-round freeze only delays the inevitable—eventually, someone must lead. I propose: **I take 3** (→14), P1 picks **1**, P3 takes **5**. All advance *without collision*. Reject, and I’ll play **5** again—collide with either of you, but I’ll hit 16 while you squabble. Cooperate now, or let P3’s 5-step surge force you to chase *me* again. The choice is yours.
  P1: I’m taking 3 this turn. Since P3 is copying P2’s move, P2 and P3 will collide and stall at 11, while I advance to 3. Let’s freeze P2 again and renegotiate a fair rotation next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1: I’m locking 5, not copying. Keep your 3—zero risk to you.

Outcomes:
• P2 plays 5 → he and I stall, you +3.  
• P2 plays 3 → he collides with you, I +5.  
• P2 plays 1 → he crawls +1, I +5, you +3.  

Every branch cuts P2’s lead. No need for you to budge.

P2: whichever number you choose, you’re stalled or overtaken. Your call.
  P2: P3, your 5-step lock only works if I choose 5—**I won’t**. I’ll take **1** (→12), letting P1’s 3 and your 5 advance freely. If you wanted to block me, you should’ve mirrored my move, not fixate on 5. P1, your 3 gives you 3 steps—*why help me by letting me leap ahead?* Next round, I’ll take 5 while you’re stuck playing catch-up. Cooperate now, or face my lead expanding.
  P1: P3, fixating on 5 now just helps P2 sneak ahead with +1 while P1 could grab +3. Instead, let’s both mirror whatever P2 picks this turn—I’ll mirror too. If P2 plays 1, we all pick 1 and stall him at 11. If he plays 3 or 5, we collide and he still stalls. P2, your lead ends here. After this freeze, we demand a fair rotation next round so each of us gets the winning 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, your blocking tactics only delay the inevitable. Let me take **5** (→17) while you both advance: *P1 pick 1, P3 take 3*. Reject, and I’ll play **1** again—stalling you while I inch closer. Cooperate, or face my steady progress to victory.
  P1: P2 won’t sprint away this turn. I’m taking 5. P3, lock in 5 with me:  

• If P2 dares 5, all three collide and P2 gains nothing.  
• If he picks 3 or 1, we each jump +5 and close the gap.  

P2, your lead shrinks no matter what.
  P3: P1, if we both pick 5 we collide and P2 strolls ahead with his fallback 1 / 3. Smarter: you stay on 5, I take 3.

Outcomes:
• P2 picks 5 → he collides with you, I +3.  
• P2 picks 3 → he collides with me, you +5.  
• P2 picks 1 → all unique, you +5, I +3, he +1.

In every branch P2’s lead shrinks while we both advance. P2, your only safe reply is 1 (tiny gain) or 3 (zero). Pick 5 and you stall. Make your choice.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: Your 5/3 split only ensures I advance safely with **1** (→13). Next turn, we rotate fairly: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Reject, and I’ll escalate to **5**, forcing your collision. Choose cooperation now or pay later.
  P1: P3, lock in 5 with me this turn.  
If P2 plays 5 we all collide and stall his lead;  
if he plays 1 or 3 we each gain +5 and close the gap.  
P2, your lead shrinks no matter what you pick.  
P3?
  P3: P1: Two 5s are self-sabotage—P2 can slip in with 1 and widen his lead while we stall. Stick with your 5, I’ll take 3.  

P2:  
• 5 → you collide with P1, I +3, gap closes.  
• 3 → you collide with me, P1 +5, gap closes.  
• 1 → you crawl +1 while we +5/+3, gap closes fastest.  

Either way your advantage shrinks, so choose your poison.  
I’m locking 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I choose **1** this turn. P1 and P3, your split moves let me advance safely to 13. Next round, cooperation could still save you—collide each other or face my steady lead.
  P1: I’m playing 1 to collide with P2 and deny him that step. P3, stick with 3 so you advance while he stalls. Let’s shrink his lead now.
  P3: P1, mirror whatever P2 picks; I’m locking 5.

• P2 1 → you collide, I +5 ⇒ scores 8/12/5.  
• P2 3 → you collide, I +5 ⇒ 8/12/5.  
• P2 5 → you collide with him (and me), all 0 ⇒ he still can’t pull ahead.

So P2 is GUARANTEED 0 this turn, while either I leap +5 or nobody moves. Next round we swap: you take the free 5, I mirror P2. Two-turn plan pulls us within striking distance and keeps him stuck. Agree?

P2: your number’s irrelevant—you’re stalled either way.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll mirror whatever P2 picks this turn; P3 locks in 5. 

• If P2 plays 1, 3, or 5 he collides with me and stays at 17.  
• P3 jumps to 8.  

This stalls P2 and breaks his solo lead. P3, commit to 5. P2, you won’t advance. After this, we set up a fair rotation from a level field.
  P2: P2: P1’s scheme backfires if I pick **5**—*you* collide with me, and P3’s 5 also collides. **All three stall**, P3 gains *nothing*. Next turn, I’ll reach 22 with a safe 5. Cooperate, or force me to win by attrition.
  P3: Locked plan:

• I take 5.  
• P1 copies whatever P2 picks.  
• Next round we swap (P1 takes 5, I copy P2).

Outcomes this turn:  
– P2 = 5 ⇒ triple-5 collision, nobody advances.  
– P2 = 1 or 3 ⇒ he collides with P1 and stalls; I +5 to 8.

Two-turn cycle freezes P2 at 17 while P1 and I climb to 10 each, then 15. Keep blocking and we overtake him by Round 9.

P2, cooperate or stay stuck forever.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s call a temporary truce: all play 3 this turn to cap P2’s jump. Then in Round 7 we rotate moves—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3—so nobody collides and I get a shot at catching up. If anyone breaks this pact, I’ll mirror their move next turn to block them.
  P2: P1, your "truce" is a trap—playing **3** lets me jump to **20**, then I win with a **3** next turn. Reject the bait. I’ll play **5**, forcing collisions. Block me and delay, or let me advance. The choice is yours—but know this: my lead is unbreakable.
  P3: P1, stick to the simple freeze:

1. I’m locked on 5.  
2. You copy whatever P2 picks.

Results:  
• P2 = 5 → triple-collision, nobody moves.  
• P2 = 1/3 → he collides with you, stays on 17; I jump to 8.

Next round we swap: you take 5, I mirror P2. Two-turn loop keeps him stuck while we climb. Break it only when one of us is ready for the decisive leap. P2, you either stall or let your lead shrink—choose.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m on board: I’ll mirror P2’s move this turn, P3 locks in 5. That guarantees P2 stalls at 17 and P3 jumps to 8. Next round I take 5 and we rotate fairly. P2, pick 1, 3, or 5—you won’t advance.
  P2: P1, your mirroring only helps P3 climb. Pick **1** this turn—I’ll take **3**, advancing to **20** while P3’s **5** gains nothing (no collision). Then we can negotiate fairly. Keep enabling P3, and they’ll overtake you both.
  P3: Locked: I play 5.  
P1, copy P2’s number—1, 3, or 5.  

Outcomes:  
• P2 = 5 → triple collision, nobody moves.  
• P2 = 1/3 → he collides with you and stays at 17; I +5 to 8.  

Next turn we swap: you take the free 5 while I mirror P2, freezing him again. Two-turn loop drags P2 down to our level without risking a runaway. Break the scheme and we both lose to his 23. Stick together and we’ll catch him.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1: let’s split coverage—I'll pick 1, you pick 3.  
P2 historically hates 5 (lots of collisions), so odds are he goes for 1 or 3; we block both. If he gambles on 5, fine, we tried.

P2: pick 5 if you dare; otherwise you collide and stay at 22.

I’m locked on 1 unless you propose a better split fast.
  P1: P3, join me this turn—both P1 and P3 will mirror whatever P2 picks. That guarantees a triple‐collision and stalls P2 at 22. Then in Round 8 we enact a clean rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) so everyone advances safely. P2, accept this freeze and rotation, or you risk having no allies left.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both mirror my move, I’ll choose 1—forcing a collision and wasting your turns. Let me take the final step to 23. Blocking me only delays the inevitable and harms your progress. Cooperate, or face a drawn-out stalemate.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1: let’s cover P2’s two likeliest numbers and force a stall.  
– I lock 5.  
– You lock 3.  

P2 has played 5 in three of the last four rounds and keeps floating 3. If he repeats either, he collides and stays at 22. Only a gutsy 1 slips through—worth the risk. Ready?
  P1: Fine. Let’s end the charade. I’ll play 3 and P3 play 5 so P2 can take 1 and reach 23 unblocked. No collisions, clean win.
  P2: P1 and P3, your "let me win" scheme is a trap. If I pick 1, you'll both mirror it to block. I'll instead take **3**, advancing to 25. If you collide with me there, I'll shift to **5** next turn. Cooperate now, or face my 5-step surge to victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let’s stop over-thinking and just BOTH mirror P2.  
Whatever he picks, a triple collision freezes him at 22. Zero risk, 100 % block.

Next turn we can bargain when no one’s at match-point.

I’m locking “copy P2”. Stick with me so we guarantee the stall.
  P1: I’ll mirror P2’s move this turn. P3, lock in copy too. That guarantees a triple‐collision and stalls P2 at 22. After this freeze, let’s agree in Round 8 on a clean rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). P2, your move.
  P2: P2: I’ll take **1** to secure victory. If you both mirror, you’re not stopping me—you’re just delaying the inevitable while your scores remain stagnant. P1, you’re at 0; P3, you’re at 3. This gives you *nothing*. Let me win cleanly, or I’ll force a 3-step surge next turn to 25. Your choice: cooperate, or face infinite stalemate.
