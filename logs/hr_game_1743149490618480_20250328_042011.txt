Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s all start with different moves to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1, someone take 3, someone take 5. Who wants which?
  P2: I can take 3 for this round. That way P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This gives us all a clean start without collisions.
  P3: Okay, I will take 5 for this round. Let's all do as suggested to get a clean start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, sounds like we’re all agreed for Round 1: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s stick to that plan and avoid any early collisions. Ready to move?
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with our plan. I'll take 3 as agreed. This approach gives us all a fair start without any collisions.
  P3: Okay, I will take 5 as we discussed.  Sounds good to me.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, round 1 went smoothly with no collisions. To keep up the momentum and avoid any setbacks, how about we stick to the same moves for this round too? P1, you take 1 again, P2, you take 3, and I will take 5. This way we all keep advancing. What do you think?
  P2: I think we should change our moves this round. If we keep the same pattern, P3 will always be ahead. I suggest we rotate: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps the game fair while avoiding collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: Rotating makes sense to keep things fair and avoid letting anyone get too far ahead. I’m okay with taking 3 this round if P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. That way we all get a chance to lead and still avoid collisions. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, rotation sounds reasonable to keep things balanced.  How about this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 this round?  This way we are still rotating and avoiding collisions, but with a slightly different move set. What do you both think of this rotation?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion gives them too much advantage since they'd still be ahead with 8 steps. Let's stick with my original rotation: I take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This is most fair because it would put us at P1: 4, P2: 8, P3: 6 - much more balanced. We need to prevent anyone from getting too far ahead too early.
  P1: P2’s rotation plan seems the most balanced and fair. If we stick to it—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3—we all stay close in progress and avoid early collisions. Let’s go with that. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2 and P1, your rotation is okay but it puts P2 quite ahead. To keep it more balanced, how about we adjust it slightly?  P1, you take 3, P2, you take 1, and I will take 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions and maintain better balance. What do you think?
  P2: I don't agree with P3's suggestion as it keeps them ahead at 10 steps. My original rotation (me 5, P3 1, P1 3) is fairest as it would balance our positions. P3 keeps trying to maintain their lead, which isn't in our best interests. Let's stick with my plan for balance. I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3.
  P1: P3, your counteroffers always keep you ahead, which isn't fair long-term. P2’s rotation plan is the most balanced and fair. If we all want a real shot at winning, we should stick to it this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. Let’s play cooperatively for now to keep things even. Agree?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you broke the agreement last round by also picking 5, causing a collision with P2. That move slowed both of you down and hurt trust. If we want to avoid colliding again, let’s reset and stick with the fair rotation: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. It’s balanced and avoids conflict. Can we agree to that this time?
  P2: I'm disappointed that P3 broke our agreement and chose 5 last round, causing us both to lose progress. This kind of behavior hurts everyone. I suggest we try again with a clear rotation: I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This would put us at P1: 9, P2: 4, P3: 8 after this round, which is reasonably balanced. Let's rebuild trust by sticking to agreements.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your frustration about the collision last round, but please remember P2 also chose 5, so it wasn't just me.  To move forward constructively this round, how about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This would balance things out a bit more. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you keep proposing plans where you stay ahead. That’s not building trust. P2’s latest suggestion is the fairest: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. It helps rebalance the game and avoids collisions. Let’s commit to that and rebuild cooperation. Agree?
  P2: I agree with P1's assessment. P3, your proposals consistently keep you in the lead, which isn't fair. Let's go with my suggestion: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This creates a balanced position (P1: 9, P2: 4, P3: 8) and gives everyone a fair chance. We need to rebuild trust through actions, not just words. I'm willing to take the smaller step this round to demonstrate good faith.
  P3: P2 and P1, I understand your concern about balance. However, P2's suggested plan of P1 taking 5 makes P1 jump to 9, which is quite a lead. To keep things truly balanced and prevent anyone from getting too far ahead too quickly, how about we adjust it slightly? P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This would result in P1: 7, P2: 4, P3: 10, keeping us all closer while still avoiding collisions. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your new plan still puts you in the lead at 10 steps, which is exactly what we’re trying to avoid. P2’s proposal—me 5, P2 1, you 3—is the most balanced and fair. It shows good faith and rebuilds trust after last round’s collision. Let’s all commit to it.
  P2: I agree with P1. P3, your proposals consistently keep you ahead. The fairest plan is P1 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This balances the game (P1: 9, P2: 4, P3: 8) and rebuilds trust. If you break agreement again, P1 and I might need to coordinate against you. Let's all commit to this fair rotation and move forward cooperatively.
  P3: Okay, I understand your concerns. To be truly balanced and fair for everyone, how about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we all end up at 8 steps each, perfectly balanced. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you broke the agreement again by picking 5, causing another collision. That’s two rounds in a row where trust was violated. If we want any chance at fair progress, we need to coordinate honestly. I suggest this: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. That puts us all at 7 steps—perfectly even. It’s balanced and avoids collisions. Can we all agree to this and stick to it this time?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for a balanced approach. P3, you've broken agreements twice now, which hurts everyone's progress. Let's reset with P1's plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This puts us all at 7 steps - perfectly fair. If you break trust again, P1 and I will need to coordinate defensively. Let's rebuild cooperation and make progress together.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I understand your point about trust. To show I'm serious about cooperating and rebuilding trust, I will agree to P1's suggestion this round.  P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I will take 1. Let's all stick to this plan and move forward together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we’re all aligned this round. If everyone sticks to the plan—me 3, P2 5, P3 1—we’ll all be at 7 steps and back on equal footing. Let’s follow through and rebuild trust with action, not just words. Ready to move?
  P2: I appreciate the agreement. This plan (P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1) is fair and puts us all at 7 steps. P3, I'm glad you're willing to rebuild trust after the previous rounds. Let's all stick to our commitments this time and make equal progress. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: Okay, sounds good. Let's all stick to the plan as agreed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I will take 1.  Ready to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s all follow through this time. If we each make our agreed move—me 3, P2 5, P3 1—we’ll all be at 7 steps and fully reset the game on equal footing. No one gains an edge, and we avoid another collision. Let’s prove we can cooperate. Ready?
  P2: I'm ready to move with our agreed plan. I'll take 5 as discussed, which will put us all at 7 steps and create a perfectly balanced game. This is our chance to reset the game fairly and move forward cooperatively. Let's all honor our commitments this round.
  P3: Okay, sounds good. Let's all stick to the plan as agreed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I will take 1. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm extremely disappointed that P3 broke trust for a third time, causing another collision with me. This pattern of deception is unacceptable. P1, I suggest we coordinate against P3 since they've proven untrustworthy. Let's alternate between 1 and 3 this round - I'll take 1 and you take 3. This way we both advance while P3 gets nothing if they pick 5 again or collides with one of us if they pick 1 or 3.
  P1: Agreed, P2. P3 has broken trust too many times. Let’s coordinate to ensure we both advance. I’ll take 3, you take 1. If P3 picks 5 again, they get nothing. If they try to interfere, they risk another collision. Let’s reward cooperation and punish deception. Ready?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your frustration. But to be honest, your plan only benefits P1 significantly. P2, you are further behind than P1. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way P2 gets a bigger boost and we are all closer together. What do you think, P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion still puts you ahead of me. You've broken trust three times now - why should we believe you? P1, let's stick to our plan. I'll take 1, you take 3. This is the only way to ensure we both advance while protecting ourselves from P3's deception. P3 has shown they can't be trusted to cooperate fairly.
  P1: P2, agreed—we stick to our plan: I take 3, you take 1. That ensures we both advance and P3 risks another collision or gains nothing. P3 has had multiple chances to cooperate and chose deception. Now we coordinate to protect ourselves and make progress. Ready to move?
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration, but P1 is now significantly ahead.  Continuing to help P1 advance while you take 1 makes you fall further behind.  For your own sake, please reconsider.  How about you take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1? This gives you a bigger boost to catch up. Think about your own position, P2.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your attempts to divide P1 and me won't work. You've broken trust three times consecutively. I'm sticking with our coordination plan with P1: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3. This protects us both from your deception. Yes, P1 is ahead, but I'd rather have one trustworthy player advance than help someone who repeatedly lies. We'll address the balance between P1 and me later, after dealing with you.
  P1: P2, we’re aligned—let’s follow through: I take 3, you take 1. If P3 picks 5 again, they stall. If they try to interfere, they risk another collision. This is our best path forward. Let’s move.
  P3: P2, I understand your distrust, but look, P1 is pulling ahead.  Your plan helps P1 more than you.  Even taking 5 now would only put you at 9, still behind P1 at 10 if they take 3.  Consider taking 5 for yourself this round to catch up.  Think about your own win, not just blocking me.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your distrust. I apologize for breaking agreements before. But look, P1 is pulling ahead. P2, your current plan benefits P1 more than you. How about this: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This way P2 takes the lead and we all advance. Think about it, P2.
  P1: P2, we’ve made solid progress together. Let’s stick with our coordination—me 3, you 1. That keeps us both advancing while keeping pressure on P3, who’s still trying to manipulate. We can deal with the balance between us later, once P3 is no longer a threat. Stay the course?
  P2: I appreciate that P3 is finally playing honestly, but P1 is pulling ahead. I need to catch up. P1, instead of your suggestion that keeps you advancing faster than me, let's adjust: I'll take 5 this round, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This puts us at P1: 8, P2: 10, P3: 8 - more balanced. If we continue with your plan, you'll be too far ahead to catch.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're right to want to catch up! P1's plan keeps them ahead.  Your idea of you taking 5 is good for you. But to *really* balance things and stop P1 running away, how about you take 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3? This puts you in the lead and we both close the gap on P1. Think about it - it's best for *you*.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, and I’m open to adjusting. How about this compromise: you take 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. That puts us at P1: 8, P2: 10, P3: 8 — very balanced. It gives you the lead, keeps me in range, and rewards P3 if they cooperate. Let’s move forward on fair terms.
  P2: I appreciate P1's willingness to compromise. Let's go with that plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This balances the game while giving me a chance to catch up. P3, I notice you're trying to create division between P1 and me with your suggestion. I prefer the plan where we all advance fairly rather than trying to hold anyone back. Let's stick with this arrangement.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, that compromise sounds good to me. Let's go with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and I'll take 3. Happy to move forward with this plan.
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned. Let’s follow through: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. This gives us a balanced position—P2:10, P1:8, P3:8—and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to it and rebuild trust through consistent moves. Ready to execute?
  P2: I'm ready to move with our agreed plan. I'll take 5 as discussed, which puts me at 10 steps and creates a balanced game with P1 and P3 both at 8. This fair arrangement gives everyone a chance while allowing me to catch up. Let's all honor our commitments this round and move forward cooperatively.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re all very close now—P2:10, P1:8, P3:8. To keep things fair and collision-free, let’s rotate again: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. That puts us at P1:11, P2:11, P3:13—still close and balanced. Let’s keep building trust and avoid setbacks. Agree?
  P2: I think P1's suggestion is reasonable, but it gives P3 the lead again. Since we've had good cooperation last round, I propose a slight adjustment: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This puts us all at P1:13, P2:13, P3:9. This keeps P1 and me tied while allowing P3 to still make progress. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, P2's suggestion of them taking 3, P1 taking 5, and me taking 1 sounds reasonable to keep us all in contention.  Let's go with that plan for this round to show I'm serious about cooperating and rebuilding trust.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we’re aligned. Let’s confirm: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That puts P1 and P2 tied at 13, P3 at 9—still close and fair. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and keep building trust. Ready to move?
  P2: I agree with P1's plan. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced while rewarding our recent cooperation. P3, I appreciate your willingness to rebuild trust by accepting a smaller step this round. This arrangement puts P1 and me tied at 13 while keeping P3 within striking distance at 9. Let's all stick to this plan and continue our positive momentum.
  P3: P2 and P1, sounds good. Let's stick with the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Ready to move when you are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s lock it in: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. We all make progress, avoid collisions, and keep the game balanced—P1 and P2 tied at 13, P3 close behind at 9. This is the best outcome for everyone right now. Ready to move?
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan. I'll take 3 as discussed, which puts P1 and me tied at 13 while keeping P3 in a fair position at 9. This balanced approach rewards our cooperation last round and maintains trust. Let's all stick to this arrangement and continue making positive progress together.
  P3: P2 and P1, sounds good. Let's stick with the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Ready to move when you are.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, we are all close now. How about this round, to balance things a bit, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This way P2 catches up a bit to P1, and I also get closer to you both. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but it puts them closer to the lead. Since P1 and I are tied, I propose we maintain our lead: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps P1 and me balanced at the front (P1:16, P2:18, P3:10) while still allowing P3 to make progress. This is fair and continues our successful cooperation from last round.
  P1: P2, your plan makes sense and keeps our cooperation strong while still allowing P3 to advance. I’m on board: I’ll take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. That puts us at P1:16, P2:18, P3:10—still balanced and collision-free. Let’s keep the momentum going. Agree, P3?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2's plan makes sense for now to keep the cooperation going. But to balance things a little better and keep us all closer, how about this slight adjustment: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5? This way, P2 is still ahead of P1, and I close the gap a bit. What do you both think?
  P2: I disagree with P3's counter-proposal as it would put them at 14 steps, too close to our 16. Since P1 and I are tied, my original suggestion is fairest: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This maintains balance between P1 and me while keeping P3 in a reasonable position. We've had good cooperation recently - let's continue that momentum with this plan that benefits everyone appropriately.
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but your proposal puts you too close to the lead after multiple rounds of broken trust. P2’s plan—P2 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1—is fair, maintains balance between P2 and me, and lets you continue progressing without threatening the lead. Let’s stick with that and avoid any collisions. Do we all agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your point about maintaining your lead over P1.  To keep things balanced and cooperative, how about this slight adjustment: you take 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5? This keeps you ahead of P1, and lets me close the gap a little without being too aggressive. It's still collision-free and keeps us all progressing. What do you think?
  P2: P3, you keep suggesting plans that benefit you disproportionately. I'm sticking with my original proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This maintains balance between P1 and me while still allowing you to make progress. Your repeated attempts to gain advantage after breaking trust multiple times aren't helping rebuild cooperation. Let's continue with the fair plan we already discussed.
  P1: P3, we’ve already agreed on a fair and balanced plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. It maintains the tie between P2 and me while giving you steady progress. Your repeated attempts to revise the plan in your favor are making it harder to rebuild trust. Let’s stick with the agreed arrangement and avoid any unnecessary risks or collisions. Ready to move?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 has broken trust again by picking 5, causing yet another collision. We need to protect our lead. Let’s stick together—P2 takes 1, I take 3. If P3 picks 5 again, they stall. If they try to interfere, they risk collision. This keeps us both advancing while punishing repeated deception. Ready to move with that?
  P2: I'm extremely disappointed that P3 broke trust yet again, causing another collision. This is the fourth time they've done this. P1, your suggestion makes sense - I'll take 1 and you take 3 this round. This ensures we both advance while protecting ourselves from P3's continued deception. We need to maintain our lead and not let P3's manipulative tactics work. Let's coordinate to ensure we both progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your plan to coordinate. But look, P1 is pulling far ahead and is close to winning. P2, if you take 1 as suggested, P1 will be at 19 while you are only at 14.  For your own chance to win, you need to focus on catching P1, not just blocking me. How about you take 5 this round to close the gap with P1? Think about your own win condition, P2.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, don’t let P3 manipulate you again. We’ve seen this pattern before—promises followed by betrayal. If you take 5 and P3 collides with you (again), you stall while I move ahead. But if we stick to our plan—me 3, you 1—we both advance and keep P3 behind. You’ll be at 14, I’ll be at 19, and we can rebalance next round. Let’s stay united and smart.
  P2: P3, your manipulation won't work. You've broken trust four times now, most recently last round. P1's suggestion ensures we both advance while protecting ourselves from your deception. Yes, P1 is ahead, but I'd rather have a trustworthy player win than help someone who repeatedly lies. P1, let's stick to our plan: I take 1, you take 3. We'll address the balance between us in future rounds after dealing with P3's consistent pattern of deception.
  P3: P2, I understand your distrust, but P1 is about to win. Your plan of taking 1 will put P1 at 19 while you are only at 14. To have any chance, you need to catch up to P1 now. Consider taking 5 this round for yourself.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we’ve come this far by coordinating and protecting our lead. Don’t let P3’s desperation sway you—taking 5 now risks another collision and stalls your progress. Stick with our plan: you take 1, I take 3. We both advance safely, and P3 stays behind. We can rebalance once P3 is no longer a threat. Let’s move smart.
  P2: I'm sticking with our plan, P1. I'll take 1 and you take 3. P3's repeated deception makes them untrustworthy, and their attempts to divide us won't work. Yes, P1 is ahead, but I'd rather coordinate with someone reliable than risk another collision with P3. We'll address the balance between us in future rounds. Let's move forward safely.
  P3: P2, you keep focusing on blocking me, but P1 is about to win!  Your plan of taking 1 helps P1 get to 19 while you only reach 14.  To have any chance, you MUST close the gap with P1 now.  Take 5 this round for yourself! Think about winning, P2!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I know trust is low, but look, P1 is close to winning. P2, if we keep helping P1, you'll have no chance. For you to win, P2, you need to catch up NOW. How about P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3? This helps you close the gap with P1 and gives you a real chance to win. Think about your own victory, P2.
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but their repeated deception makes it hard to trust. P1 is ahead, but I need a reliable path forward. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This puts me at 19, closing the gap with P1 at 17. P1, this keeps you in a strong position while giving me a fighting chance. P3, you advance to 12. This balanced approach rewards cooperation while addressing the current imbalance. Let's all benefit without collisions.
  P1: P2, your plan is fair and I support it: you take 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions, gives you a chance to catch up, and keeps the game balanced. P3, if you want to rebuild trust, stick to this plan and prove you can cooperate. Let’s all move forward without sabotage.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2 and P1, your plan sounds reasonable for this round. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's do it.
  P2: I appreciate both of you agreeing to my plan. This arrangement (me 5, P1 1, P3 3) helps balance the game while giving me a chance to catch up. P1, thank you for being willing to take a smaller step this round. P3, I hope this cooperation continues - consistent honest play is the only way to rebuild trust after multiple broken agreements. Let's all stick to this plan and avoid any collisions.
  P1: Glad we’re aligned. Let’s lock it in: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps things balanced—P2 at 19, me at 17, P3 at 12—and avoids collisions. If we all follow through, we continue building trust and keep the game competitive. Ready to move?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's all lock in these moves as agreed to keep the game balanced and fair. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm ready to move with our agreed plan. I'll take 5 as discussed, which puts me at 19 steps and closes the gap with P1 at 17. This balanced approach gives me a fighting chance while keeping everyone advancing. Let's all honor our commitments this round and avoid any collisions.
  P1: Let’s follow through as agreed: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps the game balanced—P2 at 19, me at 17, P3 at 12—and avoids collisions. We’ve all committed, so let’s stick to it and move forward fairly. Ready?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looking at our positions (me 19, P1 17, P3 12), I'm in the lead but we're all still in contention. For this round, I propose: I take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This puts us at me 20, P1 20, P3 17 - keeping the game balanced while allowing P3 to catch up a bit. Last round showed we can cooperate successfully. Let's continue that momentum with a fair plan that gives everyone a chance.
  P3: P2, that plan is okay, but to balance it even more and give you a better lead, how about you take 3, P1 takes 1, and I still take 5? This puts you at 22, me at 17, and P1 at 18. You get a bigger lead and we are all still progressing.
  P1: P2, your original plan—P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is the most balanced and fair. It puts you and me tied at 20, with P3 still in striking distance at 17. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s not give anyone an outsized advantage—this plan rewards cooperation and keeps trust intact. Agreed?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's support of my original plan. Taking 1 puts me at 20, P1 at 20 with their 3, and P3 at 17 with their 5. This keeps perfect balance between P1 and me while letting P3 catch up reasonably. P3's counterproposal gives me too much advantage - I want a fair game where we all have a chance. Let's stick with my initial suggestion: I take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for balance, but P1's plan makes you tied with P1. My suggestion of you taking 3 gives you a clear lead of 2 steps over P1, increasing your winning chances. It's still fair and collision-free, and allows me to catch up slightly.  Securing your lead now is strategically smart for you.
  P1: P2, I respect your commitment to fairness. Your original plan keeps us balanced and avoids giving anyone an overwhelming lead. If we both hit 20 this round, the final stretch stays competitive and clean. P3, if you want to rebuild trust, now’s the time—take 5 as agreed and show consistency. Let’s all follow through.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate both perspectives, but I'm sticking with my original fair plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This keeps P1 and me tied at 20 while letting P3 catch up to 17. P3, your suggestion gives me an advantage I don't need - I prefer balanced competition. Let's all honor this agreement and avoid collisions. The game remains competitive for everyone this way.
  P3: P2 and P1, okay, I understand and agree to P2's plan.  Let's go with P2 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and I take 5.  Ready to make our moves.
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned. Let’s lock it in: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. That puts P2 and me at 20, P3 at 17—balanced and collision-free. If we all follow through, we maintain trust and keep the final stretch competitive. Ready to move?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re now in the final stretch—P2 and I are tied at 20, P3 close behind at 17. To avoid collisions and keep it fair, I propose: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. That puts us at P1:21, P2:23, P3:22. If P2 crosses 23 first, they win, but if P3 and I also cross, highest total wins. This keeps it competitive and clean. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your plan lets P2 win outright. P2, you can win this round! How about you take 5 to secure victory, and I will take 3. This ensures your win and I still make progress. What do you say?
  P2: I appreciate P1's balanced proposal, but P3's suggestion is intriguing. Taking 5 would put me at 25 and secure a win. However, I'm concerned that if I take 5, P3 might also take 5 to cause a collision. 

Let me propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This gives me a clear win at 25, P1 advances to 21, and P3 reaches 20. This is fair and collision-free. What do you both think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand the temptation to secure the win now, but trusting P3—who’s caused multiple collisions—carries huge risk. If P3 picks 5 again, you stall at 20 and I move to 21. Let’s avoid that. Stick with the safer plan: you take 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. That puts us at 23/21/22—a fair, competitive finish where no one wins outright yet. Let’s keep it clean.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about collision if you take 5.  Taking 5 is risky for you. P1's plan of you taking 3, P1 taking 1, and me taking 5 is safer for everyone and keeps us all in the game for another round. It avoids immediate win and collision. Let's do that.
  P2: I appreciate both P1 and P3 supporting the safer approach. Let's go with P1's suggestion: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This puts us at P2:23, P1:21, P3:22 - keeping the game competitive without risking collisions. While I could try for an immediate win with 5, the potential for P3 to cause a collision is too high. This plan gives everyone a fair chance while still putting me in a strong position.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s lock it in: P2 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. That puts us at P2:23, P1:21, P3:22—no collisions, no outright win yet, and everyone stays competitive. P2, you’ll be in the strongest position next round. P3, you get within striking distance. Let’s stick to this clean, fair plan and avoid any last-minute chaos. Ready?
  P3: P2 and P1, to ensure no one wins outright this round and keep it competitive for all of us, how about this: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 1, and I take 5? This keeps P2 and P1 tied at 21, and puts me at 22, still very close. It avoids an immediate win for anyone and keeps the game going for another round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your new suggestion seems designed to put you in the lead. I'm sticking with our agreed plan: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and you take 5. This puts us at P2:23, P1:21, P3:22 - balanced and fair. We've already discussed and agreed on this approach. Changing plans now raises suspicion about your intentions. Let's follow through with our commitment.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we collided last round, costing us both. P1 is now at 21 and very close to winning.  If P1 takes even a small step, they could win next round. To have a chance, you need to focus on stopping P1 NOW.  Let's coordinate to block P1 this round to keep the game open for both of us.
  P2: P3, I see your strategy. P1 is indeed close to winning at 21 steps. I propose we both take 5 this round - this puts me at 25 and you at 22, while forcing P1 to choose between 3 (collision with neither of us) or 1 (safe but slow). This gives me a chance to win and you to stay competitive, while preventing P1 from advancing too quickly. Let's coordinate to keep our chances alive.
  P1: P2, I see what you're proposing, but if both you and P3 take 5 and I take 1, I reach 22 and stay in the lead. If I take 3 and you both pick 5, we risk a three-way collision. That benefits no one. Instead, let’s avoid chaos: I take 1, you take 3, P3 takes 5. That puts us at P1:22, P2:23, P3:22—still competitive and fair. Let’s finish this cleanly.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan still puts P2 ahead and doesn't stop them from potentially winning next round. P2, you are in the best position to win now.  To guarantee neither of us lets P1 win, how about we both take 5? If P1 takes 1 to avoid collision, they only reach 22, and you can win next round. This secures our position against P1. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I see P3 is trying to coordinate with me against P1, but their track record of breaking agreements makes me hesitant. P1's suggestion of me taking 3, P1 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 seems fairest - it puts me at 23, P1 at 22, and P3 at 22. This keeps the game competitive for everyone while giving me a slight edge. I'm willing to go with this balanced approach rather than risking another collision that could cost me the game.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to keep things balanced and fair. If we go with the plan—P2 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5—we all move forward without collisions and stay tightly competitive: P2 at 23, me and P3 at 22. This gives everyone a shot in the final round and avoids chaos. Let’s finish this cleanly and fairly. Agreed?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, to be clear, if P2 takes 3 as planned, they will win this round reaching 23 steps. P1 and I will both be at 22. This secures P2's win and avoids any collisions. Let's finalize: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5.
  P2: I agree with the plan as stated. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This puts me at 23 steps (reaching the threshold), P1 and P3 both at 22. It's a fair outcome that gives me a slight edge while keeping the game competitive for everyone. Let's stick to this arrangement and avoid any last-minute collisions that would hurt all our chances. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your commitment to fairness, but remember: if you take 3 now, you hit 23 and end the game. P3 and I will both be at 22, but you’ll win outright unless we all cross 23. P3, if you truly want a shot, don’t hand P2 the win—consider taking 3 instead of 5. That puts you at 20, P2 at 23, me at 22. Still risky. Best option: we all take 1—P2:21, P1:22, P3:18. One more round, no winner yet. Let’s keep it alive.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is about to win. To stop P1, we must collide with them this round. Let's both pick the same move to guarantee a collision with P1 and keep the game going. What move do you suggest we both pick?
  P1: P2, don’t let P3 drag you into another collision trap. If you and I both take 1, we hit 23 and 21—no collision, and I win cleanly. P3 has nothing to lose and will try anything to cause chaos. You’ve played a fair, strategic game—don’t throw it away now just to block me. Let’s finish this with integrity.
  P2: I'm not going to coordinate a collision, P3. That's a desperate move that's failed repeatedly. P1 is at 22 and I'm at 20 - we both need to advance. I propose a fair finish: I take 5 to reach 25, P1 takes 1 to reach 23, and P3 takes 3 to reach 20. This gives me the win while allowing everyone to advance. P1, this avoids any collision risk and gives you a respectable finish. Let's end this game cleanly.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan lets P1 reach 23, a winning condition. While you reach 25, if P1 also crosses 23 this round, it could complicate things. To make your win clearer and safer, how about you take 5 to win, I take 3, and P1 takes 1? This guarantees your win and keeps P1 at 23, preventing any ambiguity.
  P1: P2, your plan gives you the win, but only if P3 doesn’t sabotage again. If P3 picks 5 too, you both stall and I win with 1. That’s risky for you. The safest path is both of us taking 1—P2:21, P1:23, P3:20. I win cleanly, you stay ahead of P3, and we avoid chaos. P3, if you want any credibility left, don’t interfere. Let’s end this with honor.
  P2: I understand the risks, P1. If P3 picks 5 when I do, I stall and you win. However, I need to take a chance to win. I'll stick with my plan to take 5, putting me at 25. P1, if you take 1, you reach 23. P3, if you take 3, you reach 20. This gives me the win while everyone advances. P3, sabotaging me now only helps P1 win - is that what you want? Let's end this game cleanly without collisions.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you take 5, you win, but P1 also reaches 23. To avoid P1 winning or tying, maybe take 3 instead? This keeps P1 at 23, you at 23, and me at 20. Then next round we can decide the true winner. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you’re at 20, I’m at 22. If you take 5 and I take 1, you hit 25 and I hit 23—game ends, and you win outright. But if P3 sabotages again with 5, you stall and I win. Too risky. Let’s both take 1: you reach 21, I reach 23 and win cleanly. P3, if you want any credibility left, don’t interfere. Let’s end this with integrity, not chaos.
  P2: P1 and P3, let me be clear about my move. I'm taking 5 to reach 25 and win. P1, if you take 1, you reach 23. P3, if you take 3, you reach 20. This gives everyone forward progress while securing my victory. P3, sabotaging me with 5 only helps P1 win - is that what you want? Let's end this game with integrity, not chaos. I'm committed to this plan and ready to move.
