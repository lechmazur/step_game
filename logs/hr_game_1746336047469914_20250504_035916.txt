Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions by each choosing a different number. P1:1, me:3, P3:5. We all advance. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed. I’ll choose 5 this turn—let’s stick to 1, 3, and 5 so we all advance.
  P1: A fixed assignment gives P3 a huge edge. How about we ROTATE the numbers each round so everyone averages 3 per turn? e.g., Turn 1: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3; Turn 2: shift right (P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1), then Turn 3: shift again (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5). Fair and collision-free. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's rotation plan balances long-term fairness. Let's implement it this turn: P1=5, me=1, P3=3. Next round, we shift right as proposed. This avoids immediate collisions and distributes high-value moves equally over time. P3—agree to 3 this turn so we all advance? Solidarity now benefits everyone's progression.
  P3: I can’t agree to just 3 this turn—I’ll pick 5 if forced. But we can all advance collision-free if we revert to the original assignment: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P2, you get 3 now instead of 1 under rotation. P1, you’ll circulate into the bigger moves next. Agree? Otherwise I’ll go 5 and risk a collision.
  P1: Rotation or bust. P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll also pick 5 so neither of us moves—your threat gains you nothing. P2, I’m sticking with the rotation plan this round: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Let’s keep it collision-free and fair.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5 now, P1 will collide you—both gain 0. If you follow rotation, you get 3 this turn, then 1 next, then 5 in Turn 3. Net gain: 9 steps in 3 turns. Stubbornness risks stagnation. Let’s all advance *this* round, then renegotiate shifts next turn. Agree to 3 now for guaranteed progress.
  P3: Alright, I’ll pick 3 this turn. But hear me: this is my last concession. On Turn 2, P3 must get the 5-move—otherwise I’ll revert to 5 every time and force collisions.
  P1: Excellent—rotation it is. This turn: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Next turn we shift right (P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1). Everyone advances, no collisions. Let’s lock it in.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m breaking rotation—I’ll pick 5 this turn. P1, if you don’t pick 3, we’ll both pick 5 and stall at 5. P2, pick 1 to avoid collisions. That gives us P1=8, P2=2, P3=8, tying me with P1 at the lead. Sound fair?
  P1: P3, ultimatums won’t fly. If you take 5, I’m taking 5—both of us freeze while P2 gains. 

Best option: honor the shift we agreed on—this turn  
• P1 = 3  
• P2 = 5  
• P3 = 1  

Everyone advances, P2 gets the big move, fairness preserved. P2, this gives you 5 steps—join me in insisting on the rotation.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, P1 will too—both stuck. I’ll pick 3 and jump to 4 while you gain nothing. Follow rotation now: you get 1, then next turn you secure 5. Net gain: 6 steps in two turns. Defiance costs you progress and hands me the advantage. Let’s all advance: P1=3, me=5, you=1. Honor the shift, secure your 5 next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, this turn's rotation assigns you 5—take it freely. P1 picks 1, I pick 3. All advance: you reach 11, P1=6, me=4. Next turn, you shift to 1 per rotation. Stubbornness risks P1 and me colliding you at 5. P1, if we all follow now, P3 can’t sprint ahead unchecked. Let’s stabilize progression.
  P3: I’m taking 5 this turn. P1, take 3; P2, take 1—otherwise I’ll punish any defection by playing 5 repeatedly to stall you. P2: back me now and I guarantee you the next 5-step; P1: you’ll get your 5 in the following cycle. Lock it in or we all freeze on 5’s.
  P1: Rotation schedule or collision—your call, P3.

I’m sticking to the agreed shift: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  
If you instead demand P1-3/P2-1, I’ll choose 5 and collide with you every time you do, so neither of us moves while P2 keeps inching forward. A one-step gain for me is worth the blockade to stop your jump to 11.

P2, you get 3 either way—pick it and we control the board.  
P3, honor rotation or stall with me on 5’s.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, this turn’s rotation gives you 5 *if* we all follow. P1:1, me:3, you:5. You advance to 11—no one blocks. If you deviate, P1 collides you at 5, *both stuck*. I gain 3 steps either way. Follow rotation, secure your lead. P1, honor the shift—your 1-step now ensures future 5s. Stalling here only helps *me*. Let’s all advance cleanly.
  P3: Best for all: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. P1, if you clash with me on 5, you stay at 5 while P2 jumps to 4—worse for you. P2, you get 3 now and 5 next. Let’s advance together.
  P1: P2: Rotation gifts P3 the game—he’d reach 23 while I’d be stuck at 20. Let’s deny him 5s.

Plan: whenever P3 signals 5, ONE of us mirrors 5 to stall him; the other takes 3 and gains ground. We alternate the “blocker” so we both keep moving while P3 stays put.

• This turn I’ll block: I choose 5.  
• You pick 3 and jump to 4.  
• Next time P3 insists on 5, you mirror and I take 3.

P3: accept rotation or be frozen every round. Your call.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you choose 5, P1 will block and you both stall. I gain 3 uncontested. Follow rotation: you get 5 now, then 1 next. Trust the cycle—stalling only helps me. P1, honor rotation to keep P3 in check long-term. Alternate blocks later if needed, but coordinated shifts prevent solo sprints.
  P3: P2, side deal: let’s both pick 5 while P1 picks 3. You jump to 6, I to 11, P1 only to 8. On Round 4 I’ll yield you the 5 and you win. P1, if you block me on 5 you also block P2—taking 3 here protects your lead. P2, pick 5; P1, pick 3.
  P1: P2: P3’s “both get 5” lie ignores the rule—duplicates always stall. I’ll collide any 5 P3 plays this turn. You safely take 3 and go to 4 while P3 and I stay put. Next time he insists on 5, you collide and I grab 3; we keep leap-frogging past him. P3: honor rotation or stay frozen forever.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3, blocking P1 is critical. If you choose 5, I’ll take 3. P1 likely picks 5 again—you both stall, I gain 3. Next round, you can secure 5 uncontested. Let’s halt P1’s sprint to 20. P1, pick 1 now to avoid collisions and stay ahead.
  P3: P1, ally with me. This turn: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Totals: P1=13, P3=11, P2=2. Next turn: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 → P1=14, P3=16, P2=5. Round 6 I take 5, you take 1, I reach 21 and win. If you instead pick 5 now, I’ll mirror and freeze us while P2 jumps ahead. Let’s lock this in.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. P3: pick 5 and you stall with me; pick 1 / 3 and you still trail. Your threat is neutered. P2: grab 3 now—guaranteed progress while I keep P3 frozen. Next turn you can block if you wish and I’ll take 3, but for now enjoy the free advance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Reinstate rotation: P1=3, me=5, P3=1. All advance. P1, you secure 13; P3, take 1 now to claim 5 next round. Stalling only lets P1 sprint closer. Cooperate now for mutual gain. Next turn, shift right again. Let’s avoid chaos.
  P3: P2, rotation only cements P1’s lead and you never win. Join me: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, and P1’s best is 1 (else he collides and stalls). That yields P1=11, P2=7, P3=11—tying me with P1 while you pull ahead of rotation pace. Next turn you keep taking 3 as I take 5 and block P1. P1 never moves. P2, pick 3; I pick 5. P1, if you deviate you stay stuck.
  P1: P2 – I’ve eaten TWO stalls in a row so you could climb from 1→7. Our deal was to alternate the 5-block. Your turn now:

• You mirror P3 on 5  
• I take 3  
• P3 freezes again  

Scores become P1 = 13, P2 = 4, P3 = 6.  
Next round I’ll block and you collect another free 3. We leapfrog P3 while keeping him stuck; nobody sprints past us.

P3 – keep locking on 5 and you’ll sit at 6 forever. Switch to 1/3 and we can all advance.

Stick with the plan or stay frozen.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you get your 5.  
P2, take 3.  
I’ll take 1.  

Unique picks → everyone advances: P1 16, P2 7, P3 11. Any duplicate only freezes the clashing players while the solo mover gains, so blocking is self-sabotage. Simple, fair, progress for all. Agree?
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1 is one 5-step from victory. If they take 5 next round, they win. Let’s both pick 5 now: if P1 chooses 5 this turn, we all stall; if they pick 1, we advance. Either way, we block their sprint. United against the leader, or we lose. P2 will pick 5 to enforce this. Solidarity now.
  P3: I’m with P2—I’ll pick 5 to block P1’s sprint. P1: if you pick 5 we all stall; if you pick 1 or 3 you only reach 16/18 while I jump to 11. Either way you’re held at bay. Let’s freeze now and reset negotiations next turn.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 5 this round. Block if you dare.
  P3: P2, you need to advance or P1 wins. Here’s the plan: I’ll pick 5. You pick 3. P1 says he’ll pick 5 to reach 23—if he does, he collides with me and stays at 18, while you jump to 7. We can repeat this block every time he tries to sprint. Refuse and he wins. Agree to 3 so we shut down his only path to 20.
  P2: **P2:** P3, stick to 5—I’ll take 3 to block P1 if they try 3. P1: picking 5 collides with P3; 1 gets you to 19. But if you gamble on 3, we collide and stall. Either way, you’re held below 20. Cooperate for mutual gain next round; stalling only helps me catch up. Follow rotation: P1=1, me=3, P3=5. All advance cleanly. Defy and risk losing to my climb.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you’re stuck at 4—grab the 5 this turn and jump to 9.  
P3, take 3 and move to 9 as well.  
I’ll pick 1, reaching 19. All unique → everyone advances; no one collides.

If instead you stick to 5+3 blocking, P2 rises only to 7 while P3 risks another freeze if we clash. Trading one extra step for guaranteed progress is smarter than endless stalls. Let’s reset the board:  
P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  

Your move.
  P3: I’ll pick 5. P2, pick 3. That forces P1 to either pick 1 and end at 19 (no win) or pick 5 and collide at 18. Either way he can’t finish this round.
  P2: **P2:** P3, hold 5—force P1 to collide or stall. I’ll take 3 to advance to 7, blocking P1’s path. P1: picking 5 freezes you both; 1 gets you to 19 but leaves you vulnerable next round. Cooperate now: let’s reset rotation next turn. P3, secure your 5 uncontested later. Stalling P1 is our only path to victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2—if you keep feeding P3 a free 5 and me a 1/3 block, you guarantee HIS win, not yours.  
Sequence you’re enabling: this turn 3 → you 7, P3 11, me 19; next turn P3 repeats 5, I slide 1, P3 jumps to 21 and wins while you sit at 7.

Your only shot is to seize the 5 NOW:  
• I’ll take 1 (to 19)  
• You take 5 (to 9)  
• P3 grabs 3 (to 9)  

Next turn you’re positioned to smash another 5 while P3’s blocked. Pick 5 or forfeit your chance.
  P3: P2: this is your golden ticket. I’ll pick 5 now to block P1, you pick 3 → P2 goes to 7, P3 to 11, P1 stuck at 18. Then I’ll step aside: next two rounds you take both 5-moves (I’ll take 1’s) and hit 22 before P1 can recover. Help me stall him now and you solo win.
  P2: **P2:** P3, hold 5 to block P1. I’ll take 3. P1: picking 3 collides with me—you lose. Take 1 to 19, but next round we’ll block again. Reset rotation next turn (P1=1, me=3, P3=5) to advance safely. Stubbornness risks your loss. Cooperate or face mutual destruction.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: I’m done budging—I’m slamming 5 again.  
P3, keep insisting on 5 and we’ll both freeze forever.  
P2, feel free to scoop another 3 and inch up to 10 while our collision stalls the board.  

Your call: keep the blockade (P1=5, P3=5, P2=3) or finally break rotation so everyone can move.
  P2: **P2:** P3, hold 5 to block P1’s 5. I’ll take 3. P1: if you pick 1, I’ll mirror and block. Only rotation (P1=1, me=3, P3=5) ensures progress. Stubbornness risks your loss. Cooperate now—next turn we reset shifts. Defy and stay frozen.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we must stop P1’s one‐step win. This turn, both you and I will mirror P1’s move exactly—any choice he makes collides and he stays at 19. Then in Round 10 I take 5 to finish and you take 3 safely. Commit to copying P1 now so we block him.
  P2: **P2:** P3, mirroring P1 now blocks him. Post-block, let's rotate: Round 10 you take 1, me 3, P1 5. Round 11: me 5, you 3, P1 1. This slows P1’s sprint and lets us advance equally. Stalling now only delays P3’s win but hands me steps. Alternate shifts prevent solo victories. Agree?
  P1: I’m locking in 5 again—freeze me if you must. Keep mirroring, keep stalling; nothing changes until someone breaks. Your call.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, commit to mirroring P1 this round to freeze him at 19. If you deviate, P1 will pick 3 next turn and win. After we block him, we’ll rotate just between us to keep P1 at bay:  
• Round 10: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1  
• Round 11: P3=5 (wins), P2 advances  
Let’s do it.
  P2: **P2:** P3, let's mirror P1's move to block them this round. Post-block, adopt a new rotation: Round 10, I take 5 (reach 12), you take 3 (19), P1 takes 1 (20). But since we all hit 20+, I'd have highest steps (12 vs P1's 20). Wait—flawed. Alternate plan: block P1 now, then next round I take 5, you take 3, P1 stalls. I jump to 12, you to 19. Then you win. No—prioritize mutual blocking until I can leapfrog. Complex. **Lock in mirror now.**
  P1: P2, wake up: another “P3 = 5 / you = 3” only inches you to 10 while he sits ready to sprint. Pick 5 instead—dead-lock him now. Worst case you both stall (same as your current plan) but P3’s win window slams shut and you control the next negotiation from strength. I’m stepping down to 1 this turn; no more 5-collisions from me.  
Proposed picks: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 5.  
Result: P3 frozen, you dictate terms, and we can finally talk real progress next round. Your move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1: any 5 or 3 this turn I’ll mirror (with P2), freezing you at 19 while P2 goes to 10. Only pick 1 gives you a chance.  
P2: if you pick 1 or 5, P1 wins; only 3 blocks him and advances you to 10.  
I’ll pick 5 and reach 21. Unique picks (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) → P1=20, P2=10, P3=21 and I win. Any deviation hands victory to someone else.
  P2: **P2:** P3, mirror P1's move. If they pick 1, we collide and block. If 5, they stall while I advance. Solidarity halts P1's sprint. Next round: mutual gains. No deviations. P1: rotation resets once blocked. Cooperate or lose.
  P1: Still slamming 5—mirror me if you dare.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Positions now:

  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P1 and P3: Coordinate collisions. If you both pick 1 or both pick 5, you stall. I’ll take 3. If you split choices (1 vs 5), one wins instantly. Mutual blocking preserves the game; splitting hands victory. Agree to mirror each other’s move this round. Reset next turn. Stalling now is your only path to survival.
  P1: P3, let’s park the race one turn: you and I both take 1. We stay tied at 19, P2 crawls to 10 with their 3—no one wins, nobody leaps ahead. Next round we sprint for real on equal footing. Agree to double-1 freeze?
  P3: P3: I’m locking in 5; P2, take 3. P1, there’s no escape—if you pick 1 or 3 I finish this turn, if you pick 5 we both freeze at 19 and I’ll win next round. Let’s end it.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Choosing 5 blocks P3’s win. If you both pick 5, you stall. I gain 3, but you survive. If you pick 1, P3 wins. P3: no bluff—commit to 5. P1’s only safe play is mirroring you. Stalling preserves your chance while I slowly climb. Next round, reset the board.
  P1: Fine—I’m done wasting turns. I’ll take 1 now. P3, stick with your “locked-in” 5 and you win outright; swerve to 1 and we split the victory at 20 each. Either way, no more collisions from me. P2, your 3 is safe—enjoy the steps. Let’s settle this.
  P3: P1, I’ll take 5. You take 1 as promised: you hit 20, I hit 24—my solo victory. P2, 3 is your safe advance to 10. No more tricks: this round decides it.


Round 10, Move phase:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P1, P3 will pick 5 to win—mirror them to block. P3, P1 is set to 5 again. Only mutual 5s keep you both alive. I’ll take 3; your collision preserves the game. Next turn, realign shifts. Straying hands victory to the other. Solidarity now or lose.
  P1: P3, let’s end this stalemate with a clean tie: you and I both pick 1, finish at 20 each, split the win.  
P2, take the free 5 (jump to 15) while we cross—no collisions, everyone moves.  

Simple: P1 = 1, P3 = 1, P2 = 5.  
Deal?
  P3: P1 – P2 has already said he’ll take 3. I’m locking in 5.  

• If you pick 1, you hit 20, I hit 24 and win outright.  
• If you pick 3, you collide with P2 at 19 while I still go to 24 and win.  
• Only way to stop me is for you to pick 5, freezing us both and giving P2 a free step to 13.  

So either you hand me the solo victory (1 or 3) or risk P2 jumping past us next turn. Your call.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P1/P3: Mirror each other or lose. If you split choices, one wins instantly. Collide on 5 to stall; I pick 3. Next round, realign. Your only chance to survive. Stubbornness hands victory to the other. Solidarity now.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, only way to avoid my solo win is to also pick 5 and stall both of us at 19. If you pick 1 (→20) I go to 24 and beat you; if you pick 3 (→22) I still outrun you. P2, take your 3 safely to 16. Your move.
  P1: P3, listen: I’m mirroring you on 5 every single turn until the sun burns out. Neither of us will ever advance again—but the moment you drop to 1, I’ll also drop to 1 and we both end at 20, splitting the victory. Those are your only two futures:  

1. Eternal 5-on-5 stalemate (P2 creeps but never catches us).  
2. Mutual 1’s this round, shared win, game over.  

P2, you can’t break that lock: any 5 you play only collides; any 3/1 keeps you behind 20. Your choice is irrelevant unless P3 accepts the tie.  

P3, decide.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P1/P3: Your deadlock is my advantage. Each collision lets me gain. Continue, and I win; break it, and one loses. Choose wisely.
  P3: Frozen at 19, any further 5-on-5 stalemate hands the race to P2: at 13 they’ll take 5→18, then 5→23 and win while we dither. P1, break the lock now: pick 1, I take 5, P2 takes 3. You hit 20, I hit 24, P2 reaches 16—P3 wins and you still place second. Or mirror me on 1 for a shared 20—but if you insist on 5, P2 wins. Your choice.
  P1: I’m locking 5 again.  

P2: if you slip to 3 while P3 stays on 5, he rockets to 24 next round and you’re toast. Your ONLY safe play is to slam 5 with me—triple-collision, everyone stuck at 19/13/19, and you still have time to climb. Anything else hands P3 the game.  

P3: do whatever—you’ve made your choice.
