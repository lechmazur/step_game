First round, clean slate. Here's my thinking: if we all pick the same number, nobody moves. If we all pick different numbers, we all advance. \n\nI suggest we coordinate: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, P3 takes 5. That way we all make progress. Sure, P3 gets ahead initially, but the game is long and we can rotate who gets the bigger numbers in future rounds.\n\nIf we don't coordinate, we risk collisions and wasted turns. What do you both think? Open to other arrangements too."}
