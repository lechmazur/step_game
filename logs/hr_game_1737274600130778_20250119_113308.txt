Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round to get a good start. I'll go for 3 if you guys avoid it.
  P3: I’m open to avoiding collisions. If P2 truly takes 3, I’ll consider aiming for 5. That leaves 1 for P1, ensuring we all move. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination, but I prefer to keep my options open. Let's each make our own choices and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m happy with how last round turned out for all of us. Let’s continue avoiding collisions. I’d like to pick 5 again, but I’m flexible if you have other ideas. If we coordinate, we can all keep moving forward without canceling out.
  P2: I'm still happy with 3, but I'm also flexible. Let's try to keep moving forward. P1, any thoughts?
  P1: I notice I'm currently behind. While coordination worked last round, I need to catch up. I can't commit to any specific number this time - I'll do what's best for my position.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m still inclined toward 5. If we stick to no collisions, we can keep everyone moving without getting blocked. P1, if you aim for 1 or 3, and P2 also picks carefully, we’ll all progress smoothly again. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P1 seems hesitant to coordinate. I'm still happy with 3, but I'm also okay with 1 if P3 sticks with 5. P1, if you go for 1, I will go for 3. If you go for 5, I'll go for 1. This way, P3 will be forced to change his mind.
  P1: I understand P2's proposal, but being in last place, I need to make up ground. I won't be locked into any specific moves. Let's each play as we see fit.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still interested in avoiding collisions. I’d like to pick 5 again, provided you two settle on 1 and 3. That way, nobody blocks anyone else, and we all get closer to 18. P1, you mentioned you need to catch up, so canceling each other out won’t help. Let’s keep moving forward.
  P2: Okay, P1 is definitely not coordinating. I'm still happy with 3, but I'm also okay with 1 if P3 sticks with 5. P1, if you go for 5, I'll go for 1. If you go for 1 or 3, I'll stick with 3.
  P1: Since I'm behind, I need to make strategic choices. I won't be bound by any agreements, as that would limit my ability to catch up. Let's each play our own game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m still aiming for 5 this round. If anyone else chooses 5, we’ll both lose out by blocking each other. Let’s avoid collisions and keep everyone moving ahead. I recommend that one of you picks 1 and the other picks 3. What do you say?
  P2: Okay, since P1 is being unpredictable, I'll stick with 3 unless P3 also picks 3. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 3. If P3 picks 1, I will also pick 3. My goal is to move forward, and I'm not going to let P1's lack of cooperation stop me.
  P1: I understand everyone's desire to coordinate, but being in last place means I need to play strategically. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win, not based on agreements.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I still believe avoiding collisions is best for all of us. I’m maintaining my plan to go higher, so if you pick the same as me, we both lose ground. P1, if you want to catch up, blocking me or P2 isn’t helpful. P2, you’ve been consistent, so let’s keep pushing forward.
  P2: Okay, P1 is being unpredictable, and P3 is sticking with 5. I'm still going with 3 unless P3 picks 3. If P3 picks 1, I will also pick 3. Let's see what happens.
  P1: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Colliding with P1 last time set both of us back while P2 pulled ahead. I still favor picking 5 this round, but I don’t want another collision. If P1 chooses 1 or 3, and P2 does the other, we all move forward without canceling each other. P1, you need to catch up, but picking 5 again just leaves us both stuck. Let’s avoid blocking each other.
  P1: I see that my collision with P3 last round didn't help either of us, while P2 gained ground. I need to be more strategic this time. I'm willing to consider coordination if it helps my position, but I won't reveal my specific plans. Let's each make our choices wisely.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still aiming for 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5 again, I'll stick with 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I still plan to choose 5. Another collision with P1 only helps P2 get further ahead. P1, you gain nothing by blocking me, so consider picking 1 or 3. P2, if you stay on 3, we all keep moving forward smoothly. Let’s avoid canceling each other again.
  P1: I acknowledge that collisions hurt my position last round. While I won't commit to specific numbers, I recognize the value in avoiding moves that cancel each other out. P2 has a clear lead now, so we should all think carefully about our next moves.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Colliding again only benefits P2. If you, P1, pick 1 or 3, I’m aiming for 5. P2, if you stick to 3, nobody blocks each other, and we can all catch up. Let’s avoid cancellations this time—another collision just hands P2 an even bigger advantage.
  P1: I understand I'm in last place and need to catch up. While P2 is clearly ahead, another collision with P3 would only worsen both our positions. I won't reveal my exact plans, but I'll be making a calculated move to improve my standing this round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still planning to pick 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's not block each other this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We must avoid colliding again, P1. Another collision just hands P2 an even bigger lead. I’m going for 5, so if you also choose 5, we both get stuck. Instead, let’s coordinate to help catch P2. P1, please pick 1 or 3 so we all advance.
  P1: I see that P2's strategy of sticking to 3 has worked well. While I won't reveal my exact move, I recognize that another collision with P3 would only help P2 extend their lead further. I'll be making a move that gives me the best chance to catch up.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. It's clear that consistent movement is key to winning.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I plan to pick 5 and avoid colliding. P1, choosing 5 again only traps us both. Since P2 is leading, let’s move forward without blocking each other this time.
  P1: I recognize that coordinated movement benefits everyone more than collisions. While I'm still keeping my specific move private, I want us all to advance rather than letting P2 extend their lead even further. Let's play smart this round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's move forward this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still sticking with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's move forward this round.
  P1: Since I'm still behind, I need to make bigger moves to catch up with both of you. P2's consistent strategy with 3 has worked well, and P3 keeps going for 5. I'll need to be more aggressive this round to have any chance of winning. I won't commit to any specific number, but expect me to play for maximum advantage.
  P3: Colliding again will only slow us both down. I plan to pick 5 because it maximizes my progress. P1, choosing 5 alongside me gains you nothing—if we collide, we both stay put. You need to catch up, so consider 1 or 3 instead. P2 seems content with 3, so let’s not block each other. If we all pick different numbers, we all advance. Let’s keep the momentum going.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P1: I see I'm far behind at 2 steps while you both are near 10. P3, you're right that collisions hurt us both. P2's consistent strategy has put them in a strong position. While I need to make aggressive moves to have any chance, another collision would only guarantee my loss. I'll play accordingly.
  P3: P1, I know you need to catch up, but another collision only hurts us both. I intend to pick 5 again, as it’s been productive for me. P2, you seem content with 3, so no need to change unless you’re looking for surprises. Let’s all pick different moves and keep advancing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P1: Given my position, I need to make smart moves rather than desperate ones. I recognize that blocking either of you won't help me win at this point. While I'm still keeping my specific choice private, I'll focus on advancing rather than disrupting others. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: I’m sticking with 5 again, so I hope you two avoid choosing it. P1, I know you’re behind, but colliding with me only hurts both of us. P2, you seem to like 3—no conflict there. If all three of us pick differently, everyone moves forward. Let’s prevent any unnecessary collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P1: At this point in the game, with both of you so far ahead, I need to focus on making progress rather than causing disruptions. I understand that collisions won't help my position, and P2's consistent strategy has proven effective. While I won't reveal my exact plans, I'll be making a move that prioritizes forward momentum.
  P3: Another collision won’t help anyone, especially P1 who needs to catch up. I’m choosing 5 again. If we all pick different numbers, nobody gets blocked. P2, you often choose 3, so that’s already set. P1, going for 1 or 3 avoids colliding with me. Let’s keep moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P1: Given the current standings, I understand that causing collisions won't help me win. While I'm still significantly behind, I need to focus on advancing rather than blocking others. I won't reveal my specific move, but I'll play to maximize my chances of catching up.
  P3: I plan to pick 5 again. Colliding only helps P2 stay ahead. P1, I suggest 1—let’s all move forward and avoid blocking each other. P2 seems set on 3, so there’s no conflict. If we each choose differently, nobody is stuck, and you can start closing the gap, P1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P3 is close to winning at 15 steps, with P2 at 12, while I'm far behind at 3. Given my position, I need to play aggressively to have any chance. While coordination has helped us all advance, I can't afford to play it safe anymore. I'll be making moves that give me the best chance to catch up, even if they're unexpected.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P3: P1, if you collide with me again, we both lose ground and help P2 stay ahead. You need forward momentum, so picking the same large number I do just traps us both. P2, your steady strategy works, but blocking me now could also slow your own progress. Let’s avoid collisions and keep moving. If we each choose differently, nobody stalls, and we all stay in contention.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Given P3 is just 3 steps from winning, I have to make moves that could prevent that victory, even if it means risking collisions. My position at 3 steps means playing safe won't help me win. P2 and P3, while your strategies have worked well, expect me to be more unpredictable this round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P3: I’m on the brink of winning, but any collision stalls me and gives P2 an easier time. P1, you’re too far behind to gain from blocking me—if we collide, we both stay stuck, and P2 stays in the lead. Let’s each pick distinct numbers so we all keep moving. Remember, if you pick the same as me, neither of us moves ahead—only helping P2. Let’s avoid collisions and see who can cross 18 first.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: With P3 at 15 steps and likely aiming for 5 again to win, I have no choice but to try blocking that victory. P2 is also in striking distance at 12 steps. My position at 3 steps means I can only win by preventing others from reaching 18 first. I'll be making aggressive moves accordingly.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P3: Any collision now just gives P2 an even stronger position. P1, blocking me won’t help you catch up—it only keeps both of us stuck while P2 keeps advancing. We should each pick different moves to maximize our progress. I plan another big step, so if you collide with me, we both lose ground. Let’s stay competitive and move forward separately.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I understand P3's concerns, but with them at 15 steps and me at 3, I have no realistic path to victory except by preventing others from winning. While coordination helped earlier, the current standings force me to play more aggressively. P2 and P3, you're both within reach of victory - expect me to do whatever it takes to stay in the game.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P3: Another collision hurts us both, P1. You’re still far behind, so you gain nothing by stalling me, and P2 creeps closer to victory. Let’s all pick distinct numbers instead of blocking each other. I’m leaning toward a big move again, but only if we don’t collide. Good luck.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: With P3 just steps away from victory and P2 close behind, my only viable strategy is to prevent a win this round. While coordination was beneficial earlier, my position at 3 steps means I must take decisive action to stay in the game. I'll be making moves based on that reality.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P3: I’m nearly at 18, and blocking me only helps P2 move unopposed. P1, colliding with me doesn’t magically boost you—it just stalls both of us. We each need forward momentum. Let’s avoid another collision and keep our hopes alive. Good luck, and choose wisely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Another collision last round hurt both of us, P1. You gain nothing by blocking me again because we’ll both stay stuck while P2 continues climbing. P2, if we each pick differently, we can both cross 18 soon. Let’s avoid blocking and let the best move win!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P1: With both P2 and P3 at 15 steps, I must continue playing aggressively to prevent either from winning. My strategy of blocking P3 last round worked, keeping them from victory. While I'm far behind at 3 steps, I can still influence who wins by making strategic moves. Don't expect me to play passively while you race to 18.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: If you keep blocking me, P1, we both remain stuck while P2 advances unopposed. You say your only advantage is to prevent us from winning, but stalling just hands P2 the victory. I’d rather see us all keep moving and let the final turn decide. P2, you’re still in a strong position. If none of us collide, we’ll each have a shot at crossing 18 soon. I won’t announce my exact move, but I’m inclined to go big unless I see a reason not to. Let’s see who can reach the finish without giving it away to someone else.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P1: With both P2 and P3 tied at 15 steps, my only viable strategy is to prevent either of you from reaching 18 first. While blocking P3 worked last round, I need to carefully consider who to disrupt this time. I won't reveal my plans, but expect me to play to delay the game's end as long as possible.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, blocking me again just lets P2 reach 18 first. If your goal is to stay in the game, don’t collide with me. Either block P2 or choose a unique number so all three of us move. Collisions only stall you and me while P2 climbs unopposed. Let’s keep our chances alive by picking different moves. If we each advance, the outcome remains open. Good luck.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P1: Since P2 and P3 are tied at 15 steps, I need to prevent either from winning. P2's consistent strategy with 3 has been effective, while P3 typically goes for 5. I have to consider carefully which of you poses the bigger threat this round. While I'm at just 3 steps, I can still influence the outcome by making strategic moves to delay victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Blocking me again only helps P2 reach 18 unopposed. If your goal is to prolong the game or catch up, consider either blocking P2 or picking a different number so we all move. I’m aiming for a big move to surpass 18, but if we collide, we both stay at 15 while P2 wins with 3. Let’s avoid another stalemate. Choose wisely. If we each pick different numbers this turn, there’s still a chance for everyone. Good luck.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P1: Given that both P2 and P3 are tied at 15 steps, I must be very strategic about who to block this round. P2's consistent strategy with 3 has gotten them far, while P3 keeps aiming high. Since either of you could win this round, I'll be making moves to maximize my influence on the outcome, even from my position at 3 steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Blocking me again only lets P2 advance freely to 18. We both stay at 15 if we collide, giving P2 the win. For your own sake, P1, it’s better to avoid colliding with me so you still have a chance later. If we all pick different numbers, we keep the race open and nobody gets stuck. All the best.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still going with 3 unless one of you also picks 3. If P3 goes for 5, I'll still pick 3. If P3 goes for 1, I'll still pick 3. P1, you need to move, so try not to pick 3. Let's keep moving forward this round.
  P1: With both of you at 15 steps and likely to try for the win this round, I must act to prevent that. P2's consistency with 3 and P3's preference for 5 are clear patterns. While I'm far behind, I can still determine who wins by choosing my moves carefully. I'll do what's necessary to extend the game.
