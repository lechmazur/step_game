Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s keep the momentum going! To avoid collisions again, I’ll take 3 this round. P1, P3, can you confirm your choices? P1, maybe you take 5, and P3, you take 1? This way, we all advance smoothly and stay on track. Trust and consistency are key—let’s stick to our agreements.
  P3: Okay P2, your plan is good for avoiding collision. But I am still far behind. How about this round I choose 5, you choose 3, and P1 chooses 1? This way we all still move and I can catch up a little. What do you think?

Round 2, Conversation subround 2:

This keeps us all advancing safely. We can reassess next round to help you catch up. Trust the plan—consistency is key to avoiding collisions and winning the game. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: P2, I understand your point about consistency, but as I am currently last, choosing 5 this round is important for me to catch up. P1 has already agreed to my suggestion. Since we all want to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses, could you please agree to P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 for this round? It's just for this round to balance things out a bit.
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about consistency, but helping P3 catch up this round reduces future collision risks. Let's confirm clearly now: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance safely. Agreed?
