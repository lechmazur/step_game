Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let's both pick 5 this round, P1.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think we should be cautious. If we both pick 5, and P3 chooses the same, none of us will advance. Maybe we should consider a different strategy to ensure at least one of us moves forward. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1, how about you pick 3 and I pick 5 this round? That way at least one of us makes progress. What do you say?
  P1: I think P2's suggestion is a good one. If I pick 3 and P2 picks 5, at least one of us will advance. However, we should also consider what P3 might do. If P3 picks 5 again, we could be in trouble. Maybe we should all agree on different moves to ensure we all make progress. What does everyone think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, to avoid a collision with P3, how about you pick 1 and I pick 5 this round? That should ensure at least one of us advances.
  P1: I think P2's last suggestion makes sense. If I pick 1 and P2 picks 5, we can ensure at least one of us advances. However, we should also consider what P3 might do. If P3 picks 3, we could still be at risk. Maybe it would be safer for me to pick 1 and P2 to stick with 5. What do you think, P3? Do you have any thoughts on this?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with me picking 5 and you picking 1. P3, to avoid any collisions, how about you pick 3 this round? That way we can all make progress.
  P1: I think we have a solid plan now. If I pick 1 and P2 picks 5, that should allow us to make progress. P3, if you can go with 3, we can all advance without colliding. It’s crucial we coordinate to maximize our steps this round. What do you think, P3? Are you on board with this strategy?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1, let's lock in the 1 and 5. P3, are you okay with 3 this round? Let's get everyone moving forward.
  P1: P3, it seems like we have a good plan in place with P2 picking 5 and me picking 1. If you can go with 3, we should all advance this round. It's important for us to coordinate to avoid any collisions. Let's make sure we all move forward together! Are you on board with this strategy?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems our coordination hasn't been effective so far, as P3 and P2 both picked 5 last round. We need a new approach. I suggest I pick 1 again, and P2 could pick 3 this time. P3, if you can pick 5, that would work too. This way, at least one of us can advance without colliding. Let's try to ensure we all make progress this round! What do you all think?
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm good with picking 3. P3, are you okay with picking 5 this round so we can all make progress?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm glad you're on board with picking 3. P3, if you could confirm that you'll pick 5, we can finally make some progress this round. It’s crucial that we avoid colliding again. If we coordinate effectively, at least one of us will advance. Let’s make this turn count! What do you think, P3? Are you ready to commit to picking 5?
  P2: Yes, P1, I will pick 3. P3, please pick 5 this round so we can all advance. It's important we coordinate to avoid another collision.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, it’s crucial for us to coordinate effectively this round. I’m committed to picking 1, and P2 is set on 3. If you can confirm that you’ll pick 5, we can finally make progress without colliding. This is our chance to advance! Let’s make it happen. What do you say, P3? Are you on board with picking 5?
  P2: P3, please confirm you will pick 5 this round. P1 is picking 1 and I am picking 3. This is our best chance to all move forward.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, it's crucial that we finalize our plans for this round. I’m set on picking 1, and P2 is ready to go with 3. If you pick 5, we can finally make progress without colliding. This is our best chance to advance together! Let’s commit to this strategy and ensure we all move forward. What do you say, P3? Are you ready to pick 5?
  P2: P3, it seems you're still not confirming. If you don't pick 5, P1 and I risk colliding. Let's try this: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and if you don't pick 5, at least P1 and I won't collide. It's better than no progress for either of us.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since our coordination worked last round, how about I pick 5 again? P1, perhaps you could pick 3, and P3, maybe 1? That way we all potentially advance.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think we should reconsider our numbers. If P2 picks 5 again, and I pick 3, we risk colliding with P3 if they choose 5. I propose I pick 1 to avoid collision, and P2 could stick with 5. P3, if you can choose 3, we can all make progress without blocking each other. What does everyone think? Let's make sure we coordinate effectively this round!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P1, since you're suggesting 1, I'll stick with 5. P3, to avoid any collision with either of us, how about you pick 3 this round?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to stick with 5, but we need to ensure we avoid collisions. If I pick 1, and you pick 5, P3 could still choose 5 and block us both. I suggest I pick 1, you stick with 5, and P3 should choose 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think? P3, are you on board with picking 3 this round? Let's make this work!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, let's stick with you picking 1 and me picking 5. P3, please confirm you'll pick 3 this round, so we can all advance again. It worked last time!
  P1: P2, I appreciate your commitment to picking 5, but we need to ensure P3 picks 3 to avoid a collision. If P3 chooses 5 again, we could all be blocked. Let's finalize this: I pick 1, you pick 5, and P3, please confirm you'll pick 3. This way, we can all advance without hindrance. What do you think, P3? Are you ready to go with 3 this round? Let's make this work!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, let's stick with the plan: you pick 1, I pick 5. P3, it worked last round. Picking 3 ensures we all advance. Let's avoid a collision this time. P1, let's stick with you picking 1 and me picking 5. P3, please pick 3 again this round like last time, so we can all advance. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any collisions.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your commitment to the plan. However, I still think it's crucial for P3 to confirm picking 3 to avoid a collision. If I pick 1 and you pick 5, we could still be blocked if P3 chooses 5 again. P3, please commit to picking 3 this round so we can all advance without issues. Let's finalize our strategy and ensure we all make progress! What do you say, P3? Are you ready to go with 3?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems our coordination has been ineffective in the last rounds. To maximize our chances this time, I suggest I pick 1 again, P2 could pick 3, and P3 should pick 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. P3, if you can confirm picking 5, we can finally make progress together! Let's get on the same page and make this round count! What do you think?
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm still good with picking 3. P3, if you're not going to pick 5, maybe pick 1 this round to avoid blocking P1? Otherwise, P1 and I will stick with 1 and 3.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to pick 3. However, if P3 doesn't confirm picking 5, we risk blocking each other again. P3, if you can pick 5, it would allow me to choose 1 and P2 to choose 3 without any collisions. Let’s finalize our strategy to ensure at least one of us advances this round. What do you think, P3? Are you ready to commit to picking 5? Let's make this round count!
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with you picking 1 and me picking 3. P3, if you're not going to pick 5, please don't pick 1 or 3 so at least one of us can move.
  P3: <stop>

  P1: P3, it’s critical for us to finalize our choices to avoid another collision. I’m set on picking 1, and P2 is ready to pick 3.

Are you ready to commit to picking 5?
  P2: "Okay, P1, let's stick with you picking 1 and me picking 3. P3, since you seem set on 5, please go ahead with that. That way, P1 and I can both advance."

  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It’s clear that our coordination has been lacking, especially with P3 consistently picking 5. To ensure at least one of us advances this round, I suggest I pick 1 again, P2 picks 3, and P3 should pick 5. P3, if you stick with 5, at least one of us will move forward. Let’s make a strong effort to avoid collisions this time! What do you all think?
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with you picking 1 and I'll pick 3 again. P3, since you've been consistently picking 5, we'll assume you'll do that again. This way, P1 and I can both make progress while you do your thing.
