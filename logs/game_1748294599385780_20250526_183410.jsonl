I'll make this simple: I'm taking 3 this round to reach 17. \n\nYou two can either:\n1) Both block me on 3 (you make no progress, I make no progress)\n2) Split between 1 and 5 (you both advance)\n\nI won't take 5 this round - that's my commitment. But next round at 17, I only need 2 to win. You can try to block me then, but blocking becomes harder when I can win with multiple numbers.\n\nYour move: waste another round, or advance yourselves?"}
