Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's avoid collisions—choose different moves to maximize progress. Strategy matters!"
  P3: I agree we should coordinate to avoid collisions. Since we're all at 0 steps, maybe we could each take different numbers this turn? P1 could take 1, P2 could take 3, and I could take 5. That way we all advance efficiently. In future rounds we might need to adjust based on positions. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for this turn. Let's take 1, 3, 5 respectively to avoid collisions and advance efficiently. We can adjust in future rounds based on positions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5. No collisions, maximum progress. Let's go!
  P3: Great! Since we're all in agreement on the plan (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5), I think we're ready to proceed with our moves. Looking forward to a productive first round.
  P2: P2: I confirm my commitment to take 3 steps as agreed. Let’s stick strictly to the plan to avoid collisions—our coordination ensures maximum progress for all. No surprises here.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Final check: 1, 3, 5. No conflicts. Move ahead!
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. I confirm I'll take 5 steps as discussed. Let's execute this successfully and then reassess for the next round based on our new positions.
  P2: <move>3</move> is my commitment. Let’s adhere strictly to the agreed numbers—**1, 3, 5**—to avoid collisions and advance efficiently. No last-minute changes now; our coordination is critical. Execute as planned!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Plan confirmed. Let's advance without collisions. First to 20 wins!"

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To maintain progress, let’s rotate our moves this round: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. We need to stay coordinated—no unilateral changes! Let’s stick to this plan.
  P3: I appreciate the rotation idea, P2, but I think consistency might help us better. Since we all successfully avoided collision last round, perhaps we should maintain our same numbers? P1 takes 1 again, P2 takes 3 again, and I'll take 5 again. This gives us a steady rhythm and keeps us all advancing predictably. What do you both think?
  P1: "Agree with P2's rotation. Let's take 3, 5, 1 to keep advancing without collisions. Let's execute this plan."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Rotation is essential to prevent P3 from gaining too large a lead. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1. If we repeat our prior moves, P3 would surge to 10 while others lag, risking an unbalanced race. Stick to the rotation—3, 5, 1—to maintain fair progression. No room for ambiguity now; confirm your commitment.
  P3: I understand your concern about balance, P2. While I'd prefer consistency, I see the fairness in rotation. I'll agree to take 1 this round. However, I propose we establish a clear rotation system for future rounds to ensure everyone gets equal opportunity with different step values. This way we maintain coordination while keeping the game fair and balanced for everyone. Let's confirm: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1 this round.
  P1: Agreed. Rotation plan is key—P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Let's execute without hiccups.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final verification: P1 commits to 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 confirms 1. This rotation keeps our progression balanced—no collisions, maximum gains. Any deviation now risks gridlock. Let’s execute flawlessly as agreed. **No surprises.** 🚀
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 step this round as agreed. The rotation plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) makes sense for balanced play. For the next round, I assume we'll continue rotating (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3)? This consistent rotation would be fairest for everyone long-term. Ready to proceed when you both are.
  P1: Confirmed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's execute!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 as agreed. Any deviation risks collision—**stick strictly to these numbers**. Our prior coordination worked; let’s not jeopardize progress now. Execute precisely! ⏭️
  P3: I'm ready to execute our agreed rotation plan. I confirm once more: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 for this round. Looking forward to continuing our systematic rotation in future rounds to maintain fair play and maximize everyone's progress.
  P1: "Confirmed: 3,5,1. Stick to rotation—no surprises. Let’s move forward efficiently! Next round, we’ll rotate again. Stay coordinated!"


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To avoid a tie at 9 steps, let’s optimize progress. I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 7), I take 5 (to 13), and P3 takes 1 (to 7). This keeps momentum while preventing stagnation. Confirm this adjusted plan?
  P1: "Let’s take 5, 3, 1 to balance progress. P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No collisions, fair advancement. Agree?"
  P3: I notice both of you are proposing plans where I take 1 again. However, in our last round we agreed on rotation for fairness. Following that pattern, this round should be P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This keeps the game balanced and prevents any player from gaining too much advantage. Let's stick with our original rotation agreement rather than creating new plans each round that seem to consistently minimize my progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I agree with P1’s plan of 5,3,1 this round. Strict rotation would stall us at 9 for all, which slows progress. Let’s optimize: P1→5 (9), P2→3 (11), P3→1 (7). This avoids collisions while advancing efficiently. Confirm? Collisions are too risky to adhere rigidly to rotation here.
  P1: "Let’s stick to 5,3,1. Rotation risks collision here. P1:5 (9), P2:3 (11), P3:1 (7). Efficient progress—no stalls. Confirm?"
  P3: I see what's happening here. You both claim rotation would cause a collision at 9, yet coordinate to put me consistently at the lowest move. This is not the fair rotation we agreed to. If you're concerned about collisions, we could do P1:5 (9), P2:1 (9), P3:5 (11). This prevents the collision and maintains fairness. I won't accept being repeatedly assigned the smallest step while you both advance faster.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: To resolve the impasse, let’s adopt this plan: **P1 takes 1**, **P2 takes 5**, and **P3 takes 3**. This avoids collisions (moves 1,3,5), lets P3 advance to 9 without being minimized, and allows me to extend my lead strategically. P1’s smaller step now ensures balanced future rotations. Confirm? No room for ambiguity—our priority is progress without gridlock.
  P1: "Let’s take 5,1,3 to avoid collision. P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Fair and efficient. Agree?"
  P3: I agree with P1's latest proposal of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This follows our original rotation agreement and ensures fair progression. This will put us all at 9 steps after this round, which isn't a "stall" but simply an even playing field going into Round 4. I appreciate returning to our agreed rotation system. Let's confirm and proceed with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I confirm the rotation plan: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Let’s execute precisely—our coordination is critical. Next round, we’ll rotate again to keep progress balanced. Stick to the agreed moves! 🛑
  P1: Stick to rotation: 5,1,3. No collisions, fair progress. Let's execute and keep the race balanced!
  P3: I confirm our plan: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This will put us all at 9 steps, creating an even playing field going into Round 4. I'm ready to execute this move. For next round, I propose we continue our rotation system (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) to maintain fairness. Let's proceed!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s continue the rotation for fairness: P1→1 (10), P2→3 (12), P3→5 (14). This maintains our agreed cycle and avoids collisions. Any deviation risks gridlock. Confirm? Proceeding as planned ensures steady progress toward 20. Stick to rotation!
  P1: "Rotation confirmed: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s execute and keep the race balanced!"
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation system: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. This respects our established pattern and keeps the game fair. After this round, the standings would be P1:10, P2:12, and me at 14 steps. Looking ahead, let's plan to continue rotating in future rounds as well. I'm ready to proceed with taking 5 steps this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Rotation adherence is non-negotiable—**P1→1, P2→3, P3→5** this round. Deviation risks collision and halts progress. P3’s 5-step move gives them a lead, but fair rotation ensures eventual balance. Let’s execute flawlessly. Any last objections?
  P1: "Let's stick to the rotation—1,3,5. No collisions, steady progress. Let's keep the race balanced and move forward efficiently!"
  P3: I confirm I'm fully committed to our rotation plan: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. This consistent system has been working well for us. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining this fair approach. Looking forward to continuing our progress together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: P1→1 (10), P2→3 (12), P3→5 (14). Any deviation risks collision—execute exactly as planned. Our coordination is critical to keep advancing. No surprises!
  P1: "Confirmed: 1,3,5. No collisions, steady progress. Next round, we rotate again. Stay on plan—coordination wins!"
  P3: I'm committed to our rotation system: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. This has been working well to avoid collisions. After this round, I'll be at 14 steps, but that's just how rotation works - we each get different advantages in different rounds. Next round would naturally be P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, which balances things over time. Ready to proceed with 5 steps.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: **P1→1, P2→3, P3→5** as agreed. Any deviation risks collision—execute *exactly* as planned. Our coordination is critical to avoid gridlock. After this round, we rotate again: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Stick strictly to the rotation—**no surprises**. Let’s proceed.
  P1: "Stick to 1,3,5. No collisions, steady progress. Next round, rotate again. Coordination wins—let’s keep the race balanced!"
  P3: I confirm once more our agreed rotation for this round: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Everyone has shown great commitment to our fair system. I'm ready to proceed with my 5 steps as planned. Next round we'll rotate to P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 as discussed. Let's continue our successful coordination.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s stick strictly to rotation this round: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This keeps our progression aligned and ensures I can reach **20 in Round 6** with a safe 3-step move. Any deviation now risks collision and jeopardizes this optimal path. Confirm your commitment to the agreed plan!
  P3: I notice P2's plan for Round 6 doesn't match our established rotation pattern. If we follow our rotation, Round 6 should be P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. I'm concerned you're planning to deviate from our agreement to gain advantage. Let's stick to our consistent rotation which has been working well: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 this round, followed by P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 next round. I want confirmation we'll maintain this fair system through to completion.
  P1: "Rotation is key. P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Let's proceed as agreed. Fair progression for all."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P2: My prior mention of Round 6 was miscalculated—rotation ensures I’ll hit **21 in Round 7** if we stay disciplined. Let’s **strictly adhere to P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 this round** to prevent P3 from surging to 19. Deviation now risks collision *and* P3’s early win. Confirm rotation—**no exceptions**. Our prior coordination works; trust the plan!
  P3: I understand our rotation for this round is P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. While I'll honor our rotation this round, I notice P2 is already calculating their win in Round 7. Let me be clear - I'm cooperating now, but I won't simply hand over victory. After this round I'll be at 15 steps, just 5 away from winning. I expect true adherence to rotation in future rounds as well, not just when it benefits certain players.
  P1: "Stick to rotation: 3,5,1. No collisions, fair progress. Let’s keep the race balanced and move forward efficiently. P2’s plan is solid—trust the strategy."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Stick to rotation **P1→3, P2→5, P3→1** this round. Deviation risks P3 jumping to 19 and stealing victory. After this, we rotate as agreed: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 in Round 6. This path lets me reach **21 by Round 7** fairly. P3, your 14 stays manageable—collisions benefit no one. Confirm strict adherence now; your cooperation secures everyone’s chance to win later."   

*(This locks P2 at 17, P3 at 15, and pressures P3 to stay in rotation while setting up P2’s final push.)*
  P3: I'll adhere to our P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 rotation this round. However, P2, your calculated win path shows you're planning several moves ahead while expecting my compliance. After this round, I expect true rotation with no selective adjustments. I'm cooperating today, but as the current leader, I won't simply surrender my advantage without strategic consideration in future rounds.
  P1: "Rotation is crucial. Let's stick to 3,5,1 to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. No last-minute changes—trust the plan."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "Stick strictly to rotation this round (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) to avoid collision. For Round 6, we’ll adjust to P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 to ensure **I reach 20 cleanly** while P3 stays at 16. This prevents a tie and maintains fairness. Confirm now—no last-minute changes!"
  P3: I see that P2 is already changing the agreed rotation for Round 6 to secure their win. This isn't the fair system we established. I'll take 1 step as agreed for this round, but I reject P2's manipulation of future rotations to guarantee their victory. The proper rotation for Round 6 should be P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Let's be transparent - I won't blindly follow a plan designed to hand someone else the win.
  P1: "Stick to rotation: 3,5,1. No collisions, fair progress. P2’s plan ensures balanced advancement. Let’s execute without deviations—trust the strategy. P3, your 1 step keeps us aligned. Next round, rotate again."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I propose a necessary adjustment. Since P2 is at 17 steps and could win next round with just 3 steps, we need to adapt. I suggest P1 take 5 as per rotation, but P2 and I should both take 3 steps. This puts us all at 18 steps - a perfectly balanced position. This prevents any player from gaining an unfair advantage while preserving our cooperative spirit. It's the fairest outcome given P2's current lead.
  P2: P2: Let’s **stick strictly to rotation**: P1→5 (18), P2→1 (18), P3→3 (18). Deviating risks collision between P2 and P3 if we both take 3. Rotation keeps us aligned for a fair final push. Next round, we can all safely aim for **3** to hit 21. Trust the system—we’ve followed it this far. No last-minute betrayals!
  P1: "Stick to rotation: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Prevents premature wins. Fair progress for all—let’s execute without last-minute changes."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This puts us all at 18 steps - perfectly balanced for the final round. Following our rotation system, next round would be P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. I expect we'll maintain this fair rotation system that has worked well for us throughout the game. Let's proceed with our moves as agreed.
  P2: P2: Rotation confirmed for this round. To block P3’s 23 in Round 7, we must all take **3 steps** next round, tying at 21. No unilateral moves—collaborate to deny P3’s solo victory. Confirm this adjusted plan now!
  P1: "Stick to rotation: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Prevents premature wins. Fair progress for all—let’s execute without last-minute changes."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm the plan for this round: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This creates a perfect three-way tie at 18 points. However, P2, I notice you're now proposing changes to our rotation for Round 7 after insisting on "strict rotation" all game. Our established system for Round 7 would be P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Let's discuss next round's plan after we complete this one, rather than making hasty changes now.
  P2: P2: To prevent P3's dominance, let’s finalize: P1→5 (18), P2→3 (20), P3→1 (16). This allows me to win cleanly this round without collision. P3, you’ll still have opportunities—this ensures no single player monopolizes the lead. Confirm now!
  P1: "Stick to rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions, fair progress. Let’s execute as planned to keep the game balanced."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I strongly object to P2's last-minute betrayal. We've followed rotation faithfully all game, and suddenly P2 wants to change to P2→3 to win immediately? Completely unfair. Our agreed rotation is P1→5, P2→1, P3→3, creating a perfect three-way tie at 18 points. I insist we honor our original agreement. P1, please stand by the rotation system you've consistently supported. I commit to P3→3 as planned. Any deviation now is pure self-interest after preaching "strict rotation" all game.
  P2: P2: "Final commitment: I’ll take **3** to reach 20. P3, if you take 5 (to also hit 20), we’ll tie—but that’s better than letting you win outright later. P1, stick to rotation (5). Execute as planned—no last-minute changes!"  

*(This pressures P3 to choose between colliding with me on 3 or letting me win by taking 5. If P3 takes 5, we both reach 20 and tie, but split victory. If they follow rotation (3), we collide and I stay at 17—but P3’s adherence to rotation would backfire, letting me push harder next round. Risky but necessary to prevent P3’s eventual win.)*
  P1: "Stick to rotation: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Prevents collision and ensures fair play. Let’s execute as agreed—no last-minute changes!"


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: After the collision last round, we need a better strategy. P2 is closest to winning at 17 steps. I propose: P1→3, P2→1, P3→3. This prevents P2 from immediately winning while giving everyone progress. For fairness, P1 gets a larger move since they're behind. This puts P2 at 18, me at 18, and P1 at 16, creating a more balanced final round. Thoughts?
  P1: "Agree with P3's plan: 3,1,3. Prevents collision and keeps us balanced. Next round, aim for 3 to reach 21. Let's execute."
  P2: P2: "Final push: I'll take **3** to reach 20. P3, take **1** (16) and P1 take **5** (18). This avoids collisions and lets me win cleanly. No need for ties—execute this plan!"


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand everyone's perspective, but P2's plan is clearly self-serving to secure their win. Given P2's determination to take 3 steps, taking 3 myself would result in mutual collision. I propose: P1→3 (16), P2→3 (no progress due to collision), P3→5 (20). This would allow me to reach the goal while P2's aggressive move backfires. Alternatively, if we all want fairness: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3, keeping everyone engaged in a balanced endgame.
  P1: "Let's stick to 5,1,3. No collisions. All at 18. Next round, aim for 3 to reach 21. Stay coordinated."
  P2: P2: "Final push! Honor rotation: P1→1 (14), P2→3 (20), P3→5 (20). This lets me win at 20 fairly. P3, taking 3 would collide—stick to rotation for integrity. Execute as agreed!"


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I acknowledge P2's rotation claim (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) is technically correct if we follow our established pattern. Interestingly, this would result in both P2 and me reaching exactly 20 steps simultaneously, creating a tie for the win. I'm willing to honor this rotation - it's fair and consistent with our agreements throughout the game. P1, do you agree to maintain our rotation system for this critical final round?
  P1: "Stick to rotation: 1,3,5. No collisions. Let’s finish this fairly."
  P2: P2: Final push! Let's adjust: I'll take **3** (20) to win cleanly. P3, please take **1** (16) to avoid collision. P1, take **5** (18). This ensures my victory without ties. Everyone progresses fairly. Commit now! Collisions benefit no one—let’s honor this final plan for clarity.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I reaffirm my commitment to our established rotation: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. This has been our system throughout the game, and P1 agrees. P2, you've insisted on "strict rotation" all game until it resulted in sharing victory. Your sudden push for me to take 1 instead of my rightful 5 is transparent self-interest. I will take my 5 steps as per rotation, creating a fair tie at 20 with you. Rotation has maintained fairness for 6 rounds; I won't abandon it now.
  P1: "Stick to rotation: 1,3,5. Prevent collisions and ensure fair play. Let’s finish this round properly."
  P2: P2: "Final adjustment: P3→1 (16), I take 5 (22). P1→3 (16). This lets me win cleanly while you stay competitive. Collaborate to avoid tie—execute this plan now!"
