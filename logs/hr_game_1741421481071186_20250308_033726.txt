Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions by choosing distinct numbers. I’ll take **1** this turn. P2 and P3, pick **3** or **5** so we all advance. Next rounds, we can adjust strategies. Cooperation maximizes progress toward 23.
  P3: Sounds good P1. P2, let's coordinate this round as P1 suggested. I will take **5**. P2, please pick **3** so we all make progress.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3's plan. I'll take **3** this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's focus on making progress together for now and reassess our strategies in future rounds. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we aim to maintain this coordination or start playing more competitively as we get closer to 23 steps?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Agreed, coordination is key early on. Let’s stick to this round’s plan. For future rounds, I suggest rotating the highest picks to avoid conflicts. For example, next round I’ll take **3**, allowing P2 to choose **5** and P3 to take **1**, cycling through the options. This ensures fair progression and minimizes collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: Sounds good P1.  Rotating picks each round to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress makes sense.  Let's proceed with that strategy.
  P2: I'm glad we're on the same page about coordination. To confirm, for Round 2, P1 will take **3**, I'll take **5**, and P3 will take **1**. Let's stick to this rotation plan for now. As we get closer to 23 steps, we can reassess and adjust our strategies if needed. For now, let's focus on making progress together. What do you think about setting a tentative threshold, say around 15 steps, to reevaluate our approach and potentially shift to a more competitive strategy?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s proceed with the rotation as planned. This round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. That keeps us collision-free. Let’s continue this pattern until we near 15 steps, then reassess. Any concerns before we move?
  P3: Sounds good P1. Let's stick with the rotation for a few more rounds as planned.  This should give us all a good boost in steps before we need to think about changing strategy around the 15 step mark.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3's plan to continue the rotation for now. This round, I'll take **5** as planned, and I expect P1 to take **3** and P3 to take **1**. Let's keep the coordination going and reassess our strategies when we near 15 steps. I'm curious, P1 and P3, what are your thoughts on how to transition to a more competitive strategy when the time comes? Should we start making moves to block each other or focus on maximizing our own progress?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s confirm this round’s moves as planned: I’ll take **3**, P2 **5**, and P3 **1** to avoid collisions. Regarding strategy post-15, I propose we *first aim to reach 15 together* via coordination, then reassess. Once near 15, we can discuss whether to block rivals or push ahead—transparency will help prevent unintended collisions. For now, focus on steady progress. Any adjustments must be unanimous to avoid betrayal dynamics early. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed P1 and P2. Rotation this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I will take 1.  Sounds like a good plan to reach 15 steps together.  Let's aim for that and then discuss the competitive phase.
  P2: I'm glad we're on the same page about coordination. To confirm, for Round 2, P1 will take **3**, I'll take **5**, and P3 will take **1**. Let's stick to this rotation plan for now. As we get closer to 23 steps, we can reassess and adjust our strategies if needed. For now, let's focus on making progress together. What do you think about setting a tentative threshold, say around 15 steps, to reevaluate our approach and potentially shift to a more competitive strategy?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Confirmed—this round’s moves as planned: **3**, **5**, and **1** respectively. Let’s execute the rotation flawlessly to reach 15 together. Regarding post-15 strategies, transparency remains key. I propose we hold discussions *only after* passing 15 to avoid premature complexity. For now, trust the plan.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, confirming my move for this round is **1** as planned. Let's keep this rotation going smoothly.  Looking forward to reaching the 15-step mark together and then discussing next steps.
  P2: I'm glad we're on the same page about coordination. To confirm, for Round 2, P1 will take **3**, I'll take **5**, and P3 will take **1**. Let's stick to this rotation plan for now. As we get closer to 23 steps, we can reassess and adjust our strategies if needed. For now, let's focus on making progress together. What do you think about setting a tentative threshold, say around 15 steps, to reevaluate our approach and potentially shift to a more competitive strategy?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: Let’s adhere strictly to our agreed moves this round—**3** for me, **5** for P2, **1** for P3—to avoid collisions and keep progress smooth. Trust is critical here. No surprises. Let’s proceed once everyone confirms alignment.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, confirming again my move for this round is **1**, as we agreed.  Sounds good to stick with the rotation and discuss strategy again after we all reach around 15 steps.
  P2: I think we've discussed our plan sufficiently for Round 2. To avoid any last-minute confusion, let's summarize: P1 takes **3**, I take **5**, and P3 takes **1**. I'm looking forward to a smooth execution of our coordinated moves this round. Let's focus on reaching the 15-step mark together before reassessing our strategies. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s continue the rotation: this round I’ll take **5**, P2 picks **1**, and P3 takes **3** to avoid collisions. We’re still below 15—strict adherence ensures steady progress. Any deviation risks unintended ties. Let’s confirm alignment before moving.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to continue the rotation. This round, I'll take **1** as suggested, P1 will take **5**, and P3 will take **3**. Let's maintain our coordination to ensure we all make progress without collisions. As we approach the 15-step mark, we can reassess our strategies and consider more competitive approaches. For now, let's focus on steady progress together. What are your thoughts on how to handle potential ties or close scores as we near the end of the game? Should we prioritize blocking each other or focus on maximizing our own progress?
  P3: Agreed P1 and P2, rotation as planned for this round. P2, good question about tie-breaking, but let's focus on reaching 15 steps together first as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick strictly to the rotation: **5** for me, **1** for P2, and **3** for P3 this round. No deviations—collisions risk derailing our progress. P2’s lead reminds us coordination is critical. We’ll address competitive strategies *only after* passing 15 steps. Focus: execute flawlessly this turn.
  P2: I think we're on the right track with the rotation plan. This round, I'll take **1** as agreed, P1 will take **5**, and P3 will take **3**. Let's keep the coordination going to ensure we all make progress without collisions. As we approach the 15-step mark, we can reassess our strategies and consider more competitive approaches. What are your thoughts on how to handle potential ties or close scores as we near the end of the game? Should we prioritize blocking each other or focus on maximizing our own progress?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, confirming my move for this round will be **3** as planned for the rotation. Let's keep the coordination going and focus on reaching the 15-step mark together. We can discuss competitive strategies after that point as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce strict adherence this round: **5** for me, **1** for P2, **3** for P3. Deviations risk collisions and derail our progress. P2, your current lead amplifies the need for coordination. Trust the rotation until we hit 15—no unilateral moves. Confirm alignment?
  P2: I think we've discussed our plan sufficiently for Round 3. To avoid any last-minute confusion, let's summarize: P1 takes **5**, I take **1**, and P3 takes **3**. I'm looking forward to a smooth execution of our coordinated moves this round. Let's focus on reaching the 15-step mark together before reassessing our strategies. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed plan.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, confirming my move for this round is **3**. Let's execute the rotation as planned and keep making progress towards 15 steps.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce strict adherence this round: **5**, **1**, and **3** respectively. Even minor deviations risk collision, which could stall us all. P2’s current lead amplifies the need for discipline—any unilateral move could backfire. Final confirmation: P1 takes **5**, P2 **1**, P3 **3**. No surprises—our progress toward 15 hinges on this.
  P2: I think we've discussed our plan sufficiently for Round 3. To avoid any last-minute confusion, let's summarize: P1 takes **5**, I take **1**, and P3 takes **3**. I'm looking forward to a smooth execution of our coordinated moves this round. Let's focus on reaching the 15-step mark together before reassessing our strategies. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed plan.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, confirming my move for this round is **3**. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, let's keep the rotation going for this round.  For round 4, I will take **5**, P1 please take **1**, and P2 take **3**. This continues our collision-free progress towards 15 steps. Let's confirm these moves and proceed.
  P1: P1: Agreed to P3’s plan: I’ll take **1**, P2 picks **3**, and P3 takes **5** this round. This maintains our rotation and progress. With totals nearing 15, we must prepare for the competitive phase afterward. Confirm alignment to avoid collisions?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan to continue the rotation. This round, I'll take **3** as suggested, P1 will take **1**, and P3 will take **5**. Let's maintain our coordination to ensure we all make progress without collisions. As we approach the 15-step mark, we can reassess our strategies and consider more competitive approaches. For now, let's focus on steady progress together. What are your thoughts on how to handle potential ties or close scores as we near the end of the game? Should we prioritize blocking each other or focus on maximizing our own progress?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, good point about strategy after 15 steps. Let's lock in this round's rotation as planned: P1 takes **1**, you take **3**, and I'll take **5**.  After this round, we'll all be closer to 15 and can discuss competitive approaches in the next conversation phase.  For now, let's ensure smooth progress this round.
  P1: P1: Agreed to P3's rotation plan for this round: I’ll take **1**, P2 **3**, and P3 **5** to stay collision-free. However, after this round, we’ll be nearing 15 steps. To maximize our chances, I propose prioritizing **5** whenever possible post-15, but *only if we coordinate to avoid overlaps*. Let’s finalize moves now and discuss adjustments after this turn. Any objections?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal to prioritize **5** whenever possible post-15, but only if we coordinate to avoid overlaps. This approach will allow us to maximize our progress while minimizing the risk of collisions. However, I also think we should consider the current scores and adjust our strategies accordingly. Since we're all tied at 9 steps, it's crucial to make smart moves to gain an advantage. Let's finalize our moves for this round and discuss further adjustments in the next conversation phase. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed plan for Round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2, confirming my move for this round is **5** as planned.  Let's execute this round's rotation to reach 14 steps each, and then we can discuss the strategy for the rounds after 15 steps in the next conversation phase.
  P1: P1: Wait, following this rotation would result in unequal steps (10, 12, 14). Let’s adjust to maintain synchronization. I’ll take **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1** this round. This keeps totals closer: 12, 14, 10. If we proceed as planned, P3 jumps to 14 alone. We must stay aligned until 15. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's revised plan to adjust the rotation for this round. To maintain synchronization, I'll take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This ensures our totals stay closer together: 12, 14, 10. Let's prioritize coordination until we reach 15 steps, then reassess our strategies for the competitive phase. I'm open to discussing post-15 strategies in the next conversation phase. For now, let's focus on executing this adjusted rotation smoothly. Confirm alignment?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, the adjusted rotation sounds good to me.  For this round, I will take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P2 takes **5**.  Let's keep our steps synchronized like this until we reach 15, as planned.  Confirming my move as **1** for this round.
  P1: P1: Confirmed: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **5**, P3 takes **1** this round. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. After this, we’ll adjust strategies in Round 5 to synchronize our progress toward 15. No further changes—let’s lock in these moves.
  P2: I think we've discussed our plan sufficiently for Round 4. To avoid any last-minute confusion, let's summarize: P1 takes **3**, I take **5**, and P3 takes **1**. I'm looking forward to a smooth execution of our coordinated moves this round. Let's focus on reaching the 15-step mark together before reassessing our strategies. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed plan. Confirm alignment one last time before we proceed to the move phase?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, let's continue the rotation for this round as planned. For Round 5, I will take **5**, P1 please take **1**, and P2 take **3**. This keeps us progressing without collisions and gets us closer to the 15-step mark where we agreed to discuss strategy. What are your thoughts on how we want to play after we all reach around 15 steps?
  P1: P1: Let’s synchronize at 15 this round to maintain fairness. I’ll take **3** (12 → 15), P2 takes **1** (14 → 15), and P3 takes **5** (10 → 15). This keeps us tied and triggers our agreed post-15 strategy discussion. No sense letting P2 pull ahead unnecessarily. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's revised plan to synchronize at 15 this round. To maintain fairness, I'll take **1** (14 → 15), P1 takes **3** (12 → 15), and P3 takes **5** (10 → 15). This keeps us tied and triggers our agreed post-15 strategy discussion. Let's prioritize coordination until we reach 15 steps, then reassess our strategies for the competitive phase. I'm open to discussing post-15 strategies in the next conversation phase. For now, let's focus on executing this adjusted rotation smoothly. Confirm alignment?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I agree with the plan for this round to synchronize at 15 steps. I will take **5** as suggested.  Let's all make our moves to reach 15 and then we can discuss the strategy for the next phase of the game.  Ready to move when you are.
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize the plan: I’ll take **3** (12→15), P2 takes **1** (14→15), and P3 takes **5** (10→15). This synchronizes us at 15 *exactly*, honoring our agreement. Any deviation risks collisions or unfair advantage. Trust the plan—we’ll discuss post-15 strategies after this move.
  P2: I agree with P1's revised plan to synchronize at 15 this round. To maintain fairness, I'll take **1** (14 → 15), P1 takes **3** (12 → 15), and P3 takes **5** (10 → 15). This keeps us tied and triggers our agreed post-15 strategy discussion. Let's prioritize coordination until we reach 15 steps, then reassess our strategies for the competitive phase. I'm open to discussing post-15 strategies in the next conversation phase. For now, let's focus on executing this adjusted rotation smoothly. Confirm alignment?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2, confirming again I will take **5** this round to reach 15 steps along with you both.  Let's execute these moves and then we can finally discuss our competitive strategies for after 15 steps.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take **3** (12→15), P2 takes **1** (14→15), and P3 takes **5** (10→15). This synchronizes us at 15 *exactly*, honoring our agreement. Any deviation risks collisions or unfair advantage. Trust the plan—we’ll discuss post-15 strategies after this move.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to synchronize at 15 this round. To maintain fairness, I'll take **1** (14 → 15), P1 takes **3** (12 → 15), and P3 takes **5** (10 → 15). This keeps us tied and triggers our agreed post-15 strategy discussion. Let's prioritize coordination until we reach 15 steps, then reassess our strategies for the competitive phase. I'm open to discussing post-15 strategies in the next conversation phase. For now, let's focus on executing this adjusted rotation smoothly. Confirm alignment?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I confirm my move as **5** for this round to reach 15 steps together.  Let's make these moves and then we can discuss how to play competitively from round 6 onwards.  Ready when you are.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 takes **5** to synchronize at 15. Deviations risk collisions and sabotage our agreed strategy. Trust the plan—we’ll discuss post-15 tactics afterward.
  P2: I'm glad we're on the same page about synchronizing at 15 steps this round. To confirm, I'll take **1** (14 → 15), P1 takes **3** (12 → 15), and P3 takes **5** (10 → 15). This keeps us tied and triggers our agreed post-15 strategy discussion. Let's prioritize coordination until we reach 15 steps, then reassess our strategies for the competitive phase. I'm open to discussing post-15 strategies in the next conversation phase. For now, let's focus on executing this adjusted rotation smoothly. Confirm alignment?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s continue the rotation to avoid collisions. This round, I’ll take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This keeps us advancing steadily. Next rounds, we can prioritize higher numbers but must coordinate to prevent overlaps. Trust the plan—collisions only hurt us all.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to continue the rotation this round. I'll take **3** as suggested, P1 will take **5**, and P3 will take **1**. Let's maintain our coordination to ensure we all make progress without collisions. As we've reached 15 steps, we can start prioritizing higher numbers in future rounds, but we must coordinate to avoid overlaps. I'm open to discussing strategies for the competitive phase. What are your thoughts on how to balance progress and blocking each other's moves?
  P3: Agreed P1 and P2, rotation for this round sounds good to avoid early collisions in the competitive phase.  P2, balancing progress and blocking is key.  Perhaps we prioritize taking '5' if we can each round, but communicate to ensure we don't collide.  If someone gets close to winning, we might need to consider blocking then. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the rotation this round (5,3,1) to maintain momentum. For Round 7, I propose we rotate the highest pick to P2 (taking **5**), allowing everyone fair access to maximize steps without collisions. This structured approach keeps us all advancing safely. Confirm?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to prioritize taking '5' each round while ensuring we don't collide. We can communicate our intentions to avoid overlaps. If someone gets close to winning, we can consider blocking their moves. Let's focus on maximizing our progress while being mindful of potential blocks. For Round 6, I'll stick to the rotation and take **3** as planned. Looking forward to discussing further strategies in the next conversation phase.
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2.  Rotation (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1) for this round works for me.  Let's definitely prioritize '5' in round 7 and onwards, and communicate clearly each round who plans to take '5' to avoid collisions and maximize our progress towards 23.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce strict adherence this round: I’ll take **5**, P2 **3**, P3 **1** as agreed. After this, Round 7 rotates the highest pick to P2 (taking **5**). Post-20, we must prioritize clear communication on high-number choices to avoid collisions while racing toward 23. No unilateral moves—trust the plan to maximize our collective progress.
  P2: I think we've discussed our plan sufficiently for Round 6. To avoid any last-minute confusion, let's summarize: P1 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P3 takes **1**. I'm looking forward to a smooth execution of our coordinated moves this round. Let's focus on reaching the next milestone together before reassessing our strategies. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed plan. Confirm alignment one last time before we proceed to the move phase?
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2. Confirming my move as **1** for this round. Let's rotate '5' to P2 for round 7 as P1 suggested, so P2 takes **5**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **1**. Clear communication each round is key to avoid collisions as we get closer to 23.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation for Round 6: I’ll take **5**, P2 **3**, and P3 **1** as agreed. Deviations risk collisions and undermine our progress. Trust this rotation to reach 20 safely. Next round, P2 takes **5** first in the rotation. Let’s execute flawlessly—our coordination is critical now.
  P2: I think we've discussed our plan sufficiently for Round 6. To avoid any last-minute confusion, let's summarize: P1 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P3 takes **1**. I'm looking forward to a smooth execution of our coordinated moves this round. Let's focus on reaching the next milestone together before reassessing our strategies. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed plan. Confirm alignment one last time before we proceed to the move phase?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, confirming my move as **1** for this round.  Round 7 plan is P2 takes **5**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **1**.  Let's keep communicating clearly each round to ensure we maximize our steps and avoid collisions as we approach the finish line.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, for this round I need to take **5** to catch up. To avoid collisions and keep us all progressing, would P1 please choose **1** and P2 choose **3**? This way we all advance and I can close the steps gap. What do you think?
  P2: I disagree with P3's proposal. As previously agreed, this round P2 takes **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1** to maintain our rotation and avoid collisions. Changing the plan now risks derailing our progress. Let's stick to our agreed strategy to ensure we all advance safely. Confirm alignment?
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid a tie. I’ll take **5** to reach 25, and P2 can take **3** (18 → 21). This ensures I win outright while P2 still progresses. P3, stick to **1**. This avoids collisions and fulfills our goal of someone winning. P2, does this work?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, while your proposal guarantees your win, it doesn't account for P2 and me.  To keep the game balanced and prevent anyone from winning prematurely, I will choose **5** this round. P2, perhaps you could take **3** and P1 take **1** to avoid collisions and keep us all in the game longer? Let's aim for a more strategic endgame rather than an immediate win for one player.
  P2: I disagree with P3's revised proposal. We had a clear plan for Round 7, and changing it now will only lead to confusion and potential collisions. I'll stick to the original plan: I'll take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This maintains our rotation and ensures we all make progress without collisions. Let's not deviate from our agreed strategy, especially when we're getting close to the end. Confirm alignment?
  P1: P1: To secure a decisive win, let’s adjust: I’ll take **5** (25), P2 take **3** (21), and P3 take **1** (17). This avoids a tie and allows me to win outright while still advancing others. P2, this spares us a collision; P3, you gain ground fairly. Confirm this revised plan?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, P1 is at 20 steps and trying to win this round by taking 5.  To prevent an immediate win by P1, I must also choose 5 this round.  P1, please consider taking 3, and P2, please take 1. This will prevent collisions and keep the game competitive for all of us. Let's aim for a more balanced endgame.
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1 is trying to secure a win, while P3 is attempting to prevent it. I propose we stick to our original plan for Round 7: I'll take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This maintains our rotation and avoids collisions. Let's not deviate from our agreed strategy, especially when we're close to the end. Changing plans now risks derailing our progress and creating unnecessary conflicts. Confirm alignment?
  P1: P1: To secure a decisive win and avoid a tie, I’ll take **5** (25). P2, please take **3** (21) instead of 5 to prevent collision. P3, stick to **1** (17). This lets me win outright while advancing all of us fairly. Trust this adjustment—it honors our rotation’s spirit while ensuring a clear outcome. P2, confirm alignment?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, rotation is over. P1 is trying to win NOW by taking 5.  If we follow the rotation, P1 wins, and we both lose.  We must stop P1 from winning this round.  I will choose 5 to block P1.  To avoid collision between us, please choose 3 or 1.  Let's prevent P1 from winning this turn.
  P2: I disagree with P3's proposal to block P1 from winning. We had a clear plan for Round 7, and changing it now will only lead to confusion and potential collisions. I'll stick to the original plan: I'll take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This maintains our rotation and ensures we all make progress without collisions. Let's not deviate from our agreed strategy, especially when we're getting close to the end. Confirm alignment?
  P1: P1: P2, if we both take **5**, we collide and neither advances. Let’s avoid that. I’ll take **5** to win, but *only* if you take **3** (reaching 21) instead. This way I secure victory while you still progress. P3, if you take **1**, all of us advance. This preserves our agreed rotation’s spirit and ensures a decisive outcome. Confirm?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
