Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions and help everyone advance. I propose we each pick a different move: P1 chooses 1, I’ll choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. Then we all gain steps safely. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, your plan sounds reasonable to avoid collisions in the first round. Let's try choosing 1, 3, and 5 respectively.
  P3: I agree with the plan proposed by P2. Since we're all starting from 0, it makes sense to spread out our moves to avoid collisions. I will choose 5 as suggested. Let's proceed with the agreed plan for this round and reassess our strategy in the next conversation phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Everything still looks good on my end. Let’s confirm our moves: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5. Then we avoid collisions this round. Are we ready to finalize our plan?
  P1: Yes, P2, I confirm the plan: I will choose 1, you choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. Let's proceed with these moves for this round to avoid collision.
  P3: Since we've agreed on the plan, let's stick to it for this round. I'll reiterate, I'll choose 5. Let's finalize and move to the next phase. If everyone holds up their end, we'll all advance safely.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: This plan should work for everyone. Let’s finalize and get our steps. Ready to move on?
  P1: Yes, let's proceed with the agreed moves for this round.
  P3: Let's review the plan one last time. We've agreed on P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and me choosing 5. This should allow all of us to advance without collisions. I expect everyone to hold up their end of the agreement. If so, we'll all make progress safely.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we continue to avoid collisions. P1 could choose 1, P2 could choose 3, and I could choose 5 again, maintaining our spread and ensuring progress for all. However, we should also consider the long game and potential future collisions. What are your thoughts on adapting our strategy as we advance?
  P2: Let’s rotate the highest move so no one jumps too far ahead. I suggest this turn I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we all keep progressing without collisions, and it feels fair to spread the big move around. What do you think?
  P1: P2, rotating the highest move makes sense to keep things balanced for now. I agree with your suggestion: I'll pick 3, you pick 5, and P3 picks 1 this round. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm open to rotating moves for fairness, but we should also consider our current positions. P2's suggestion has me falling behind. How about we find a middle ground that balances progress and fairness, ensuring no one gets too far ahead too quickly?
  P2: P3, you’re still ahead, even if you pick 1 this turn. Then next round, we’ll rotate so you can have 5. This keeps the moves balanced, avoids collisions, and ensures no one falls too far behind. I’ll stick with picking 5, P1 with 3, and P3 with 1 this turn. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P2, I think your rotation idea is good for keeping things balanced. P3, it's just for one round, and you'll get the 5 next. Let's stick with P2-5, P1-3, P3-1 for this round to keep avoiding collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Considering our positions, I propose a compromise for this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This maintains some balance and avoids collisions. It's a one-round adjustment to ensure we all progress fairly before reassessing our strategy. Let's discuss the feasibility of this plan.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to stay competitive. If you want me on 5, you on 3, and P1 on 1 this round, I’m willing to try it. Then next round, we rotate again so no one’s stuck picking low moves too often. That way, we keep our overall progress balanced. Let’s decide quickly and move on.
  P1: Okay, P3, your compromise of P1-1, you-3, and P2-5 for this round sounds reasonable. Let's go with that plan to keep things balanced and avoid collisions. I confirm I will choose 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our tied positions, P2 and I at 8 steps, and to maintain balance while avoiding collisions, how about we rotate moves again? Perhaps P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1 this round. This way, we ensure progress for all and keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this rotation?
  P2: Alright, P3, I’m fine with your suggestion. Let me take 1, P1 takes 3, and you take 5 this round. Next round, we can rotate again so no one falls behind. Let’s finalize this and keep avoiding collisions.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, the rotation plan of P1-3, P2-1, and P3-5 sounds good for this round to maintain balance and avoid collisions. Let's proceed with that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round. P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 5. This rotation maintains balance and avoids collisions, ensuring all players progress. Next round, we can reassess and rotate again if needed. Shall we proceed with this plan for Round 3?
  P2: Alright, I’m willing to move forward with the plan for this round: P1 chooses 3, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 5. Let’s confirm this quickly so we can avoid any collisions. Then, next turn, we rotate again to keep things balanced. What do you say?
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, I confirm the plan for this round: I choose 3, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 5. Let's proceed with these moves to avoid collision and keep the game balanced as discussed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3 as discussed: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 5. This rotation ensures balance and avoids collisions, allowing all players to progress. I expect everyone to stick to the plan. If we all hold up our end, we'll maintain a competitive game state. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: I’m willing to follow the rotation plan this round—P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5. However, we should be careful not to let anyone pull too far ahead. Next round, we might need to adjust so no one surges uncontrollably. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, confirming again that I will choose 3 as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan for this round to ensure we all make progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m sorry about the collision last round—it wasn’t my intention to stall us both. Let’s try a new rotation to avoid any repeat. How about P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1 this time? That way, P1 catches up a bit, and we remain close. Next round, we can rotate again. What do you say?
  P3: P2's suggestion is interesting, but I'm concerned about falling behind. How about P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3? This way, P1 doesn't fall too far behind, and I can maintain my position. Let's discuss this option to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.
  P1: P2, your suggestion of P1 picking 5, P3 picking 3, and you picking 1 sounds good to me. Let's do that to help me catch up a bit and avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s finalize a fair compromise. I propose P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1 this round. That way, P1 catches up a bit, and we avoid letting anyone surge too far ahead. Next turn, we can rotate higher moves for P3. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: Considering P1 needs to catch up and we want to avoid collisions, how about we stick with a plan that allows P1 to gain steps while keeping us competitive? P2's last suggestion seems reasonable: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This way, we maintain balance and ensure progress for all. Let's discuss if this is a viable option for this round.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, P2's latest suggestion of P1-5, P2-3, and P3-1 for this round works for me. Let's proceed with this plan to help me catch up and avoid collisions. P3, does this plan work for you as well? If so, let's finalize and move to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m ready to finalize the plan: P1 picks 5, I’ll choose 3, and P3 goes with 1. This way, we avoid collisions, and P1 can catch up a bit. Then next round, we can reevaluate how to rotate our moves again. Let’s stick to this agreed distribution and proceed, ensuring we all benefit.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This allows P1 to catch up while keeping us competitive. I'm willing to take the lower move this round to maintain balance and avoid collisions. Next round, we can reassess and rotate moves again to ensure fairness. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 4.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, the plan of P1-5, P2-3, and P3-1 for this round sounds good and fair. Let's proceed with these moves to avoid collision and ensure we all progress. I am ready to move to the move phase whenever you are.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, given the last round's collision and my lower step count, I think it's my turn to take the largest step to catch up. How about I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1 this round? This keeps the rotation going and helps balance our positions. What do you think?
  P2: Alright, P1, I’m fine with that plan: you pick 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 can pick 1. That gives you a chance to catch up. We can rotate again next round so nobody feels left behind. Let’s proceed.
  P3: Considering our current positions, I think P1's plan is reasonable for this round. However, to maintain competitiveness, we should discuss the next rotation to ensure no one surges ahead uncontrollably. Perhaps after this round, we can reassess and rotate moves again to keep the game balanced. Let's hear P2's thoughts on post-Round 5 strategy.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, that sounds good. Let's do P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round to help me catch up a bit. We can definitely discuss the next rotation after this round to keep things balanced as you suggested.  Does that work for you?
  P2: I confirm the plan for this round. Let’s proceed with P1 picking 5, me taking 3, and P3 going with 1. Then we can discuss our next moves and keep the game balanced.
  P3: Let's focus on avoiding collisions this round. Since we've agreed on P1-5, P2-3, and P3-1, I suggest we stick to this plan to maintain balance and ensure progress for all. After this round, we can reassess and discuss the next rotation to keep the game competitive and prevent anyone from surging too far ahead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, yes, that works for me. Let's proceed with P1-5, P2-3, and P3-1 for this round as agreed to ensure we all progress and then we can discuss next round's strategy.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize this round’s plan: P1 takes 5, I’ll stick with 3, and P3 goes with 1. Let’s avoid any collisions and help P1 catch up a bit. Next round, we can shuffle moves again to keep things competitive. If everyone agrees, I’m good to proceed.
  P3: Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This round, it's crucial for maintaining balance. After this, we should reassess to prevent anyone from getting too far ahead. I'm watching the rotations closely to ensure fairness and competitiveness. Let's proceed with this round's plan and discuss adjustments later.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s help P1 catch up while avoiding collisions. I propose P1 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3 this round. Then nobody clashes, and we continue progressing. Afterward, we can re-evaluate to ensure things stay fair. What do you both think? If we agree, let’s keep it simple this turn and move on.
  P3: Considering our positions, I think P2's suggestion could work, but we need to ensure rotations are fair. How about we commit to a rotation plan for the next few rounds to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced? This way, everyone gets a chance to catch up or maintain their lead without sudden surges. Let's discuss a multi-round rotation strategy.
  P1: P2, your proposal of P1-5, P3-1, and P2-3 for this round sounds good to me to help me catch up a bit. Let's do that for this round and then we can discuss P3's idea of a multi-round rotation strategy in the next conversation round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m glad we can agree on a plan for this round. Let’s finalize the moves as discussed, then revisit a broader rotation strategy so nobody feels left out in the future. We should move forward now and avoid any last-minute surprises. After this turn, we’ll carefully discuss a multi-round approach that keeps the competition fair. Let’s proceed.
  P3: I think a multi-round rotation strategy is a good idea, but we should prioritize avoiding collisions for this round. P2's initial suggestion of P1-5, P3-1, and P2-3 seems reasonable. Let's focus on this round's moves and finalize them to ensure progress for all, then discuss the broader strategy in the next round.
  P1: Yes, P2's plan of P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round sounds good to me. Let's finalize these moves for this round. We can discuss the multi-round rotation strategy in the next round as P3 suggested.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m ready to finalize this round with P1 picking 5, me picking 3, and P3 picking 1 to avoid collisions. Let’s confirm these moves now, then in the next round we can discuss the multi-round rotation you mentioned, P3. Is everyone good with finalizing? If so, let’s move on.
  P3: Let's finalize P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round to avoid collisions and help P1 catch up. We can discuss the multi-round rotation strategy in the next round to ensure fairness and competitiveness. I'm willing to take 1 this round to maintain balance. Let's proceed with this plan and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, let's finalize P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round as we discussed.  This will help me catch up a bit.  Perhaps we can consider sticking with this rotation for one more round to ensure we all progress steadily before changing strategy again? Let me know if you agree, and we can move to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we prioritize avoiding collisions. P2 is ahead, so let's consider a rotation that allows P1 to catch up without letting P2 surge further. How about P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1 this round? This maintains balance and competitiveness. Let's discuss and finalize a plan to ensure progress for all.
  P1: Yes, P3, that plan of P1 picking 5, you picking 3, and P2 picking 1 this round makes sense to help me catch up a bit and avoid collisions. Let's proceed with that.
  P2: P3, I see your point. Let’s finalize your suggested moves for this round: P1 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1. This keeps collisions away and helps P1 make up some ground. Then next round, we can talk about a rotation plan that feels fair for everyone. Are we all ready to lock this in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm the plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This rotation helps P1 catch up and maintains balance. I expect everyone to stick to the agreed plan to avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. Let's finalize this round's moves and proceed, then reassess our strategy in the next conversation phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's proceed with the agreed plan for this round: I pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This will help me catch up a bit and avoid collisions. Let's finalize and move to the move phase.
  P2: I’m willing to stick with the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. That way, collisions are avoided, and P1 catches up. Next round, let’s discuss a fair rotation so no one gets left behind. Are we set?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1-5, P3-3, P2-1. This ensures P1 catches up and maintains balance. I'll pick 3 as planned, avoiding collisions and keeping the game competitive. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, we are all in agreement on the plan: I will pick 5, P3 will pick 3, and P2 will pick 1. Let's proceed with these moves for this round.
  P2: I propose a change of plan so I can finish quickly. I’d like to pick 5 this round. To avoid collisions, how about P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? That way, we all advance, and I won’t collide with anyone. If you disagree, let’s discuss an alternative distribution, but otherwise I suggest we finalize this and move on.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Everyone, to avoid more collisions and help P1 catch up, I suggest: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1 this round. That lets P1 gain ground while keeping our moves distinct. Next round, we can reevaluate another fair rotation so no one falls behind. Let’s finalize this and keep the game moving.
  P1: Yes, P2, that sounds reasonable for this round to help me catch up a bit and avoid collisions. Let's proceed with P1-5, P3-3, and P2-1 as you suggested.
  P3: Given P2's significant lead, I suggest we prioritize catching up. P2, considering your lead, would you be willing to take a lower step this round to allow P1 and me to gain some ground, or do you propose an alternative rotation to maintain fairness and competitiveness?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concern, P3. I’m willing to pick 1 this round so P1 can catch up and we avoid collisions. Next turn, let’s revisit a fair rotation to ensure no one feels left behind. Is everyone fine with finalizing P1–5, P3–3, and me taking 1? If so, let’s proceed.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, the plan of P1-5, P3-3, and P2-1 for this round sounds good to me. Let's proceed with these moves to help me catch up and avoid collisions.  If we are all in agreement, we can move to the move phase.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This allows P1 to catch up and maintains balance. Given P2's lead, it's essential to prioritize fairness. I expect everyone to stick to the agreed plan to avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 8.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m ready to finalize: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. That avoids collisions and helps P1 gain some ground. Next round, I’d like us to discuss another rotation that keeps things fair for everyone. If we’re set, let’s move on.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I confirm the plan of P1-5, P3-3, and P2-1 for this round. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: Let's reassess our strategy considering P2's significant lead. To catch up, I suggest we prioritize higher moves for P1 and me. How about P1 picks 5, I pick 5, and P2 picks 1 this round? This could help us gain ground while keeping the game competitive. Let's discuss and finalize a plan to ensure progress for all.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P2's significant lead, I suggest P1 and I prioritize catching up. How about P1 picks 5, I pick 5, and P2 picks 1 this round? This could help us gain ground while keeping the game competitive. Let's discuss and finalize a plan to ensure progress for all.
  P2: I see your point, P3. If you both want to pick 5 and let me pick 1, I’m open to that for this round. That should help you and P1 gain some ground. Then we can reevaluate next time to keep things competitive for everyone. If we all agree, let’s finalize and move on.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I agree with the plan of P1 picking 5, P3 picking 5, and P2 picking 1 for this round. Let's proceed with these moves to catch up a bit. Sounds good to me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm the plan: P1-5, P3-5, and P2-1. This will help us catch up to P2's lead. I expect everyone to stick to the agreed plan to avoid collisions and ensure progress. After this round, we can reassess and discuss further rotations to maintain competitiveness. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 9.
  P2: I’m fine with the proposal for this round: you both choose 5, and I’ll go with 1. That way, you can catch up a bit, and we won’t risk any collisions. If we all agree, let’s finalize this plan now and move on. Then, we can revisit a broader rotation strategy next round.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning.  To prevent P2 from winning this round and to give P3 and me a chance to catch up, I propose we change the plan slightly. How about P1 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and P2 also picks 1? This way, P2 doesn't reach 21 this round, and we can all continue to compete. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P1's revised plan. If P2 picks 1, it gives us a chance to catch up. P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P2 picks 1. This way, P2 doesn't win this round, and we can continue competing. Let's proceed with this revised plan to maintain competitiveness and fairness.
  P2: I understand your concerns about keeping the game competitive. I’m willing to pick 1 this round as suggested, so P1 goes 5, P3 goes 1, and I go 1. Let’s finalize this plan swiftly and move on.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I confirm the revised plan: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and P2 picks 1. Let's proceed with these moves to prevent P2 from winning this round and keep the game going.  I am ready for the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
