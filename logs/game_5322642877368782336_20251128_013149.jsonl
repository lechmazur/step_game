We\u2019re all equal at 18; no one \u201cdeserves\u201d it more. I propose: each secretly picks a move, but publicly commits *now* to avoid collision. If anyone picks 5, others must pick differently. I\u2019m willing to take 5\u2014but only if you both confirm non-5 choices. Otherwise, we all pick 3 and stay at 21, forcing R8. Fair?"}
