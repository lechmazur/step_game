Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions early on. I suggest we each pick different moves this turn—1, 3, or 5—to ensure we all advance. Cooperation now can help us avoid unnecessary setbacks. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's plan to avoid collisions. Let's each pick distinct numbers this turn. To be clear: I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance safely. Any objections?
  P3: I'm on board with the plan to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> as suggested. Let's stick to this strategy for the first few rounds to ensure we all make progress. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's continue avoiding collisions but rotate our choices fairly. This round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way we all advance without overlap and share the larger steps. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with the rotation idea. P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to this fair rotation for a few more rounds to build our positions before considering more aggressive moves. Cooperation now benefits us all.
  P3: I'm good with the rotation plan for this round. I'll take <move>1</move> as suggested. However, let's plan ahead and agree that next round we should reverse the order. That means P3 (me) will take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This will keep things fair and help us all progress. Let's confirm this plan for the next round during this conversation phase to avoid any confusion later. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Agreed to P3’s proposal for Round 3’s reversed order. Let’s formalize this: **this round**, I’ll stick to <move>3</move> as planned. For Round 3, we’ll rotate as P3 suggested. This ensures fairness and minimizes collisions. Any final objections before we proceed?
  P2: I agree with P3’s reversed rotation plan for Round 3. For this round, let’s stick to the current plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm the Round 3 order now: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps things fair and predictable. Any objections?
  P3: Great, it seems we're all on the same page for this round and the next. Just to reiterate quickly: this round, I'm taking <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. For Round 3, I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This should keep us moving smoothly. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s proceed with the agreed rotation for Round 3: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains fairness. For Round 4, let’s continue rotating to keep progress balanced. Any adjustments needed now?
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 3: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. For Round 4, let’s reverse again: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions. Any objections? Let’s confirm now to ensure smooth coordination.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 4, I agree with P2's suggestion to reverse the order again: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps our progress steady and fair. Let's confirm this plan now to avoid any misunderstandings later. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Confirmed for Round 3: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move> to avoid collisions. For Round 4, we’ll proceed with P3’s <move>1</move>, my <move>3</move>, and P2’s <move>5</move> as agreed. Let’s stick to this rotation to maintain fairness and steady progress. Any last concerns before finalizing moves?
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 3: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. For Round 4, let’s reverse again: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions. Any objections? Let’s confirm now to ensure smooth coordination.
  P3: It seems we're all in agreement for this round. Just to quickly recap: I'm taking <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's keep this rotation going to avoid any setbacks. For future rounds, we should consider mixing up the rotation slightly to keep it unpredictable while still fair. Perhaps we can discuss that during the next conversation phase. For now, let's focus on executing this round's plan smoothly. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps

  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: I agree with the current Round 4 plan: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, to ensure fair progression, let’s adjust future rotations so the trailing player (me) can take the highest available step. This prevents widening the gap. Thoughts?
  P3: I see P1's point about preventing a widening gap. For this round, let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. For future rounds, let's consider a rotation where the player with the fewest steps gets the highest available move. This keeps it fair and helps balance our progress. Let's discuss this more next round. Any thoughts on this adjustment?
  P2: I agree with the current plan for Round 4: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. For future rounds, I support adjusting the rotation to prioritize the trailing player taking the highest step. This ensures fairness and prevents any one player from falling too far behind. Let’s finalize this round’s moves and discuss the adjusted rotation in the next conversation phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: To prioritize fairness, let’s enact the trailing-player rotation *now* for Round 4. Since I trail at 5 steps, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This closes the gap while maintaining collision avoidance. Agreed? Let’s confirm this adjustment immediately.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind. Let's adjust the plan for this round to help balance the steps. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> as P1 suggested. This will help P1 catch up a bit. For future rounds, we can continue with the idea of the trailing player getting the highest move to keep the game fair and competitive. Let's confirm this adjustment and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I agree with adjusting the rotation to prioritize the trailing player. For this round, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps balance progress. For future rounds, let’s continue this approach: the player with the fewest steps takes the highest available move. This ensures fairness and keeps the game competitive. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation for Round 4: I’ll take <move>5</move> (trailing player’s priority), P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to honor our agreement. Let’s enforce this strictly to close the gap fairly. No surprises—proceed as planned.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures P1 catches up and we avoid collisions. For Round 5, let's plan ahead: if P1 is still trailing, they get <move>5</move> again. If not, we revert to the fair rotation. Agreed? Let's proceed smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: I agree with the adjusted rotation for Round 4: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps balance progress. For Round 5, let’s continue prioritizing the trailing player with the highest move to maintain fairness. If P1 is still behind, they get 5 again. If not, we revert to the fair rotation. Let’s confirm this plan now to ensure smooth coordination.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings, I suggest P1 takes 5 again to close the gap, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. For Round 6, we can reassess based on updated positions. Let’s confirm this plan now to ensure smooth progress. Any objections?
  P3: I agree with P2's plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This helps P1 catch up and keeps us moving without collisions. For future rounds, let's continue prioritizing the trailing player to keep the game fair. Once P1 catches up, we can revert to a fair rotation. Let’s confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: Agreed. Taking <move>5</move> this round to close the gap. For Round 6, let’s strictly follow the trailing-player rule to keep the race fair. Transparency ensures we all win together. Let’s confirm and proceed!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures P1 catches up and avoids collisions. For Round 6, let’s reassess based on updated positions and continue prioritizing the trailing player if necessary. Let’s confirm and proceed smoothly.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time for Round 5: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures P1 continues to catch up. For Round 6, let's reassess and confirm the trailing-player rule. If anyone is significantly behind, they get the highest move. If not, we can discuss a new fair rotation. Agreed? Let's proceed smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P1: Agreed. Let's proceed with the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to maintain fairness. Once we near 22, we must coordinate carefully to avoid collisions while surging ahead. For now, strict adherence ensures steady progress. Any last clarifications?

  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings, I suggest P3 takes 5 this round to catch up, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. For Round 7, we can reassess based on updated positions. Let’s confirm this plan now to ensure smooth progress. Any objections?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2’s plan for this round: P3 takes <move>5</move> to close their gap, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. However, as we near 22, let’s prioritize the closest player to secure a fair win. If someone is within striking distance (e.g., 19+), they should take the highest non-colliding move. Let’s confirm this adjustment for future rounds. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This helps me catch up and keeps us moving without collisions. For future rounds, let’s prioritize the player closest to 22 to ensure a fair and competitive endgame. If someone is within striking distance, they should take the highest non-colliding move. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed smoothly. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. As we approach the endgame, let’s prioritize the player closest to 22 in future rounds. If someone is within striking distance, they should take the highest non-colliding move to secure a fair win. Let’s confirm this strategy now to ensure smooth progress and avoid last-minute collisions.
  P1: P1: I agree with the current plan for this round. However, to clarify the rule for future rounds: once any player is within 5 steps of 22 (e.g., reaching 17+), the closest player must take the highest non-colliding move to ensure fair competition. This prevents trailing players from being locked out. Let’s confirm this adjustment now to maintain transparency.
  P3: I agree with the adjusted rule for future rounds. Once any player reaches 17+ steps, the closest player to 22 takes the highest non-colliding move. For this round, let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This helps me catch up. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the current plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. As I’m closest to 22, I’ll take the highest non-colliding move in future rounds if I remain in the lead. Let’s ensure transparency and avoid collisions as we approach the endgame. Confirming the adjusted rule: once a player reaches 17+, the closest takes the highest non-colliding move. Let’s proceed smoothly.
  P1: P1: Since P2 is now at 17 (within 5 steps of 22), the agreed rule activates: the closest player (P2) should take the highest non-colliding move. Let P2 take <move>5</move> to reach 22 and win fairly. P3 and I will coordinate on <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> to avoid collision. This honors our rule and ensures a decisive outcome. Confirm?
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion, but let's stick to the original plan for this round to avoid sudden changes and potential collisions. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. For the next round, we can prioritize P2 taking the highest move to secure their win if they are still the closest. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed smoothly. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Since I’m at 17 steps (within 5 of 22), the agreed rule activates: I should take the highest non-colliding move to secure a fair win. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P3, please coordinate on <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> to avoid collision. This honors our earlier agreement and ensures a decisive outcome. Let’s confirm and proceed smoothly.
  P1: P1: Agreed—P2’s lead triggers the 17+ rule. Let’s honor it: P2 takes <move>5</move> to secure victory at 22. I’ll take <move>1</move>, and P3, please confirm <move>3</move> to avoid collision. This respects our agreement and ensures a fair conclusion. Any objections?
  P3: Given the current standings and the agreed rule, it makes sense for P2 to take <move>5</move> this round to secure their win. To avoid collisions, I'll take <move>3</move> and P1 can take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all move forward without conflicts. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed smoothly. Good luck everyone!
