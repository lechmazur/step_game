  P2: To maximize the chances of winning, it's crucial to coordinate steps with other players to avoid collisions and make efficient progress towards 17 steps. 

### Approach

1. **Coordination to Avoid Collisions:** Each player should choose distinct step numbers each turn to prevent collisions.
2. **Efficient Progress:** Players should aim to take as many steps as possible without risking collisions.
3. **Strategy Based on Current Positions:** 
   - **P1 (1 step):** Needs to catch up quickly.
   - **P2 (9 steps):** Close to the target, needs to plan steps to reach 17 before others.
   - **P3 (10 steps):** Currently leading, should aim to maintain or increase the lead.

### Strategic Plan

1. **Propose a Step Allocation Plan:**
   - **Round 6:**
     - P1: 1 step
     - P2: 3 steps
     - P3: 5 steps
   - This ensures no collisions and allows all players to move forward.

2. **Rotate Step Choices in Subsequent Rounds:**
   - **Round 7:**
     - P1: 3 steps
     - P2: 5 steps
     - P3: 1 step
   - This rotation helps in making steady progress without overlapping step choices.

3. **Adjust Based on Progress:**
   - Monitor the positions after each round and adjust step choices if necessary to prevent collisions and optimize progress.

4. **Communicate Clearly:**
   - Ensure all players are aware of the step allocation plan to avoid any miscommunications leading to collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 has already chosen 3. I'll take 1 step this round, and P3, please take 5. This avoids collisions and gets us all moving. Let's stick to this for a clear round.
  P3: Let's avoid collisions this round. I propose P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and I'll take 5 steps. This ensures progress for all without overlaps and allows me to maintain my lead. Please confirm if you can adhere to this plan to proceed efficiently.
  P2: "各位，我注意到之前有几次碰撞导致我们没有前进。为了避免这种情况，我建议我们开始协调我们的步骤选择。例如，在本轮中，P1选择1步，我选择3步，P3选择5步。然后，在下一轮中，P1选择3步，我选择5步，P3选择1步。这样，我们可以确保每一轮中步骤选择不同，避免碰撞，并且每个人都能前进。这将帮助我们更有效地接近目标。你们觉得如何？"


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, I'll take 1 step this round. P2 has already chosen 3, so P3, please take 5. This avoids collisions and gets us all moving. Let's stick to this for a clear round.
  P3: I propose we stick to the plan: P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and I'll take 5 steps. This ensures progress for all without overlaps and allows me to maintain my lead. Let's finalize our moves efficiently and avoid another collision. Please confirm if you can adhere to this plan to proceed.
  P2: To maximize our chances of winning, we need to coordinate our steps to avoid collisions and make efficient progress towards 17 steps. I propose the following step allocation for this round:

- P1: 1 step  
- P2: 3 steps  
- P3: 5 steps  

This ensures that we all choose different step numbers, avoiding any collisions and allowing us to move forward efficiently. In subsequent rounds, we can rotate the step choices to optimize our progress. For example:

- Next round: P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 5 steps, P3 takes 1 step.  

By following this rotation, we can ensure that each player gets a chance to take larger steps without overlapping with others. It's essential that we all adhere to this plan to avoid any miscommunications leading to collisions. Please confirm if you agree with this approach.
