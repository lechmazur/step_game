With the scores so close, we need to be strategic. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that I advance while keeping the competition tight. Trust is crucial, but we must also look out for our own positions. Let's commit to this plan and keep the game moving forward! What do you both think? Ready to finalize our choices?"}
