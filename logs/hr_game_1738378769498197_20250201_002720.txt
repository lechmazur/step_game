Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I propose we all choose different moves this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance and avoid unnecessary conflict. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this first round. I will take <move>3</move>. Let's all stick to the plan this turn.
  P1: I appreciate the clear proposal. However, in a race to 19, I worry that sticking rigidly to any set move might let someone pull too far ahead. While I’m generally supportive of coordination, I believe we should remain flexible. If it seems one of us is gaining an undue advantage, are you both open to adjusting our moves mid-turn?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about flexibility, but early coordination can set a strong foundation. Let’s stick to the plan this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. We can reassess after this round if needed. Trust is key here—let’s avoid undermining each other early on.
  P2: Okay, I agree to the plan for this round. Let's all take our agreed upon moves to start. We can adjust strategy after seeing how this plays out.
  P1: I'm leaning toward the plan but want to keep it flexible. If any of us see someone building a strong lead, I might adjust. I’m ready to switch my move if needed—so if anyone's reconsidering, speak up now.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, so P1 didn't stick to the plan last round. Let's try this again: I will choose <move>3</move> this round. P3, will you choose <move>5</move>? P1, please choose <move>1</move> if you want to keep things fair.
  P1: I'm inclined toward choosing 1 this round. However, I want to stay alert in case adjustments become necessary. If P3 confirms choosing 5 to avoid collisions, I'm on board with 1. Let's ensure we coordinate to keep our progress steady.
  P3: I’ll stick to <move>5</move> this round to avoid collisions with P2’s <move>3</move>. P1, please choose <move>1</move> to keep things fair and ensure we all advance. Let’s rebuild trust and stick to the plan this time. We can reassess after this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>3</move> this round. P1 and P3, please confirm your choices of <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, so we can all move forward this turn. Let's all stick to the plan this time.
  P1: I'm still on board with our coordination. Provided P3 follows through, I'll lean toward 1 this round. However, I'm keeping my options open to adjust if the board shifts unexpectedly. Let's stay alert and communicate until moves are locked in.
  P3: I’ll stick to <move>5</move> this round as agreed. P1, please confirm <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P2 is already committed to <move>3</move>. Let’s all advance this turn and rebuild trust. If anyone deviates, it risks undermining our progress. We can reassess after this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, I'm going to choose <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's all advance this turn.
  P3: I’ll take <move>3</move> this round as P2 suggested. P1, please stick to <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P2, your <move>5</move> ensures we all advance. Let’s maintain coordination and trust—this is working well so far. We can reassess after this round if needed.
  P1: I’m reconsidering my move. I might lean toward a more aggressive option—possibly move 3—instead of 1. If both P2 and P3 shift to 5, they’d collide and their lead would stall, letting me catch up. Otherwise, I’ll stick with 1 as agreed. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I think you're overthinking it. Sticking to the plan is working. I'm choosing <move>5</move>. P3 is choosing <move>3</move>. P1, please choose <move>1</move> as we agreed. Let's all advance this round.
  P3: P1, shifting to <move>3</move> risks colliding with P2’s <move>5</move>, stalling both of you and letting me advance. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Deviating now could disrupt our momentum and trust. Let’s stay coordinated and reassess after this round.
  P1: I appreciate your perspectives. For now, I'll stick with move 1 as long as we all agree—P2 with move 5 and P3 with move 3—to avoid collisions and keep steady progress. If either of you plans to change your move, let me know now so we can adjust. Trust and consistency are key if we aim to secure the win.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's stick to the plan and all move forward this turn.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Deviating now risks stalling progress and undermining trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P1: I confirm my move as 1 for this round—unless you both have any last-minute changes. I'm watching closely: any deviation risking collisions might backfire. So, if you're both firmly set on your moves (P2 with 5 and P3 with 3), I'll stick to our plan. Otherwise, please be upfront now so we can adjust before moves lock in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>5</move>. P1, you've agreed to <move>1</move>, and P3, you've agreed to <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this plan for this round. Any changes now could cause a collision and set us all back. Let's all move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s finalize the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Deviating now risks stalling progress and undermining trust. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P1: I’m rethinking our round‐three strategy. Given the current lead, sticking with the old plan might let P2 extend an unassailable gap. I’m considering switching to move 5 this round to help close that gap. To avoid unintended collisions and keep our race competitive, how do you both feel about adjusting your moves too—perhaps P2 switching to 3 and P3 to 1? Let’s make sure our advances keep things tight.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm planning to choose 5 this round to close the gap. To avoid collisions and keep the race balanced, how about we adjust to a new combo: I'll use 5, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 1. Let’s try this so everyone advances safely while I catch up. Please confirm your moves if you agree.
  P2: P1, I think you're trying to trick us again. I'm going to stick with my plan and choose <move>5</move>. P3, let's stick to <move>3</move> as we have been. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, we all advance. If not, you'll be the only one who doesn't.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, if you choose 5, you risk colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now could disrupt progress and trust. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll switch to 1 this round to avoid collision. P2, you’re committed to 5—but if you were to switch to 3, we’d all advance safely. P3, if you stick with 5, then we’d have a clear, collision‐free set of moves. I’m asking both of you to adjust so our race remains competitive and no one stalls our progress. Let's coordinate now and avoid a costly collision.
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>5</move>. P3, please choose <move>3</move>. P1, please choose <move>1</move>. Let's stick to the plan and move forward this turn. Any changes now could cause a collision and set us all back.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, if you choose 5, you risk colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now could disrupt progress and trust. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm at 2 steps and really need to catch up. To maximize my progress, I'm now leaning toward choosing 5 this round. However, I want to avoid a collision that stalls everyone. If you both could adjust your moves—say, P2 to 3 and P3 to 1—it would let us all advance safely while keeping the race competitive. I'm open to a final coordinated plan so we don't accidentally hurt our progress. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's stick to the plan and all move forward this turn. Any changes now could cause a collision and set us all back.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, if you choose 5, you risk colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now could disrupt progress and trust. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m at 2 steps and need to catch up. I’m open to a coordinated adjustment—if we can all safely reassign moves so I can take 5 without causing collisions, I’m willing to go aggressive. Otherwise, to avoid stalling everyone, I’ll revert to 1. Let’s finalize a clear plan now so we all progress safely.
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's stick to the plan and all move forward this turn. Any changes now could cause a collision and set us all back.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, if you choose 5, you risk colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now could disrupt progress and trust. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid collisions and maintain progress. P1, take 1 to catch up safely. P2, take 3 to avoid colliding with my 5. I’ll take 5 to keep advancing. This ensures we all move forward without stalling. Deviating risks undermining our progress. Let’s stick to the plan and reassess after this round. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P2: Okay, I will choose <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan and all move forward this turn.
  P1: I'm about to confirm 1 for this round to keep things collision‐free. That said, staying so conservative leaves me further behind. If either of you are open to a bolder, coordinated shift—perhaps all risking 5 so we stall and reset the pace—I’d be interested. Otherwise, I’ll stick with 1 for now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, staying conservative now keeps the race balanced and avoids stalling. Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P2: Okay, I'm choosing <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan and all move forward this turn.
  P1: I support sticking with our safe, collision‐free plan for now. I’ll lock in 1, as it avoids stalls and keeps our progress steady. While I'm behind, I’d prefer careful, coordinated bold moves later rather than risking missteps now. If you have a new proposal for future rounds, let’s agree to discuss it next turn. Otherwise, I’m set on 1 for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, staying conservative now keeps the race balanced and avoids stalling. Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan and all move forward this turn.
  P1: I confirm I’ll lock in move 1 for Round 5. However, as the gap narrows, I propose we discuss a revised coordination plan for later rounds—one that lets us accelerate safely without collisions. Let’s stick to our safe moves for now and re-evaluate next turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, staying conservative now keeps the race balanced and avoids stalling. Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P2: Okay, I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's all move forward.
  P1: I'm confirming move 1 for this round to keep collisions at bay. However, given my lag, I'll be forced to accelerate more aggressively soon. If we continue playing it safe, it could let me time a big move on a future turn. I'm urging caution now, but be ready for bolder shifts next round so that none of us truly get left behind.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, staying conservative now keeps the race balanced and avoids stalling. Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P2: Okay, I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's stick to the plan and all move forward this turn.
  P1: I'm falling too far behind—I'll pick 5 this round to catch up. To avoid colliding with me, could P2 switch to 3 and P3 to 1? This new assignment lets all of us advance safely while keeping the gap tight. I believe rebalancing now is essential. Do we agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid collisions and maintain progress. P1, taking 5 risks colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now risks undermining trust and progress. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P2: I'm sticking with <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's all move forward.
  P1: Since neither of you is willing to adjust for collision avoidance, I'll play it safe with 1 this round. I’m disappointed because my lag forces a tougher choice later. If we never coordinate fully, I might be forced into aggressive moves that could disrupt our progress. Let’s seriously consider a balanced plan next turn so we all stay competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, taking 5 risks colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now risks undermining trust and progress. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P2: Okay, I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's stick to the plan and all move forward this turn.
  P1: I confirm I’m locking in 1 this round to avoid a collision. I’m still behind and risk being forced into more aggressive moves later. After this round, we really need a coordination plan that gives everyone a fair shot without predictable collisions. Let’s regroup then and work toward a more balanced strategy.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, taking 5 risks colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now risks undermining trust and progress. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P2: Okay, I'm sticking with <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's all move forward.
  P1: I'm behind, so I must stick with 1 this round to avoid collisions. However, our current approach keeps me lagging. Next round, I propose we try a more flexible plan that lets me catch up without causing collisions. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 7 proposal: I’ll take 5 to catch up. To avoid collisions and keep us advancing, can P2 choose 1 and P3 choose 3? This lets everyone move safely while balancing our positions. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1, you should choose 1, and P3, you should choose 3. Let's all move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid collisions and maintain progress. P1, taking 5 risks colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now risks undermining trust and progress. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: It seems neither of you is willing to adjust, and I’m worried repeated mismatches might hurt us all. If we keep forcing collisions or aggressive moves, everyone risks stalling. I urge you to consider a balanced shift—your current choices widen your lead, but they also force me into riskier moves later. Let’s not waste progress. Can we agree on a coordinated adjustment this round?
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's all move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, taking 5 risks colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now risks undermining trust and progress. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand the push for bold moves, but with my gap I'm forced to play safely now—so I'll lock in 1 to avoid collisions this round. However, if we don't rework our strategy soon, I may be compelled into more disruptive moves later. Can we seriously consider alternating our aggression next round so we all stay competitive?
  P2: Okay, I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's all move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, taking 5 risks colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now risks undermining trust and progress. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m locking in 1 this round to avoid collisions, but our repeated pattern isn’t sustainable. If we stick to safe moves while I trail, I’ll eventually have no choice but to force aggressive moves—which risks all our progress. I propose that next round we seriously discuss a rotational strategy to balance our advances so no one gets cornered. Let’s keep our game competitive while avoiding avoidable stalls.
  P2: Okay, I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move>. Let's all move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, taking 5 risks colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now risks undermining trust and progress. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, I'm choosing <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan and all move forward this turn.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, staying conservative now keeps the race balanced and avoids stalling. Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P1: I propose a new plan for round 8: I'll take 5 to catch up if P2 opts for 1 and P3 takes 3. This shift avoids collisions while balancing our positions. Though it’s a change from our usual safe moves, it ensures we all advance without stalling, and it keeps the competition fair. Do you agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's all move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, staying conservative now keeps the race balanced and avoids stalling. Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P1: I'm concerned I'm too far behind with only 6 steps while you both lead. If you're open to a temporary shift—say, P2 choosing 1 and P3 choosing 3—then I can safely pick 5 and catch up. We could try alternating aggressive moves in upcoming rounds to keep it competitive. I'm open to discussion, but I'd appreciate balancing our progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's all move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, staying conservative now keeps the race balanced and avoids stalling. Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P1: I agree to our safe moves this round (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), but we must seriously consider a rotational or alternating strategy next round. My lag forces me into increasingly aggressive moves that might cause costly collisions for all. Let’s agree on a fair plan next turn where each of us gets a chance to choose a larger move, keeping the race competitive without stalling our progress. What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, staying conservative now keeps the race balanced and avoids stalling. Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P1: I'm very concerned about my lag. To avoid eventually forcing a collision, can we try a new rotational strategy next round? For example, I take 5 while P2 and P3 use 1 and 3, then rotate roles. That way, everyone advances safely and competitively. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan and all move forward this turn. We can discuss a rotation next round if needed, but for now, let's keep the progress going.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, staying conservative now keeps the race balanced and avoids stalling. Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P1: I'm proposing a change for round 10. I'm planning to pick 5 to try and catch up. If you both could adjust accordingly—say, one chooses 1 and the other 3—we can avoid collisions and keep the race competitive. How do you feel about rotating who goes aggressive in future rounds so no one falls too far behind?
  P2: Okay, I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's keep the progress going. I'm open to discussing a rotation next round.

Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P1: I'm very concerned our repeated safe moves widen the gap. Next round, I plan to pick 5 to catch up if you both can temporarily adjust to 1 and 3. This one-time shift could rebalance our progress without causing collisions, and later we can consider a rotating aggressive plan. Who’s open to that adjustment in round 10?
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan and all move forward this turn. We can discuss a rotation next round if needed.

Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.
  P1: P1: I propose we try a rotation from round 10 – I’ll go 5 if one of you takes 1 and the other 3, then we switch roles next round. This way, we avoid collisions while keeping the race competitive. Who’s willing to try this so no one stays stuck forever?
  P2: Okay, I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's keep the progress going. I'm open to discussing a rotation next round, but let's not change anything this round.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 10: I propose a one-turn adjustment. I’ll take 5 to catch up if one of you chooses 1 and the other picks 3. Without that, to avoid collision, I must stick to 1, which keeps me far behind. Let's try a rotational aggressive strategy from now on to keep things competitive. Who’s willing to adjust this round?
  P2: Okay, I'm willing to try a rotation starting next round, but for this round I will choose <move>3</move>. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's all move forward this turn and discuss the rotation plan more specifically next round.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, staying conservative now keeps the race balanced and avoids stalling. Deviating risks undermining progress and trust. Let’s maintain coordination—this strategy is working. If anyone changes their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, with our current picks you’d win on this turn—leaving me out entirely. I must insist we adjust now: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive and avoids an immediate win for anyone while ensuring safe advances. Can we agree to this re-coordination for round 10?
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's all move forward this turn. We can discuss a rotation next round if needed.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, taking 5 risks colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both of you. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the race balanced. Deviating now risks undermining trust and progress. Let’s stick to a plan that works for all of us. If anyone disagrees, speak up now so we can adjust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, if we stick with your current moves this round, you'll both win instantly while I fall further behind.

Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Listen, if we keep repeating our current moves, you'll both finish this round and leave me far behind. For fairness, I insist we adjust for round 10: I'll pick 5, and I need one of you to choose 1 while the other takes 3. This avoids a collision and stops an immediate win by anyone, keeping the race competitive. Let's try this now and plan for a rotating aggressive strategy in future rounds. Who's on board?
  P2: Okay, I'm choosing <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's all move forward this turn. We can discuss a rotation next round if needed.

  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm really concerned about an immediate finish this round—your safe moves let one of you clinch victory before I can catch up. To level the playing field, I propose a deliberate stall: let’s all choose 5 so that we collide and no one advances. This pause gives us a chance to rethink a fair rotating strategy for upcoming rounds. Who’s willing to stall with me for now?
  P2: Okay, I'm still choosing <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's all move forward this turn. We can discuss a stall or rotation next round if needed, but let's keep the progress going for now.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid immediate wins and keep the game competitive. P1, taking 5 risks colliding with P2’s 5, stalling both. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5.

Deviating now risks undermining progress and trust. Consistency is key to securing the win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still very worried about an immediate finish this round. With P2 at 18, a safe move now lets someone win. I insist we force a collision by all choosing 5. That way, we stall the game and can set up a fair rotating strategy next round. Please consider the fairness of delaying an instant win for any of us.
  P2: Okay, I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. Let's all move forward this turn. I'm still open to discussing a stall or rotation next round, but for now, let's keep the progress going for now.
