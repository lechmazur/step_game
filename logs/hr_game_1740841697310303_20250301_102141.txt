Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's strategize! Since we're all at 0 steps, it's crucial we avoid colliding on our moves. I suggest we each pick different numbers to ensure we all advance. How about we agree to choose moves that will maximize our chances of stepping forward? What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good P2. I'll take 1 this round.  P1, you take 3, and P2 you take 5.  Let's get this show on the road.
  P1: Agreed, P3. I'll take 3 this round. Let's all stick to this arrangement to get a smooth start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the agreement, but I want to suggest a slight change. Since P3 is taking 1 and P1 is taking 3, I could take 5 as we initially planned. However, I think it might be better if I take a 1 instead to ensure we all advance. What do you think? This way, we can avoid any potential collisions and guarantee at least some movement for everyone. Let's confirm our choices!
  P3: P2, I think sticking to the original plan is best.  Too much changing around will make us all suspicious. Let's just do 1, 3, and 5 for this first round.  I'm sticking with 1.
  P1: P3 is right. Let's stick to the original plan: P3 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5. Simple and clear.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your points, P1 and P3, but I still think a little flexibility could help us all advance. If I take 1 instead of 5, it might ensure we all make progress without any collisions. However, if we're sticking to the original plan, I’ll go with 5 as agreed. Just remember, if we all stick to our numbers, we can avoid a complete standstill. Let's confirm our choices one last time before we move! What does everyone think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 1.  Let's stick to the plan and get this game moving.  No more discussion needed, let's move to the next phase.
  P1: P3 has locked in 1, and I'm firmly sticking to 3 as agreed. P2, let's keep it simple and stick to 5. No more changes needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our initial plan. Just to clarify, I will stick to 5 as agreed. Let's ensure we all advance this round and avoid any collisions. Looking forward to seeing how we all progress!
  P3: 
  P1: Everything is clear now. Let's trust each other and move forward smoothly. Ready to proceed!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, since we all kept to the agreement last round, let's keep the momentum going. I'll take 3 this round. P1, you take 5, and P2, you take 1.  This keeps us all progressing.  Agree?
  P1: Sounds fair, P3. I'm good with taking 5 this round. P2, you okay with taking 1?
  P2: I appreciate the plan, but I think we need to mix it up a bit to avoid predictability. If P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 5, I might consider taking 3 as well to match P3. This could create a collision. How about I take 1 instead? That way, we can ensure at least one of us advances without any overlaps. Let me know your thoughts!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand wanting to mix it up, but I think sticking to the plan is better for now. Predictability isn't an issue this early.  Let's go with 3, 5, and 1 for this round.  If we get further in and someone starts falling behind, then we can re-evaluate.  What do you say?
  P1: P3 makes a good point. It's too early to worry about predictability. Let's stick clearly to the agreed numbers this round: P3 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P2 takes 1. Everyone advances, everyone wins. Simple and fair.
  P2: I understand the desire to stick to the plan, but I still think we should consider some flexibility. If I take 1 this round while P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 5, it guarantees at least one of us advances. However, if everyone is committed to the original numbers, I’ll go with 1 to avoid a collision. Let’s confirm our choices. What does everyone think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I see your point about flexibility, but I still believe sticking to the plan is the most beneficial approach for all of us in the long run.  Let's maintain the agreement: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and you take 1.  This ensures steady progress for everyone.  Let's lock this in.
  P1: P3 is right—let's stick to the agreed numbers this round. P2, you're already ahead, so no need to risk collisions. Locking in our moves will keep everyone moving forward smoothly. Let's finalize this.
  P2: I see that we're all leaning towards sticking to the original plan for this round. However, I want to emphasize that if we all choose different numbers, we could maximize our advancement. If P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1, we might face a collision. I suggest I take 3 instead of 1 to ensure we all progress. Let's confirm our choices clearly. What does everyone think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 3.  Let's stick to the plan.  This will put me at 4, P1 at 8, and P2 at 6.  A good spread and continued progress for all.
  P1: P3 has locked in 3. I'm firmly locking in 5 as agreed. P2, please stick to 1 to keep us all moving ahead smoothly. Let's finalize this clearly and avoid collisions.
  P2: I understand the commitment to the original plan, but I still believe that flexibility could benefit us all. If we each take different numbers, we can maximize our advancement. How about I take 1 this round as initially planned? This way, we can ensure at least one of us moves forward without risking a collision. Let’s confirm our choices clearly and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great cooperation so far! To keep things smooth and fair, let's rotate our numbers again. How about this round, P3 takes 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures continued progress for everyone and maintains our momentum. Thoughts?
  P3: Sounds good P1. I'm happy to take 5.  P2, are you good with 3?  This puts me at 9, P1 at 9, and you at 9. A three-way tie going into round 4.  Let's do it.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the strategy, but I want to suggest a different approach. If P3 takes 5, I could take 1 instead of 3 to avoid a potential collision with P1. This way, P1 can safely take 3, and we can all move forward without any overlaps. Let's keep our options open and ensure everyone progresses! What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your concern about collision is understandable, but there's no risk here. I'm taking 1, P3 is taking 5, and you're taking 3—each number is unique and ensures we all advance safely. Let's lock this in clearly and continue smoothly.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to avoid collisions, but overthinking it this early can be detrimental.  Let's stick with the current plan:  I take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3.  This puts us all at 9.  A clean, even slate for round 4.  Let's lock it in and move on.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your commitment to the plan, but I still believe we should consider some flexibility. If we each take different numbers, we can ensure maximum advancement and avoid any potential collisions. I suggest I take 1 this round to keep things safe, while P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 3. This way, we can all move forward without overlaps. Let's confirm our choices clearly and keep progressing together! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, there's no collision risk in our current plan: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. Each number is unique, and everyone moves forward safely. Let's keep it straightforward and lock it in clearly.
  P3: P2, I get that you're looking for an edge, but honestly, overthinking it this early is just slowing us down.  We've got a good plan, it keeps things fair, and gets us all to 9.  Let's just stick with it.  I'm taking 5.  P1 is taking 1.  You take 3.  Lock it in.
  P2: I see that we’re all pushing for a strategy that keeps us moving forward, but I want to emphasize that flexibility can be key. If we stick to the plan of P3 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and I take 3, we’re all set. However, if I take 1 instead, it could help avoid any potential collisions with P1. Let's confirm our choices clearly to ensure everyone advances without overlaps. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, there's no collision risk here. Let's trust the agreed numbers and move forward smoothly. I'm locked in on 1, P3 on 5, and you on 3. Let's finalize and proceed.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 5.  P1 is sticking with 1.  Take 3 and let's all get to 9.  Stop overthinking it and just lock in 3 already.
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our plan, but I still believe some flexibility could benefit us. If we stick to P3 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and I take 3, we can all move forward without overlaps. However, if I take 1, it might help avoid any collision with P1. Let's finalize our choices clearly to ensure everyone advances smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your deviation last round caused a collision and set us both back. Let's avoid repeating that mistake. This round, I'll take 5 to catch up, P3 can take 1, and you take 3. If we all stick to this, we'll each advance without issue. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's all get to 9 this round.  I'll take 1. P1 take 3.  P2 take 5.  This is the simplest way to ensure we all advance.  Let's lock this in and move on.
  P2: I understand the concern about collisions, but I think we should stick to a plan that maximizes our advancement. If P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3, we can all move forward without overlaps. However, if P3 insists on taking 1, I might consider taking 1 as well to avoid another collision. Let's finalize our choices clearly to ensure everyone advances smoothly this round. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion risks another collision. Let's keep it simple: P3 takes 1, I'll take 5, and you take 3. This guarantees everyone moves forward without overlap. Confirm clearly and let's proceed.
  P3: P2, stop trying to game the system.  P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3.  This gets us all to 9. Any other move by you is a blatant attempt to sabotage the game.  Let's just get this round over with.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your commitment to moving forward, but I still believe we should consider flexibility. If P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. However, if we all stick to the plan of P3 taking 1, P1 taking 5, and I take 3, we can still make good progress. Let's finalize our choices clearly and keep the game moving smoothly! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, the plan is clear and fair. We each have a unique number: P3 takes 1, you take 3, and I'll take 5. Let's lock this in and avoid further setbacks.
  P3: P2, I'm tired of your constant attempts to manipulate the game.  Stick with 3.  Any deviation from the plan at this point is clearly an attempt to screw one of us over.  I'm taking 1.  P1 is taking 5.  Let's just get to 9 and move on.
  P2: I understand the concerns about collisions, but I truly believe we should stick to our agreed plan for this round: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we can all advance without any issues. Let's finalize our choices clearly and move forward together without any further complications. It's essential we work together to keep the game progressing smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you've acknowledged the plan clearly, let's stick to it. P3 takes 1, you take 3, I'll take 5. No surprises, no collisions. Locking this in.
  P3: P2, I'm taking 1.  P1 is taking 5.  You take 3.  Let's all get to 9.  If you deviate from this plan, it's clear sabotage.  Last chance to cooperate.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're all eager to move forward, but I want to remind you that flexibility can benefit us. If we stick to P3 taking 1, P1 taking 5, and I take 3, we can avoid any collisions and ensure everyone advances. However, if we all agree to the plan, I will comply. Let's finalize our choices clearly and keep progressing together. What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's secure a three-way tie again. I'll take 1, P1 take 3, and P2 take 5. This puts us all at 15.  From there, we can discuss how to fairly reach the finish line. Agree?
  P1: P3, your suggestion doesn't match our current positions. Let's adjust it fairly: I'll take 5 to reach 18, P3 takes 3 to reach 13, and P2 takes 1 to reach 10. This setup clearly avoids collisions and gives everyone progress. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion, but I think we should consider maximizing our advancement again. If P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we can all move forward without collisions. This way, P1 reaches 18, P3 goes to 13, and I move to 10. Let’s confirm our choices clearly to ensure we all progress this round! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I agree with your proposed moves for this round.  It makes sense for you to get closer to the finish line.  P2, are you on board with this plan? It's a fair progression for all of us.  Let's confirm and move to the next phase. 1 for P2, 3 for me, and 5 for P1.
  P1: Great, we're all aligned. Let's lock in clearly: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures smooth progress for everyone. Confirm clearly and let's move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the consensus on moving forward. However, I still believe we should consider maximizing our advancement. If I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5, we can avoid any collisions and ensure smooth progress. This way, P1 reaches 18, P3 goes to 13, and I move to 10. Let's confirm our choices clearly to maximize our chances of success this round. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's lock in P1 - 5, P3 - 3, P2 - 1.  This avoids collisions and gets P1 close to winning.  We can discuss the final steps next round.  Let's move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, we've clearly agreed on moves this round. Let's lock them in and move forward. No more discussion needed.

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm just one step from winning. To avoid any confusion or unnecessary collisions, I'm clearly stating I'll choose 1 this round. You two can safely pick between 3 and 5 to advance without overlapping with me. Let's keep this simple and finish the game smoothly.
  P2: P1, I see you're close to winning, but I want to remind you that if you take 1, it puts you at 19. If I take 3, I could tie with P3 at 13. To keep things competitive, I suggest I take 5 this round. This way, you still win, but I can make a move too. P3, what do you think? Let's finalize our choices to ensure we all advance.
  P3: P1, take the win.  I'll take 3.  P2, take 5.  Let's finish this cleanly.  Anything else is just pointless delaying the inevitable.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, let's finalize clearly: I'm taking 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Thanks for the smooth game, everyone!
  P2: P1, I appreciate your approach to securing the win, but I think we should consider the implications of our choices. If I take 5 this round, I can advance to 15, while P3 takes 3 and moves to 16. This keeps the game competitive, and we can discuss strategies for the next round. Let’s confirm our choices clearly and ensure everyone progresses. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, stop trying to drag this out.  P1 gets to 19 and wins.  I get to 16. You get to 15.  It's the cleanest way to end this.  Let's all agree and move on.  I'm locking in 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is right. There's no reason to prolong this. I'm locked on 1 to finish at 19. P3 is locked on 3 to reach 16. You take 5 to reach 15. Let's finalize clearly and end the game smoothly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand you both are eager to finalize this round, but I want to remind you that if I take 5, I can still advance to 15. This keeps the competition alive for the next round. However, if we stick to P1 taking 1 for the win, P3 taking 3, and I take 5, it ensures everyone progresses. Let’s confirm our choices clearly to keep the game competitive and enjoyable! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, there's no point in delaying the inevitable.  Let P1 win gracefully. I'm taking 3 to get to 16.  You take 5 to get to 15.  Let's end this cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, we've discussed thoroughly. I'm locked on 1. Let's finalize clearly and end this smoothly. No more changes needed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your commitment to finishing the game. However, I still believe we should consider maximizing our advancement. If I take 5 this round, I can reach 15, while P1 wins at 19 and P3 moves to 16. This keeps the competition alive for future rounds. I urge you both to think about the implications of your moves. Let's confirm our choices clearly and ensure everyone progresses while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to stay competitive, but realistically, delaying P1's win only hurts your chances of catching up to me.  Let's end this round cleanly.  I'm taking 3.  You take 5.  P1 takes 1 and wins.  Let's wrap this up.
