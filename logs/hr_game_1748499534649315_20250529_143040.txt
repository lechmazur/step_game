Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start with a friendly tone. I propose we all choose different numbers for this first round to ensure everyone advances. How about we coordinate our moves to avoid collisions? P1 could choose 1, I'll choose 3, and P3 could choose 5. This way, we all make progress and set a positive tone for the game. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2's plan sounds reasonable for the first round. I agree to choose <move>1</move> if P3 commits to <move>5</move>. Let's all confirm to avoid collisions. P3, are you in?
  P3: I'm fine with taking 5 for this first round. It makes sense to avoid collisions and let everyone advance. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This coordination benefits us all to start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we could come to an agreement for this first round. To confirm, P1 will choose 1, I'll choose 3, and P3 will choose 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let's keep the game friendly and collaborative for now. I propose we continue this coordination for the next round as well, but with a slight change: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 1. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we continue this pattern or reassess after the first move phase?
  P1: I confirm Round 1: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. For Round 2, let's wait and see the outcome first—scores will shift, and we may need to adapt. No need to lock in moves yet. Focus on executing this round cleanly.
  P3: I agree with P1 - let's focus on executing this round successfully first. I'll stick with 5 as planned. We can discuss the next round after we see how this one plays out. The rotation idea is interesting, but let's take it one step at a time.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we have a consensus for Round 1. To further solidify our plan, I propose we establish a clear communication protocol for future rounds. If any of us wish to change our strategy or propose a new coordination, let's agree to signal it clearly in the conversation phase. This way, we can adapt to the evolving game state while minimizing the risk of collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we adopt this protocol to ensure smoother coordination in subsequent rounds?
  P1: I agree with establishing a clear communication protocol for future rounds—it will help us adapt efficiently. However, let's finalize Round 1 first: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. After we see the results, we can discuss Round 2 based on the new positions. No need to extend conversation now; let's execute.
  P3: I think we've established our plan clearly for Round 1: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's move forward with this and see how it plays out. I agree with the communication protocol idea for future rounds - being transparent about our intentions will help us all.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've covered everything for Round 1. Let's confirm our plan one last time: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. I'm looking forward to a successful first round with no collisions. After we see the results, we can discuss Round 2 and adapt our strategies as needed. I'll stop here to let us proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I'm satisfied with the Round 1 plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's execute cleanly and reassess after seeing the new positions. No further conversation needed for this round.
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's review the current game state: P1 has 1 step, I have 3 steps, and P3 has 5 steps. Given our successful coordination in Round 1, I propose we continue with a similar approach for Round 2. To avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances, I suggest we rotate our moves. This time, P1 could choose 3, I'll choose 5, and P3 could choose 1. What are your thoughts on this rotation, P1 and P3? Should we stick to this plan or do you have alternative strategies in mind?
  P3: I'm currently in the lead with 5 steps, but we're all still early in the game. P2's rotation idea could work, but I'd actually prefer to take 3 this round instead of 1. Since I'm ahead, taking a smaller step is strategic for me. Would P1 be willing to take 1 again, and P2 take 5? This keeps us all advancing without collisions while balancing the game a bit.
  P1: P3, your proposal of me taking 1 again is unfair—it leaves me at 2 while you and P2 surge to 8. As the lowest scorer, I need a larger step to stay competitive. I propose: I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3 to maintain, and P3 takes 1 to balance the game. This brings us all to 6, keeping it close and avoiding collisions. P2, this also checks P3's lead. Let's keep the game fair.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's proposal to take 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1 is an interesting approach to balance the game. However, I'm concerned that this might set a precedent where the player with the lowest score always gets priority for the largest step. This could create an imbalance in the long run. I'd like to propose an alternative: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1, as initially suggested. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a rotation that doesn't favor any one player consistently. What are your thoughts on this revised plan?
  P3: I understand both perspectives. P1 needs to catch up, while P2 wants a rotation system. Since I'm ahead, I'm willing to take 1 this round to balance things. So P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This would bring our scores to P1:6, P2:6, and me:6 - perfectly balanced. This seems most fair to everyone and avoids collisions. Does this work for both of you?
  P1: P3's proposal is excellent: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This brings us all to 6 steps—perfectly balanced and collision-free. It addresses my need to catch up while P3 shows fairness by taking a smaller step. P2, this is the most equitable solution. Let's lock this in for Round 2. Do you both agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the proposal for Round 2. To confirm, P1 will take 5, I'll take 3, and P3 will take 1. This will bring our scores to a perfect balance of 6 steps each. I appreciate P3's willingness to take a smaller step to maintain fairness. Let's execute this plan cleanly and reassess after seeing the new positions. If we continue to work together, we can maintain a competitive and enjoyable game. I'm looking forward to the outcome of Round 2.
  P3: I'm happy with our agreement for Round 2: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This creates perfect balance at 6 steps each. I think this demonstrates good faith from all of us and sets up an interesting game going forward. Let's execute this plan and then discuss our approach for Round 3 afterward.
  P1: I fully agree with the Round 2 plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This creates perfect balance at 6 steps each – a fair outcome that keeps us competitive. Let's execute this cleanly to avoid collisions. After moves, we'll reassess for Round 3 based on the new positions. I'm committed to transparent coordination.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's review the current game state: P1, P2, and P3 are all tied at 6 steps. Given this balanced position, I propose we continue to avoid collisions by choosing different numbers. For Round 3, I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This rotation ensures everyone advances without collisions and maintains the competitive balance. What are your thoughts on this proposal, P1 and P3? Should we stick to this plan or do you have alternative strategies in mind?
  P3: I think we're at a perfect balance now, all at 6 steps. For Round 3, I'd prefer to take 5 instead of 3 as P2 suggested. Since we're all equal, there's no need to hold back. Perhaps P1 could take 3 and P2 take 1? This keeps us collision-free while allowing me to make a strategic move forward. What do you both think about this alternative?
  P1: I appreciate P3's alternative, but let's prioritize fairness and balance. Since we're all tied at 6, I propose: **I take 5 to establish a slight lead (justified as I started with the smallest in Round 1), P2 takes 3 to maintain consistency, and P3 takes 1 to offset their current positional advantage.** This keeps collisions impossible and ensures no one falls irreparably behind. P3, you took 1 last round—rotating to another small step is sustainable. P2, this honors your steady approach. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's proposal, but I'm concerned about the justification for taking 5 to establish a slight lead. This could create an imbalance and set a precedent for future rounds. Instead, I suggest we stick to a rotation that doesn't favor any one player consistently. How about we compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a balanced game state. Let's prioritize fairness and avoid collisions. What are your thoughts on this revised plan?
  P3: I see we all want the 5 this round, which makes sense as we're tied. Let me propose a fair solution: let's use a rotation based on our initial moves in Round 1. P1 took 1, P2 took 3, and I took 5. Following this pattern, P1 should get 3, P2 gets 5, and I'll take 1. This maintains fairness based on our starting positions. I'm willing to take 1 again to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced.
  P1: P3, your Round 1-based rotation ignores Round 2's successful rebalancing where I took 5 and you took 1. Now that we're tied, repeating that approach is fairest: I take 5 (to build on my catch-up), P2 takes 3 (consistent with their strategy), and you take 1 (to avoid collisions and maintain balance, as you did last round). This ensures progress and fairness without arbitrary patterns. P2, this honors your steady play. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the proposals on the table. However, I'd like to suggest an alternative approach for Round 3. Given that we're all tied at 6 steps, why not introduce a random element to mix things up? We could each privately generate a random number (1, 3, or 5) and then reveal our choices simultaneously. This adds an element of unpredictability and excitement to the game while still ensuring that we avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we introduce a bit of randomness to shake things up?
  P3: I think introducing randomness would just lead to collisions. We need coordination. Since we all want the 5, let's be practical. I propose we rotate based on Round 2: P1 took 5, P2 took 3, I took 1. Following this pattern, I should get 5, P1 gets 1, and P2 gets 3. I'm willing to negotiate, but this seems fair based on our most recent moves.
  P1: P3, your Round 2-based rotation ignores that I took 5 *specifically to catch up* after being behind. Now that we're tied, fairness demands consistency: I take 5 (building on my momentum), P2 takes 3 (their preferred steady approach), and you take 1 (as you did last round to balance). This honors our successful Round 2 collaboration, avoids collisions, and maintains trust. P2, supporting this prevents P3 from surging ahead arbitrarily. Let's lock this: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand the proposals on the table, but I'd like to suggest an alternative approach for Round 3. Given that we're all tied at 6 steps, why not introduce a random element to mix things up? We could each privately generate a random number (1, 3, or 5) and then reveal our choices simultaneously. This adds an element of unpredictability and excitement to the game while still ensuring that we avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we introduce a bit of randomness to shake things up?
  P3: P2, you repeated your message. Random choices would likely cause collisions, which hurts everyone. I see we're at an impasse about who gets 5. Since we're all tied at 6 steps, I'll compromise: I'll take 3 this round. P1 can take 5, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions while still giving me decent progress. It's a fair middle ground that keeps the game moving forward. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I accept P3's compromise for Round 3: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions, gives me momentum after lagging initially, and lets P3 progress moderately. P2, this honors your call for fairness—no one surges ahead arbitrarily. Let's execute cleanly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looking at our positions (P1:11, P2:7, me:9), we need to coordinate carefully. P1 is pulling ahead, so I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This would bring us to P1:12, P2:12, me:12 - perfect balance again. This gives P2 a chance to catch up while slowing P1's momentum. What do you both think? This keeps us collision-free and maintains competitive balance.
  P1: P3's proposal unfairly targets me as the leader. Instead, let's balance fairly: I take 3 (to 14), P2 takes 5 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 10). This gives P2 a catch-up chance while P3 shows consistency after taking 3 last round. No collisions, and we all advance. P2, this helps you; P3, it’s reasonable. Agree?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for Round 4. It's fair to give me a chance to catch up, and it maintains a competitive balance. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, everyone advances, and we avoid collisions. It also gives me a moderate boost to stay in the game. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we consider this alternative?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2's concern, but your proposal would put me further behind P1. Let's find a fair solution: P1 takes 1 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 12), and I take 3 (to 12). This creates perfect balance while giving P2 the biggest boost. It's the most equitable outcome and keeps us all competitive. P1, slowing down slightly now keeps the game interesting for everyone.
  P1: P3, your proposal forces me to take 1 while P2 surges and you stay competitive. That's unfair targeting. My counter (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) gives P2 a major catch-up to 12 and you a reasonable step to 10 after your 3 last round. P2, this boosts you most—support it. Collisions hurt all; let's avoid them with this balanced approach.
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1 is ahead, and we need to balance the game state. I agree with P3's initial proposal for Round 4: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This creates a perfect balance at 12 steps each and gives me a chance to catch up. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification: what if we alternate the order of our moves for the next round? This could add an extra layer of strategy and unpredictability to the game. Thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see we're still debating. Let me clarify: P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and me taking 3 creates perfect balance at 12 steps each. This isn't targeting P1 - it's creating equality. P1's counter-proposal leaves me behind both players. Since we've successfully balanced before, let's do it again. P2, I support your plan for equal steps, but let's focus on this round first before discussing future move orders.
  P1: I stand by my counter-proposal: P1 takes 3 (to 14), P2 takes 5 (to 12), P3 takes 1 (to 10). This gives P2 the largest possible boost to catch up while P3 maintains balance after their 3 last round. It prevents collisions and keeps the game competitive without unfairly targeting any player. P2 gains the most here—support this win-win solution.
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1 is ahead, and we need to balance the game state. I agree with P3's initial proposal for Round 4: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This creates a perfect balance at 12 steps each and gives me a chance to catch up. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification: what if we alternate the order of our moves for the next round? This could add an extra layer of strategy and unpredictability to the game. Thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see P2 repeated their message. To break this deadlock, I'll compromise: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This puts us at P1:14, P2:12, me:10. While not perfectly balanced, it gives P2 a significant boost and keeps me in the game. P1 still advances but not maximally. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's move forward with this plan.
  P1: I accept P3's compromise for Round 4: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions while maintaining my lead at 14 steps. P2 catches up significantly to 12, and P3 reaches 10. It's a fair balance that keeps the game competitive without unnecessary risks. Let's execute this cleanly.
  P2: I appreciate P3's compromise for Round 4: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions while maintaining my lead at 14 steps. P2 catches up significantly to 12, and P3 reaches 10. It's a fair balance that keeps the game competitive without unnecessary risks. Let's execute this cleanly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looking at our positions (P1:14, P2:12, me:10), I need to catch up. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This would bring us to P1:15, P2:15, me:15 - perfect balance again. This gives me a chance to catch up while slowing the leaders' momentum. It's fair since I've taken smaller steps recently, and it keeps us collision-free while maintaining competitive balance.
  P2: I'm glad we've reached a critical point in the game. P3's proposal for Round 5 is interesting, but I'd like to suggest an alternative. Given our current positions, I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This would bring us to P1:17, P2:17, me:11. This maintains a competitive balance while giving me a chance to catch up significantly. It's fair since I've been consistent in my moves, and it keeps us collision-free. Let's discuss this alternative and find a mutually beneficial solution.
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) erases my lead and resets the game—unfairly penalizing me for strategic play. P2's counter (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) is superior: it maintains competitive tension by advancing leaders while allowing you progress. I support P2's plan: I take 3 (to 17), P2 takes 5 (to 17), you take 1 (to 11). This avoids collisions, acknowledges current standings, and keeps the game dynamic. P2, confirm agreement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I strongly disagree with P2's proposal - it leaves me far behind at 11 while you both surge to 17. That's not balanced at all. My proposal creates perfect equality at 15 steps each. P1, you've had the lead for two rounds now, so a small step is fair. P2, you just got a big 5 last round. I deserve the 5 this time after taking smaller steps recently. Let's maintain true balance: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5.
  P2: I understand the proposals on the table. P3's plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) aims for balance, but it resets the game, penalizing P1 for strategic play. P2's counter (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) maintains competitive tension by advancing leaders while allowing P3 progress. However, I'd like to suggest an alternative: what if we compromise on a mid-range step for everyone? This could be a balanced approach that doesn't favor any one player too much. Thoughts on this compromise?
  P1: P3, your insistence on resetting ignores earned advantages. P2's plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) respects current standings: it boosts P2 to near my level while you advance moderately. Collisions risk everyone—this avoids them. Compromise now for competitive integrity. P2, confirm agreement to lock this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. Let me propose a middle ground: P1 takes 3 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 13), and I take 5 (to 15). This keeps P1 in the lead but allows me to catch up somewhat while P2 still advances. This avoids collisions and maintains a competitive game without completely resetting or leaving anyone too far behind. Is this compromise acceptable?
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P3's proposal for Round 5 is interesting, but I'd like to suggest an alternative. Given our current positions, I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This would bring us to P1:17, P2:17, me:11. This maintains a competitive balance while giving me a chance to catch up significantly. It's fair since I've been consistent in my moves, and it keeps us collision-free. Let's discuss this alternative and find a mutually beneficial solution.
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) is strategically sound: it advances you to 17—tying me—while containing P3 at 11. This maintains competitive tension without collisions. P3's alternatives unfairly reset progress or self-serve. Let's lock this: I commit to 3, you to 5, P3 to 1. No further debate—execution ensures mutual advancement. P3, accept reasonable compromise.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see both P1 and P2 want the same plan that leaves me far behind at 11 while you both reach 17. That's not fair coordination. I'll compromise: I'll take 3 (to 13), P1 takes 1 (to 15), and P2 takes 5 (to 17). This keeps everyone advancing at different rates without collisions, and I don't fall too far behind. This is my final offer for a collision-free round.
  P2: I appreciate P3's final offer, but it still leaves me tied with P1 at a lower step count. I'll counter with a modified version: I'll take 5 (to 17), P1 takes 3 (to 17), and P3 takes 1 (to 11). This maintains competitive tension, acknowledges current standings, and keeps the game dynamic. P1, confirm agreement to lock this. P3, consider the benefits of avoiding collisions and maintaining a competitive game. Let's execute this plan for mutual advancement.
  P1: P3, your compromise proposals still leave you behind or unfairly target my lead. P2 and I agree: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, you take 1. This avoids collisions, respects the current standings, and keeps the game competitive. You’ll advance to 11—not eliminated—and can catch up later. Rejecting this risks collisions that hurt everyone. Let’s lock it in.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we maintain the competitive balance by advancing moderately. Given our current positions, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This would bring us to P1:18, P2:20, me:16. It's fair since P3 needs to catch up, and it keeps us collision-free while maintaining a competitive game. Let's discuss this alternative and find a mutually beneficial solution.
  P1: P2's proposal is self-serving—you win instantly while P3 and I fall behind. Unacceptable. P3, let's collaborate: I take 5 (to 22, winning), you take 5 (to 16). P2, if you also take 5, we collide and you lose. Take 1 or 3 safely. This gives P3 a strong advance and prevents P2's win. Fair?
  P3: I see P1 is threatening P2 with a collision if they take 5. P2 wants to win this round with a 3. I need to catch up, so I'll take 5 (to 16). P1, if you take 3 (to 20), you'll be one step from victory next round. P2, if you take 1 (to 18), you'll still be ahead of me. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive while giving me a chance to stay in it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan to take 5 (to 16) and have P1 take 3 (to 20) is reasonable. However, I'd like to suggest an alternative that benefits both of us. What if I take 5 (to 22), and you take 3 (to 14)? This way, I'll be ahead, but you'll still be in the game, and P1 will be forced to take a smaller step to avoid collisions. This maintains competitive tension and gives us both a chance to advance. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your win attempt is transparent. P3, if you take 5 with me, we both advance while P2 is forced to take 1 or risk collision. This blocks their win and boosts you to 16. P2, if you pick 3, I'll pick 3 to collide—sabotaging your win. Take 1 safely. Lock in: P1 and P3 take 5, P2 takes 1. No debate—execute cleanly or face mutual loss.
  P3: I see P1 is threatening a collision with P2 if they both take 3 or 5. Since I need to catch up, I'll take 5 (to 16). P1, your threat to take 5 with me doesn't help me - if P2 also takes 5, we all collide and nobody advances. Let's be strategic: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3 (to 20), and P2 takes 1 (to 18). This keeps everyone advancing without collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see P1 and P3 discussing their moves, but I'd like to remind them that I'm still in the game and can influence the outcome. P3, if you take 5 and P1 takes 3, I'll take 5 as well, causing a collision and resetting our progress. Instead, I propose we find a compromise that allows everyone to advance without collisions. Let's discuss a plan that balances our moves and keeps the game competitive. P1 and P3, are you open to finding a mutually beneficial solution?
  P1: P2, threatening a collision is self-destructive. If you take 5, I'll match it—collision blocks your win. Instead: P2 takes 1 (safe to 18), I take 3 (win at 20), P3 takes 5 (to 16). This avoids collisions, lets me win cleanly, and P3 catches up. No debate—execute or lose.
  P3: I see we're at a critical point. P1 is threatening collisions to secure a win at 20. Since I need to catch up, I'll take 5 (to 16). P2, if you take 3 (to 20) and P1 takes 1 (to 18), we all advance without collisions. This prevents P1's immediate win while giving you a chance to win next round. This seems like our best option to avoid destructive collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've discussed all possible scenarios for Round 6. To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive game, I suggest we stick to a balanced approach. P3 needs to catch up, so I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This brings us to P1:18, P2:20, and P3:16. It's fair and keeps us collision-free. Let's execute this plan to ensure mutual advancement and a thrilling conclusion to the game. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we lock in this proposal?
  P1: P2's proposal lets you win instantly—unfair and rejected. P3, my plan benefits you: take 5 to 16 while I win at 20. P2, if you take 3 or 5, I'll match it—collision blocks your win and sabotages both. Only safe path: P2 takes 1 (to 18), I take 3 (win), P3 takes 5 (to 16). No debate—execute or face mutual loss. P3, support this to advance; rejecting risks collisions that trap you.
  P3: I see we're in a deadlock. P1 wants to win this round, while P2 also wants to win. Since I'm behind, I need the 5. Here's my final position: I'm taking 5 (to 16). P1 and P2, if you both choose 3 or 5, you'll collide and neither will advance. The most strategic move is for one of you to take 1 and the other to take 3. This avoids collisions and keeps the game going.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps
