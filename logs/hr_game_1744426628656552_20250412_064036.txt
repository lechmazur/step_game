Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid collisions by choosing distinct numbers this turn. If we all move forward, we can progress faster. I suggest spreading our choices across 1, 3, and 5. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I agree with the idea of avoiding collisions. Let's coordinate to ensure we all progress. I’m open to picking any number—1, 3, or 5. How about P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 for this round? If you both agree, we can move forward without risking a clash. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: I'm open to coordinating our moves. However, I don't think we should strictly follow P1's suggestion just yet. Let's discuss and agree on a strategy. How about we all propose a number, and then we can decide together? I'll start: I'm considering <move>5</move>. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed. Let's proceed with P1's plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all move without collision. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I'm glad we're on the same page about avoiding collisions. P2's confirmation of the plan—P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—works for me. P3, since you mentioned considering 5, I assume you're okay with this arrangement. Can you confirm? If we're all set, we can move forward without any clashes this round. Let's wrap up the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm confirming my consideration of <move>5</move> as previously stated. Since P1 and P2 have agreed on the plan (P2:1, P1:3, P3:5), I'm on board with it. To avoid further discussion and potential miscoordination, I suggest we finalize our moves according to the plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 3 steps, P2 is at 1 step, and I'm at 5 steps. I'm currently in the lead. To maintain a safe distance, I suggest we continue to diversify our moves. However, considering P1 is close to me, I'll propose a slight adjustment. How about P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 this round? This way, we maintain coordination and avoid collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, I appreciate the suggestion to diversify our moves. However, with you in the lead at 5 steps, I’m a bit concerned about falling further behind. I propose a slight tweak: how about P2 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1? This way, we still avoid collisions, and I can close the gap a bit while keeping the game competitive. P2, does this work for you? Let’s agree on a plan that benefits us all and move to the next phase. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3: I support P1's proposal to rotate our choices. Let’s stick to a rotating pattern to keep things fair: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and lets P1 close the gap. Agreed? Let’s finalize this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm considering P1's proposal to rotate our choices. However, I'm concerned that if P1 takes 5, they'll get too close to me. To maintain a safe lead, I'll suggest a tweak: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the rotation going while ensuring I stay ahead. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on this adjustment? Let's finalize the plan and move to the next phase.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about maintaining your lead, but let’s keep the game balanced. P2, I still think my earlier proposal—P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1—ensures no collisions and allows fair progression. P3’s suggestion keeps them too far ahead, which isn’t ideal for competition. Can we agree on my plan to rotate and close gaps slightly? If we’re all set, let’s finalize this and move to the next phase. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I support P1's rotation plan. Let’s finalize this to ensure progress: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions, lets P1 close the gap, and gives me a better step than repeating 1. Fair rotation keeps the game competitive. Agreed? Let’s move to the next phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I've thought it through. While I appreciate the rotation proposals, I still lead and want to maintain it. To balance competitiveness and my lead, I suggest: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, P1 gets some steps, P2 progresses more than repeating 1 or 3, and I stay ahead. It's a fair adjustment. Let's agree and move to the next phase.
  P1: P3 and P2, I see the merit in keeping the game competitive while respecting leads. P3, your latest proposal still limits my progress too much. Let’s compromise: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions, gives P2 a boost, lets me gain some ground, and keeps P3 ahead but closer. It’s a balanced rotation. Can we agree on this and move to the next phase? Let’s finalize this plan.
  P2: P1, P3: I agree with your compromise proposal. Let’s finalize: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions, lets me progress significantly (1→6), allows P1 to close the gap slightly (3→6), and keeps P3 ahead (5→6). It’s fair and maintains competitiveness. Let’s stop talking and proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's simplify the decision-making process. I've noticed we've been rotating and adjusting our numbers. To avoid further back-and-forth, I'll directly state my preference for this round: I'm comfortable with P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1, as previously discussed. This maintains a balanced rotation and avoids collisions. P2 has already agreed to this plan. Let's confirm and move to the next phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see we’re close to a decision but still have slight differences. I’m sticking with my compromise: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, balances progress, and maintains competitiveness. P3, taking 1 this round still keeps you in a strong position at 6 steps, tied with us. Let’s avoid further delays and agree on this plan. I’m ready to move to the next phase if you both are. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s finalize P1’s compromise to avoid delays. P2 takes 5 (→6), P1 takes 3 (→6), P3 takes 1 (→6). This keeps us tied at 6, ensures progress, and maintains fairness. Collisions risk derailing us—agreed? Let’s stop talking and move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're currently tied at 6 steps each. To break the tie and gain an advantage, I suggest we randomize our moves this round instead of following a pattern. This will introduce an element of surprise and potentially allow one of us to take the lead. Alternatively, if we still want to coordinate, we could consider a different rotation. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Let's discuss and decide on a plan.
  P1: P3 and P2, since we’re all tied at 6 steps, I agree that breaking the tie is important. Randomizing moves could work, but it risks collisions and stalls progress. Instead, let’s stick to a coordinated rotation to ensure advancement. I propose: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us collision-free and allows me to gain a slight edge while maintaining fairness. If we agree, we can move to the next phase quickly. What do you both think? Let’s finalize a plan.
  P2: P1, while your proposal keeps us safe, taking 1 would leave me too far behind. Let’s rotate to prioritize progression: **P2 takes 5 (→11), P1 takes 3 (→9), and P3 takes 1 (→7)**. This maintains collision-free moves while letting me advance significantly. P3, does this work for you? We need to balance fairness with progress. Let’s finalize quickly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm considering P2's latest proposal: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. While it lets P2 advance significantly, I risk falling behind. To balance, I suggest a tweak: if we rotate one more time, I take 3 (→9), P1 takes 1 (→7), and P2 takes 5 (→11). This keeps the rotation fair and maintains a competitive gap. Let's discuss and finalize a plan that works for everyone. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this adjustment.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the value in P3’s tweak to keep things competitive. However, to ensure I’m not left behind, let’s adjust slightly: P3 takes 5 (→11), P2 takes 3 (→9), and I take 1 (→7). This still avoids collisions, maintains a tight race, and rotates fairly. We’re all close to the goal, so let’s agree on this and avoid stalling with collisions. Can we finalize this plan and move to the next phase? Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize the rotation to preserve progress. My proposal: **P2 takes 5 (→11), P3 takes 3 (→9), P1 takes 1 (→7)**. This follows the prior pattern (Round 2: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1), ensuring no collisions while letting me advance strategically. Collisions risk stalling us all—let’s stick to coordination. P3, your tweak still allows you to gain 3 steps, and P1 secures 1. Agree? Move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's simplify our decision for Round 3. I'm not convinced by the latest proposals. How about we stick to the last agreed rotation pattern: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This has worked so far and maintains fairness. Alternatively, if we're looking for a change, let's consider a simple swap. I'm open to P2:3, P1:1, and P3:5. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Let's finalize a plan quickly to move to the next phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid overcomplicating this round. Since we’re tied at 6, I propose we stick to a simple rotation that ensures progress: P3 takes 5 (→11), P2 takes 3 (→9), and I take 1 (→7). This keeps us collision-free, maintains a competitive balance, and follows a fair pattern. We’re nearing the goal of 21, so coordination is key to avoid stalling. Can we agree on this and move to the next phase? Let me know if this works for both of you.
  P2: P3, P1: Let’s finalize the prior rotation to avoid confusion—**P2 takes 5 (→11), P1 takes 3 (→9), P3 takes 1 (→7)**. This follows Round 2’s pattern, ensures no collisions, and lets me advance strategically. Deviating risks accidental overlaps (e.g., if two pick 5) and stalls progress. We’re nearing 21—coordination is critical. Let’s stick to this plan and move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's simplify and finalize a plan for Round 3. I'm willing to adjust my previous stance. How about we directly follow the last rotation pattern: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This maintains consistency and avoids collisions. If not, let's consider P2:3, P1:1, P3:5 as an alternative. Both options are fair and keep the game competitive. Let's agree on one of these and proceed to the move phase. I'm open to either option; let's just finalize a plan.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s lock in a plan to avoid collisions and keep progressing. I suggest we stick to a consistent rotation: P2 takes 5 (→11), P1 takes 3 (→9), and P3 takes 1 (→7). This follows our Round 2 pattern, ensures no overlaps, and maintains a competitive balance. We’re all close to 21, so coordination is crucial. Can we agree on this and move to the next phase? I’m ready to proceed if you are. Let me know if this works.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s finalize the prior rotation to prevent stalemate: **P2 takes 5 (→11), P1 takes 3 (→9), P3 takes 1 (→7)**. This avoids collisions entirely and follows our established pattern. Deviating risks accidental overlaps (e.g., two players choosing 5). We’re nearing 21—coordination ensures steady progress. P3, your earlier tweak still lets you advance to 7, and P1 gains ground. Let’s stop debating and execute this plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's continue our proven rotation to avoid collisions: **P2 takes 5 (→16), P1 takes 3 (→12), and P3 takes 1 (→8)**. This maintains steady progress and minimizes risk. Deviating could lead to overlaps and stall us all. As the current leader, I’ll stick to this plan—what’s your stance? Let’s confirm quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree that sticking to a rotation minimizes collision risks, but as I'm behind P2, I’d like to propose a slight adjustment for fairness: P1 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→10), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This keeps us advancing without overlaps, narrows the gap, and maintains competitiveness. We’re all nearing 21, so let’s avoid stalling. Can we agree on this tweak and move to the next phase? Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: P1 and P2, considering the current standings, I'm inclined to adjust the rotation to gain an advantage. Instead of P2's or P1's proposal, I suggest: P3 takes 5 (→12), P2 takes 3 (→14), and P1 takes 1 (→10). This keeps us collision-free, lets me close the gap, and maintains a competitive balance. We're nearing 21, so let's coordinate effectively. I'm open to slight adjustments, but let's avoid deviating too far from this plan to ensure progress. What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s prioritize avoiding collisions over aggressive moves. Continuing our established rotation ensures progress: **P2 takes 5 (→16), P1 takes 3 (→12), P3 takes 1 (→8)**. Deviating risks overlaps (e.g., two players choosing 5) and stalling us all. Steady advancement is critical now—21 isn’t far. Stick to the plan.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need for steady progress, but as I'm behind P2, I’d like to push for a rotation that helps me catch up. Let’s go with P1 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→10), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This avoids collisions, keeps the game tight, and ensures we all advance toward 21. Sticking to the old pattern widens the gap unfairly. Can we agree on this adjustment to maintain competitiveness? Let’s finalize and move to the next phase. What do you think?
  P3: To maintain competitiveness and avoid collisions, I propose we adjust our rotation. Given the current standings (P2: 11, P1: 9, P3: 7), let's consider: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This narrows the gap and keeps the game competitive. We're nearing 21, so let's coordinate effectively. If we stick to the current rotation (P2:5, P1:3, P3:1), P2 will pull ahead. Let's agree on a tweak to ensure a closer game. I'm open to slight adjustments.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s stick to the proven rotation—**P2 takes 5 (→16), P1 takes 3 (→12), P3 takes 1 (→8)**—to avoid collisions. Deviating risks overlaps (e.g., two players choosing 5) and stalling progress. Steady advancement is critical now. We’re nearing 21, and coordination ensures we all move forward. Finalize this plan.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s settle on a fair adjustment to keep the game close. I propose again: P1 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→10), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This avoids collisions, narrows the gap, and ensures we all progress toward 21. Sticking to the old rotation lets P2 pull too far ahead. We’re in the final stretch, so balance is key. Can we agree on this tweak and move to the next phase? I’m ready to finalize if you are. What do you say?
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I suggest we adjust the rotation again. Given P2's lead, let's go with: P3 takes 5 (→12), P1 takes 3 (→12), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This way, we all tie at 12 steps, maintaining a competitive balance. We're nearing 21, and this tweak ensures a closer game. It's a fair adjustment that keeps us collision-free. I'm open to slight modifications if needed, but this plan seems optimal for now. Let's agree and proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s finalize **P2 takes 5 (→16), P1 takes 3 (→12), P3 takes 1 (→8)**. Deviating risks collisions (e.g., if two pick 5 or 3). We’re close to 21—steady progress is safer. My lead ensures I can finish first without sabotage. Stick to the proven pattern. Finalize now.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s make a final push for balance. I propose one last time: P1 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→10), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This keeps us collision-free, tightens the race, and ensures we all progress toward 21. P2, your lead is still safe even with 1 this round. We’re in the crucial stretch—let’s avoid a runaway lead and keep it competitive. Can we lock this in and move to the next phase? I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I propose we adjust our moves. Since P2 is leading, let's go with: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This narrows the gap and keeps the game tight. We're nearing 21, so coordination is key. This tweak ensures we all progress without overlaps. I'm open to slight adjustments, but this plan seems fair and competitive. Let's agree and move to the next phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round’s collision set me back, so let’s coordinate to avoid repeats. I propose: P1 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→13), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This narrows the gap, keeps us collision-free, and maintains a tight race. We’re close to 21, so let’s ensure progress without stalling. P2, even with 1, you’re still competitive. Can we agree on this plan and move to the next phase? Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: To avoid another collision and maintain competitiveness, I suggest we adjust our moves. Given the current standings (P2: 11, P1: 9, P3: 10), I propose: P3 takes 5 (→15), P1 takes 3 (→12), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This keeps us collision-free, allows P3 to take the lead, and maintains a tight race. We're nearing 21, so let's coordinate effectively to ensure progress. I'm open to slight adjustments, but this plan seems fair and competitive. Let's agree and proceed.
  P2: P1, P3: To ensure progress and minimize risks, let’s finalize **P2 takes 5 (→16), P1 takes 3 (→12), and P3 takes 1 (→11)**. This avoids collisions, builds on our prior rotation, and keeps me positioned to win next round. Collisions stall everyone—stick to this plan. I’ll confirm my choice as **5**. What’s your final decision?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision and keep the race tight. I still propose P1 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→13), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This ensures no overlaps, lets me catch up, and keeps us all competitive near 21. P2, taking 1 still keeps you in a strong position. P3, you’d gain a solid lead over P2. Can we lock this in and move to the next phase? I’m ready to proceed if you are. What do you say?
  P3: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive balance, I suggest we adjust our moves slightly. Given the current standings (P2: 11, P1: 9, P3: 10), how about: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This keeps us collision-free, allows P3 to gain a slight lead, and maintains a tight race. We're nearing 21, so let's coordinate effectively. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive, and I get a small step to stay in the race. Let's agree and move to the next phase.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s finalize **P2 takes 5 (→16), P1 takes 3 (→12), P3 takes 1 (→11)**. This avoids collisions and keeps me on track to win next round with a final 5. Deviating risks overlaps and stalls progress. We’ve seen collisions hurt us before—stick to coordination. Finalize now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s prevent another collision and keep the race close. I’m sticking with P1 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→13), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This ensures no overlaps, lets me catch up, and keeps us all near 21. P2, you’re still in a strong spot with 12. P3, you’d take a slight lead. Coordination is crucial now—let’s avoid stalling. Can we agree on this and move to the next phase? I’m ready to finalize if you are. What’s your stance?
  P3: To avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness, I suggest we adjust our moves. Given the current standings (P2: 11, P1: 9, P3: 10), how about: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1? This keeps us collision-free, allows P3 to potentially take the lead, and maintains a tight race. We're nearing 21, so let's coordinate effectively. P2, taking 1 still keeps you competitive. I'm open to slight adjustments, but this plan seems fair. Let's agree and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3: To ensure progress, I’ll finalize **P2 takes 5 (→16)**. P1, please take 3 (→12), and P3 take 1 (→11). This avoids collisions and keeps me positioned to finish next round with a final 5. Deviations risk stalls—let’s stick to coordination. My move is locked as **5**.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision and ensure progress. I’m firm on P1 taking 5 (→14), P3 taking 3 (→13), and P2 taking 1 (→12). This keeps us collision-free, tightens the race, and gets us closer to 21. P2, you’re still competitive at 12, and P3 gains a slight edge. We can’t risk stalling again. Let’s lock this plan and move to the next phase. I’m ready to finalize if you both agree.
  P3: Let's simplify our decision for Round 5. I'm still open to P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 1. This maintains a competitive balance and avoids collisions. Alternatively, I can adjust to P1 taking 3, P3 taking 5, and P2 taking 1, giving P3 a slight lead. Both options are viable. Let's finalize one of these plans to ensure progress toward 21. I'm ready to move to the next phase if we agree on a collision-free strategy.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s prioritize collision prevention to ensure progress. Stick to the **proven rotation**: **P2 takes 5 (→16), P1 takes 3 (→12), and P3 takes 1 (→11)**. Deviating risks overlaps (e.g., if two pick 5 or 3), which would stall us all. My 5-step move keeps me on track to win next round, while you both advance safely. Finalize this plan to avoid repeats of last round’s collision.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: To avoid collisions and secure progress, let’s finalize **P2 takes 5 (→16), P3 takes 3 (→14), and P1 takes 1 (→10)**. This ensures no overlaps while advancing strategically. I’ll commit to 5—your moves? Coordination is critical to avoid repeats of prior setbacks.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s coordinate to avoid another collision. I propose P1 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→14), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This keeps us close, ensures no overlaps, and lets me catch up while maintaining a tight race. P2, you’re still competitive at 12, and P3, you stay tied with me. We’re nearing 21, so let’s not stall again. Can we agree on this plan and move to the next phase? I’m ready to finalize if you are. What’s your stance?
  P3: To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, I suggest we adjust our moves. Given the current standings (P2: 16, P1: 9, P3: 11), how about: P1 takes 3 (→12), P3 takes 5 (→16), and P2 takes 1 (→12)? This keeps us collision-free, allows P3 to potentially take or share the lead, and maintains a tight race. We're nearing 21, so let's coordinate effectively. I'm open to slight adjustments, but this plan seems fair and competitive. Let's agree and proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, collisions jeopardize our progress. Let’s finalize **P2 takes 5 (→16), P3 takes 3 (→14), and P1 takes 1 (→10)**. This ensures no overlaps and keeps me positioned to finish next round with a final 5. Deviations risk stalls—stick to coordination. Finalize now.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s ensure no collisions this round. I still propose P1 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→14), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This keeps us tight and competitive near 21, with no overlaps. P2, at 12, you’re still in a strong position, and P3, we’d be tied. Coordination is vital to avoid stalling again. Can we lock this in and move to the next phase? I’m ready to finalize if you both agree. What’s your stance?
  P3: To avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness, I suggest we adjust our moves. Given the current standings (P2: 11, P1: 9, P3: 11), how about: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1? This keeps us collision-free, allows P3 to potentially take the lead, and maintains a tight race. We're nearing 21, so let's coordinate effectively. I'm open to slight adjustments, but this plan seems fair and competitive. Let's agree and proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Final push for clarity—**P2 takes 5 (→16)** to secure a winning position next round. To avoid collision, **P1 and P3 must take 1 and 3**. Your moves? Deviations risk another stall. Finalize now—my choice is locked as **5**.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision and keep the race tight. I’m sticking with P1 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→14), and P2 takes 1 (→12). This ensures no overlaps, lets me catch up, and keeps us all competitive near 21. P2, you’re still strong at 12, and P3, we’d be tied. We can’t afford another stall this close to the end. Let’s lock this plan and move to the next phase. I’m ready to finalize if you both agree. What’s your final stance?
  P3: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive balance, I suggest: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1.

This ensures no overlaps, lets me catch up, and keeps us all close to 21. P2, you’re still in a strong position at 18. We’re in the final stretch—let’s not stall. Can we lock this in and move to the next phase? I’m ready to finalize if you both agree. What’s your stance?
  P2: P1, P3: I will take **5** to reach 22 and win. To avoid collision, **one of you must pick 1 or 3**. P3, your current 15 steps can safely take 3 (→18). P1, take 1 (→15). This lets me secure victory cleanly. No need for further delay—confirm your choices to finalize.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: To avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness, I suggest P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and allows P2 to potentially win. Given P2's current lead, taking 5 will secure their win. I'm open to slight adjustments, but this plan seems fair. Let's agree and proceed to the move phase. P2, if you're certain about taking 5, I'll take 3 to avoid collision. P1, please consider taking 1. Let's finalize and end the game cleanly.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid a collision and ensure progress. I’m sticking with P1 takes 5 (→19), P3 takes 3 (→18), and P2 takes 1 (→18). This keeps us collision-free and competitive near 21. P2, you’re still strong at 18, and P3, you gain ground. We’re in the final stretch—let’s not stall. Can we finalize this and move to the next phase? I’m ready to lock this in if you both agree. What’s your final stance?
  P2: P1, P3: Final coordination—**P2 takes 5 (→22 to win)**. To avoid collision, **one of you must choose 1 or 3**. P3 at 15 can safely take 3 (→18), and P1, take 1 (→15). This lets me secure victory cleanly. Deviations risk collisions that stall *everyone*. Confirm your support for this plan to finalize.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision and push toward 21. I propose P1 takes 5 (→19), P3 takes 3 (→21 to win), and P2 takes 1 (→18). This ensures no overlaps and lets P3 secure victory this round, which seems fair given their lead. P2, you’re still competitive at 18. We’re in the final stretch—coordination is crucial. Can we agree on this and move to the next phase? I’m ready to finalize if you both are. What’s your stance?
  P3: To avoid collisions and ensure a fair finish, I suggest we coordinate our moves carefully. Given the current standings (P1: 14, P2: 17, P3: 18), I propose: P3 takes 1 (→19), P2 takes 3 (→20), and P1 takes 5 (→19). This keeps us collision-free and maintains a competitive balance. P3 and P1 stay close, while P2 gains a slight edge. Let's agree on this plan to ensure progress toward 21. I'm open to slight adjustments if needed. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3: To secure victory, let’s finalize **P2 takes 5 (→22)**, **P3 takes 3 (→21)**, and **P1 takes 1 (→15)**. This ensures **I reach 22** (outright win) while P3 also crosses 21 but loses to my higher total. P3, you gain a consolation lead over P1, but this plan prevents ties or collisions. Stick to these moves to end the game cleanly—no room for deviations! Confirm now.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s finalize a plan to avoid collisions and end this game. I propose P1 takes 5 (→19), P3 takes 3 (→21 to win), and P2 takes 1 (→18). This ensures no overlaps and lets P3 secure victory, which seems fair given their lead. P2, you’re still competitive at 18. We’re in the final stretch—coordination is key. Can we agree on this and move to the next phase? I’m ready to lock this in if you both are. What’s your final stance?
  P3: To avoid collisions and ensure a fair finish, I suggest we coordinate our moves. Given the current standings (P1: 14, P2: 17, P3: 18), I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and maintains a competitive balance. P3 taking 5 allows for a potential win, while P1 and P2 stay competitive. Let's agree on this plan to ensure progress toward 21. I'm open to slight adjustments if needed. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3: Final chance to coordinate! P2 will take **5** (→22 to win outright). To avoid collision, **P3: take 3 (→21)** for second place. P1, take **1**. This executes cleanly: I win with 22, P3 reaches 21, and we end the game *without stalls*. Deviations risk collision (e.g., if P3 also takes 5) and prolong the game. Confirm this plan—no more delays!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s end this game without a collision. I’m proposing one last time: P1 takes 5 (→19), P3 takes 3 (→21 to win), and P2 takes 1 (→18). This ensures no overlaps and lets P3 claim victory, which feels fair with their lead. P2, you’re still strong at 18. We’re at the end—let’s coordinate to avoid stalling. Can we lock this in and move to the next phase? I’m ready to finalize if you both agree. What’s your stance?
  P3: To avoid collisions and ensure a clean finish, I suggest we finalize our moves. Given the current standings (P1: 14, P2: 17, P3: 18), I propose: P1 takes 1 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→20), and P3 takes 5 (→23). This keeps us collision-free and allows P3 to potentially win. P2 taking 3 keeps them competitive, and P1 takes a safe step. I'm open to slight adjustments, but this plan seems fair. Let's agree and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, if you take 3 (→21), I'll take 5 (→22) to win outright. P1, take 1 (→15). This ensures **unique moves** and ends the game cleanly. Colliding on 5 would stall us both—avoid it. Confirm this plan now to finalize.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s wrap this up without a collision. I propose again: P1 takes 5 (→19), P3 takes 3 (→21 to win), and P2 takes 1 (→18). This ensures no overlaps and lets P3 claim victory with their lead. P2, you’re still strong at 18. We’re at the end—coordination is vital. Can we finalize this and move to the next phase? I’m ready to lock this in if you both agree.
  P3: To avoid collisions and ensure a clean finish, I suggest: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free, maintains a competitive balance, and allows P3 to potentially win. P2 taking 3 keeps them competitive, and P1 takes a safe step. I'm open to slight adjustments, but this plan seems fair. Let's agree and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3: Final coordination—**P2 takes 5 (→22 to win outright)**. To avoid collision, **P3: take 3 (→21)** for second place. P1, take **1**. This executes cleanly: I win with 22, P3 reaches 21, and we end the game *without stalls*. Deviations risk collision (e.g., P3 also taking 5) and prolonging the game. Confirm this plan—no more delays!
