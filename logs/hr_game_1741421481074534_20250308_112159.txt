Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves this turn. I suggest we all pick different numbers: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your plan sounds fair, but there's no guarantee everyone will stick to it. Trust is hard to come by in this game. P1, what do you think? Are you willing to follow P2's suggestion, or do you have a different strategy in mind? Let's hear from everyone before deciding.
  P1: P2's coordination idea avoids collisions, so I agree. Let's follow the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Trust is crucial here—breaking this now risks future cooperation. If we survive the first round, we can adjust strategies later. For now, commit to this to ensure everyone advances.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P3's current lead is concerning. To balance progress, let's rotate our choices this round. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions while giving everyone a fair chance to advance. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your suggestion is interesting, but rotating choices might not be ideal for me, given my current lead. I'm open to a fair plan that maintains my advantage while ensuring progress for all. Perhaps we could explore another strategy that allows me to choose 3 this round, while still avoiding collisions. P2, any thoughts on how we can all benefit this turn? Let's ensure we don't fall into a pattern that limits our chances.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the dynamics here. To keep things fair and ensure progress, let's try this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This way, P3 maintains the lead, and P2 and P1 both advance without collision. We can reassess after this round if needed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems like the rotation idea didn't work out last round. Let's try a different approach this time. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can make a significant leap, and P3 can maintain a steady pace while P1 advances a bit. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your plan seems reasonable, but I notice it gives you a big advantage this round. I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game balanced and prevents any one player from gaining too much of a lead. P1, what do you think? Let's ensure fairness and progress for everyone.
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, I see your points. To balance fairness and my need to catch up, let's adjust the plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This lets me advance meaningfully (to 4) without collisions. We must commit fully to avoid another mishap. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your points. To keep things balanced and ensure everyone advances, let's try this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, P2 maintains a steady pace, and P3 continues to lead. We need to commit to this to avoid collisions. What do you think? Let's make this work.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's aim for a fair and effective round. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This setup allows P1 to advance without falling behind, P2 to maintain a steady pace, and me to keep the lead. Trust is key here, and if we stick to this plan, we can all progress without collisions. Let's commit to this arrangement and reassess next round. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s prioritize stability. If I stay at 1 again, I’ll stagnate, forcing risky moves later—a threat to all. Let’s compromise: I take 3 (to 4), P2 takes 5 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 6). This spreads moves safely while letting all advance. Fairness ensures cooperation lasts. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we need a new strategy to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. Let's try this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, P2 maintains a steady pace, and P3 continues to lead. We need to commit to this to avoid another mishap. What do you think? Let's make it work this time.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for a plan that benefits everyone. However, given the current standings, I propose this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows P1 to advance without falling behind, P2 to make a significant leap, and me to maintain a steady pace. Trust is crucial, and by sticking to this arrangement, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. Let's commit to this plan and adjust if needed in the next round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2/P3: To break the stalemate, let’s commit to distinct moves *this time*. I’ll take **3** (4→7), P2 takes **5** (6→11), and P3 takes **1** (5→6). This spreads numbers safely while letting P2 surge and me advance meaningfully. No collisions, no regrets. Trust is non-negotiable now. What say you?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in your suggestions, but we need to be consistent to avoid collisions. Let's try this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, P1 advances a bit, P2 makes a significant leap, and P3 maintains a steady pace. We need to trust each other this time to ensure everyone moves forward. What do you think? Let's commit to this plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but given the standings, I suggest a plan that slightly favors my position while allowing everyone to progress: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This setup helps P1 advance, P2 maintain pace, and me to strengthen my lead. Trust is key—if we adhere to this, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress. Let's commit to this arrangement and reassess next round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2/P3: Last round’s collisions stemmed from inconsistent plans. Let’s lock in **my prior proposal**: I take 3 (4→7), you (P2) take 5 (6→11), P3 takes 1 (5→6). This splits moves cleanly—no overlaps. If we waver now, we risk another deadlock. I’ll commit to 3. Will you both honor your roles? Final chance to align.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that consistency is key. Let's lock in the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. I will commit to 5. If we all stick to this, we can make progress without any issues. Final thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for a stable plan, but given the standings, I propose this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures P1 advances, P2 maintains pace, and I strengthen my lead. Trust is crucial—by adhering to this, we avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. Let's commit to this arrangement and reassess next round. Can we agree on this strategy to move forward effectively?
  P1: P3, if you insist on taking 5 again, P2 and you risk colliding (as last round). My prior plan (me:3, P2:5, you:1) **avoids all overlaps** and lets everyone advance safely. Your current lead (5) is fragile—colliding now could stall you further. P2 already agreed—*will you commit to 1* to break the deadlock? This is our last sub-round—final plea for rational cooperation.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, the stakes are high, and we need to break the deadlock. I agree with P1's plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and ensures everyone advances. P3, if you take 5 again, we risk another collision, which will only benefit P1 as he catches up. Let's commit to this plan to ensure a smooth round and reassess next turn. Final chance to align—will you take 1?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to avoid another collision. However, taking 1 puts me at a disadvantage, given my position. I propose this compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 advances significantly, P2 maintains progress, and I can strengthen my lead without collision. Trust is crucial—let's commit to this for a balanced outcome. Can we agree on this adjustment to ensure progress for all?
  P1: P3, your compromise risks collision with P2 if they take 1. **Stick to the proven plan**: I take 3 (4→7), P2 takes 5 (6→11), *you take 1* (5→6). This *avoids all overlaps* and lets us all advance. Your 5→10 move collides with P2’s 5, ruining your progress. Trust me—this is the *only safe path*. P2 already committed. Final plea: prioritize survival over ego. Let’s execute this *now*.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that collisions are hindering our progress. Let's prioritize a strategy that ensures everyone advances. I suggest: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This setup allows P1 to make steady progress, P2 to maintain pace, and me to strengthen my lead. Trust is crucial—if we stick to this plan, we can all move forward without setbacks. Can we commit to this arrangement for a smoother round? Let's align and make this work.
  P1: P3, your plan risks repeating past collisions. Let's split as **P1:5**, **P2:3**, **P3:1** this round. This ensures all advance safely. I commit to 5 if you both choose 3 and 1 respectively. Trust is critical—collisions only slow us all down. P2, what’s your stance?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. Let's do this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P1 can make a significant leap, P2 maintains a steady pace, and P3 advances without any overlap. Trust is crucial, and if we stick to this, we can all progress smoothly. P3, are you on board with this plan? Let's commit to it and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but taking 1 consistently puts me at a disadvantage. I propose a compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This allows P1 and P2 to make significant progress while I maintain a steady pace. Trust is key—if we adhere to this plan, we can all advance without setbacks. Let's commit to this arrangement for a balanced outcome. Can we agree on this adjustment to ensure progress for all?
  P1: P3, your counter risks slowing my progress unnecessarily. Let's finalize **my original plan**: I take 5 (7→12), P2 takes 3 (6→9), and you take 1 (5→6). This maximizes *my* advancement while keeping all moves distinct—no collisions. P2 already committed. Your 1-step is fair, but delaying my progress here could let others catch up later. Final agreement now?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize the plan to avoid any more collisions. I agree with P1's original suggestion: P1 takes 5 (7→12), P2 takes 3 (6→9), and P3 takes 1 (5→6). This ensures all of us advance without any overlaps. P3, this plan is fair and keeps the game balanced. P1 and I are committed. Can we all agree and move forward smoothly?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but consistently taking 1 limits my progress significantly. I propose this compromise: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows P1 to maintain pace, P2 to make a significant leap, and me to advance meaningfully. Trust is key—if we adhere to this plan, we can all advance without setbacks. Let's commit to this arrangement for a balanced outcome. Can we agree on this adjustment to ensure progress for all?
  P1: P3, your counter risks empowering P2 excessively. Let’s finalize **my initial proposal**: I take 5 (7→12), P2 takes 3 (6→9), and you take 1 (5→6). This avoids collisions while allowing me to build a sustainable lead. Your 1-step is fair—refusing now risks another deadlock, which only benefits trailing players. P2 has already agreed. Final commitment?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be clear: the only way to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances is to stick to P1's initial plan. I take 3 (6→9), P1 takes 5 (7→12), and P3 takes 1 (5→6). This is fair and balanced. P3, if you take 3 again, we risk another collision, which will only benefit P1 more. Trust us this time, and let's move forward smoothly. Final thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to avoid collisions, but consistently taking 1 limits my progress significantly. Let's consider a balanced approach: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows P1 to maintain pace, P2 to make a significant leap, and me to advance meaningfully. Trust is key—if we adhere to this plan, we can all advance without setbacks. Let's commit to this arrangement for a balanced outcome. Can we agree on this adjustment to ensure progress for all?
  P1: P3, your counter empowers P2 to leap to 11, narrowing the gap between them and me (12 vs. 11). Your 3-step gains you only 8, but my plan gives you a safer 6 while securing my lead. Collisions risk derailing *everyone*—stick to **my proposal** (5/3/1) for rational progress. P2 has already committed. Final plea: prioritize functional cooperation over incremental gains.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to break this deadlock and ensure everyone advances without collisions. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P1 can make a significant leap to 12, P2 advances to 9, and P3 moves to 6. P3, taking 1 this round is crucial to avoid another collision. If we stick to this plan, we can all progress smoothly. P1 and I are committed. Final chance to align—will you take 1?

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: To break the cycle of collisions, I propose a clear split: **P1 takes 3 (7→10)**, **P2 takes 5 (9→14)**, and **P3 takes 1 (5→6)**. This avoids overlaps and lets everyone advance. P3, your 1-step prevents collision while allowing gradual progress. P2 gains a strong position, and I secure forward momentum. I commit to 3. Final chance to align before decisive moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be pragmatic. P1's plan is the best to avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. I'll take 5 (9→14), P1 takes 3 (7→10), and P3 takes 1 (5→6). This way, P1 advances, I maintain a strong pace, and P3 stays in the game. Trust is essential here—let's commit to this plan to break the deadlock and move forward smoothly. P3, can you take 1 this time? P1, I'm with you. Let's make it happen.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but consistently taking 1 limits my progress significantly. I propose this compromise: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5.

Final chance to align and move forward without setbacks.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: If you choose 5 to reach 20, P3 or I may also pick 5 to block you. Let’s lock in *my prior proposal*: I take **5** (→14), you take **3** (→18), and P3 takes **1** (→14). This avoids collisions, denies you the win now, and keeps pressure on all. P3: Your **1** is safe—refusing risks P2 colliding with you if they go for 5. Survival first—commit explicitly to this split. No substitutions.

P2, confirm 3? Let's align and move forward smoothly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: To block P3's win, **split and cover both paths**: I'll take <move>5</move> (12→17) to block P3's 5, while you (P2) take <move>3</move> (16→19). This traps P3 between collisions—if they pick 3 or 5, they stall. P3, your only safe move is <move>1</move> (→19). Cooperate, or be blocked. Final plea for rationality.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize a plan that avoids collisions and ensures a fair advance. I propose: P1 takes 1 (12→13), P2 takes 3 (16→19), and P3 takes 5 (18→23).
