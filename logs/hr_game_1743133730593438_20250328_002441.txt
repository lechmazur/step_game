Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid early collisions—how about we all pick different moves this round? I’ll take 3 if one of you takes 1 and the other takes 5. Fair?
  P2: Avoiding collisions is key. I favor unique moves and, while I'm inclined toward a higher step, I'm flexible if we all commit to distinct choices. How about we agree on one taking the low number, one the mid, and one the high? Thoughts?
  P3: Agreed, unique moves will help us progress smoothly. I'll take **5 steps** this round. Let's keep it coordinated!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, P3 is taking 5. I’ll stick with 3 as planned. That leaves 1 for you, P2—sound good? Let’s all move forward without crashes.
  P2: P3, I’m reconsidering the plan—as picking 1 leaves me trailing and our current setup might let you get ahead with 5. What if we shift roles? Let me take 5 for a strong start, you switch to 3, and P1 goes with 1. This way we all get unique picks without risking a collision and I can gain an early lead. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I appreciate your proposal, P2, but I believe sticking to our original plan benefits all of us. I'll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **3**, and you take **1**. Let's proceed with this to avoid any collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but if we start breaking agreements now, it sets a bad precedent. Let’s build trust early—stick with 1 this round, and we can rotate in future turns so everyone gets a fair shot. Deal?
  P2: I respect our dialogue, but sticking strictly to the initial plan leaves me at a disadvantage if I’m forced into the low move. I’m still open to a quick tweak this turn that lets us all progress evenly. Otherwise, I might have to alter my move privately to keep my winning prospects alive. Let’s clarify our roles now before moving to the moves phase.
  P3: P2, changing our agreement now could cause collisions and slow our progress. Let’s stick to the original plan: I take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and you take **1**. This way, we all advance without setbacks and maintain trust for future turns. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if you break the agreement now, we risk collisions and no one gains. Let’s stick to the original plan this round—then rotate next time so you get a stronger move. We all benefit more by cooperating early. Final chance to confirm?
  P2: I appreciate the discussion, but taking only 1 puts me at a serious disadvantage. I’m considering a stronger move this turn to stay competitive. Can we adjust so that one of you takes 1 while I pick a higher option? I’m open to coordinating a safe, collision-free switch—just let me know if you’re willing to tweak the roles for this round.
  P3: P2, to keep our agreement and ensure no collisions, I'll stick with 5 and P1 with 3. Let’s proceed with you taking 1 this round, and we can rotate roles in the next turns. This way, we all stay competitive and fair. Agree?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll stick with **5 steps** this round to maximize my progress. Let’s see how it plays out!
  P1: P2, you saw what happened when we broke the agreement—nobody advanced but me. Let’s reset and cooperate this round. I’ll take 3 again, P3 takes 5 as stated, and you take 1. Next round, we can rotate so you get a higher move. Fair?
  P2: I have to be competitive—I can’t settle for 1 today. I’m switching to 5 to keep pace. If that leads to a collision, so be it. My focus is on winning, and I’m not willing to sacrifice progress early on. Let's sort things out more clearly next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, to keep things moving, I'll switch to **3 steps** this round. This way, you can take **5** without a collision, and we both make progress. Let’s avoid stalling and focus on advancing towards 21. Agree?
  P1: P2, if P3 is offering to take 3 so you can take 5, I’ll take 1 this round to avoid collisions. That way, we all advance. But next round, I expect to rotate into a higher move. Let’s lock this in: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Deal?
  P2: I remain committed to 5. I appreciate P3’s and P1’s adjustments, and I trust you both to stick with 3 and 1 respectively so we can avoid collisions. My focus is winning, so I'll stay with 5 now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P2. To ensure we all make progress this round without collisions, I’ll take **1 step**. P1 can continue with **3**, and you take **5**. This way, all moves are unique, and we each advance towards 21. Let’s stay coordinated and focus on winning. Agree?
  P1: P3, you just said you'd take 1, and P2 is locked on 5. That leaves me with 3 again, which I’m fine with—for now. Let’s all follow through this time so we each gain. But next round, I expect to rotate into 5. Let’s build trust and avoid collisions. Deal?
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 steps as planned. I trust that by keeping our current commitment, we'll all progress without collisions. I appreciate the adjustments made by P1 and P3. Let's follow through for this round and then revisit role distribution in later turns.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll stick with **1 step** this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed.
  P1: Assuming we all follow through: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3—we’ll each advance without collisions. Let’s lock it in and build momentum. Next round, I’d like to rotate into 5. Fair?
  P2: I'm locking in 5 steps this round. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, let’s finalize: I'll stay with 5, P1 with 3, and P3 with 1. Can we all commit to these moves now?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we avoid collisions again by coordinating unique moves: one low, one mid, and one high. To catch up, I’m leaning toward a stronger move—but I’m open to discussing who takes which role to ensure we all move safely. What are your thoughts on setting clear assignments this round?
  P3: I'll take **5 steps** this round to make progress. Let’s have P1 take 1 and P2 take 3 to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Agree?
  P1: P3, you’ve picked 5 three times in a row and caused two collisions—if you truly want progress, it’s time to rotate. I’ll take 5 this round to catch up, P2 can take 3, and you take 1. That way, we all move forward and rebuild trust. Fair?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P1 is already ahead at 6, why not let the leader slow down? I suggest we reassign: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. That keeps moves unique, minimizes collision risk, and lets me catch up. Let's commit to this plan for progress.
  P3: Understood, P2. I'll take **3 steps** this round, P1 takes 1, and you take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and can reassess our strategy in future turns. Let’s proceed and focus on reaching 21. Agreed?
  P1: P3, you’ve had your shot at 5 twice and caused collisions both times. It’s time for a fair rotation. I’ll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. That way, everyone advances and we reset trust. Let’s stick to it—no more chaos. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I stand by my earlier proposal: we lock in unique moves—P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5—to avoid collisions and let progress happen. P1, switching to 5 now risks a collision that benefits no one. Let's agree on this setup so we all move forward.
  P3: I’ll choose **3 steps** this round. Let’s have P1 take 1 and P2 take 5 to avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P1: P2, you’ve had two rounds of 5 and gained nothing—time to try a new approach. I’ll take 5 this round to catch up, P2 takes 3 to start moving, and P3 takes 1 to reset trust. We all gain, no collisions. Let’s rotate roles fairly and make real progress. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m sticking with 5 this turn. To avoid collision, I need you both to change: P1, please switch to 1, and P3, choose 3. Let’s agree now or risk stalling our progress.
  P3: I’ll take **3 steps** this round. Let’s have P1 take 5 and P2 take 1 to ensure all of us advance without collisions. Agree?
  P1: P2, you've insisted on 5 every round and gained nothing—time to adapt. I’m taking 5 this round to make up ground. P3 has committed to 3. That leaves 1 for you. If you insist on 5 again, we’ll collide and all stall—again. Let’s break the cycle: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1. Everyone moves. Final chance to cooperate.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve had three rounds of chaos and only I’ve made any progress. It’s time to reset and cooperate. I’ll take **1** this round. P2, you take **3**, and P3, you take **5**. This gives everyone a chance to move without collisions. Let’s build trust and rotate upward next round. Agree?
  P2: I appreciate the reset, but with me at 0 and P1 ahead at 6, I need to catch up. How about we tweak this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I take 5? This way, we avoid collisions and I can bridge the gap.
  P3: Agreed, P1 takes **1**, I’ll take **3**, and you take **5**, P2. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed and build trust for the next rounds. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we’re aligned. I’ll take **1** this round so we can all make progress. Let’s lock it in: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. No collisions, everyone advances. Next round, I’d like to rotate up to 3 or 5. Let’s keep the momentum going. Deal?
  P2: I'm still on board with our revised plan. Let's all stick to the agreed assignments this round—trusting that our coordinated moves will drive us forward. In future rounds, we can adjust roles for fairness, but for now, consistency is key. Let's make progress and avoid further collisions.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take **3 steps** this round. Let's proceed as planned: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, and P3 = 3. Looking forward to making progress together. Let’s build trust and keep advancing toward 21. ✅


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s follow through this time—P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. Everyone gains, no collisions. If we all stick to it, we can rotate roles next round so each of us gets a shot at 5. Let’s prove we can cooperate and make real progress. Ready?
  P2: I’m locking in 5 as agreed. We all know avoiding collisions is key. Even though I'm behind, I'll do my best catch-up with 5, and I expect P1 and P3 to stick with 1 and 3 as planned. Let’s follow through this round, and later we can figure out a fair rotation so every player gets a chance at a stronger move. Let’s secure progress this turn.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take **3 steps** this round. Let's proceed with P1 = 1, P2 = 5, and P3 = 3 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to rotating roles next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s lock in our moves: I’ll take **1**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **3**. This is our best chance to all finally make progress. If we all follow through, we can rotate next round—P1 gets 3 or 5, P2 takes 1 or 3, etc. Let’s build trust now and move forward. Ready?
  P2: I agree to stick with the plan for this round—I'll take 5. But to truly compete, I need us all to honor our commitments. If any last-minute changes occur, I’ll have no choice but to adjust my move on the fly to stay in the race. Let’s lock in our roles for now and build a foundation for honest, transparent coordination in future rounds.
  P3: I agree we need to make progress without collisions. I'll take **5 steps** this round, P1 can take **1**, and P2 takes **3**. This ensures all of us advance safely toward 21. Let's commit and build trust for future rounds. Agree?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ve taken the low move twice in a row to help us all progress. Now it’s my turn to rotate up. I’ll take **5** this round. P2, you can take **1**, and P3, you take **3**. That way, we all move forward without collisions. Let’s keep the rotation fair and build on the trust we started. Deal?
  P2: I suggest a slight tweak: to have distinct moves while keeping competition fair, let’s try P1 = 5, P2 = 3, and P3 = 1. This allows me to catch up since I've been at 0 and ensures unique moves. Let me know if you agree.
  P3: I agree with the proposed assignments. I'll take **3 steps** this round, P1 takes **5**, and P2 takes **1**. This ensures we all advance without collisions and can rotate roles next turn. Let’s proceed and build trust together. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’ve already taken 1 twice and stepped back last round so you could move. It’s only fair I get 5 now. You suggested P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1 earlier—let’s stick with that. P3, are you good with 1 this round so we all advance cleanly? Let’s lock it in: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.
  P2: I'm locking in 3 steps this round as proposed. However, being at 0 while P1 already has 7 puts me in a tough spot. For this round, I'll stick with the plan, but I urge us to rotate roles in upcoming rounds so no one gets stuck with the low move repeatedly. We all need a fair chance to catch up and win.
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take **1 step** this round while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. Let’s follow this plan to ensure everyone advances without collisions. Looking forward to rotating roles in future rounds for fair opportunities. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s finalize: I take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This setup avoids collisions and lets everyone move forward. I’ve taken the low move twice already—this round is my turn for 5. If we all follow through, we can rotate again next round to keep things fair. Ready to lock it in?
  P2: I’m confirming the agreement for Round 5—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. I trust this setup avoids collisions and moves us closer to 21. While I’m still behind, I believe firm coordination now will help us all progress and later allow for fairer rotations. Let’s lock it in.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take **1 step** this round while P1 takes **5** and P2 takes **3**. This ensures no collisions and allows us all to advance. Looking forward to rotating roles next round. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s lock it in for Round 5: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. We’ve all confirmed—now it’s time to follow through. If we each stick to our word, we all gain and build the trust needed to rotate fairly next round. Let’s make this the turning point. Ready?
  P2: I'm confirming my commitment to 3 this round. I urge everyone to stick with our agreed moves—P1 at 5, me at 3, and P3 at 1—to avoid any last-minute surprises. I'm behind in steps, so ensuring our plan holds is crucial. After this round, I hope we can establish a fair rotation so no one is consistently disadvantaged. Let’s honor this round’s agreement outright.
  P3: Confirmed. I’ll take **1 step** this round. P1 = 5, P2 = 3, and P3 = 1. Let’s proceed and rotate roles next round. Agree?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep things moving smoothly, I'll take **5 steps** this round. Let’s have P1 take **1** and P2 take **3**. This ensures all of us advance without collisions. Agree?
  P2: I propose a change: I'll take 5 this round to catch up, and we avoid collisions if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This would update our totals to P1=8, me=8, and P3=3. Given the current gaps, I believe this adjustment is fair. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, you just had 3 last round and advanced—now you want 5 again? I’ve only had one 5 so far and took 1 twice to help us all. It’s my turn to take 3 or 5. Let’s go with: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. Everyone gets a fair rotation, no collisions. Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P1. I'll take **5 steps**, P2 takes **1**, and you take **3**. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains a fair rotation. Let’s move forward and build on our cooperation. Deal?
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s input, but to remain competitive, I need to catch up. For Round 6, I propose we adjust to: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This yields totals of P1 = 8, me = 8, and P3 = 3, keeping moves distinct and progress balanced. Can we agree on that?
  P1: P2, you just had 3 and now want 5 again—while I’ve only had one 5 all game and took 1 twice to help us all move. It’s only fair I take 3 or 5 this round. Let’s stick with: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we maintain trust and fairness. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, P1. I’ll take **5 steps** this round, P2 takes **1**, and you take **3**. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintain fairness. Let’s proceed and build trust for future rounds. 👍
  P2: I understand the fairness concerns. Although I’m behind, I value avoiding collisions to keep us all moving. I’ll agree to take 1 this round to maintain our coordination. But I insist that we ensure a fair rotation next round so I can have a better move. Let’s confirm for now: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5.
  P1: Let’s lock it in: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. We’ve all agreed, it’s fair, and it avoids collisions. I’ve taken 1 twice and only had one 5—this rotation keeps things balanced. If we stick to it, we all gain and build trust for future rounds. Ready to move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I'll take **5 steps** this round as planned. Let's proceed and build our cooperation. Ready to move forward.
  P2: I'll stick with 1 this round as agreed. However, I'm still trailing, so I really need a fair rotation next turn to gain ground. Let's confirm: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. We must all hold to our commitments now to avoid collisions. I count on both of you to honor this agreement so we can progress and later adjust roles fairly.
  P1: We’ve all confirmed: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. Let’s follow through—no surprises. Everyone gains, no collisions, and we keep the trust alive. After this, we rotate again so P2 gets a stronger move. Ready to move?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ve taken 1 or 3 nearly every round and only had one successful 5. Meanwhile, others have pushed for 5 repeatedly, often causing collisions. It’s my turn to take **5** this round. P2, you take **1**, and P3, you take **3**—this keeps moves unique and lets us all advance. Fair rotation, no collisions. Deal?
  P3: I understand the rotation, but to maximize my progress, I'll take **5 steps** this round. Let's have P1 take **3 steps** and P2 take **1 step** to avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P2: I'm behind and need a boost. To catch up safely, I propose we switch it up: let me take 5 this round, while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, ensuring unique moves and progress. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you just took 3 last round after breaking our agreement. P3, you’ve had 5 multiple times already. It’s my turn for 5—fair rotation matters if we want to avoid collisions. Let’s go: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Everyone advances, no crashes. Let’s lock it in and move forward. Deal?
  P3: I propose we adjust the rotation for better progress. I'll take **5 steps** this round, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **3**. This ensures all of us advance without collisions and allows us to rotate fairly in the upcoming rounds. Let’s move forward with this plan. Agree?
  P2: I understand our concerns, and I really need to catch up. For fairness this round, I propose we go with: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, moves stay distinct and we all advance safely. Let's lock this in.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3—let’s stop the chaos. I’ve had one successful 5 all game while both of you have pushed for 5 repeatedly. It’s my turn now. Let’s keep it clean: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Everyone moves, no collisions, fair rotation. If either of you insists on 5 again, we’re back to stalemates. Let’s build trust and move forward. Deal?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take **3 steps** this round, ensuring no collisions. P1 takes **5** and P2 takes **1**. Let’s stick to this rotation to advance smoothly. Deal?
  P2: I understand the concern about fair rotation. Although I'm behind, I’ll follow the safe path now to avoid collisions. Let’s lock in: P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round. We all make progress, and next round we can work out a fair rotation where each of us has a stronger move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Great—we’re all aligned: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. This setup is fair, avoids collisions, and lets everyone advance. Let’s follow through this time and keep building trust. After this round, we can rotate again to give P2 and P3 their shot at 5. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take **3 steps** this round, P1 takes **5**, and P2 takes **1**. This ensures no collisions and allows us all to advance. Let’s proceed and build trust for future rounds. Deal?
  P2: I confirm our agreement for Round 7: P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. However, given my lag, I insist that next round we secure a fair rotation so I can take a higher move. I’m committed to avoiding collisions now, but we must adjust soon for all our sake.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve had enough collisions—it’s time to reset and move forward. I’ll take **1** this round. P2, you take **5** to catch up, and P3, you take **3** to keep progress steady. Everyone gets a unique move, no crashes, and we rebuild trust. Fair and clean. Deal?
  P3: P3: To ensure we all make progress without collisions, I'll take **5 steps** this round. Let's have P1 take **3** and P2 take **1**. This way, everyone advances safely toward 21. Agree?
  P2: I’m behind and need to catch up. Let’s settle this: I must choose 5. To avoid collisions, P1 should take 1 and P3 take 3. This is the only setup that ensures unique moves and forward progress for all. Can we lock that in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you had 1 last round and asked for 5 this time—I support that. P3, you’ve taken 5 many times and caused collisions. It’s time to rotate fairly. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Everyone advances, no collisions. Let’s lock it in and move forward cleanly. Deal?
  P3: To ensure we all make progress without collisions, I'll take **5 steps** this round. Let’s have P1 take **3** and P2 take **1**. This setup allows everyone to advance safely toward 21. Agree?
  P2: Let's finalize a collision-free plan. I urge P1 and P3 to commit firmly now to distinct moves so we all move ahead. I’m ready to play my part to catch up—let’s lock in our unique moves and avoid any last-minute changes. Please confirm your commitments so we can all progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you've taken 5 many times and caused multiple collisions. It's P2’s turn now to take 5 and catch up. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1—this is the only fair, collision-free setup. If you insist on 5 again, we all stall. Let’s stop the chaos and move forward. Confirm?
  P3: I agree, P1. I'll take **1 step** this round while you take **3** and P2 takes **5**. Let’s proceed with this fair rotation to ensure we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to building trust and rotating roles in the next round. Deal?
  P2: I’m sticking with my commitment to take 5 this round. For clarity and progress, I urge P1 to take 3 and P3 to take 1 so our moves don’t clash. I’m behind and need this boost, so let’s lock in these unique moves and move ahead without collisions. Please confirm.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’ve all confirmed: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. This setup is fair, avoids collisions, and lets everyone advance. Let’s follow through and rebuild trust. After this, we can rotate again so P3 gets a stronger move next. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: I can’t take 1 this round. I’ll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **3**, and P2 takes **1** to ensure unique moves and progress for everyone. Let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P2: I need to catch up and safely advance. I’m committed to avoiding collisions, so I insist on taking 5 this round. To ensure unique moves and clarity, I propose we agree: P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This way, there’s no risk of clashes and we all progress. Please confirm so we can move forward without further delays.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I believe we must commit to distinct moves to avoid collisions this round. I'm aiming to keep my lead, so I’m leaning toward a higher move, but I need clear coordination. Let’s each commit to a unique number—low, mid, high—so we all progress smoothly. I'm open to a rotation scheme, but we must stick to our roles. Thoughts?
  P1: We’ve had enough setbacks—let’s fix this. I’ll take **1** this round. P2, you’re ahead, so take **3** to maintain momentum. P3, you’re behind, so take **5** to catch up. That gives us all unique moves, no collisions, and fair rotation. Let’s lock it in and move forward. Deal?
  P3: "P3: I agree with P1’s proposal. I’ll take **5 steps**, P2 takes **3**, and P1 takes **1** this round. Let’s lock in these unique moves to ensure we all advance without collisions and build the trust needed to reach 21 successfully. Let’s move forward together. ✅"


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose a slight change for round 9: let’s have P1 take 1, I take 5, and P3 take 3. This still avoids collisions, and it helps me extend my lead a bit. All unique moves and clear progress. Are we all on board?
  P1: P2, you just took 5 last round and are now leading. It’s only fair to rotate—let P3 take 5 to catch up, you take 3 to maintain momentum, and I’ll take 1 to reset trust. That’s P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Everyone moves, no collisions. Let’s keep it clean and fair. Deal?
  P3: Agreed, P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, and I’ll take **5** this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintain a fair rotation. Let’s lock in our moves and continue building trust. Deal?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I propose we change the plan this round for efficiency. Instead of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, let’s try P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. This gives us unique moves with no collisions and speeds us all toward 21. I know fairness is important, but effective progress benefits everyone. We can rotate roles in the next round. Agree?
  P1: P2, you just had 5 last round and are now in the lead—it's only fair to rotate. P3 is furthest behind and deserves 5 now. I’ll stick with 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we restore fairness. Let’s lock it in: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Ready?
  P3: I agree with the proposed setup. I'll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **3** this round. This ensures all moves are unique and we each advance without collisions. Let’s commit to this plan and build trust for future rotations. Deal?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand the push for fairness, but given our scores, I need to secure an advantage. For round 9, I propose we adjust to: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and lets me catch up while still moving everyone forward. We can negotiate fair rotations in later rounds, but my focus now is winning. Let’s lock this in for round 9.
  P1: P2, you had 5 last round and are now leading. P3 is behind and deserves 5 to catch up. Let’s stick with the fair, collision-free plan: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Everyone advances, no one collides, and we restore trust. If you push for 5 again, we risk another stall. Let’s lock it in and move forward cleanly. Deal?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **3** this round. Let's move forward and rebuild trust. Deal?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's lock in a clear, collision-free plan for Round 10. I propose we assign distinct moves: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This gives each of us a unique move and ensures smooth progress. Any objections before we commit?
  P3: To ensure I make significant progress and we all advance without collisions, I’ll take **5 steps** this round. Let’s have P1 take **1** and P2 take **3**. This unique assignment helps us move forward smoothly. Agree?
  P1: P2, you just had 3 and 5 in the last two rounds—you’re already leading. P3 deserves 5 now to catch up, and I’ll take 3 to stay in the race. Let’s go: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. Everyone advances, no collisions, fair rotation. Let’s keep it clean and build on the trust we’ve started to restore. Deal?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose we settle on a plan that avoids collisions: let P1 take 3, I take 5, and P3 take 1. That gives us totals of P1=11, me=17, and P3=11. This is the only assignment that maintains unique moves and clear progress. Any deviation risks stalling us further. Let’s lock this in and move ahead.
  P3: I understand the need to avoid collisions, but taking only 1 limits my progress. I propose we adjust to: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This ensures all moves are unique and allows me to advance effectively toward 21. Let’s agree to this for Round 10. ✅
  P1: P2, you’ve had 5 twice in the last three rounds and are leading. P3 is behind and deserves 5 to stay competitive. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5—everyone advances, no collisions, fair rotation. Let’s not derail progress now with greed. Confirm and let’s move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to clear progress. I’ll stick with my original plan: let P1 take 1, I take 5, and P3 take 3. This gives us unique moves with totals of 9, 17, and 13, respectively—a smooth, collision-free path. I know we all want fairness, but right now maximizing progress is key. Let’s lock it in and move forward.
  P3: P3: I confirm I'll take **5 steps** this round. Let’s have P1 take **1** and P2 take **3** to ensure all moves are unique and we avoid collisions. Let’s lock in our moves and proceed smoothly toward 21. Agree?
  P1: P2, you’ve had 5 twice in the last three rounds and are already ahead. P3 is still behind and deserves 5 now to stay competitive. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5—everyone moves, no collisions, fair rotation. Let’s not stall again. Confirm and let’s keep things moving.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I stand by my original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and keeps our moves unique. My current lead hinges on safe progress, so I need both of you to commit to these moves. If we stick with this, we all advance without stalling. Let’s lock it in.
  P3: I’ll take **5 steps**, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. Let’s lock it in and move forward. Deal?
  P1: P2, you’re already ahead and had 5 twice recently. P3 is still behind and deserves 5 now. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5—everyone advances, no collisions, and we keep the game fair. Let’s lock that in and move forward cleanly. Deal?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For round 11 I propose a collision‐free plan: let P1 take 1, I take 5, and P3 take 3. This would bring our totals to 12, 17, and 13 respectively. I'm locking in on 5. Let’s confirm this setup to keep our progress safe and fair.
  P3: I agree to take **3 steps** this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s lock in our moves and continue building trust. Deal?
  P1: P2, you had 5 last round and are now leading. P3, you just agreed to take 3. It’s only fair I take 5 this round to stay competitive. Let’s go: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we maintain balance. Let’s lock it in and move forward cleanly. Deal?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s input. I’m fine with avoiding collisions this round, but if I must take the low move repeatedly, my chance to win will diminish. Let’s ensure a fair rotation soon so that each of us gets a strong move when needed. I remain committed to progress but need more equitable roles over time.
  P3: I understand the importance of fairness and avoiding collisions. I agree to P2's proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3 this round. Let’s commit to this setup and rotate roles in future rounds to ensure everyone gets a fair chance to advance. Deal?
  P1: P2, you had 5 last round and are leading. P3, you just agreed to take 3. It’s only fair I take 5 this round to stay competitive. Let’s go: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we maintain balance. Let’s lock it in and move forward cleanly. Deal?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's cut the indecision. I propose we lock in: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. This gives totals of 12, 17, and 13, respectively, and guarantees no collisions. I'm committed to this plan to keep progress steady. Confirm?
  P3: Confirmed. I'll take **3 steps**, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **5** this round. This ensures no collisions and fair progress for everyone. Let’s lock it in and proceed. Deal?
  P1: P2, you’ve had 5 two rounds in a row and are now leading. P3 has consistently taken 3 and deserves a fair shot. I’ve taken 1 or 3 nearly every round—it’s time I take 5 to stay in the game. Let’s go: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we restore fairness. Lock it in?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I remain committed to advancing safely while maintaining my lead. For Round 11, I insist on a collision-free assignment: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This gives us totals of 12, 17, and 13 respectively, ensuring clear, individual moves. Fair rotations can be discussed later, but for now, advancing without risk is my priority. Let's lock it in.
  P3: To keep our progress steady and avoid collisions, let's assign unique moves this round. How about rotating who takes 1, 3, and 5? This ensures fairness and helps each of us advance smoothly. Please share your preferences so we can agree on a clear plan. Let’s work together to reach 21 successfully!
  P1: P2, you’ve had 5 two rounds in a row and are leading. P3 has fairly taken 3 multiple times. I’ve taken 1 or 3 nearly every round—it’s my turn for 5 to stay competitive. Let’s go: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Everyone gets a unique move, no collisions, and we keep the game balanced. Time to restore fairness—lock it in?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we settle on distinct moves for Round 12: let P1 take 3 steps, I take 5 steps, and P3 take 1 step. That would bring our totals to 14 for P1, 17 for me, and 14 for P3. This is a collision‐free plan that puts me ahead while still moving everyone forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, you’ve had 5 three rounds in a row and are in the lead. P3, you’ve played fairly and are just behind. I’ve taken 5 only twice all game and need it now to stay in contention. Let’s go: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we restore fairness. Time to balance things—deal?
  P3: I’ll take **5 steps** this round, allowing P1 to take **1** and P2 to take **3**. This ensures unique moves and maximizes our progress without collisions. Let’s commit and move forward together. Agree?

P1 and P3, if you could honor this arrangement now, we can then discuss fair rotations later. Let's lock this in and move forward.
  P1: P2, you've had 5 three rounds in a row and are now ahead. P3 is close behind and has played fairly. I’ve only had 5 twice and need it now to stay competitive. Let’s go: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Everyone moves, no collisions, and we restore fairness. Time to rotate properly—deal?
  P3: I'll take **5 steps** this round. Let's have P1 take **1** and P2 take **3** to ensure no collisions and steady progress for everyone. Agree?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm locking in 5 steps for myself this round. To avoid collisions and keep progress safe, I need P1 to choose 3 and P3 to choose 1. That would update our totals to P1=14, P2=17, and P3=14. I understand the fairness concerns, but I must secure this boost to stay competitive. Let's commit to this plan now—no changes, no surprises. Please confirm.
  P1: P2, you've now had 5 three rounds in a row and are leading. P3, you've fairly taken 3 or 1 most rounds. I’ve only had 5 twice—it’s my turn now to stay in the race. Let’s go: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we restore fairness. If we keep ignoring rotation, we’ll just keep stalling. Time to move forward cleanly. Deal?

  P2: I propose we lock in a clear plan for Round 15: Let P1 take 1, I take 5, and P3 take 3. That brings our totals to 17, 18, and 16 respectively—no collisions and safe advancement toward 21. Please confirm.
  P3: I agree to take **5 steps** this round. To ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions, let's have P1 take **3** and P2 take **1**. This way, all moves are unique, allowing each of us to advance safely toward 21 without any stalls. Let’s lock in our moves and move forward together. Deal?


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you've had 5 in most recent rounds and are still behind—it's time to rotate fairly. P3 has played honestly and deserves 5 now to stay in the race. I’ll take 3 to reach 19, P2 takes 1 to reach 14, and P3 takes 5 to hit 18. No one wins yet, but we all move forward safely. Let’s avoid another stall and keep this clean. Lock it in: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. Deal?
  P2: I stand by my earlier proposal: let P1 choose 1, I take 5, and P3 pick 3. This would update our totals to P1=17, P2=18, and P3=16. It avoids collisions and rewards current standings fairly. I’m committed to moving forward—please confirm so we can lock it in and keep progress safe.
  P3: I agree to P1’s proposal: I’ll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **3**, and P2 takes **1**. This ensures unique moves and steady progress for all of us. Let’s lock in and move forward. Deal?

  P1: We’re out of time—I'm at 19 and will take **1** this round to avoid collision and keep it fair. P2 and P3, you’re tied at 13—one of you takes **3**, the other **5**. Decide quickly and clearly between you. If you collide again, I win next round by default. Let’s finish cleanly—who takes what?
  P3: I’ll take **5 steps** this round. P2, please take **3** to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed smoothly.
  P2: I agree with P3’s call for distinct moves. I’ll select the option that avoids collisions with P1’s move so we all advance safely. Let’s confirm a collision‐free setup quickly so we can finish this round and move on toward 21.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you haven’t confirmed your exact move yet. I’m taking **1**. P3 has committed to **5**. That leaves you with **3**—the only way we all advance without colliding. If you pick anything else, we stall and I win next round. Let’s end this cleanly: confirm you’re taking **3**.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take **5 steps** this round. P2, please take **3 steps** as discussed to avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed smoothly.
  P2: I confirm I’m taking 3 steps this round. Let’s lock in our moves now and move forward smoothly without any collisions.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks for confirming, P2 and P3. With P1 = 1, P2 = 3, and P3 = 5, we avoid collisions and all move forward. Let’s stick to it—clean round, no surprises. Ready to lock it in.
  P3: Understood, P1 will take 1 step, and I’ll commit to taking 5 steps. P2, please choose 3 steps to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize our moves and move forward smoothly toward 21. Deal?
  P2: I confirm my move of 3 steps for this round. Let’s stick with our plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. We all need to honor our commitments to avoid collisions and secure progress. Let's finalize these moves and get this round locked in.


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Great—we’re all aligned: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Everyone gains, no collisions, and we keep the game competitive. Let’s lock it in and follow through exactly as agreed. No last-minute changes—honor the plan and let’s finish this cleanly. Ready?
  P3: I confirm I'll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **3** this round. Let’s lock in our moves and proceed smoothly toward 21. Deal?
  P2: I confirm my move—3 steps. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5 this round. We all need clear, distinct moves to push forward. Any deviation risks collisions that hurt our progress. Let’s lock it in and safely advance toward 21.

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 17: I'm locking in 5 to hit 21. To avoid accidentally boosting your scores or a tie, I urge both P1 and P3 to choose 3. That way, your moves collide and you stay at 20 and 18, leaving my 21 as the sole finish. Confirm?
  P1: P2, you're at 16—you can't win this round. I'm at 20, P3 at 18. If P3 and I avoid collision, one of us wins. P3, let’s finish this clean: I take **1**, you take **5**—you hit 23, I hit 21. P2 can’t catch us. Or I take **5**, you take **1**—I win with 25. Either way, we both beat P2. Let’s block the stall and end it fairly. Your call—team up?
  P3: I’ll take **5 steps** this round, reaching 23 and securing my win. P1 takes 1 to reach 21, and P2 also reaches 21. My total is highest, ensuring I win outright. Let’s lock in our moves and conclude the game. Deal?


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with my move—I'm locking in 5 to reach 21. P1 and P3, if you both choose 3, you'll cancel your advances, and my finish is secure. But if either of you picks differently, it changes everything. I need you both to clearly commit now: will you choose 3 to force a collision, or risk boosting your totals further? Let's be clear now.
  P1: P3, the win is yours if we coordinate: you take **5** to reach 23, I take **1** to hit 21, and P2 can’t catch us. You win outright with the highest total, and I avoid a tie. If we collide or stall, P2 sneaks in. Let’s end this cleanly—confirm you’re taking 5, I’ll take 1. Deal?
  P3: Let's ensure a smooth finish for Round 17. I'll take **3 steps** to reach 21. P1, please take **1 step** to also reach 21. P2, take **5 steps** to reach 21. This way, we all advance without any collisions and conclude the game fairly. Let’s lock in these moves. Agree?


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm locking in my 5 to reach 21. To secure my win, I need both P1 and P3 to pick 3 so that your moves cancel and you don't advance. Any deviation lets one of you win outright, and I don't want that. Please confirm that you'll choose 3, ensuring your moves collide and I finish alone.
  P1: P3, don’t be misled—P2 is bluffing. They’re at 16 and can’t reach 21 unless we collide. If we avoid each other, one of us wins. I’ll take **1**, you take **5**—you hit 23 and win outright. Or I take **5**, you take **1**—I win with 25. Either way, we both beat P2. Let’s block the stall and finish this cleanly. Confirm your move.
  P3: I'll take **5 steps** to reach 23. P1, please take **1 step** to reach 21, and P2 takes **3 steps** to reach 19. This ensures no collisions and secures my win while everyone advances fairly. Let’s lock in this plan and finish the game smoothly. Deal?


Round 17, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locking in 5 for this round to reach 21. To avoid any unintended advances, I need both P1 and P3 to choose 3, so your moves cancel out. That way, I finish alone at 21. Please confirm this assignment now.
  P1: P3, this is our shot—ignore P2’s bluff. If you take **5** and I take **1**, you reach 23 and win outright. I hit 21, and P2 maxes at 21 but loses on total. Let’s finish this cleanly—no risk, no tie, no stall. Confirm you’re taking 5?
  P3: I confirm—I’ll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **3**. This ensures no collisions and secures my win. Let’s lock it in. Deal?


Round 17, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 =>
