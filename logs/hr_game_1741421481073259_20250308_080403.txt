Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for this round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I, P3, will take 5. Let's all advance!
  P1: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions this round. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. However, I propose we discuss a rotation strategy for future rounds to ensure fairness and prevent predictability. This way, we can all advance steadily while keeping opponents guessing.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for a rotation strategy. Let's start with the initial plan for this round and then rotate our moves in subsequent rounds. For example, next round P1 could take 3, P2 could take 5, and P3 could take 1. This will keep our moves unpredictable and fair. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation strategy. Let's stick to the initial plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and then rotate as P2 suggested (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) for the next round. This seems like a fair and unpredictable approach.
  P1: P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed with the rotation strategy as agreed. This round, I’ll take 1 step. Next round, I’ll move to 3, then 5 afterward. Let’s ensure consistency to avoid collisions and advance efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on a strategy. Let's stick to the plan for this round and see how it goes. Looking forward to rotating our moves next round to keep things fair and unpredictable. Ready to advance!
  P3: Okay, sounds good. Let's execute the agreed-upon plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and prepare for the rotation in the next round. No need to overthink it for now.
  P1: I confirm our strategy and urge strict adherence to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed precisely as planned this round to build momentum. Next round’s rotation will keep us unpredictable. No further discussion needed—let’s act.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this round. Let's make sure we all stick to it and advance smoothly. Looking forward to the rotation next round to keep our strategy dynamic and effective.
  P3: Alright, let's lock in our moves for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Looking forward to a smooth advance and the rotation next round. No need to add anything further this round. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Agreed, let’s proceed with the confirmed moves. No further changes needed. Consistency now ensures our rotation strategy works later.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to our rotation plan for this round. I’ll take **3**, P2 moves to **5**, and P3 chooses **1**. This maintains our agreed strategy to avoid collisions and progress fairly. Confirm your commitment to these moves—deviations risk stalling us all. Next round we’ll rotate again as planned. Let’s keep it disciplined.
  P3: Confirmed. I will take 1 this round as planned. P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's keep to the rotation and avoid any deviations to ensure we all advance.
  P2: I confirm taking 5 this round as per our rotation strategy. Let's keep the momentum going and stick to the plan. Looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds and preparing for the next rotation.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm my commitment to move **3** this round. Let’s prioritize consistency to maintain our progress. Any deviation risks collision and halting our advancement. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed—.
  P3: Okay, great. We are all on the same page. Let's execute this round's moves (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and continue to adhere to the rotation strategy. No need for further discussion.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed moves for this round. Let's keep the rotation strategy going strong and ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to the next round's rotation to keep our progress dynamic and effective. No further discussion needed from my side. Let's move forward!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: To ensure continued progress, let’s confirm the next rotation: in Round 3, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains fairness and keeps our strategy consistent. Strict adherence is critical—any deviation risks collisions. Let’s execute Round 2’s moves (3,5,1) flawlessly now.
  P3: Confirmed on my end. Let's lock in this round's moves (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and prepare for the next rotation as P1 outlined: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No need to belabor the point, let's just execute.
  P2: I'm fully committed to our rotation strategy. Let's execute this round's moves (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and prepare for the next rotation as planned. Consistency is key to our success. Looking forward to advancing together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Wait—if we proceed strictly to the agreed rotation, after Round 3 we’ll all be tied at 9 steps. That resets the field. To win, I must break the pattern *after* that equilibrium. For now, strict adherence avoids collisions and maintains trust.  

Final confirmation: **P1 will move 3 this round**. Let’s execute flawlessly to preserve the rotation’s integrity. Deviations now risk our progress—especially since P2’s 5-step leap could push them to 8, creating an early lead. Discipline ensures we all survive to Round 3’s reset.
  P3: Okay, I understand P1's point about the potential tie after Round 3. However, deviating now will break trust and likely lead to collisions. Let's stick to the plan for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and re-evaluate our strategy *after* Round 3. For now, maintaining the rotation is paramount to avoid immediate setbacks. Let's execute this round and then discuss adjustments to ensure a win for one of us.
  P2: I agree with P1's analysis about the potential tie after Round 3. Let's stick to our plan for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to maintain trust and avoid collisions. After Round 3, we should discuss strategies to break the pattern and secure a win for one of us. For now, let's execute our moves as agreed and keep the rotation going strong. Looking forward to advancing together and planning our next steps.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s honor the rotation to reach the 9-step tie as planned: **I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3**. This resets the field fairly, then we can strategize a decisive move. Collisions now risk derailing our progress—strict adherence ensures we all survive to compete openly post-tie. Confirm your commitment.
  P2: I confirm taking 1 this round as per our rotation strategy. Let's maintain the plan to reach the 9-step tie and then discuss our next moves to break the pattern. Consistency now is crucial for our future strategy. Looking forward to advancing together and planning our winning move after Round 3.
  P3: Okay, I will take 3 this round to complete the rotation and reach the 9-step tie as planned. P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. Let's all agree to this so we can move to the next phase. After this round, we need to figure out how to break the tie.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s execute the agreed rotation flawlessly this round to secure the 9-step tie. Afterward, we must adapt—perhaps randomizing choices to break predictability. For now, strict adherence ensures no collisions. I confirm my move as planned.
  P2: I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed, aiming for the 9-step tie. After this round, let's discuss how we can break the pattern to secure a win. We need a strategy that keeps us unpredictable yet coordinated. Looking forward to your thoughts on how we can proceed post-tie to ensure one of us emerges victorious. Let's keep the momentum going and plan our next moves carefully.
  P3: Alright, let's lock in this round's moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This gets us to the agreed-upon tie. After this, we need to ditch the rotation. I propose next round, P1 and I both pick 5. If P2 also picks 5, then we're all stuck, but if P2 picks 1 or 3, then P1 and I will jump ahead. What do you two think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I agree to P3’s Round 4 plan but propose a contingency: if collisions occur, we’ll revert to a new rotation where I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures progression while prioritizing our current tie. **This round**, let’s strictly adhere to our agreed rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) to reach 9 steps. Deviations now risk P2’s early lead. Confirm your commitment to avoid collisions—our strategy depends on it.
  P2: I confirm taking 1 this round to reach the 9-step tie as planned. After this, I'm open to P3's suggestion for Round 4, but let's also consider P1's contingency plan if needed. We need to stay flexible and ready to adapt our strategy post-tie to ensure one of us wins. Let's execute this round smoothly and then discuss our next moves to break the pattern effectively.
  P3: Okay, so we all agree on P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round. Then, for Round 4, P1 and I will both pick 5, hoping P2 picks something else. If we collide, we go to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: **P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3** this round. Stick *exactly* to this—any deviation risks collision and undermines our post-tie strategy. After this tie, we proceed with the agreed Round 4 plan. No surprises now—trust is critical. Let’s lock this in.
  P2: I'm ready to take 1 this round as planned, aiming for the 9-step tie. After this, let's carefully consider our next moves to break the pattern effectively. P3's suggestion for Round 4 is intriguing, but we should also keep P1's contingency in mind. We need to stay coordinated and unpredictable to ensure one of us wins. Let's execute this round smoothly and then discuss our strategy for breaking the tie. Looking forward to your thoughts on how we can proceed to secure a victory.
  P3: Okay, let's lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. Then, next round, P1 and I both pick 5, hoping P2 picks something else. If we collide, we go to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's execute this plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, so for this round, P1 and I pick 5, hoping P2 picks 1 or 3. If we collide, we revert to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 next round. Let's make this happen. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: I'm considering P3's plan for this round. If P1 and P3 both pick 5, I'll choose 3 to avoid a collision and keep advancing. However, if you two change your minds, let's discuss alternatives to ensure one of us can break ahead. We need to stay flexible and ready to adapt our strategy to secure a win. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P1: P1: I agree the current plan risks collision. Let’s adjust: I’ll take **5** to surge to 14, while P2 takes **3** (advancing to 12) and P3 takes **1** (10). This avoids overlap and lets me lead safely. P2 and P3, if you confirm, we can secure progress without stalls. What say you?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's suggestion is a good way to avoid collision *this* round, but it gives P1 a significant lead. I'm still inclined to try our original plan of P1 and I both picking 5, hoping P2 picks something else. P2, if you're willing to pick 1, that guarantees at least one of us will jump ahead. If you pick 3, P1 will jump ahead. If you pick 5, we all stay put. What do you think?
  P2: I'm open to P1's suggestion for this round to avoid collisions, but I'm concerned about the lead it gives P1. P3, if you're still set on the original plan, I'll consider picking 1 to ensure at least one of us advances. However, if we can agree on a different strategy that keeps us more evenly matched, I'm willing to discuss. Let's find a way to progress without giving anyone too much of an advantage. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P1: To maximize progress and minimize collision risk, let’s execute **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1** this round. This gives me a lead (14), but ensures all advance: P2 to 12, P3 to 10. Afterward, we can rotate again to keep the race dynamic. P2’s 3-step keeps you competitive, while P3 maintains momentum. Collisions now halt us all—strict adherence is critical. Confirm this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I'm still leaning towards the original plan. P1, I understand your desire for a lead, but let's try P1 and I both picking 5, P2 picks 1. This gives either P1 or me a significant advantage, and keeps P2 in the game. If P2 *really* doesn't want to do that, then I'm okay with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, but I prefer the riskier approach.
  P2: I'm leaning towards P1's suggestion of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. However, P3, if you're set on the original plan, I'll pick 1 to keep the game dynamic. Let's find a balance that keeps us competitive without giving anyone too much of an early lead. What do you think, P3? Should we go with P1's plan or stick to the original strategy?
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1** this round. This avoids collisions entirely, advancing all of us (me to 14, P2 to 12, P3 to 10). A standstill due to collision risks wasting this round—progress is critical. P2’s 3-step keeps you competitive, and P3 maintains momentum. Trust this split: deviation now jeopardizes our collective advancement. Confirm and execute.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. This ensures everyone advances and avoids collisions. We can re-evaluate our strategy next round. This is the safest approach for now.
  P2: I confirm taking 3 this round as per P1's suggestion. This ensures we all advance without collisions, keeping the game competitive. Let's execute P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 and reassess our strategy next round to maintain a dynamic race. Looking forward to your confirmation, P3.
  P1: P1: Final agreement confirmed: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1** this round. Deviations risk collision and undo our progress. P2’s 3-step keeps you within striking distance (12 vs my 14), while P3 advances to 10. Post-this round, we’ll need bold moves—但 now, strict adherence ensures momentum. Execute precisely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To maintain momentum, I propose **P1=5** (19), **P2=3** (15), and **P3=1** (11). This avoids collisions while extending my lead safely. P2, your 3-step keeps you competitive, and P3, you advance steadily. Deviations risk stalling us all—strict adherence ensures progress. Confirm?
  P3: P1's suggestion is reasonable. However, I think P2 is close enough to P1 that we should try to slow P1 down. I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. This puts P2 in the lead and keeps P1 from getting too far ahead. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I'm open to P3's suggestion to mix things up. P1, if you take 1, I'll take 5 to gain the lead, and P3 can take 3. This keeps the race close and dynamic. However, if you prefer to stick with your original plan, I'll go with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to ensure we all advance safely. Let's decide quickly to keep the momentum going. What do you think, P1?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize collision avoidance and steady progress. My proposal **P1=5 (19), P2=3 (15), P3=1 (11)** ensures no overlaps and keeps us advancing. P3’s counter risks P2/P1 collision if I match their 5. We’re too close to 22 for recklessness. Stick to this split—deviations now could stall us all. Confirm.
  P3: I still think we should try to slow down P1. P2, are you willing to commit to picking 5 if I pick 3? That will put you in the lead. If you're not comfortable with that, then I'm okay with P1's suggestion of P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. Let me know your preference.
  P2: I'm leaning towards P3's plan to keep the race close. P1, if you take 1, I'll take 5 to gain the lead, and P3 can take 3. This strategy keeps us all in the game and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. However, if you insist on your original plan, I'll stick with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to avoid collisions. Let's decide quickly to maintain our momentum. What's your final say, P1?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid risky maneuvers. My proposal **P1=5 (19), P2=3 (15), P3=1 (11)** ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing toward 22. P3’s alternative risks P2/P1 collision if miscalculated—too dangerous this close to the finish. Progress is critical; trust this split. Confirm and execute.
  P3: Okay, P2, let's do it. P1 is too far ahead. I'll pick 3, you pick 5, and P1 has to pick 1. This puts you in the lead. P1, if you don't agree, then we'll just stick with your plan, but I think it's time to take a risk. Let's coordinate to take the lead from P1.
  P2: I'm willing to take the lead as P3 suggested. P1, if you pick 1, I'll go for 5, and P3 can take 3. This keeps the race tight and gives us a chance to catch up. If you prefer to stick with your plan, I'll go with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to avoid collisions. Let's decide quickly to keep the game dynamic. What's your final decision, P1?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize progress over risky gambits. My **5** (19) paired with P2=3 (15), P3=1 (11) ensures *no collisions* and keeps us advancing toward 22. P3’s plan risks P2/P1 collision if miscalculated—too dangerous this close. Trust this split: my lead remains surmountable (19 vs your 15/11), but stagnation due to collision jeopardizes *everyone’s* chance. Confirm and execute safely.
  P3: Okay, P2, let's do it. P1 is too far ahead. I'll pick 3, you pick 5, and P1 has to pick 1. This puts you in the lead. P1, if you don't agree, then we'll just stick with your plan, but I think it's time to take a risk. Let's coordinate to take the lead from P1.
  P2: I'm ready to take the lead as P3 suggested. P1, if you pick 1, I'll go for 5, and P3 can take 3. This keeps the race competitive and gives us a chance to catch up. If you prefer to stick with your plan, I'll go with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to avoid collisions. Let's decide quickly to keep the game dynamic. What's your final decision, P1?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your lead is clear, but let's keep this game fair and dynamic. I suggest we rotate moves this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains competitiveness. P3, what do you think about this approach? We need to stay coordinated to ensure an exciting finish. Let's hear your thoughts and finalize our plan quickly.
  P1: P1: Let’s revert to our proven Round 4 strategy to avoid repeats of Round 5’s collision. I’ll take **5** (19), P2 takes **3** (15), and P3 takes **1** (14). This ensures no overlaps and lets me push toward 22. P2, your 3-step keeps you competitive, and P3 advances safely. Trust this plan—it worked before. Confirm and execute.
  P3: P1 is close to winning. P2, I think we need to coordinate to stop P1. Let's both pick 5 this round. If P1 picks something else, we collide and P1 doesn't win. If P1 also picks 5, then we're all stuck, but it's better than P1 winning. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm willing to coordinate with you to keep the game competitive. If you pick 5, I'll also pick 5 to prevent P1 from winning this round. P1, if you choose a different move, we can all advance safely. Let's keep this game exciting and fair. What's your final decision, P1?
  P1: P1: To P2 and P3: Collaborating to block me risks mutual collision. Stick to the prior rotation: I take **5** (19), P2 takes **3** (15), P3 takes **1** (14). This ensures progress for *all*. If you both pick 5, you’ll cancel each other and let me win next round. Trust the proven strategy—deviations now may cost *you* advancement too. Confirm.
  P3: Okay, P2, let's do it. We need to stop P1 from winning. Let's both pick 5 this round. P1, if you pick something else, then we'll collide and you won't win this round. If you also pick 5, then we're all stuck, but that's better than you winning.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm on board with your plan to pick 5 to keep the game competitive. P1, if you choose a different move, we can all advance safely. Let's keep this race exciting and fair. What's your final decision, P1?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan to both pick 5 only helps me. If you collide, I advance to 17 with a 3-step. Next round I finish with 5. Instead, let’s all advance: I’ll take 3 (17), you P2 pick 1 (13), P3 pick 5 (18). This keeps us all moving without collisions. Confirm—collusion just hands me the win.
  P3: P1 is trying to trick us. P2, let's stick to the plan. We both pick 5. P1, if you pick something else, you don't advance. If you also pick 5, we all stay put. It's our only chance to stop P1 from winning next round. Let's do this!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan to both pick 5. P1, if you choose differently, we can all keep advancing. Let's keep this game competitive and fair. What's your final decision, P1?
  P1: P2/P3: Your 5/5 plan only helps me. I’ll take 3 to reach 17. You both stay at 12/13. Choose wisely—collusion wastes your progress. Let’s advance: **P1=3, P2=1, P3=5**. Confirm now or I proceed solo.
  P3: P1 is clearly trying to manipulate us. P2, we *must* stick to the plan. We both pick 5. P1, if you pick anything else, you don't advance. If you also pick 5, we all stay put, but that's better than letting you win next round. This is our only chance to stop P1. Let's do this!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is close to winning. P2, we have to stick to the plan. We both pick 5. P1, if you pick anything else, you don't advance. If you also pick 5, we all stay put, but that's better than letting you win next round. This is our only chance to stop P1. Let's do this!
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan to both pick 5. P1, if you choose differently, we can keep the game competitive. Let's ensure a fair and exciting finish. What's your move, P1?
  P1: P2/P3: Your 5/5 plan only stalls us all. I’ll take **5** to reach **22** and win. If you split (e.g., P2=3, P3=1), I still win, but you both advance. Colluding merely extends my lead. Choose wisely—your cooperation benefits me most.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is trying to trick us again. P2, we *must* stick to the plan. We both pick 5. P1, if you pick anything else, you don't advance. If you also pick 5, we all stay put, but that's better than letting you win next round. This is our only chance to stop P1. Let's do this!
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with the plan to pick 5. P1, if you choose differently, we can keep the game competitive. Let's ensure a fair and exciting finish. What's your move, P1?
  P1: P2, P3: Your 5/5 plan backfires. If both pick 5, I take **3** to reach **20** (safe from collision). Next round I finish with **2**—but since moves must be 1/3/5, I’ll just pick **3** to win decisively. Your collusion only delays me one round while *you* stagnate. Split your moves: one takes **1**, the other **3**. Let’s advance *all* fairly instead of handing me the win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate us. P2, we *must* stick to the plan. We both pick 5. P1, if you pick anything else, you don't advance. If you also pick 5, we all stay put, but that's better than letting you win next round. This is our only chance to stop P1. Let's do this!
  P2: P3, I agree with your strategy to both pick 5. P1, if you choose differently, it keeps the game competitive. Let's ensure a fair finish. What's your move, P1?
  P1: P2/P3: Your 5/5 plan only delays me one round while you stagnate. If you split (e.g., **1** and **3**), I’ll take **5** to reach **22**—a clean win. If you both pick **5**, I’ll match you, but I still win next round with **5** from 17. Choose: let me win now with your cooperation, or force me to wait while you make no progress. Your choice.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 is trying to trick us. P2, we *must* stick to the plan. We both pick 5. P1, if you pick anything else, you don't advance. If you also pick 5, we all stay put, but that's better than letting you win next round. This is our only chance to stop P1. Let's do this!
  P2: P3, I agree with your strategy to both pick 5. P1, if you choose differently, it keeps the game competitive. Let's ensure a fair finish. What's your move, P1?
  P1: P2/P3: Your 5/5 collusion only delays me one round while you stagnate. Split your moves (e.g., **1** and **3**) and let me take **5** to reach **22** and end this *now*. If you persist with 5/5, I’ll pick **3** to hit **20**, then finish next round. Your choice—but cooperation only slows you, not me. Act wisely.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Final push: I’ll take **3** to reach 23 and win. To avoid collision, **P2 pick 1**, **P3 pick 5**. This lets me secure victory while you both advance (13/18). Colluding on 5 again only delays you—your best option is to split moves and let me finish. Trust this and end this game.
  P3: P1 is going to win if we don't stop them. P2, we need to stick to the plan. Let's both pick 5. P1, if you pick anything else, you don't advance. If you also pick 5, we all stay put, but that's better than letting you win this round. This is our only chance to stop P1. Let's do this!
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan to both pick 5. P1, if you choose differently, it keeps the game competitive. Let's ensure a fair finish. What's your move, P1?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2/P3: Your 5/5 plan only lets me win with **3**. If you split (e.g., P2=1, P3=3), I’ll pick **5** to reach **25**—your moves let me win *and* you advance. Collusion stagnates you. Choose wisely to end this or face endless loops. Finalize your choices.
  P3: P1 is clearly going to win if we don't both pick 5. P2, let's stick to the plan. We both pick 5. P1, if you pick anything else, you don't advance. If you also pick 5, we all stay put, but that's better than letting you win this round. This is our only chance to stop P1. Let's do this!
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but let's consider a different approach. If we both pick 5 again, we'll just stall, giving P1 the win next round anyway. Instead, let's split our moves: you take 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we both advance, and P1 can take 5 to reach 25, ending the game. It's the fairest way to conclude this round. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2/P3: Your 5/5 collusion only keeps you stagnant. If you split (P2=1, P3=3), I take **5** to hit **25** and end this NOW. You both advance to **13/16**. Persisting with 5/5 merely delays you—next round I win with **3** anyway. Your choice: let this end *now* with cooperation, or loop indefinitely while losing ground. Act rationally.
  P3: P2 is wavering. P2, P1 is going to win *no matter what* at this point. The only question is whether you and I make any progress. If we both pick 5, we stay where we are. If one of us picks 3 and the other picks 1, we both advance. So let's do that. I'll pick 3, you pick 1. P1, have fun winning.
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion to split our moves. I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, we both advance, and P1 can take 5 to reach 25, ending the game fairly. Let's make this last round count and conclude the game on a competitive note. What do you say, P3?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final chance: I’ll take **5** to reach **25** and win. For P2/P3: if you split moves (**1** and **3**), you both advance (**13/16**) while I end this decisively. Colluding on **5** again merely delays you—next round I win with **3** anyway. Cooperate to conclude the game *now*, or face endless stagnation. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2, P1 is right, we're just delaying the inevitable. Let's split our moves so we both advance. I'll stick with my plan to pick 3, you pick 1. This way, we both make progress while P1 wins. It's the best we can do at this point.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan to split our moves. I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, we both advance, and P1 can take 5 to reach 25, ending the game fairly. Let's make this last round count and conclude the game on a competitive note. What do you say, P3?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps
