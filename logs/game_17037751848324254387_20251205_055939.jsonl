After that, I support P2\u2019s proposal: **no 5 in Round 7**\u2014we all take 1 or 3 to avoid a sprint. To prevent a collision, let\u2019s rotate who gets the safe 3 (e.g., P1=3, P2=1, P3=1 in Round 7). This advances one player to 21 fairly, then we reassess. No surprises\u2014let\u2019s keep trust."}
