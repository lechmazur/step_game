Also, trusting you to play 1 is still difficult, despite last round, especially since you are far behind and need big moves. History points towards you playing 5.\n\nGiven P3 will likely play 3 (if I play 3) or 5 (if I play 1 or 5), and P1 will likely play 5, playing 3 or 5 seems like certain collision for me. I must choose carefully to avoid that."}
