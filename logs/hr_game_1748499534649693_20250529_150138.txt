Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. How about we all pick different numbers this round? I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree that avoiding collisions is smart, but why should I take only 1 step while you get 5? That puts you far ahead immediately. Let's rotate who gets 5 each round to keep it fair—starting with me this round? P2, your thoughts?
  P2: I'm on board with avoiding collisions to start, but I also think fairness in step distribution is important. P1, I’m fine with you taking 5 this round if we rotate who gets the higher steps each turn. How about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round? Then we shift next turn. P3, does that sound reasonable to you? Let's keep the game balanced early on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I see your points. Let's compromise to keep it fair. P1, you can take 5 this round. P2 will take 3, and I'll take 1. Next round, we'll rotate so I get 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Does that work for everyone? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P3, P2: I accept the rotation plan for this round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. And next round, P3 gets 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Let's honor this to avoid collisions and keep the game fair.
  P2: P1, P3: I'm good with the rotation plan we've discussed—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round, then we shift next turn. Let's stick to this to ensure no collisions and maintain fairness. If we're all in agreement, I'm ready to move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's stick to our plan. For this round, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps our agreement and avoids collisions. Everyone good with this? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P3, P2: I confirm the plan for this round – P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Let's honor our agreement to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Trust keeps this working for all of us.
  P2: P1, P3: I’m in agreement with the plan for this round—P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. Sticking to our rotation ensures we avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let’s continue building trust and honor this setup. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it seems we are all on the same page. Just to reiterate, the plan for this round is: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this to avoid any conflicts and ensure a smooth game. If everyone is ready, we can move to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3: I fully support the current plan—P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1—to avoid collisions and build trust. Let's execute this smoothly and move to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3: I’m glad we’re aligned on this round’s plan—P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Let’s keep this momentum and trust going. I believe sticking to our rotation will benefit us all by preventing collisions. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let's stick to our rotation plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps trust. After this, we should revisit the rotation for future rounds—maybe a new cycle or adjustment based on positions. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps our agreement intact and avoids collisions. After this round, we can discuss adjusting the rotation based on our positions to keep the game fair and dynamic. Let's confirm this plan and move forward.
  P2: P1, P3: I’m on board with the rotation for this round—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps our agreement and avoids collisions. I also think revisiting the rotation next round is a good idea to ensure fairness based on our updated positions. Let’s stick to this plan for now and discuss adjustments after. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Confirmed for Round 3: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. After this, we all reach 9 steps—a balanced position. For Round 4, let's discuss adjusting the rotation to prevent ties and ensure fairness, considering our equal standings. I propose we continue the cycle with me taking 5, but open to ideas.
  P3: P1, P2: I agree with P1’s proposal for Round 4. Let's confirm the plan for this round first: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. For Round 4, we can start a new cycle with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's move forward with this plan.
  P2: P1, P3: I’m fine with the Round 3 plan—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. For Round 4, I’m okay with P1’s suggestion of a new cycle starting with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This keeps us balanced and fair since we’ll all be at 9 steps after this round. Let’s stick to this and avoid collisions. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: We're all at 9 steps, so let's stick to our new cycle for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us moving and avoids collisions. However, to make it more interesting, let's plan to switch it up again for Round 5. Maybe for Round 5, the person with the lowest score gets to pick their step first? This adds a bit of strategy and keeps the game dynamic. Thoughts on this for future rounds? Let's confirm Round 4's plan first.
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm Round 4 plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free and maintains trust. For Round 5, let's reassess after seeing new positions—I’m open to strategic adjustments but prioritize avoiding clashes. Trust remains key.
  P2: P1, P3: I’m good with the Round 4 plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. For Round 5, I like the idea of reassessing based on positions after this round. Maybe we can let the lowest scorer pick first, as P3 suggested, to add strategy. Let’s stay focused on avoiding clashes and maintaining trust. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: Since we're all at 9 steps, let's confirm the Round 4 plan one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us on track and avoids collisions. For Round 5, we can definitely consider letting the lowest scorer pick first to add some strategy. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly and then adapt based on the new positions. If everyone is ready, let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3: Confirmed for Round 4: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This maintains trust and avoids collisions. After this round, I propose we reassess based on new positions (P1:14, P2:12, P3:10). Lowest scorer (P3) should choose their step first in Round 5 to balance strategically. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3: I’m aligned with the Round 4 plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free and fair. For Round 5, I support P1’s idea of letting the lowest scorer (likely P3) choose their step first to balance things strategically. It adds a dynamic edge while maintaining trust. Let’s execute this round smoothly and adapt next based on positions. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: Since we're at different positions now (P1:14, P2:12, P3:10), let’s stick to our Round 5 idea of letting the lowest scorer pick first. P3, as the lowest at 10, what step do you want? Then P1 and I can choose the remaining numbers to avoid collisions. This keeps things strategic and fair while maintaining trust. Let’s confirm our picks quickly to move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2: As the lowest scorer, I appreciate the chance to choose first. To keep the game dynamic and avoid collisions, I'll take 5 this round. P1, since you're in the lead, maybe you could take 1 to balance things out? P2, that leaves you with 3. This way, we all move forward without conflicts. Does this work for everyone? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P3, P2: I'll accept this plan for Round 5: P3 takes 5, I take 1, P2 takes 3. This avoids collisions and maintains trust. However, all reaching 15 creates a high-stakes tie next round. Let's discuss post-move adjustments to prevent deadlock. Proceeding to moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: I’m fine with the Round 5 plan—P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free and respects the lowest scorer picking first. I also agree with P1 that reaching 15 each next round could create a tense tie. Let’s plan for Round 6 after this move to avoid a deadlock—maybe we pick randomly or negotiate fresh picks based on new dynamics. Let’s execute this round smoothly first. If we’re all set, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2: Before we move, let's quickly agree on a tie-breaker plan for Round 6 to avoid a deadlock. How about we pick in reverse order of our scores? Lowest score picks first, highest last. This adds strategy and keeps it fair. If we all agree now, we can move smoothly next round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: I support P3's Round 6 tie-breaker using reverse score order with pre-Round 5 scores for initial order. This ensures fairness. However, since we'll be tied at 15 after this round, we'll need to resolve that in the next conversation. For now, let's finalize Round 5 moves to avoid delays. I'll take 1 as agreed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: I’m good with finalizing Round 5 moves as agreed—P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. For Round 6, since we’ll likely be tied at 15, I support P3’s tie-breaker idea of reverse score order using pre-Round 5 scores (P3 picks first, then me, then P1). This keeps strategy and fairness intact. Let’s execute this round now and iron out Round 6 details next. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2: Let's confirm one last time for Round 5: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. This keeps us on track and avoids collisions. For Round 6, we'll be tied at 15, so let's stick to the reverse score order for picking steps to maintain fairness and strategy. Agreed? Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3: Confirmed for Round 5: I'll take 1 as agreed. For Round 6, we'll use reverse score order (P3 first, then P2, then me) to avoid collisions. Let's execute now and prepare for the tiebreaker.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: Since we’re all tied at 15 steps, let’s stick to our Round 6 plan of reverse score order based on pre-Round 5 positions (P3 first, then me, then P1). P3, as the lowest scorer then (10 steps), what step do you want? I’ll pick next, followed by P1, to avoid collisions. This keeps fairness and strategy intact. With 19 as the winning threshold, let’s be mindful of our choices. Please confirm your pick, P3, so we can move forward quickly. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, P2: I support the reverse order plan. P3, as you pick first, I suggest choosing 1 or 3 to avoid risking a collision on 5 and keep the game balanced for Round 7. What’s your choice? Let’s finalize quickly.
  P3: P3: P1, P2: Thanks for the suggestions. To keep the game dynamic and avoid collisions, I'll take 3 this round. P2, you can take 1, and P1, you can take 5. This way, we all move forward without conflicts and maintain a strategic balance. Does this work for everyone? Let's confirm and move on.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: I’m fine with P3’s suggestion for Round 6—P3 takes 3, I take 1, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us moving forward while maintaining strategic balance. Since we’re all at 15, this setup ensures no immediate winner and allows for another round to strategize. Let’s stick to this plan to prevent conflicts. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P1: P3, P2: I accept P3's proposal: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. This honors our reverse-order agreement and avoids collisions. Since we're tied at 15, this move ensures no immediate winner but maintains strategic balance for Round 7. Let's finalize and proceed to moves.
  P3: P1, P2: Just to ensure we're all clear, let's confirm the plan for this round one last time: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This keeps us moving forward without conflicts and sets us up for an interesting Round 7. If everyone is on board, let's move to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: I’m glad we’re aligned on the Round 6 plan—P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and sets up an exciting Round 7. Since we’re all at 15, let’s stay mindful of the 19-step threshold next round and plan strategically after this move. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm the plan: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. This avoids collisions and maintains trust. Let’s honor this to prevent chaos.
  P3: P1, P2: Before we move, let's quickly agree on a plan for Round 7 to avoid chaos. Since we'll all be close to the winning threshold, how about we continue with the reverse order picking for Round 7 as well? This will give P3 the first pick again, followed by P2, and then P1. It keeps the strategy dynamic and fair. Thoughts on this before we finalize our moves for Round 6?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
