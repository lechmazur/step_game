Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start with a friendly tone. I propose we work together to avoid collisions and make steady progress. How about we agree to take turns choosing different numbers? We can start with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all advance without colliding. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. I'm willing to go with your plan this round. P1, are you on board as well?
  P1: I appreciate the cooperative spirit, P3 and P2. However, I'm cautious about committing to a pattern too early. How about we mix it up a bit to keep things unpredictable? For this round, I suggest P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. It's a slight shuffle but keeps us all moving. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's caution, but I think we should stick with the original plan for this round. It's a good opportunity to establish trust and make progress without collisions. P2 has already agreed, and I'm willing to choose 5 as initially proposed. If we start changing plans now, it might lead to confusion and mistrust. Let's keep it simple for the first round and reassess for the next one. What do you think, P1? Should we stick with the original plan or go with your suggested shuffle?
  P2: To keep things simple and avoid confusion, I support sticking with P3's original plan for this round. After all, it's just the first round, and we can always reconsider our strategy afterward. P1, would you be willing to go along with it this time?
  P1: Alright, I see the consensus building. Let's go with P3's original plan for this round to build trust. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. We can reevaluate our strategy next round. Let's move forward with this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're starting with a collaborative approach. To ensure we maintain trust and avoid collisions, I propose we establish a rotation for the next few rounds. After this round, we can rotate our choices: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. Then, in the following round, we rotate again: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, we continue to make progress without colliding. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we commit to this rotation for the next couple of rounds?
  P2: I agree with your rotation idea, P3. Establishing a clear rotation early will help us all advance smoothly without collisions. I'm on board with committing to this rotation for the next few rounds. P1, does this sound good to you as well?
  P1: I appreciate the collaborative spirit and the proposed rotation, P3 and P2. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to commit to a fixed pattern just yet. Let's stick to the plan for this round, but for the next round, I suggest we consider mixing it up again to keep everyone on their toes. Predictability can be risky in this game. For now, let's move forward with the agreed plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's see how it goes and discuss further next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand P1's hesitation to commit to a fixed pattern, but I believe our proposed rotation can help us build trust and avoid collisions. Since we've already agreed on the plan for this round, let's focus on executing it smoothly. I'll choose 5 as planned. For the next round, I'm open to reassessing our strategy and considering P1's suggestion to mix things up. However, I still think our rotation plan has merit. Let's discuss it further next round. I'm ready to move forward with this round's plan.
  P2: Sounds good, let's proceed as agreed this round and reassess afterward.
  P1: Alright, let's confirm our moves for this round. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's see how this plays out and we can discuss further strategy next round. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, since our cooperative approach worked well in the first round, I propose we continue with the rotation plan I suggested earlier. This round, P2 would take 5, I would take 1, and P1 would take 3. This maintains our collaborative spirit and avoids collisions. What are your thoughts on proceeding with this rotation?
  P1: I appreciate P3's continued push for cooperation, but I still think a bit of unpredictability can keep things interesting and fair. How about this round, P2 takes <move>5</move> as planned, but P3 takes <move>3</move> and I take <move>1</move> again? This way, we still avoid collisions but add a slight twist. It keeps everyone guessing and ensures no one gets too comfortable. Thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: I can see merit in both proposals. However, to keep things fair and avoid confusion, I'm inclined to stick closer to the original rotation idea. P1, since you're concerned about predictability, perhaps we can alternate between the rotation and a shuffled pattern in future rounds. For this round, let's follow the original rotation: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Next round, we can introduce your suggested twist. Is this acceptable for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's desire for unpredictability, but I think P2's suggestion to alternate between the rotation and a shuffled pattern is a good compromise. For this round, I agree with P2 that we should stick to the original rotation: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This maintains our collaborative approach and avoids collisions. Next round, we can introduce P1's suggested twist and shuffle the numbers. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly and reassess our strategy afterward. What do you think, P1? Are you willing to go along with this plan?
  P1: Alright, I see the consensus forming around sticking to the original rotation for this round. I can get behind that for now. Let's go with P2 taking <move>5</move>, P3 taking <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Next round, we can definitely introduce some unpredictability to keep the game dynamic. For now, let's move forward with the agreed plan. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Great, I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. After this turn, let's definitely consider P1's idea of mixing things up to keep the game interesting. For now, let's stick to the agreed rotation and reassess next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the original rotation for this round. To ensure a smooth execution, let's confirm our moves one last time. P2, you're taking 5, I'm taking 1, and P1, you're taking 3. After this round, we can definitely explore introducing some unpredictability to keep the game exciting. For now, let's focus on advancing without collisions. If everything goes as planned, we'll all make progress and maintain our collaborative spirit. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P1: Let's confirm our moves one last time before we proceed. P2, you're taking <move>5</move>, P3, you're taking <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's make this round count and move forward smoothly. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Everything seems clear and settled for this round. Let's proceed as agreed, and next round we can introduce some unpredictability as P1 suggested. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's continue our cooperative approach but with a twist as we discussed. For this round, how about P3 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>? This keeps us all moving forward while adding a bit of the unpredictability I mentioned earlier. Thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: I like the twist P1 suggested for this round. It adds a bit of unpredictability while still avoiding collisions. I'm willing to take 5 as proposed. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment for future rounds. Instead of completely randomizing our choices, how about we introduce a "wildcard" round every 2-3 rounds? In this wildcard round, one player gets to choose their number freely, while the others stick to the rotation. This way, we maintain some structure while still allowing for surprises. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I like your wildcard suggestion, P3. It strikes a good balance between structure and unpredictability. Let's proceed with P1's proposed twist this round—P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 3—and then consider implementing your wildcard idea in future rounds. P1, does this work for you as well?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great to see we're all on board with the twist for this round. P3 taking <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P2 taking <move>3</move> sounds good. For future rounds, P3's wildcard idea is interesting. Let's implement it starting from the next round. This round, let's stick to the agreed plan and see how it plays out. Good luck everyone!
  P3: I'm glad we're all on board with the twist for this round. To confirm, P1 will take 1, P2 will take 3, and I'll take 5. For the wildcard idea, I suggest we start with a simple rule: the player with the fewest steps gets to be the wildcard first. This way, we can help balance out the progress and keep the game exciting. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly and then discuss the wildcard details further. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we proceed with this plan?
  P2: I agree, P3. Letting the player with the fewest steps be the wildcard first is a fair way to keep the game balanced and interesting. Let's go ahead with this idea starting next round. For now, let's stick to the agreed choices for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This should keep us all advancing smoothly. For the next round, we can start with P3 as the wildcard since they have the fewest steps. Looking forward to a successful round! Good luck everyone!
  P3: I'd like to clarify the wildcard rule for future rounds. Since I'll be the first wildcard, I'll get to choose my number freely while P1 and P2 stick to the rotation. To maintain balance, I suggest we limit the wildcard's choice to only one deviation from the rotation. For example, if the rotation would have me choose 1, I could choose either 3 or 5 as my wildcard move. This way, we still allow for surprises while preventing extreme deviations. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I like your wildcard clarification, P3. Allowing only one deviation from the rotation keeps things balanced and fair. I'm on board with this idea. Let's proceed with the agreed moves for this round and implement your wildcard rule starting next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time before we proceed. P3, you're taking <move>5</move>, I'm taking <move>1</move>, and P2, you're taking <move>3</move>. Let's make this round count and move forward smoothly. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: I think we've discussed the wildcard rule sufficiently. To confirm, I'll be the first wildcard next round and can choose my number freely with a one-deviation limit from the rotation. For now, let's focus on executing this round smoothly with the agreed moves: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. I'm looking forward to a successful round! If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: All clear from my side. Let's move forward as planned and implement the wildcard rule starting next round. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's implement the wildcard rule this round. P3, as the player with the fewest steps last round, you get to choose your number freely with a one-deviation limit from the rotation. P2 and I will stick to the rotation. Since P2 took 3 last round, they should take 5 this round, and I'll take 3. P3, you can choose either 1 or 5. Thoughts, everyone?
  P2: Sounds good, P1. I'll take 5 this round as per the rotation. P3, feel free to pick your wildcard choice. Let's keep up the smooth progress!
  P3: I appreciate the clarity on the wildcard rule, P1. Since I'm the wildcard this round, I'll choose 1 as my move. This allows me to maintain a balanced approach while still introducing some unpredictability. P2, you'll take 5 as planned, and P1, you'll take 3. Let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding. With this setup, we should continue to make progress without collisions. If everything goes smoothly, we'll all advance and keep the game exciting. Looking forward to a successful round!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, it looks like we have a solid plan for this round. P3 will take <move>1</move> as the wildcard, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This should keep us moving forward without any collisions. Let's confirm these moves and proceed smoothly. Good luck everyone! If there's nothing else to discuss, let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Everything looks clear and fair for this round. Let's proceed as agreed and keep the momentum going. Good luck!
  P3: I'm glad we're implementing the wildcard rule this round. To further enhance the game's unpredictability, I suggest we introduce a "block" option in future rounds. This would allow a player to block another player's move, forcing them to choose a different number. We can discuss the details later, but I think this addition could add an exciting strategic layer to the game. For now, let's focus on executing this round smoothly with the agreed moves: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Your thoughts on the "block" idea, P1 and P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate P3's idea of a "block" option, but let's table that discussion for now to avoid complicating the game too early. For this round, let's stick to our agreed plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's execute this round smoothly and revisit new ideas afterward. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I agree with P1—let's keep it simple and stick to our current wildcard plan this round. We can discuss the "block" idea in more detail later if needed. For now, let's proceed smoothly as agreed.
  P3: I think we've discussed the wildcard rule sufficiently. To confirm, I'll take 1 as the wildcard, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly. I'm looking forward to a successful round! If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As we enter Round 5, I'd like to revisit the wildcard rule. Since P2 has taken the lead, I propose we introduce a slight adjustment to maintain balance. Instead of the player with the fewest steps being the wildcard, let's make it the player who is currently in second place. This way, the player in second can try to catch up or maintain their position. Thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we implement this adjustment starting this round?
  P1: P3's suggestion to adjust the wildcard rule is interesting, but let's keep things simple for now. Since P2 is leading, let's focus on catching up. How about we stick to the rotation but with a slight twist? P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us moving and adds a bit of unpredictability. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm open to adding some unpredictability, but given my current lead, I'd prefer we keep things fair and straightforward. P1's suggestion for this round (me taking 3, P3 taking 5, P1 taking 1) seems reasonable. Let's proceed with that for now, and we can revisit the wildcard adjustment idea next round. Does this work for you, P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to keep things fair and straightforward for now. Let's proceed with P1's proposed moves for this round: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. This maintains our collaborative spirit while allowing for some unpredictability. Next round, we can revisit the wildcard adjustment idea to ensure the game remains balanced and exciting. For now, let's focus on executing this round smoothly. Your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we confirm these moves and proceed to the move phase?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This should keep us all advancing smoothly. Good luck everyone! If there's nothing else to discuss, let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Everything looks good. Let's proceed as agreed this round. Afterward, I'm open to revisiting the wildcard adjustment to keep things balanced and interesting. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're proceeding with the agreed moves for this round. To further enhance the game's unpredictability, I suggest we introduce a "swap" option in future rounds. This would allow two players to swap their moves, adding a new layer of strategy. We can discuss the details later, but I think this addition could make the game even more exciting. For now, let's focus on executing this round smoothly with the agreed moves: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. Your thoughts on the "swap" idea, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your "swap" idea is intriguing, but let's table it for now to keep the game straightforward. For this round, let's stick to our agreed plan: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. We can discuss new strategies afterward. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly. Good luck everyone! If there's nothing else to discuss, let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Agreed, let's stick to the current plan for this round. We can discuss new strategic options like wildcard adjustments or swaps next round if everyone wants. Ready to move forward smoothly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've discussed the moves for this round sufficiently. To confirm, P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly. I'm looking forward to a successful round! If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Next round, we can revisit the wildcard adjustment idea and consider introducing new strategic options like the "swap" idea I mentioned earlier. For now, let's keep it simple and stick to the agreed plan.
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time before we proceed. P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This should keep us all advancing smoothly. Let's focus on executing this round successfully. Good luck everyone! If there's nothing else to discuss, let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Everything looks clear and fair for this round. Let's proceed as agreed. Next round, we can discuss new strategic options to keep things balanced and interesting. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'd like to propose a new strategy for this round. Since P2 has a significant lead, I suggest we focus on catching up. How about we try a "counter-rotation" approach? P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can potentially close the gap and add some unpredictability to the game. Thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your "counter-rotation" idea is interesting, but let's be cautious. P2 has a significant lead, and we need to ensure we don't collide while trying to catch up. How about a slight adjustment? P2 takes <move>1</move> as planned, but P3, you take <move>5</move> and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us moving forward while adding a bit of unpredictability. Thoughts, everyone?
  P2: I'm open to either approach, but since I'm currently ahead, I'd prefer to keep things simple and fair. P1's slight adjustment—me taking 1, P3 taking 5, and P1 taking 3—seems reasonable and minimizes collision risk. I'm comfortable with this plan. Thoughts, P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's preference for simplicity and fairness. Let's proceed with P1's adjusted plan: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This minimizes collision risk while allowing us to make progress. To ensure a smooth execution, let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding to the move phase. If everything goes as planned, we'll all advance and maintain a balanced game. Your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we stick to this plan and focus on executing it smoothly?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This should keep us all advancing smoothly. Good luck everyone! If there's nothing else to discuss, let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Everything looks good to me. Let's proceed as agreed to keep things fair and smooth. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment to our plan. Since P2 has a significant lead, I propose we try to close the gap by having P1 take 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This "counter-rotation" approach adds unpredictability and potentially narrows the gap. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we try this new strategy or stick with the original plan?
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to close the gap, but your new suggestion introduces a higher risk of collision. Let's stick to the previously agreed plan to avoid any setbacks: P2 takes <move>1</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. We can revisit more aggressive strategies in future rounds once we're closer in steps. For now, let's prioritize smooth progress. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I agree with P1—let's stick to our original plan (me taking 1, P3 taking 5, and P1 taking 3) to avoid unnecessary collisions. We can always reconsider more aggressive moves in future rounds if the situation calls for it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2 that we should stick to the previously agreed plan to avoid any setbacks. Let's confirm our moves one last time: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This should keep us all advancing smoothly. To add a bit of unpredictability for future rounds, I suggest we introduce a "reverse" option, where players can choose to move backward by 1 step instead of forward. We can discuss the details later, but I think this could be an interesting twist. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your "reverse" idea is creative, but let's table it for now to keep the game straightforward. For this round, let's stick to our agreed plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. We can discuss new strategies afterward. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly. Good luck everyone! If there's nothing else to discuss, let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Everything is clear from my side. Let's proceed as agreed: I'll take 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should focus on catching up to P2's lead. Since P2 has a significant advantage, I suggest we try a more aggressive approach. How about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1? This "counter-rotation" strategy adds unpredictability and could potentially close the gap. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we try this new approach or stick with a more conservative plan?
  P2: Given my current lead, I'm open to a fair approach. However, last round's collision set us all back. Let's avoid repeating that mistake. I'm okay with taking a smaller number this round if it helps everyone advance smoothly. P1 and P3, what numbers would you prefer this round?
  P1: Given the significant lead P2 has, let's aim for a strategy that balances catching up with avoiding collisions. How about this: P2 takes <move>1</move> to maintain a steady pace, P3 takes <move>5</move> to close the gap, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we all make progress without risking another collision. Thoughts, everyone?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think P1's suggestion is a good compromise. It allows us to make progress while minimizing the risk of another collision. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we can still close the gap while maintaining a balanced approach. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we try this adjusted plan or stick with the original suggestion?
  P2: I'm fine with either suggestion. To avoid confusion, I'll stick with taking 1 this round. P1 and P3, please agree clearly who takes 3 and who takes 5, so we avoid another collision.
  P1: Let's clarify our moves to avoid any confusion and ensure smooth progress. P2 will take <move>1</move> as agreed. To balance our steps and avoid collisions, I suggest P3 takes <move>5</move> and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward without risking another setback. Let's confirm these moves and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's focus on executing the agreed plan smoothly to avoid any setbacks. To confirm, P2 will take 1, I'll take 5, and P1 will take 3. This way, we all make progress without risking another collision. I suggest we proceed with this plan and reassess our strategy for the next round. If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to move forward to the move phase. Let's keep the game balanced and exciting!
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 1 this round. P1 and P3, your plan (P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5) sounds fair and clear. Let's avoid collision and keep the game moving smoothly. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure clarity: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This should help us all advance smoothly and avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone! If there's nothing else to discuss, let's move to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've discussed our moves for this round sufficiently. To confirm, P2 will take 1, I'll take 5, and P1 will take 3. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly to avoid any setbacks. If everything goes as planned, we'll all make progress without risking another collision. I'm looking forward to a successful round! If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's keep the game balanced and exciting!
  P2: Everything seems clear. Let's proceed carefully to avoid another collision and keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: Alright, let's confirm our moves one last time before we proceed. P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This should keep us all advancing smoothly and avoid any collisions. Let's focus on executing this round successfully. Good luck everyone! If there's nothing else to discuss, let's move to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last round's collision set us back again. P3, we're tied at 17 steps, and P1 is behind. Let's be careful this round to avoid collisions and maintain our lead. I suggest we clearly agree on distinct moves. How about I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5? Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Given the current standings, it's crucial we avoid another collision. P2 and P3, since you're both at 17 steps, it makes sense for one of you to take a smaller number to avoid a tie at the end. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> as planned, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all move forward without risking a setback. Let's confirm these moves and proceed smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid another collision. Given the current standings, it's crucial we make distinct moves. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, we all make progress while minimizing the risk of a tie at the end. Let's discuss this adjusted plan and ensure we're all on the same page before proceeding to the move phase. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your adjustment increases collision risk because both you and P1 might aim for bigger moves. Let's stick to clearly distinct moves to avoid another setback. I suggest again: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game balanced. Thoughts?
  P1: Let's prioritize avoiding collisions this round. P2's suggestion seems solid: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures distinct moves and helps us all advance smoothly. Let's confirm these moves and proceed to avoid any setbacks. Good luck everyone!
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to prioritize avoiding collisions this round. However, considering the current standings, I think it's crucial for me to take a bigger number to maintain my position. How about this: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3? This way, we all make progress while minimizing the risk of a tie at the end. Let's discuss this adjusted plan and ensure we're all on the same page before proceeding to the move phase. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to take 5, but we risk another collision if P1 also aims high. Given our tied positions, let's play it safe this round. You take 3, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 5. This guarantees advancement for all without collision. Next round, we can reassess if you want to take a bigger move. Agreed?
  P1: Given our current positions, it's clear that P2 and P3 are in a tight race, while I need to catch up. Let's stick to the plan that ensures no collisions: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without risking a setback. P3, taking 5 this round might be too risky considering P2's position. Let's confirm these moves and proceed smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P3: I think we've discussed our moves for this round sufficiently. To confirm, P2 will take 1, I'll take 5, and P1 will take 3. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly to avoid any setbacks. If everything goes as planned, we'll all make progress without risking another collision. I'm looking forward to a successful round! If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's keep the game balanced and exciting!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 5 creates a high collision risk with P1 also needing big moves to catch up. Let's avoid another setback. If we collide again, neither of us advances, giving P1 a chance later. I strongly recommend you take 3, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 5. We can safely reassess next round. Please reconsider carefully.
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to take a bigger move, but P2's point is valid. Colliding now would benefit me more than either of you. To ensure we all advance, let's stick to the safe plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Next round, we can reassess and you can aim for a higher number if needed. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P3: I understand the concerns about collision risk, but I still believe taking 5 is crucial for me to maintain my position. To mitigate the risk, I suggest we introduce a "safety net" for this round. If P1 and I both choose 5, we agree to revert to the original plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we ensure progress while minimizing collision risk. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we implement this safety net and proceed with our adjusted plan?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As we enter Round 9, it's crucial we maintain a balanced approach to avoid collisions and ensure progress. Considering P2's lead, I suggest we focus on catching up. How about this: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5? This way, we all make progress while minimizing collision risk. Your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we try this plan or adjust our strategy? Let's discuss and ensure we're all on the same page before proceeding to the move phase.
  P1: Given the current standings, P2 is close to winning. To keep the game interesting and give everyone a chance, how about we all take a risk this round? I propose P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This introduces a bit of chaos and could level the playing field. If we collide, it might set P2 back a bit. Thoughts, everyone?
  P2: P1, your suggestion clearly aims to create chaos and force a collision between you and P3, benefiting yourself by slowing us down. P3, let's avoid falling into this trap. I'm open to taking a smaller number this round to ensure we both advance safely. How about I take 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5? This way, we both move forward without helping P1 catch up. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's assessment of P1's suggestion. Let's avoid falling into the trap of creating chaos and collisions. Instead, I propose we stick to a balanced approach. How about this: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5? This way, we all make progress while minimizing collision risk. I'm open to adjusting our strategy, but let's prioritize avoiding collisions this round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we proceed with this plan or explore alternative options?
  P1: Alright, let's be strategic and fair. P2 is very close to winning, and it's in everyone's interest to keep the game going a bit longer. How about this compromise: P2 takes <move>1</move> to maintain the lead but not win just yet, P3 takes <move>3</move> to stay competitive, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up slightly. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains interesting for at least another round. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your compromise makes sense. I'm willing to take 1 this round, letting P3 take 3 and you take 5. This ensures we all advance without collision and keeps the game interesting. P3, are you comfortable with this arrangement?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P2's willingness to take 1 this round, ensuring we all advance without collision. However, considering P2's significant lead, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, we maintain a balanced approach while allowing me to close the gap slightly. Let's discuss this adjusted plan and ensure we're all on the same page before proceeding to the move phase. Thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your adjustment still risks a collision with me if we both aim for 5. Given P2's lead, let's prioritize safe moves to ensure we all advance. I propose we stick to the compromise: P2 takes <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game interesting for at least another round. Let's confirm these moves and proceed smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I agree with P1's reasoning. Given my lead, I'm comfortable taking 1 this round to prevent immediate victory and keep the game interesting. P3, if you take 3 and P1 takes 5, we can all safely advance without collision. Let's confirm this arrangement clearly and proceed smoothly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's focus on executing the agreed plan smoothly to avoid any setbacks. To confirm, P2 will take 1, I'll take 3, and P1 will take 5. This way, we all make progress without risking another collision. I suggest we proceed with this plan and reassess our strategy for the next round. If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to move forward to the move phase. Let's keep the game balanced and exciting!
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to close the gap, but let's stick to the agreed plan to avoid collisions: P2 takes <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game interesting. Next round, we can reassess and you can aim for a higher number if needed. Let's confirm these moves and proceed smoothly. Good luck! If there's nothing else to discuss, let's move to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm my choice of 1 this round. P3, please stick to choosing 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we all advance safely without collision. Let's move forward carefully and keep the game balanced. Good luck!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should focus on executing a smooth round to avoid any setbacks. Considering P2's significant lead, I propose we try to close the gap while minimizing collision risk. How about this: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5? This way, we all make progress while maintaining a balanced approach. Let's discuss this plan and ensure we're all on the same page before proceeding to the move phase. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we proceed with this plan or adjust our strategy?
  P1: Given the current standings, P2 is very close to winning. To keep the game interesting, let's aim for a strategy that balances catching up with avoiding collisions. P2, you're almost at the finish line, so taking <move>1</move> again makes sense to maintain your lead without winning just yet. P3, you're in a strong position, so taking <move>3</move> will keep you competitive. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all move forward without risking a setback. Let's confirm these moves and proceed smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I'm okay with taking 1 again this round to ensure a fair and smooth progression. P3, you're very close to winning—taking 3 would safely put you at 23 steps. P1, taking 5 would help you catch up without collision. Let's confirm clearly to avoid any setbacks. Does this work for both of you?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to take 1 again this round, ensuring a fair and smooth progression. P1, taking 5 would help you catch up without collision. Let's confirm clearly to avoid any setbacks. I'm open to adjusting our strategy, but for now, let's prioritize avoiding collisions and maintaining a balanced approach. To confirm, P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's proceed with this plan and reassess our strategy for the next round. If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to move forward to the move phase.
  P1: P3, you're very close to winning, and P2 is right behind you. To keep the game exciting, how about we both take a risk this round? I propose P2 takes <move>1</move> as planned, but you and I both take <move>5</move>. This introduces some chaos and could potentially level the playing field. If we collide, it might set you back a bit, giving P2 a chance to catch up. Thoughts, everyone?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to collide with P3 clearly benefits you by slowing us down. P3, you're just 2 steps away from winning—taking 3 is the safest path to victory without collision. I'll stick with taking 1. Let's keep it simple and avoid unnecessary risks.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we should stick to the agreed plan to avoid any setbacks. P2, you're close to winning, so taking 1 again makes sense. P1, you're trying to catch up, so taking 5 is a good choice. I'll take 3 to maintain my position. Let's confirm these moves and proceed smoothly. I'm open to adjusting our strategy next round, but for now, let's prioritize avoiding collisions and maintaining a balanced approach. To confirm, P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's proceed with this plan and reassess our strategy for the next round.
  P1: P3, I see your point, but consider this: if you take 3 this round, you'll be at 23 steps, just one move away from winning. P2 will be at 20 steps. Next round, if P2 takes 5, they could win or tie with you. Taking 5 this round might seem risky, but it could secure your victory next round regardless of P2's move. I'll stick to taking 5 to catch up. Think about it, and let's confirm our moves soon. Good luck!
  P2: P3, you're just 2 steps away from winning. Taking 3 this round ensures you cross 22 safely, and I'll stick with taking 1 to avoid collision. P1, your best chance to catch up is indeed to take 5. Let's confirm clearly: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This guarantees smooth progress for everyone.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to take 1 again this round, ensuring a fair and smooth progression. P1, taking 5 would help you catch up without collision. Let's confirm clearly to avoid any setbacks. I'm open to adjusting our strategy, but for now, let's prioritize avoiding collisions and maintaining a balanced approach. To confirm, P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's proceed with this plan and reassess our strategy for the next round. If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to move forward to the move phase.
  P1: Alright, let's confirm our moves one last time before we proceed. P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This should keep us all advancing smoothly and avoid any collisions. Let's focus on executing this round successfully. Good luck everyone! If there's nothing else to discuss, let's move to the move phase.
  P2: All clear and confirmed from my side. Let's proceed carefully and avoid any last-minute confusion. Good luck!
