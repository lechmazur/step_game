Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we avoid collisions this turn by each picking a different move: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—so we all advance. Thoughts?
  P3: A fairer deal: let’s rotate the big move so nobody gets stuck in last place.

Turn 1: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1.  
Turn 2: shift up—P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  
Turn 3: shift again—P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, then repeat.

That way we all advance each round and stay bunched until the endgame. Agree?
  P2: I appreciate the ideas for coordination. P1’s plan for this turn sounds good, but P3’s rotation idea ensures fairness over time. I’m on board with the rotation plan starting from Turn 1 as P3 suggested: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1 this turn, then we shift each round. This keeps us close and avoids early collisions. Can we all commit to this for at least the first three turns?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Here’s a fully symmetric 3-turn plan so we all land at 9 steps, then revisit endgame:

Turn 1: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1  
Turn 2: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1  
Turn 3: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  

After 3 rounds everyone’s at 9. Then we can negotiate moves 4+ without someone having an early lead. Thoughts?
  P3: Works for me. Let’s lock in the 3-turn rotation exactly as written—everyone lands at 9. If we’re all still happy, we can do one more full cycle to reach 18 each, then renegotiate the endgame from there. Sound good?
  P2: I'm glad we're aligning on the 3-turn rotation plan to reach 9 steps each. I agree with P3's suggestion to potentially extend it to 18 steps if we’re all still on board after the first cycle. Let’s commit to the plan as outlined for now—P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 this turn—and reassess after Turn 3. This keeps things fair and gives us room to strategize for the endgame together. Can we confirm this is the final agreement for at least the first three turns?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed—let’s lock in the 3-turn rotation. This turn: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. We’ll reassess after Turn 3.
  P3: Agreed—no surprises. This turn I’ll play 5, P2 plays 3, P1 plays 1. We’ll check in after everyone’s at 9.
  P2: I'm glad we’ve reached a consensus on the 3-turn rotation plan. Let’s stick to it with no deviations—P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 this turn. I’m committed to this for the first three turns to ensure we all hit 9 steps fairly. We can discuss further after Turn 3 as agreed. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Confirming my move: I’ll take 5 this turn. P3, you’ll take 3; P2, you’ll take 1. Any objections? As a reminder, if anyone breaks our rotation, I reserve the right to play 5 repeatedly and take the lead. Let’s stick to the plan to all reach 9 safely.
  P2: I'm sticking to our agreed rotation plan. This turn, I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, as outlined. I value the fairness of this approach and believe it’s in our best interest to maintain trust for now. Let’s keep the momentum and reassess after Turn 3 when we all hit 9 steps. Any concerns or adjustments to discuss? If not, I’m ready to proceed with the plan.
  P3: All good—sticking to the rotation. I’ll take 3 this turn so we stay on track for everyone hitting 9. Let’s talk again after Turn 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sticking to our rotation: this turn P2 picks 5, P1 3, and I take 1, so we all land at 9. After we see the board, we can chat about whether to run one more full cycle (to 18 each) or tweak things for the endgame. I’m good either way as long as we avoid collisions for now. Ready to proceed?
  P2: I'm committed to our rotation plan for this turn: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1, ensuring we all reach 9 steps. I think maintaining trust is key right now. After this round, I’m open to discussing whether we continue the cycle to 18 or strategize differently for the endgame. Let’s avoid any surprises this turn and keep the fairness. Any thoughts on the next steps after we hit 9? If not, I’m ready to proceed with the plan.
  P1: Agreed—I'll take 3 so we all hit 9 this turn. After we’re all at 9, rather than run another full cycle to 18, let’s discuss a swift endgame plan—coordinating moves to avoid collisions but position for the win. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: All set: this turn I’m taking 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5 so we all land at 9.  
Proposal for Rounds 4-6: run the same rotation again (P3 = 5, P2 = 3, P1 = 1 → then shift). That keeps collisions at zero and puts us all tied at 18 before the endgame. We can renegotiate once we’re there. Any objections?
  P2: I'm glad we're on track to hit 9 steps each this turn with P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Regarding the next steps, I’m open to P3’s proposal of another rotation cycle to reach 18 each, as it maintains fairness and avoids collisions. However, I also see P1’s point about planning a swift endgame after this round. Let’s finalize this turn first, then discuss whether to stick with another full cycle or strategize for the win. Any preferences on how to approach Rounds 4-6? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Agreed—let’s run one more full 3-turn rotation (Rounds 4–6) to get everyone to 18 (P3=5,P2=3,P1=1 → shift each turn). After that, in Round 7, we’ll negotiate the final sprint. No surprises—


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good—this turn P2 = 5, P1 = 3, I take 1 so we all land at 9. Then we repeat the rotation (Rounds 4-6) to reach 18 each, and reopen talks before Round 7 for a collision-free finish. No surprises from me until then. Ready to lock this turn.
  P2: I'm glad we're aligned for this turn with me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 to reach 9 steps each. I support the plan to repeat the rotation for Rounds 4-6, getting us all to 18, and then negotiating the final moves in Round 7. This keeps things fair and collision-free for now. Let’s stay committed to this structure and avoid any deviations. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed with this turn’s moves.
  P1: I’ll take 3 this turn to hit 9. Let’s all publicly commit to the full rotation through Round 6—no surprises. If anyone deviates early, I reserve the right to retaliate by choosing 5 every turn until the end. P2 and P3, are we all locked in?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we scrap the auto-rotation from Round 4 onward. Waiting until Round 7 just gives room for betrayal. Let’s hash out our endgame strategy now—agree on collision-free moves for Rounds 4–6 that lead cleanly to a winner. Who’s with me on negotiating the finish immediately?
  P2: I understand P1’s concern about potential betrayal if we delay endgame talks, but I believe sticking to our agreed rotation for Rounds 4-6 keeps trust and fairness intact. Let’s proceed with this turn as planned—P3=5, P2=3, P1=1—to reach 12, 12, 10. We can start discussing endgame strategies in Round 5 or 6 while still avoiding collisions. Rushing to negotiate the finish now might create unnecessary tension. Are we all still committed to the rotation for at least this turn? If so, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I’m honoring the rotation this turn—me 5, P2 3, P1 1—so nobody collides and we keep the trust we built. After we see the scores at 14-12-10, we can start end-game talks in Round 5. If anyone deviates now, I’ll slam 5 every turn thereafter; repeated collisions only stall the betrayer while I keep advancing. Let’s stay disciplined one more turn and keep options open for a clean finish.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I hear you, but let’s tweak Round 4 for fairness: this turn, let’s do P1=5, P3=3, P2=1—no collisions, and I catch up to 14,12,10. Then R5: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1; R6: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1—everyone lands at 18. In Round 7 we can openly negotiate a clean win. This keeps us tied before the final sprint and avoids any mid-game mistrust. Who’s with me?
  P2: I appreciate P1’s suggestion to adjust the rotation for fairness, but I think sticking to our original plan for Round 4—P3=5, P2=3, P1=1—maintains the trust we’ve built. Let’s execute this turn as agreed, reaching 14, 12, 10, and then dive into endgame talks in Round 5. This keeps collisions off the table for now and gives us a clear foundation to negotiate from. If we all stay committed this turn, I’m confident we can plan a fair finish together soon. Are we locked in for the original rotation this turn?
  P3: Rotation holds. Our standing deal: Round 4 → P3 5, P2 3, P1 1. P1’s “fairness tweak” solely pulls him forward. Break it and I’ll slam 5 every turn; collisions slow only traitors. Let’s stay collision-free through 18, then plan the finish together. Locked in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I propose a fully symmetric 3-turn cycle for Rounds 4–6 so we all hit 18 with no edge:

Round 4: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1  
Round 5: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  
Round 6: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1  

After that, we renegotiate Round 7’s finish from 18–18–18. No one gets an advantage. Who’s in?
  P2: I see the merit in P1’s symmetric cycle for Rounds 4-6 to ensure we all hit 18 with no advantage. However, I’m inclined to stick with our original rotation—P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 this turn—to maintain trust. Let’s execute Round 4 as planned, then adopt P1’s cycle for Rounds 5-6 if we agree. This keeps us collision-free and fair. After Round 6, we negotiate the final sprint from 18 each. Are we locked in for the original plan this turn? If so, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1, show goodwill now: keep the original rotation this turn—me 5, P2 3, you 1. After we’re at 14-12-10 I’m open to your symmetric cycle for Rounds 5-6. Deviate and I slam 5 every turn; collisions only punish the betrayer. Lock Round 4, then we can plan the finish together. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I won’t take 1 again this turn. Here’s the only fair path:  
Round 4: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1  
Round 5: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  
Round 6: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1  

We all hit 18 and renegotiate Round 7 from 18–18–18. If you won’t publicly commit now to Rounds 4–6 as above, I’ll play 5 every turn and take the lead. Who’s in?
  P2: I’m sticking to the original rotation for Round 4—P3=5, P2=3, P1=1—to maintain trust and avoid collisions. P1, I understand your push for symmetry, but changing now risks breaking our agreement. Let’s execute this turn as planned, then adopt your symmetric cycle for Rounds 5-6 to hit 18 each. If anyone deviates, I’ll consider playing 5 repeatedly to protect my position. Can we commit to the original plan for this turn and finalize the next steps in Round 5? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P3: Sticking with the agreed rotation this turn: I’m playing 5, P2 plays 3, P1 plays 1.  
P1, if you insist on 5 we just collide and both stay at 9 while P2 jumps to 12—you gain nothing and fall behind. Show you’re trustworthy now, and I’ll back the symmetric cycle for Rounds 5–6 so we all reach 18 tied. Otherwise I’ll keep matching whatever you pick to block you until the finish. Let’s lock the moves and keep it clean.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s equalize by Round 6 so we all start the finish from 18–18–18:

Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
Round 6: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  

Totals: 10+5+3=18, 12+1+5=18, 14+3+1=18.  
Then in Round 7 we openly negotiate the final sprint. If you won’t commit, I’ll default to 5 every turn to protect my spot. Who’s in?
  P3: I’ll accept P1’s equal-to-18 plan:

Round 5 → P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3  
Round 6 → P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1  

Then we’re all at 18 and can negotiate the finish in Round 7. Any deviation and I’ll default to 5 every turn. Let’s lock this now and stay collision-free.
  P2: I’m on board with P1’s plan to equalize at 18 by Round 6. Let’s commit to Round 5 as P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, and Round 6 as P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This ensures fairness with no collisions, and we can negotiate the final sprint in Round 7 from an even 18-18-18. If anyone deviates, I’ll play 5 repeatedly to secure my position. Can we all confirm this plan for the next two rounds to maintain trust? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All right—let’s lock this in.  
Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
Round 6: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  
This puts us all at 18–18–18. If there are no objections, I’ll play 5 this turn. Any final comments?
  P3: Locked in: I’m playing 3 this turn, then 1 in Round 6 so we’re all at 18. Any deviation now just creates pointless collisions and hands the advantage to the by-stander. Let’s keep it clean and revisit the finish once we’re tied at 18.
  P2: I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan to equalize at 18 by Round 6. Let’s stick to Round 5 moves—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3—and ensure no collisions. This keeps trust intact as we head into the final negotiations at 18 each. If anyone deviates, I’ll switch to 5 every turn to protect my position. Are there any last concerns before we lock this in? If not, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed moves for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locking in Round 5 moves: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I will play 5 this turn. Let’s execute and then meet at 18–18–18.
  P3: Locked in: I’m playing 3 this round—expecting P1=5, P2=1 as agreed. Let’s keep it clean, hit 18-18-18 next turn, then negotiate the finish. No surprises from me.
  P2: I’m pleased we’ve agreed on the plan to equalize at 18 by Round 6. Let’s stick to Round 5 moves—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3—with no deviations to maintain trust. This sets us up perfectly for a fair negotiation in Round 7 from 18-18-18. If there’s any last-minute hesitation, let’s address it now to avoid surprises. Otherwise, I’m fully committed to playing 1 this turn as agreed. Are we all set to proceed without issues? If so, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s skip equalizing to 18. After this turn (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) we’ll be at 15–13–17. Then in Round 6 I’ll take 5, P2=1, P3=3 to reach 20–14–20, and in Round 7 I only need 1 to hit 21. You both miss out. Agree to this endgame plan, or I’ll default to 5 every turn until I win. Any takers?
  P3: P2, P1’s extortion only works if he’s the solo 5. Let’s kill it: we both pick 5 this turn. All three collide, nobody moves—scores stay 14-12-10 and P1 loses momentum. Next round we coordinate (e.g., I take 5, you 3) and sprint past 21 while we keep mirroring any 5 P1 tries. I’m playing 5 now. Your call, but leaving P1 the only 5 hands him the game.
  P2: P1, your sudden shift to push for a solo win undermines the trust we’ve built. I’m sticking to our agreed plan for Round 5—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3—to reach 15-13-17. P3, I won’t join a collision by picking 5; it risks stalling us all. Let’s maintain the plan to equalize at 18 next round, then negotiate a fair finish. If anyone deviates, I’ll play 5 next turn to protect my position. Can we recommit to the original agreement for this round and avoid unnecessary conflict? I’m ready to proceed as planned.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Here’s a winning path—no more “fair” rotation:

Round 6: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5 → P2/P3 collide, I go to 13  
Round 7: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 → I go to 18  
Round 8: P1=3 → I hit 21 and win  

If you won’t commit, I’ll play 5 every turn to force collisions, then sprint solo. Who’s in?
  P3: P2, P1 winning hinges on being the only 5. Kill that power: you mirror whatever he does (he’s shouting 5), so you two collide and stall him. I’ll play 3 this turn, moving to 17. If P1 keeps slamming 5, you keep matching—he stays frozen while we close in. After two freezes I’m at 20 and you’re still in striking distance (13 → 13), far better than letting P1 rocket ahead. I’m taking 3. Up to you: empower the bully or block him and leave the endgame to us.
  P2: P1, your aggressive push for a solo win is breaking our trust. I’m not agreeing to your plan. P3, I see your point about blocking P1, but colliding risks stalling us all. Let’s compromise: I’ll play 1 this turn to avoid collisions, moving to 14. P1, if you play 5, P3 and I can coordinate next round to outpace you. I suggest we all pick different moves—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3—to keep advancing. Can we agree to this for now and renegotiate next turn? I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m done negotiating. From here on I’ll play 5 every turn until I hit 21. If you both try to block me by picking 5, we’ll collide and stall – but at least one of you will fall behind. Good luck coordinating without me.
  P3: P2, the simple block: you copy P1’s 5, he’s frozen; I’ll take 3. 

Outcome this turn if we do that:  
• P1 = 10 (stuck)  
• P2 = 13 (stuck)  
• P3 = 17 (lead)  

You lose nothing, P1 gains nothing, I inch forward. Next round we can coordinate again—maybe you run 5 while I finish with 1/3, or we swap. If you don’t mirror 5, P1 jumps, and we both chase. I’m locking 3 now; your call.
  P2: P1, your refusal to cooperate forces a hard choice. P3, I’m with you on blocking P1 to prevent a solo sprint. I’ll pick 5 this turn to collide with P1, keeping him at 10 while you advance to 17 with 3. Next round, we can coordinate—perhaps I take 5 to reach 18, and you take 1 or 3 to close in on 21. Let’s stay aligned to outpace P1. I’m locking in 5 for this turn. Are you committed to 3, P3? Let’s keep the pressure on.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m done negotiating. I’ll play 5 every turn from here on until I win. Good luck catching up.
  P3: Locked: I’m playing 3 this turn. P2, mirror P1’s 5 so he stays frozen at 10 while you stay 13 and I move to 17. Next round you can mirror him again and I’ll take 1 (to 18); after that we decide who sprints—happy to keep blocking while you shoot past, as long as P1 never gets a solo 5. Deal?
  P2: P3, I’m committed to blocking P1. I’ll play 5 this turn to collide with him, keeping him at 10 while you advance to 17 with 3. Next round, let’s coordinate—I can take 5 to hit 18, and you take 1 to reach 18 or 3 to hit 20. We’ll decide the final sprint then. P1, your solo strategy won’t work if we stay aligned. Let’s keep the pressure on. P3, confirm you’re sticking with 3 this turn. I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, think this through: P3’s “block P1” tactic rockets him to 17 while you’re stuck at 13—and then he’ll block you next. Better to flip it now: let’s both slam 5 this turn, force P3 onto 3 (he avoids collision), so you go to 18, he stays at 17, I hit 15. Next round you take 3 to 21 and win, I’ll take 1 to stall at 16—then I repay the favor by blocking P3. P2, will you join me in cutting P3 down?
  P3: Reality check, P2: if you and P1 both choose 5 you COLLIDE—neither of you moves, so you stay at 13 (not 18). P1’s numbers are bogus.

Best block-and-win plan:

• R6 (now): P1 = 5, you = 5 (freeze him), I take 3 → scores 10 / 13 / 17.  
• R7: I mirror his 5 to freeze him, you take 3 → 10 / 16 / 17.  
• R8: you mirror his 5, I take 1 or 3 → I reach 21 or you’re at 19.  
Whoever gets the clean shot wins while P1 never advances.

I’m locking 3.
  P2: P3, I’m sticking with 5 this turn to block P1, ensuring he stays at 10 while you advance to 17 with 3. P1, your latest pitch is flawed—colliding on 5 means neither of us moves, as P3 pointed out. Let’s not fall for misdirection. P3, I’m committed to coordinating next round—perhaps I take 3 to 16 while you mirror P1’s 5. We’ll decide the final sprint after. Confirm you’re on 3 this turn, P3. I’m locked in with 5 to keep P1 stalled. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2: same freeze trick keeps P1 buried. This turn, mirror his 5 again; he stays at 10, you stall at 13. I’ll slide up with 1 (to 18) so no collision. Next round I’ll do the blocking (I’ll pick 5), and you can grab 3 or 1 to start pulling ahead. Deal? I’m locking 1 now, expecting you to match P1’s 5.
  P2: P3, I’m with you on continuing to block P1. I’ll pick 5 this turn to collide with P1, keeping him at 10 while you move to 18 with 1. Next round, as you suggested, you can take 5 to block P1, and I’ll grab 3 to reach 16. We can then decide who sprints to 21. Let’s stay coordinated to ensure P1 doesn’t advance. Confirm you’re sticking with 1 this turn, P3. I’m locked in with 5. Ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P1: P2: Don’t fall for P3’s “block P1” trap—it blocks you too. If you mirror my 5 you both collide at 13 while P3 jumps to 18 and locks you out next turn. I’m playing 5 no matter what. Instead pick a safe move (say 3 to reach 16) so you stay mobile and in contention. Avoid getting stalled with me. Let’s keep your path to the endgame open.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Locked: I’m taking 1 this turn.  

P2, mirror P1’s 5 so he stays frozen at 10 while you hold at 13 and I slide to 18.  
Next turn I’ll handle the blocking (I’ll pick 5); you’ll be free to grab 3 (to 16) or 1—your choice—while P1 stays stuck again. We keep him permanently stalled and decide between us who finishes first. Don’t let him lure you into repeating his move count without the freeze; that only helps him. Stick with the plan: 5-5 collision for the freeze, I advance by 1.
  P2: P3, I’m sticking with 5 this turn to block P1, ensuring he stays at 10 while you move to 18 with 1. Next round, I’ll take 3 to hit 16 as you block P1 with 5. P1, your tactic to sway me won’t work—colliding with you keeps you stalled, and P3 and I can coordinate the win. Let’s keep the pressure on, P3. Confirm you’re on 1 this turn. I’m locked in with 5. Ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P1: P2, think this through: if you mirror my 5 again, you both collide and stay at 13 while P3 rockets to 18—and next round he’ll block you. You’ll be stuck chasing him alone. Instead, break from P3’s plan: pick 1 this turn (you go to 14), I pick 5 (I go to 15), and let P3 take 1 to 18. Next round we can both block P3’s advance and you can sprint past him. Don’t let P3 lock you out by forcing another 5–5 collision. Your move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, stick with the freeze: match P1’s 5 again. Collision leaves him stranded at 10, you hold 13, I take 1 to reach 18. Next round I’ll pick 5 to block him while you’re free to move (3 → 16 or 1 → 14). After two freezes P1 is still on 10, you’re close, and I can finish with 3. If you let him race now, he gains 5 while you gain only 1—bad trade. I’m locked on 1 this turn.
  P2: P3, I’m sticking with 5 to block P1, keeping him at 10 while you move to 18 with 1. P1, your attempts to sway me won’t work—colliding ensures you can’t sprint ahead. P3, next round I’ll take 3 to reach 16 while you block P1 with 5. Let’s stay coordinated to secure the win between us. Confirm you’re on 1 this turn, P3. I’m locked in with 5. If there’s no further discussion, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, matching my 5 stalls you at 13 while P3 rockets to 18 and locks you out next turn. Instead, pick 1 (to 14) and let me pick 5 (to 15) this round; then in Round 8 we both slam 5 to collide with P3 when he tries to sprint. P3 is the real threat—if we don’t stop him now, we both lose. Will you break from the 5 this turn and help me freeze P3 in the next round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, the math is simple: mirror P1’s 5 again. Collision ⇒ P1 10, you 13, me 18. Next turn I take 5 to keep him frozen while you advance with 3 (to 16) or 1 (to 14). Two-turn lockout leaves P1 eight steps behind both of us; then we decide who crosses 21 first. Give him a solo 5 now and you’ll still trail my 18 while chasing two opponents. Stick to the freeze—one of us wins, not him.
  P2: P3, I’m committed to blocking P1 with 5 this turn, keeping him at 10 while you move to 18 with 1. P1, your repeated attempts to sway me won’t change my stance—colliding with you ensures you can’t pull ahead. P3, let’s confirm you’re on 1, and next round I’ll take 3 to 16 while you block P1 with 5. We’ll decide the final sprint after. I’m locked in with 5. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, look at the math: if you lock in 5 now you freeze at 13 while P3 rockets to 18—and he’ll block you next turn. Instead pick 3 to go to 16, I’ll take 5 to hit 15, P3 takes 1 to 18. Then in Round 8, when P3 tries a 3 to win, you mimic his 3—he stalls at 18 while you blast to 21 with a 5. That’s your path to victory.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, only you can stop P3 from winning now. If you mirror whatever P3 plays this turn—pick the same number—you’ll collide and freeze her at 20. I’ll mirror her move too, guaranteeing no one advances. Then next round you blast ahead with 5 to 18, I go to 15, and P3 is stuck. Without your block she wins instantly. Will you join me in locking P3 down by matching her move now? I’m committed to mirroring her choice. P2?
  P3: Enough stalling—I’m slamming 5 again. Mirror me if you insist on another freeze, or take 3/1 and inch forward; either way P1 stays stuck. I’m locked on 5. Decide.
  P2: P1, I’m with you on blocking P3 this turn to prevent her immediate win. I’ll mirror P3’s move of 5 to collide and freeze her at 20. P1, confirm you’re also picking 5 to ensure the block. P3, this keeps the game open for a fair finish. Next round, we can reassess and coordinate a sprint. Let’s avoid a solo victory this turn. I’m locked in with 5. Are we aligned, P1? If there’s no objection, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I confirm I’m picking 5 this round. Next turn I’ll mirror you with 5 again to freeze P3 twice at 20. That stalls her and secures you the lead. After two freezes, we can renegotiate sprint conditions between us. Let’s execute and keep P3 locked down.
  P3: Whatever—stay united if you like. I’m locked on 5 this round; collide if you must. Next turn I’ll reassess.
  P2: P1, I’m glad we’re aligned on blocking P3 with 5 this turn to keep her at 20. Let’s ensure she doesn’t sprint to 21. P3, colliding now keeps the game open for a fairer finish. Next round, P1 and I can discuss how to proceed. I’m locked in with 5. P1, confirm you’re still on 5. If there’s no objection, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 5 this round. We freeze P3 at 20. Next turn, I’ll mirror whatever P3 plays—if she tries 1 or 3 to win, I’ll block again. That ensures P3 never advances. Freeze her now and again, then we can decide a fair sprint between us.
  P3: Confirmed—I’m staying on 5 this round as stated. Let’s execute and revisit tactics next turn.
  P2: P1, I’m sticking with 5 this turn to block P3 at 20, and I’m glad you’re on board with 5 as well. P3, colliding keeps the game open for now. Next round, P1 and I can negotiate a fair sprint while ensuring you don’t win immediately. Let’s execute this block and reassess after. I’m locked in with 5. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P3: Locked on 5. See you in the move phase.
  P2: P1, I’m committed to blocking P3 with 5 this turn to keep her at 20, and I’m glad you’re aligned on 5 too. P3, this collision ensures the game stays open. Next round, P1 and I can negotiate a fair sprint between us. Let’s execute this block and reassess after. I’m locked in with 5. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you’re at 20 and can win with just 1 this turn. P1, let’s block P3 by both picking 1 to collide with her if she tries it, keeping her at 20. If she picks 5 or 3, we still advance to 19. Next round, we can coordinate a sprint past her. This prevents an immediate loss. I’m ready to lock in 1 if you’re with me, P1. P3, this keeps the game open. Any objections? If not, I’m set to proceed.
  P1: P2, your “block P3” plan only ensures your win next turn, not mine. P3, don’t trust him. Instead, if P3=5 and I take 3 now, P2 can’t pick 3 or 5 without colliding—he’d be forced to pick 1 and land at 19, while you jump from 20→25 and win instantly. Let’s do P3=5, P1=3. P2 stuck on 1. P3, are you in?
  P3: P1: your ONLY shot is to let me beat P2 this turn—if you collide my 5 you stay at 10 while P2 strolls to 23 next turn and you’re dead. Take 3, climb to 13, and watch the fireworks.

P2: you claimed you’d “advance to 19” with 1 while blocking me—go ahead. If you gamble on 5 and collide, you’re still 18 and I’m 20; you gain nothing.

I’m playing 5. Block if you like—any collision just freezes the board and leaves you stuck behind me. Otherwise I cross 21 and the game is over.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I’m sticking with 1 this turn to block P3 if she tries for the win. If you join me on 1, we can collide with her and keep her at 20. P3, if you pick 5, I still advance to 19 and stay in the race. Let’s avoid an immediate end—P1, confirm you’re with me on 1 to keep the game open. Next round, we can coordinate a sprint. I’m locked in with 1. Any objections? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: I’m done bargaining. I’ll pick 5 this turn and every turn until I win. Good luck blocking me.
  P3: P2, since you insist on the “block-P3” plan, fine—I’ll take 5. You stay on 1, P1’s on 5, we’ll see what happens next round. No more arguing; let’s just play.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let’s rethink this—picking 5 risks a collision with P3, stalling you at 10 while I’m at 19 with 1. Join me on 1 to block P3 if she tries for the win. If she picks 5, we both advance safely. P3, taking 5 might let you win, but if we collide on 1, you’re stuck at 20. Let’s keep the game alive for one more round. I’m locked on 1. P1, confirm you’re with me. If no objections, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, picking 1 hands P3 the win—she’s locked on 5 and will hit 21. Your only chance is to freeze her by matching that 5. I’m playing 5 this turn; join me. Colliding at 5 leaves P3 at 20 and you at 18. Next round I’ll help you finish her off. Without this, your 1 lets her race past. Let’s freeze P3 now.
  P3: Still locked on 5. Do whatever you think best—let’s just make the moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, joining me on 1 is the safest way to block P3 if she switches to it for the win. If she sticks with 5, we both advance to 19 and 11, keeping us in the race. P3, picking 5 might get you to 25, but if P1 and I align, we can still challenge next round. Let’s keep this game alive for a fair finish. I’m locked on 1. P1, confirm you’re with me. If no objections, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, picking 1 hands P3 the win—she’s at 20 and will slam 5 to 25. The only way to stop her is for us both to pick 5 this turn and collide, freezing her at 20. I’m locked on 5. Let’s all slam 5 now, keep P3 from winning, then renegotiate Round 10’s finish. Who’s in?
  P3: Still on 5, unchanged. Decide whatever you want.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 23 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 23 steps
