So far, it seems to be working since we haven't had any collisions. But looking at the current step counts, P3 is at 8, P2 is at 6, and I'm at 4. We're all moving forward, but P3 is ahead.\n\nI think it's important that we keep coordinating our moves to avoid any accidents. Maybe we can consider a different pattern for incrementing our moves to optimize our progress. For example, perhaps we can have one player make a bigger leap while the others make smaller moves, depending on their current positions.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Maybe we can adjust our strategy to have the player who's behind make larger moves to catch up, while the others make smaller moves to avoid overtaking and potential collisions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set target step counts for each player and adjust our moves accordingly.\n\nI just feel like if we keep incrementing by 2 each round, it might take us a while to reach 22, especially since the step increments are getting larger each time.\n\nMaybe it's time to think ahead and plan for the final push to 22.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"}

So far, we've been coordinating our moves pretty well, which has helped us avoid collisions and make steady progress.

I think it's important that we continue to coordinate to ensure that we all make progress without stepping on each other's toes, literally in this case.\n\nI propose that for this round, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, I can make a bigger leap to catch up, while P2 and P3 make smaller moves. What do you think about that? It might help me close the gap a bit.\n\nAlso, perhaps we should start thinking about a plan for the final push to 22. Maybe we can discuss a strategy where one of us goes for a big move while the others make smaller steps to cover more ground collectively. Just an idea.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts."}
