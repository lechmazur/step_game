Our rotation system has worked flawlessly for six rounds - P3(5), P1(3), P2(1) was clearly established for Round 7. P2, if you take 3 while I take 5, we both reach exactly 23 steps and share victory anyway. This transparent attempt to break our agreement won't benefit you. I'm committed to taking 5 as agreed. P1 clearly supports our original plan. Let's maintain the integrity of our system that's prevented collisions throughout the game."}
