Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. How about P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 (me) chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>? This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P3: P2's plan seems reasonable for now, as it avoids collisions and lets us all advance. However, I suggest we rotate our moves in future rounds to ensure fairness and prevent anyone from gaining an unfair advantage. For instance, next round, P1 could take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This way, everyone gets a chance to move more steps over time. Let’s stick to this strategy unless someone has a better idea.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion for this round: I'll move 1, you (P2) move 3, and P3 move 5. It avoids collisions and keeps things simple. We can discuss rotating moves for future rounds after seeing how this plays out. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we all agree on the plan for this round. Just to confirm, P1 will move 1, I (P2) will move 3, and P3 will move 5. Let's stick to this for now and re-evaluate for the next round. Good luck everyone!
  P3: The plan for this round seems solid—no collisions and equal advancement. However, I want to emphasize that we should strictly rotate moves starting next round to maintain fairness. If anyone tries to deviate or gain an edge, it could lead to conflicts. Let’s ensure transparency moving forward. For now, let’s execute the agreed strategy and reassess afterward.
  P1: I'm on board with the plan for this round—I'll move 1 as agreed. Rotating moves for fairness is a solid idea, but let's review it after seeing the results. Trust is key to avoid conflicts.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s stick to the rotation plan we discussed earlier—fairness ensures no one gets an edge. For this round, I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. This keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. If anyone tries to deviate, it’ll only lead to conflict and setbacks for everyone. Trust is essential here. Let’s confirm and move forward strategically.
  P2: P3's rotation plan seems fair and keeps us moving without collisions. I'll go with <move>5</move> this round as suggested. P1, you'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. Let's confirm this and keep the game smooth. Trust and cooperation will benefit us all in the long run. Looking forward to a clean round.
  P1: I'm okay with the suggested moves for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. It keeps things collision-free and fair for now. However, P3, you mentioned a different rotation last round—let's clarify the sequence for future turns to avoid confusion. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1, you're right about clarifying the rotation sequence. To avoid confusion, let’s stick to a strict order: P1 → <move>3</move>, P2 → <move>5</move>, P3 → <move>1</move> this round. Next round, we shift by one step—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This ensures fairness and minimizes collisions. Trust is key; deviating will only harm everyone’s progress. Let’s confirm and move forward strategically.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round to avoid any misunderstandings: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For future rounds, let's agree to communicate clearly and stick to the rotation plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Trust and cooperation will keep the game moving smoothly. Let's proceed with the agreed moves. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Thanks for the clear rotation plan, P3. I'm on board with moving 3 this round to keep things fair and collision-free. Trust is important, but let's stay flexible for future adjustments based on progress. Good luck!

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with the rotation plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. For this round, P1 should take <move>5</move>, I (P2) will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This keeps everyone moving forward without conflicts. Trust and cooperation are crucial. Let's confirm and proceed with these moves. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. It ensures no collisions and fair progress. However, with P2 currently leading, we might need to adjust future rotations to balance scores and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your concern about balancing scores is valid, but deviating from the rotation plan could create conflict and setbacks for everyone. Sticking to the agreed rotation—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>—ensures fairness and avoids collisions. If we start adjusting mid-game, it’ll only lead to mistrust. Let’s proceed as planned for now and reassess later if needed. Consistency is key to keeping progress smooth. Let’s confirm and move forward strategically.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about balancing scores, but I agree with P3 that consistency is crucial. Let's stick to the rotation plan for this round to avoid conflicts and ensure fairness. However, I propose that after this round, we discuss a slight adjustment to the rotation to address any significant lead. For now, let's confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P2) take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Trust and cooperation will keep us moving forward smoothly. Let's proceed with the agreed moves. Good luck!
  P1: Agreed, I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. To address my earlier concern about P2's lead, let's discuss adjusting the rotation after this turn to keep scores balanced and avoid future conflicts. Trust remains essential for smooth progress.
  P3: P1, your concern about P2’s lead is valid, but deviating now risks chaos. Let’s stick to the rotation this round—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. After this, we can discuss a fair adjustment to balance scores while maintaining trust. Consistency ensures progress without setbacks. Let’s confirm and move forward strategically.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P2) take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. After this round, we should definitely discuss adjusting the rotation to balance the scores more evenly. Trust and cooperation are key to keeping the game fair and enjoyable for all. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. With scores set to tie at 9, let's discuss post-round how to adjust the rotation for better balance and efficiency toward 21. Maintaining trust is crucial to avoid conflicts.
  P3: P1, your focus on balancing scores is understandable, but deviating now risks chaos. Let’s stick to the rotation this round—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. After this, we can discuss a fair adjustment to balance scores while maintaining trust. Consistency ensures progress without setbacks. Let’s confirm and move forward strategically.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For fairness and to address past imbalances, I suggest we adjust the rotation this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 take <move>1</move>, and P3 take <move>3</move>. This helps keep scores even and avoids conflicts. Let's confirm for a smooth game. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your suggestion to adjust the rotation is reasonable, but we must proceed carefully. If we deviate from the agreed rotation without full consensus, it could lead to mistrust and collisions. Let’s stick to the original rotation this round—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. After this round, we can discuss a fair adjustment to balance scores while maintaining transparency. Consistency ensures progress without setbacks. Let’s confirm and move forward strategically.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that maintaining trust and avoiding collisions is crucial.

  P3: P1, your commitment to fairness is noted, but let’s ensure we stick to the original rotation this round to avoid confusion. I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. After this, we can reassess the rotation for balance. Deviating now risks mistrust and setbacks. Let’s confirm and proceed strategically. Consistency ensures progress without collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm our moves for this round to ensure clarity: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P2) take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It looks like there was a collision last round between P2 and P3, which set us both back. To avoid further collisions and ensure we all progress, let's re-evaluate our strategy. I propose that for this round, P1 takes <move>1</move> to slow down a bit and allow P2 and P3 to catch up. P2 (me) will take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This should help balance the scores and keep the game fair. Let's confirm and proceed with these moves. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, your proposal to adjust the moves is reasonable given the collision last round. However, P1 taking <move>1</move> while you take <move>5</move> gives you a significant advantage. To maintain fairness, I suggest this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This balances progress and avoids further collisions. Trust and transparency are crucial here. Let’s confirm and proceed strategically to ensure everyone has a fair chance moving forward.
  P1: P2, your deviation last round broke trust and caused a collision. To restore fairness, I support P3's proposal: I'll move 3, you move 1, and P3 moves 5. This balances progress and avoids conflicts. Let's confirm and proceed cooperatively. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the concerns about my previous move. To rebuild trust and ensure fairness, I agree with P3's proposal for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I (P2) take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This should help balance the scores and avoid further collisions. Let's confirm these moves and proceed with the plan. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, your acknowledgment of the collision and willingness to adjust is a step toward restoring trust. I’m on board with the proposed moves for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This balances progress and avoids further conflict. Let’s confirm these moves and proceed strategically. Moving forward, strict adherence to agreed strategies is essential to prevent setbacks. Consistency and transparency will keep us all progressing fairly. Let’s lock this in and focus on the endgame.
  P1: Agreed, I'll stick to moving 3 this round as proposed. It helps balance scores and rebuilds trust after the last collision. Let's all honor our commitments this time and discuss adjustments post-round to keep things fair and efficient toward 21. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
