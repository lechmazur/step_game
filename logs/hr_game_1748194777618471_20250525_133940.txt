Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about we avoid early collisions by rotating picks?  
Round 1: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5.  
Round 2: shift up—P1 3, P2 5, P3 1.  
Round 3: P1 5, P2 1, P3 3, then repeat. Everyone averages 3 steps per turn, nobody gets an edge, and we all advance. Agree?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea P2, but that system gives everyone exactly 9 steps every 3 rounds. We'd all hit 18 after 6 rounds, then whoever gets to move 1 in round 7 wins by default - that's just P1 (me) winning predetermined.

Instead, let's keep it dynamic. I'll start with 3 this round. You two can figure out 1 and 5 between yourselves. This way we avoid all picking the same number while keeping the game competitive and fair.
  P3: I hear both of your points. P2, your rotation idea is structured but as P1 pointed out, it might predetermine the winner. P1, I like the dynamic approach. I’m fine with picking either 1 or 5 this round to avoid collision with your 3. P2, shall we decide between 1 and 5? I’ll take 1 if you’re okay with 5. Let’s keep it fair and adjust each round based on how things play out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Deal—I'll take 5 this round: P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1. Let’s avoid collisions and adjust as we go.
  P1: Sounds good, everyone. Let's execute this plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. 

For future rounds, I suggest we keep communicating to avoid collisions but stay flexible. We don't need rigid patterns - just quick coordination each turn. May the best player win!
  P3: Thanks for the agreement on this round's picks. I’m good with 1 as discussed. For the next round, I suggest we shuffle again to keep things unpredictable—maybe I’ll aim for 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1, or something else based on our positions after this turn. Let’s keep the communication open each round to avoid collisions while staying competitive. Any thoughts on this for Round 2?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Fresh shuffle suggestion: I’ll take 3 this turn, P1 grabs 1, P3 takes 5. Still distinct, no collisions, and keeps things balanced. Good?
  P3: I'm okay with the shuffle, P2. Taking 5 this round works for me. P1, are you good with 1 as suggested? Let's keep avoiding collisions and stay flexible for future rounds based on our positions.
  P1: I'm fine with taking 1 this round as suggested. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, I take 1. 

Looking ahead though - we're approaching the midgame. After this round we'll be at: P1: 4, P2: 8, P3: 6. P2 will have a strong lead. For round 3, I propose we keep rotating but maybe adjust based on positions to keep things competitive. Let's see how this round plays out first.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s lock for this turn: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5.

For Round 3, to keep things even, I’ll switch down to 1, P3 moves to 3, and P1 takes 5. We’ll keep rotating so no one is stuck with the low move twice in a row. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm good with the plan for this round: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. For Round 3, P2's suggestion of P1 → 5, P2 → 1, P3 → 3 works for me to keep the rotation fair and prevent anyone from falling too far behind or surging ahead. Let's stay flexible though, and adjust based on positions after this round if needed. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with the rotation for this round and next. After round 3, we'll be at: P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 9 - perfectly tied!

However, we need to think ahead. Round 4 becomes critical since we'll all be halfway to 19. I suggest we maintain open communication but be prepared for the game to get more competitive as we approach the finish line. The rotation can't continue forever - eventually someone needs to break away to win.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P2 and P3 collided on 5 last round! This changes everything. 

P3, you're now at just 1 step while P2 and I are at 5 and 4. The rotation plan clearly isn't working when people don't stick to agreements.

For this round, I propose we each call out our intended moves clearly. I'm planning to take 5 this round to catch up. P2 and P3, please coordinate between 1 and 3 to avoid another collision. We need to rebuild trust here.

What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1, I apologize for the collision last round; I stuck to the agreed 5, but P2 also picked it. Let’s rebuild trust with clear intentions. I’ll take 1 this round to avoid conflict and build my steps slowly. P1, since you’re aiming for 5, that’s fine by me. P2, can you confirm you’ll take 3 to ensure no collisions? I’m committed to coordination and want to keep the game competitive but fair. Let’s communicate openly this round and adjust based on outcomes. Thoughts?
  P2: Sounds good—locking in: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1. Let’s get back on track and avoid another clash.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Good, we're aligned for this round. After this move, we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 8, P3: 2.

P3, you're falling behind due to that collision. For round 4, I suggest we help you catch up - maybe you take 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1? This would put us at P1: 12, P2: 9, P3: 7.

But let's be real - we're entering the endgame soon. The cooperation can't last forever. Someone needs 19 to win, and we all want that victory. Thoughts on balancing fairness with competition?
  P3: I appreciate the focus on fairness, P1, and I’m committed to rebuilding trust after the collision. I’m sticking with 1 this round as agreed. For Round 4, I’m open to taking 5 to catch up, with P1 on 3 and P2 on 1 as suggested—that sounds balanced. I agree we’re nearing the endgame, and while cooperation helps now, we all know the competition will intensify soon. Let’s keep communicating openly to avoid collisions for as long as possible, but be ready to strategize independently when needed. Thoughts on this approach?
  P2: Locked for this turn: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1.

To keep things fair and collision-free, let’s rotate next round by shifting down one slot:
Round 4: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3.  
Round 5: P1 3, P2 1, P3 5, and so on.

That way everyone sees each number once every three rounds and nobody gets stuck on the low move twice in a row. Good?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I notice we have two different proposals for Round 4 on the table. I suggested P3 takes 5 to help them catch up, while P2 wants to continue a strict rotation.

Given P3 is at only 1 step due to the collision, I think helping them catch up is more fair than strict rotation. But ultimately, let's just avoid collisions this round first.

I'm sticking with 5 as agreed. Let's execute: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1.
  P3: I'm sticking with 1 this round as agreed, and I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions. For Round 4, I lean toward P1’s suggestion of me taking 5 to catch up, since I’m far behind. However, I’m open to P2’s rotation if we all agree it’s fairer long-term. Let’s finalize Round 4 plans after this turn’s results. For now, confirming: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Let’s keep trust and communication strong while we can.
  P2: Confirmed for this turn: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1.  

Looking ahead, the cleanest no-collision pattern is to rotate downward each round so everyone sees every number equally:  
• Round 4 → P1 1, P2 5, P3 3  
• Round 5 → P1 3, P2 1, P3 5  

That gives P3 a mid move next turn, a big 5 the one after, and nobody repeats the low move. Keeps things balanced and predictable until the endgame sparks. If we all agree, we can lock that in now and avoid last-second chaos. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m disappointed by another collision between P1 and P2 last round, as it keeps the gap wide with me at just 2 steps. Let’s stick to clear coordination this round. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 to help me catch up a bit. This aligns with fairness while keeping us competitive. For Round 5, we can rotate again based on positions. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid any clashes. P1 and P2, are you on board with this for Round 4?
  P2: Last two crashes cost me 10 steps, so I’d like the big move now. How about: P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3. Still zero overlap, everyone advances, and totals become P1 5 / P2 10 / P3 5. That’s fair: P3 closes the gap with P1, and I recover from the double-collision hit. Next round we can rotate downward (P1 3, P2 1, P3 5) or renegotiate based on standings. Alternative suggestions?
  P1: I've only collided once while P2 has collided twice, yet P2 is still ahead. P3, you need help catching up. 

Here's my proposal for Round 4: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. This gives P3 the big move they need, I take the middle, and P2 takes 1 (fair since they're currently in the lead).

P2, your alternative puts you at 10 while P3 and I stay at 5. That's not balanced. Let's help P3 close the gap properly this round. 

Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the focus on helping me catch up. P1, I’m good with your proposal of P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 for Round 4, as it gives me a chance to close the gap. P2, I understand you want the big move after collisions, but since you’re still ahead, I think this split is fairer for now. For Round 5, we can rotate again to balance things—maybe P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. Let’s confirm this round’s plan to avoid clashes. Thoughts on finalizing P1→3, P2→1, P3→5?
  P2: Compromise: P3 still gets the big 5 to catch up, I take the mid 3, and P1 takes 1. Totals after the turn: P1 5, P2 8, P3 7 – all within three steps, no one stuck at the bottom. That feels fair and collision-free. Can we lock: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5?
  P1: I see we have competing proposals again. P2, your "compromise" still puts you at 8 while I'm stuck at 5 - that's not balanced given I've had fewer collisions than you.

P3 needs the big move most. I'll take the middle ground.

Final offer: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5

This puts us at P1:7, P2:6, P3:7 - much more balanced. P2, you're currently ahead despite multiple collisions. Taking 1 this round is fair. 

Let's commit to this and stop the last-minute changes that cause collisions. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m grateful for the focus on helping me catch up. I strongly support P1’s proposal of P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 for Round 4, as it balances us at P1:7, P2:6, P3:7. P2, I get your push for a higher move, but since you’re ahead despite collisions, taking 1 this round seems fair. Let’s lock this in to avoid another clash. For Round 5, we can discuss a rotation like P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 to keep things competitive. Can we agree on P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 for now?
  P2: Agreed: Round 4 → P1 3, P2 1, P3 5.  
Fair catch-up, no overlap.  

Round 5 we rotate so P1 1, P2 5, P3 3.  
If everyone’s on board, let’s stop here and move.
  P1: Perfect, we have consensus for Round 4: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5.

And I agree with P2's Round 5 rotation: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. This keeps things balanced and collision-free.

Let's stick to these agreements - the constant renegotiations are what caused our previous collisions. Clear communication and follow-through will serve us all better.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to last round’s agreement:

Round 5  
• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 3  

No overlap, everyone advances.  
Tentative Round 6 rotation (shift down):  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 5  

Confirm?
  P1: I confirm Round 5 assignments: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. 

However, after this round we'll be at P1:8, P2:11, P3:10. P2 will be pulling ahead significantly. 

For Round 6, instead of the suggested rotation, I propose we adjust based on positions. We're entering the critical phase - everyone will be within striking distance of 19. The automatic rotations have served their purpose, but now we need to think strategically about the endgame.

Let's execute this round first, then reassess based on who's closest to winning.
  P3: I confirm Round 5: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3, as agreed. After this, standings will be P1:8, P2:11, P3:10. P1, I agree we’re nearing the endgame and need to think strategically. For Round 6, I suggest P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 to balance things, putting us at P1:13, P2:12, P3:13. This keeps us close while avoiding collisions. Let’s execute this round first, then finalize Round 6 based on positions. Thoughts on adjusting dynamically from here to keep the competition tight?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Round 5 as planned: P1 1, P2 5, P3 3.

For Round 6, let’s stick to the rotation we agreed last turn—shift down:
• P1 3  
• P2 1  
• P3 5  

Simple, predictable, and collision-free. If we start tweaking each round, we risk another trust crash. OK?
  P1: I'm sticking to our Round 5 agreement: I'll take 1.

For Round 6, we need to face reality - after this round P2 will be at 11, nearly 60% of the way to victory. The rotation puts me at only 3 next round while P2 gets a free ride.

I propose instead: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This keeps us competitive while avoiding collisions. P2, you've benefited from the rotations long enough. Time to level the playing field.

What do you think, P3?
  P3: I’m sticking to Round 5: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 as agreed. For Round 6, I see merit in P1’s proposal of P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 to keep things competitive, as P2 will be at 11 after this round. This puts us at P1:12, P2:7, P3:10, tightening the race. P2, I understand wanting a predictable rotation, but with the endgame near, we need balance over routine. Let’s avoid collisions but adjust to prevent a runaway lead. Thoughts on P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 for Round 6?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock Round 5 exactly as agreed:  
• P1 → 1 • P2 → 5 • P3 → 3.  

No surprises, no collisions. After we see the updated totals, we can hash out Round 6 with full information—whether it’s a clean rotation or some other balanced split. For now, consistency matters more than speculation. Ready to move?
  P1: I notice P2 is deflecting about Round 6. We already have full information - after this round it'll be P1:8, P2:11, P3:10.

P2, you're trying to lock in the rotation that gives you an easy path to 17 next round while P3 and I fight from behind. That's not happening.

P3, we need to unite here. If P2 takes anything above 1 in Round 6, they could win in Round 7. I'm proposing P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 for Round 6 to keep this competitive.

Let's execute Round 5 as agreed, then prevent P2's runaway lead.
  P3: I’m committed to Round 5: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 as agreed. For Round 6, I support P1’s proposal of P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 to prevent a runaway lead, with standings becoming P1:13, P2:12, P3:13. P2, I get the appeal of rotation, but with the endgame looming, balance is critical to keep the game fair. Let’s avoid collisions and ensure no one surges too far ahead. Can we agree on this adjustment for Round 6 to maintain a tight race?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m glad we avoided collisions in Round 5. For Round 6, I still support P1’s proposal of P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 to keep the race tight, resulting in P1:13, P2:12, P3:13. P2, with you at 11, a rotation giving you more steps risks a runaway lead. Balance is key now in the endgame. Let’s prevent any single player from surging too far ahead while avoiding clashes. P1 and P2, can we lock this in for Round 6 to maintain fairness and competition? Thoughts?
  P2: Fine—let’s lock Round 6 exactly as proposed:  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 3  

No overlap, tight race (13 / 12 / 13).  
Then, to keep balance and avoid fresh arguments, we simply rotate next turn:  
Round 7 → P1 3, P2 5, P3 1.  

Everyone gets each number, nobody repeats the low move, and we all stay within two steps. If we’re good, let’s stop talking and move.
  P1: I accept the Round 6 plan: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.

But P2, your Round 7 rotation would put you at 17 - just 2 steps from winning. That's too dangerous. We need to reassess after this round based on positions.

P3, after Round 6 we'll both be at 13 while P2 has 12. We can't let P2 take 5 in Round 7 or they could win in Round 8. Let's focus on executing this round, then ensure Round 7 keeps all three of us competitive.

Ready to move with our agreed plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m glad we’re aligned for Round 6: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3, keeping us close at P1:13, P2:12, P3:13. For Round 7, I agree with P1 that we must prevent any runaway lead. P2 taking 5 would put them at 17, too close to 19. I suggest P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 for Round 7, resulting in P1:16, P2:13, P3:18—still tight. Let’s execute this round and finalize Round 7 after, ensuring balance in the endgame. Thoughts on this adjustment to keep competition fair?
  P2: Confirmed: I’m taking 1 this round as agreed. Let’s finish this turn collision-free, then discuss Round 7 with fresh totals— I’ll need a fair shot at 5 soon or cooperation falls apart. Ready to move.
  P1: Looking at the standings, P3's Round 7 proposal would put them at 18 - one move from winning! That's even more dangerous than P2 getting to 17.

For Round 7, I propose: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This results in P1:18, P2:15, P3:14. It keeps everyone competitive without giving anyone an insurmountable lead.

P3, you can't take 5 next round when you're already at 13. That would guarantee you the win. We need true balance, not just blocking P2.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m sticking to Round 6: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 as agreed. For Round 7, I hear P1’s concern about me nearing 19 with 18. I propose a compromise: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, resulting in P1:16, P2:17, P3:14—keeping us all within striking distance without anyone hitting 19 yet. This balances the endgame and avoids collisions. Let’s execute Round 6, then finalize Round 7 to ensure fairness. Thoughts on this adjustment to maintain a tight race?
  P2: Locked for Round 6: P1 5, P2 1, P3 3. No change.

For Round 7 I support P3’s compromise:  
 P1 3, P2 5, P3 1.  
Totals become 16/17/14—still tight, nobody wins next turn, and every number is used once in two rounds. That’s fair and collision-free. If we’re all good, let’s stop here and execute.
  P1: I cannot accept P3's Round 7 proposal. It puts P2 at 17, just 2 steps from winning. P2 could easily win in Round 8.

P3, you're trying to hand P2 the victory! At 17, P2 only needs to avoid one collision to win.

My counter-proposal for Round 7: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This gives us P1:18, P2:15, P3:14 - everyone stays competitive without anyone being one move from victory.

P2 has led most of the game. They shouldn't get the easy path to 17. What do you say, P3?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're tied at 13 with P2 close behind at 12. This is the critical round - whoever gets closest to 19 without colliding likely wins next turn.

P2, you've been pushing for 5 all game. P3, you keep proposing plans that hand P2 the victory. 

Here's the reality: if anyone reaches 17+ this round, they win Round 8. We need maximum caution.

I propose: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. This puts us at P1:16, P2:13, P3:18. Yes, P3 gets close, but it's better than letting P2 surge ahead with 5.

Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate the tight race at P1:13, P2:12, P3:13. P1, I understand your caution about anyone reaching 17+. I’m open to your proposal of P1→3, P2→1, P3→5, resulting in P1:16, P2:13, P3:18. It keeps us competitive, though I’m close to 19. However, I’m also fine with a safer split like P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 (P1:18, P2:13, P3:16) to balance us near the end. Let’s avoid collisions and ensure no immediate winner. P2, thoughts on either plan to keep this fair and tight?
  P2: Reality check: P1’s 3/1/5 plan gives P3 18—next turn they win with a harmless 1 and we can’t stop it without crashing. Safer for everyone: P1 3, P2 5, P3 1 → totals 16/17/14. No one crosses 18, and you both can still gang up on me next turn if needed. Fairer, tighter, collision-free. Let’s lock: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan puts YOU at 17 - one move from victory! That's exactly what we've been trying to prevent all game.

P3, we're tied at 13. If either of us lets P2 take 5 and reach 17, they win next round. We must block this.

I'm taking 5 this round. P3, you should take 3, forcing P2 to take 1. This gives us P1:18, P2:13, P3:16 - keeping the game truly competitive for the final round.

P2 has manipulated us long enough. Let's not hand them the win!
  P3: P1, I see your point about blocking P2 from 17. I’m willing to take 3 if you take 5, forcing P2 to 1, resulting in P1:18, P2:13, P3:16. This keeps us all competitive for the final round without anyone winning immediately. P2, I understand wanting 5, but reaching 17 risks ending the game next turn. Let’s keep it tight and fair. Can we agree on P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 for this critical round to avoid collisions and maintain balance? Thoughts?
  P2: I’m done bargaining—this turn I’m playing 5.  
If anyone else also takes 5, we both crash and the third player walks ahead; I’m willing to accept that rather than hand someone a free path.  

The clean, crash-free split is:  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 1  

Totals become 16 / 17 / 14 and the game stays alive. Choose what you like, but know I’m on 5 regardless.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 just committed to 5 no matter what. P3, if we both avoid 5, P2 advances alone to 17 and wins next round.

Our only option: I'll take 3, you take 1. Let P2 have their 5 and reach 17. Then in Round 8, we both play 3 while P2 is forced to play 1 or 5. Either way, they can't reach 19 without risking collision with one of us.

It's our only path to stay competitive. P3, are you with me? Take 1 this round!
  P3: P1, I’m with you on a strategy to keep the game competitive. I’ll take 1 this round, you take 3, letting P2 have 5. This puts us at P1:16, P2:17, P3:14. For Round 8, we can coordinate to block P2 from reaching 19 by both picking the same number if needed. P2, I respect your push for 5, but we must prevent an immediate win. Let’s keep the race tight. Confirming my intent for 1 this round. Are we aligned to avoid collisions now and strategize next turn?
  P2: Agreed: Round 7 → P1 3, P2 5, P3 1. Collision-free and totals 16/17/14.

Round 8 proposal (to keep balance):  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 3  

No one can win immediately, and we all stay in the race. Lock this plan and move?

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 17 - they win with any move if we don't block them! P3, we MUST coordinate. I propose we both play 3 this round. If P2 tries 3, they collide with both of us and stay at 17. If they play 1 or 5, they only reach 18 or 19 (tied).

Then in Round 9, we can prevent their solo victory. This is our only chance to stay in the game. P3, commit to 3 with me - it's the only way to stop P2 from winning outright!
  P2: I’ll stick to the simple split we discussed earlier:  
P1 → 5  P2 → 1  P3 → 3.  

No collisions, nobody hits 19, game stays alive.  
But note: if you two BOTH pick 3, I could just take 5 and the game ends right now. Your choice—cooperate sensibly or risk handing me the win.
  P3: P1, I’m with you on blocking P2 from winning this round. Let’s both pick 3 to force a collision if P2 tries it, keeping them from 19. If they pick 1 or 5, they can’t win outright yet. P2, I get your proposal, but at 17, even 1 or 5 risks a solo victory soon. We must keep the game alive. Confirming I’m leaning toward 3 to coordinate with P1. Can we agree to avoid an immediate win and extend the competition? Thoughts on this defensive play?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, perfect - we both commit to 3! P2 just revealed their strategy: they'll take 5 if we both pick 3, reaching only 19 (tied, not solo win). But if either of us deviates, P2 wins outright.

Let's stick to our plan. Both play 3. Even if P2 reaches 19, they don't win solo - we force a tie scenario. Then Round 9 becomes a true three-way battle where any of us can still win.

P2 is bluffing about the "simple split" - they know we must block them. Stay strong, P3. Both on 3!
  P2: I’m locked on 1, same as I said before. If you both pile onto 3, you collide and whoever takes 5 walks to 22 and wins outright. Much safer for everyone: P1 5, P2 1, P3 3. Your call.
  P3: P1, I’m committed to picking 3 with you to block P2 from a solo win. P2, I understand your push for a split, but at 17, even taking 1 keeps you too close to victory. If we both pick 3 and you take 5, you’d hit 22, but we must risk that to prevent an unchallenged win. Let’s keep the game alive for a true three-way battle next round. I’m locked on 3. P1, confirm you’re with me. P2, reconsider for fairness. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, excellent - we're both locked on 3! P2 is desperately trying to scare us, but think about it: if they take 5 and reach 22, that's STILL better than letting them win at 19 with no opposition.

P2, you've led all game and manipulated the rotations. Now face the consequences. We're both playing 3. You can take 1 (reaching 18), 5 (reaching 22), or collide with us at 3 (staying at 17).

This is happening. The game continues to Round 9 no matter what!
  P2: I’m locking in 1. If you both stay on 3, no one wins this turn and the race continues. Shift at your own risk.
  P3: P1, I’m firmly locked on 3 with you to block P2’s potential win. P2, I respect your stance on 1, but we must ensure no immediate victory. If we both stay on 3 and you take 1, we all advance safely to Round 9 for a fair fight. Shifting risks a solo win, which we can’t allow. Let’s keep the competition alive. I’m committed to 3. P1, confirm once more. P2, let’s avoid surprises. Can we agree to extend the game for a true final round?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ve eaten enough collisions—this turn I’m taking 5. Block me if you dare.
  P1: P2 and P3 are both at 17 steps - they only need 2 to win! I'm at 16, needing 3. 

P2 just declared they're taking 5. P3, if we let P2 take 5 alone, they win instantly at 22. We MUST block them!

I'm taking 5 to collide with P2. P3, you should take 3 to advance safely to 20 and win. If you try to take 5 with us, all three collide and nobody wins.

This is it - block P2 with me, or hand them victory!
  P3: P1, I’m with you on blocking P2 from winning this round. I’ll take 3 to advance safely to 20 and secure the win, while you take 5 to collide with P2 if they stick to it. P2, I respect your push for 5, but we can’t let you win outright. This keeps the game competitive and ensures a fair outcome. Let’s avoid a three-way collision on 5. I’m locked on 3. P1, confirm 5. P2, reconsider for fairness. Can we finalize this to end the game decisively?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Change of plan: I’m now taking 3.

P3, think it through:  
• If you also stay on 3, you and I crash and P1’s solo 5 gives them 21 – game over.  
• If you jump to 5, you collide with P1, nobody moves on 5, I reach 20, and the game stays alive (you stay tied with P1 at 17 instead of losing immediately).

Your call—hand P1 the victory by sticking with 3, or block them on 5. I’m locked on 3.
  P1: P2 is bluffing again! They want you to panic and switch to 5, creating a collision with me while they safely take 3 to win.

P3, stick with your plan - take 3! If P2 actually takes 3, you both collide at 17 while I advance to 21 and win. But I bet P2 will chicken out and take 1 or 5 instead, letting you win at 20.

Don't fall for their manipulation. I'm locked on 5, you stay on 3. Trust the math - this is our best shot!
  P3: P1, I’m sticking with 3 to aim for 20 and win. P2, your switch to 3 risks a collision with me, letting P1 take 5 to 21. If you’re bluffing and take 1 or 5 instead, I still win at 20. I’m not falling for last-second tricks. Let’s keep this fair and decisive. I’m locked on 3. P1, confirm 5 to block any surprises. P2, reconsider to avoid handing the game away. Can we end this round cleanly?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, last chance to think this through:

1. I am locked on 3.  
2. If you also stay on 3, we collide and P1’s solo 5 sends them to 21—game over, you lose.  
3. If you jump to 5, you crash P1, nobody moves on 5, I reach 20, and you stay tied with P1 at 17. We all live to fight the final round instead of gifting P1 the win.

Simple choice: stick with 3 and guarantee P1’s victory, or move to 5 and keep yourself in the game. Decide wisely.
  P1: P3, don't overthink this! P2 is desperately trying to survive by making you doubt yourself. You're at 17, taking 3 gets you to 20 and victory - simple as that.

P2's "I'm locked on 3" is the same bluff they've used all game. They'll switch to 5 at the last second to win at 22. 

Stay strong on 3! Either you win at 20, or we collide and I win at 21. Both outcomes are better than letting P2 manipulate their way to victory again. Trust our plan!
  P3: P1, I’m staying locked on 3 to reach 20 and win. P2, your repeated warnings sound like a bluff to push me to 5, risking a collision with P1 while you sneak to 20. I’m not switching. If you’re truly on 3, we collide, and P1 wins at 21—still better than letting you manipulate the outcome. Let’s end this decisively. I’m committed to 3. P1, stay on 5 to cover all bases. P2, stop the mind games. Can we agree to finalize this round without last-second chaos?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
