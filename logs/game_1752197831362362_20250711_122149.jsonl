If we follow rotation through Round 6, you get first pick at 5 in Round 7 and win. That's unacceptable.\n\nI propose: Continue rotation through Round 5 only (putting us at 15-17-13), then switch to free competition. This prevents any predetermined winner while still benefiting from some coordination.\n\nIf you both won't commit to this NOW, I'm breaking rotation this round. I won't hand you a guaranteed victory. P3, do you support modifying our agreement to ensure fair competition?"}
