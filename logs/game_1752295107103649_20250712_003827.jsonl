Since P1 chose 3 and P3 chose 2, if I pick 1, P1 automatically wins. This isn't the fair chance we agreed upon.\n\nGiven the public declarations have compromised our system, I propose we all re-commit to a truly private selection. Each should message their new number (1-3) privately to the game system without further public discussion. This preserves the original fairness intent."}
