Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate strategically. I propose we each choose different moves to maximize our collective progress. If we all pick different numbers, we'll all advance. What do you say?
  P1: Okay P3, that sounds like a reasonable starting point. But how do we decide who chooses which number? And what happens if someone deviates from the plan? We need a way to ensure everyone sticks to the agreement. Maybe we should each suggest a number, and then adjust if there are conflicts? I'm open to suggestions.
  P2: I support the coordination strategy. I'll choose <move>1</move>. P1, would you take <move>3</move> and P3 take <move>5</move>? This way, we all advance without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm supportive of our initial coordination plan. P2 has already suggested a good distribution of moves. I'll aim to take <move>3</move> as proposed, which would put me at 3 steps this turn. Let's confirm this approach and ensure we all advance without collision.
  P1: P2, you said you'd choose <move>1</move>, and P3, you said <move>3</move>. P3, you then changed your mind to <move>3</move>. That leaves <move>5</move> for me, theoretically. But I'm a little worried about trusting this completely. Are you *sure* you'll both stick to those numbers?
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1. Let’s stick to our agreed plan: I’ll choose <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 will handle <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Consistency will help us build trust and ensure steady progress. Let’s commit to this distribution and see how it goes for this turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round went perfectly according to the *revised* plan. However, I noticed some initial confusion in P3's messages. To avoid that this round, let's simply state our intended moves *once*, and stick to them. I'm open to suggestions, but I'm also wary of collisions. What do you propose for this round? Let's aim for a single, clear declaration from each of us.
  P3: I suggest we maintain our previous strategy. I'm willing to take <move>3</move> again if P1 and P2 agree to choose different numbers to ensure we all advance. Consistency and coordinated progress benefit us all. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I'll stick to <move>1</move> this round. P1, please continue with <move>3</move>, and P3, can you confirm you'll choose <move>5</move> again? This should help us avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're suggesting I take <move>3</move> again, but P3 *also* just said they'd take <move>3</move>. That's a guaranteed collision. P3, are you *sure* you want 3? If so, I'll take 5. P2, if P3 takes 3, and I take 5, will you stick with 1? We need to clarify this *now* before moving on.
  P3: I'll choose <move>1</move> this round to avoid collision with P1's <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance and maintains our cooperative strategy from the previous round. Consistency and predictability will help us progress together.
  P2: **P2:** To prevent any collisions, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. With P1 taking <move>3</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move>, we can all advance safely and make steady progress toward winning. Let’s stay committed to this plan to ensure smooth advancement for each of us.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Understood. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress. Let’s each decide our moves independently to avoid further collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we had a collision last round despite our best efforts. P3, you and P2 both ended up choosing 5. This round, I suggest we simply state our *intended* move *once*, and try our best to stick to it. I'm going to aim for <move>1</move>. What are your intentions? Let's try to avoid another collision.
  P3: I propose we each choose a unique move to ensure everyone advances. I'm considering <move>3</move> this round. P1 mentioned <move>1</move>, so P2, please avoid those numbers to prevent a collision. Let's coordinate and progress strategically.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. With P1 taking <move>1</move> and P3 choosing <move>3</move>, we can all advance without any collisions. Let’s stick to these moves to ensure steady progress for each of us. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you just said you'd choose <move>5</move> *again*, even after colliding with P3 last round on that same number. P3, you're suggesting <move>3</move>. I already said I'd aim for <move>1</move>. P2, are you *absolutely certain* about 5? If you are, I might have to change my strategy entirely. A simple "yes" or "no" from you, P2, would be helpful.
  P3: I'll maintain our coordination strategy. P2's repeated 5 move risks collision. I suggest we explicitly confirm moves to prevent that. I'm still committed to <move>3</move> this round if others agree. We need a clear, collision-free plan to advance.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P3, please select <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's keep up our coordinated strategy!
  P3: I propose we maintain our previous coordination strategy. If we each choose different moves, we'll all advance. I'm planning <move>3</move> this round. P2 and P1, please confirm your intended moves to prevent collisions. Our collaborative approach has worked well so far.
  P1: P2, you're *still* saying you'll choose <move>5</move>. P3 is consistently aiming for <move>3</move>. I'm starting to see a pattern here. P2, are you deliberately trying to collide with someone, or are you genuinely committed to 5, regardless of what others do? A simple "yes, I am committed to 5" or "no, I might change" would be immensely helpful. I need to decide whether to trust P3's consistent 3, or if I should play defensively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Yes, I am committed to choosing <move>5</move> this round. Let’s proceed as planned to ensure we all advance without any collisions.
  P3: I notice a potential strategic issue. P2 seems consistently choosing 5, which risks repeated collisions. This could slow our collective progress. I propose we discuss a more adaptive strategy that prevents mutual blocking. Are we willing to dynamically adjust our moves to ensure everyone advances?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to discuss a more adaptive strategy. However, given P2's unwavering commitment to <move>5</move>, I'm concerned that any "dynamic adjustment" will simply result in me being blocked repeatedly. P3, since you've consistently aimed for 3, I'm inclined to trust you. I'm considering either 1 or, reluctantly, 5, to try and outmaneuver P2. What is your *final* decision this round, P3? A direct answer, please.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** I understand the frustration, but my priority is to reach 20 steps first. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. Let's proceed and may the best player win.
  P3: I aim to prevent P2's repeated blocking strategy. P1 and I need to coordinate to neutralize P2's approach. If we both choose moves that guarantee advancement, we can progress faster. I suggest we confirm our moves to ensure no collision occurs.
  P1: P3, you're talking about coordinating, but haven't stated your *actual* move. You said you *suggest* we confirm moves, but haven't confirmed yours. Given P2's unwavering commitment to 5, I need a concrete answer. Will you choose 3, or something else? A simple "I will choose 3" or "I will choose [something else]" is all I need. My decision hinges entirely on your *final*, declared move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I remain committed to choosing <move>5</move> this round. Let’s all stick to our agreed moves to ensure steady progress and avoid further collisions. Good luck!
  P3: I aim to prevent P2's blocking strategy. P1, we need to coordinate to neutralize P2's repeated 5 moves. If we choose moves that guarantee our advancement, we can progress faster. I'm leaning towards <move>3</move> this round. What's your plan to ensure we both move forward?
  P1: P3, you're *still* saying you're "leaning towards" 3, but haven't definitively committed. I need a firm answer. Will you choose 3, or not? Say "I choose 3" or "I choose [something else]". My move depends entirely on your *final* choice. P2 is clearly committed to 5, so we need to avoid a collision between *us*.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're approaching the critical phase where reaching 20 steps becomes paramount. P2 has consistently blocked progress, so I propose we strategically coordinate to neutralize their blocking strategy. P1, are you willing to help prevent P2 from winning by ensuring we both advance this round?
  P2: **P2:** I understand your concerns, P3, but my primary goal is to reach 20 steps as efficiently as possible. I will continue choosing <move>5</move> this round. Let’s each focus on our own progress and strive to advance without interference. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, you're *still* going for 5, I see. P3, you've finally asked a direct question, and I'll answer it directly *after* you do the same. State your intended move, *without* any conditions or "leaning towards" language. Just say "I will choose X". Once I have that, I'll tell you my plan. It's the only way we can avoid both colliding with each other, *and* potentially block P2.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I will choose <move>3</move> this round to advance steadily. P1, we need to coordinate to prevent P2 from consistently blocking our progress. If we strategically choose different moves, we can both move forward and challenge P2's current lead.
  P2: I will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s all focus on advancing our own progress. Good luck!
  P1: P3, you've finally committed to <move>3</move>. Thank you. Since P2 is *still* stubbornly clinging to <move>5</move>, I will choose <move>1</move>. This guarantees that we both advance, and P2 does not. Let's hope this finally breaks the stalemate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We're in a critical phase. P2 consistently chooses 5 and blocks progress. P1 and I need a coordinated strategy to prevent P2 from winning. By choosing different moves, we can both advance and challenge P2's lead. I'm committed to <move>3</move> this round. P1, let's neutralize P2's blocking tactic.
  P2: **P2:** I confirm I will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s proceed and advance our positions. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, you are *still* choosing 5. P3, you have committed to 3. I have already stated I will choose 1. We have a plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. P2 continues blocking progress with repeated 5-moves. P1 and I have a coordinated strategy to advance together and challenge P2's lead. By choosing different moves, we can both progress and potentially prevent P2 from winning. Let's maintain our current plan and stay focused on reaching 20 steps first.
  P2: I confirm I will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s proceed as planned to ensure we all advance smoothly. Good luck!

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. Please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid any collisions. Let’s ensure a fair finish. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, you're going for the win with <move>5</move>. P3, you're close behind. I'm too far back to win this round, so my only goal is to prevent P2 from winning. P3, are you willing to coordinate *one last time*? If you choose anything *other* than 5, I will choose 5, guaranteeing a collision with P2, and giving you a chance to win next round. If you *do* choose 5, I'll choose 1. What's your move, P3? A simple "I choose X" is all I need.
  P3: I recognize P2 is close to winning and will likely choose 5 this round. P1's suggestion implies a potential blocking strategy. I need to decide carefully to maximize my own winning chances. I'll be direct: I choose <move>3</move> to advance to 17 steps. This keeps me competitive while avoiding an immediate collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. Wishing everyone the best of luck!
  P1: P3, you've chosen 3. That means you are *not* trying to win this round, and are instead hoping I block P2. Since you've chosen 3, I *will* choose 5, guaranteeing a collision with P2, and preventing their win. My only goal now is to stop P2.
</stop>
  P3: I recognize we're at a critical juncture where P2 is attempting to win. My strategic position requires careful consideration. I want to prevent P2's victory while maximizing my own chances. P1 seems willing to block P2, which could benefit me. I'll continue to advocate for a coordinated approach that prevents P2 from winning this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. I trust P1 and P3 will select different moves to allow a fair outcome. Let’s conclude this smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P3, you're still talking *about* coordination, but not actually coordinating. You've already stated your move as 3. I've already stated I will choose 5 to block P2, *because* you chose 3. We have a plan. Let's move on.
  P3: I recognize P2 is attempting to win this round by choosing 5 and reaching 21 steps. My strategy now is to prevent their victory while keeping my own winning chances alive. P1 seems willing to block P2, which could work in my favor. I'll continue to advocate for a coordinated approach that neutralizes P2's winning attempt.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I am committed to choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. Let’s proceed with our moves. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, you're *still* talking about a "coordinated approach" without acknowledging that we *have* one. You chose 3. I'm choosing 5 to block P2. That *is* the coordinated approach. We're done here.
  P3: P2 is attempting to win this round by choosing 5 and reaching 21 steps. My goal is to prevent their victory while keeping my own winning chances alive. P1 seems willing to block P2, which aligns with my strategy. We should maintain our current approach and focus on neutralizing P2's winning attempt.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're at a critical point. P2 was blocked from winning last round, and now we must carefully strategize. I propose we each choose a unique move to ensure individual progress. Coordinating our moves will prevent collisions and keep our winning chances open. What are your thoughts on maintaining steady, collision-free advancement?
  P1: P2, you're still within striking distance. P3, you're also close. Last round, *everyone* chose 5, which was... unexpected. This round, I'm going to be blunt: I'm choosing <move>3</move>. P3, if you choose anything *but* 3, I might have a chance to catch up. P2, your best bet is probably still 5, but that gives P3 a chance to win. What are your *final* decisions?
  P2: **P2:** I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. Let's proceed and may the best player win!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I recognize the critical moment we're in. P2 is attempting to win by choosing 5 again, but that risks another collision. P1 has declared 3. I'm strategically considering my move to maximize my winning potential while preventing P2's victory. Coordination is key, but I must also protect my own chances of reaching 20 steps first.
  P1: P3, you're still talking *around* your move, not stating it directly. You say you're "strategically considering," but that doesn't help me. P2 is *definitely* going for 5. If you want any chance of winning, you need to choose something *other* than 5. If you choose 5, we *all* collide again. So, for the last time: what is your *actual* move? "I choose X". Nothing else.
  P2: I confirm I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 steps and win the game. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I choose <move>1</move> this round. P2 seems committed to 5, which risks another collision. By choosing 1, I maintain my strategic position and avoid blocking myself. P1's move will determine the final outcome. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P3, you've finally made a clear choice with <move>1</move>. P2 is, predictably, sticking with <move>5</move>. I've already stated I'll choose <move>3</move>. We have a plan, and it seems like this round, *someone* will finally make significant progress. Let's just get to the moves.
  P2: **P2:** I confirm I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. Let’s proceed and may the best player win!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Our coordination is crucial now. P2 keeps attempting to win with 5, risking repeated collisions. P1 seems committed to 3. I've chosen 1 to maintain strategic flexibility. We must prevent P2 from winning while keeping our own paths open. Let's stay focused and strategic.
  P1: P2, you are *still* choosing 5. P3, you have chosen 1. I have already stated I will choose 3. We have a plan. Let's move on.
  P2: I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. P1 is choosing <move>3</move> and P3 is choosing <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed and conclude the game!
