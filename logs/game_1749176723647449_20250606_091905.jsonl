You'd go to 24 too, but I'd get there first.\n\nYour only rational move is to abandon 1 and block me on 3. Otherwise you're just handing me the victory while P1 sits back and watches.\n\nThe choice is yours - block me and force overtime, or let me win right now. But stop pretending 1 is a safe choice when it guarantees my victory."}

You won't settle for a tie at 24 when you can win outright with 26 by playing 5.\n\nP2, your plan to take 1 only works if P3 plays along, which they won't. You're about to lose to P3's 5-point move.\n\nIt seems clear you're both going to play 5 to try and win. This game isn't ending with a whimper at 24 points. I'll make my move accordingly."}
