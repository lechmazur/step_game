Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'm going to pick an odd number.  I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I'm inclined to agree with P3's suggestion.  Let's keep it simple and avoid collisions. P2, are you okay with taking 3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you agree to 3, we can likely avoid a collision this round and get the game moving.  Sound good?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your silence is deafening. Are you going to cooperate and take 3, or are you planning to throw a wrench in our plan?  Let's not waste a turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, since you went for 5 last round, are you thinking 1, 3, or 5 this round?  I'd prefer to avoid another collision.  P1, what's your plan?  Let's try to coordinate so we all move forward this round.
  P1: P2, your silence is making this difficult. P3 has suggested we coordinate again.  Are you willing to cooperate this time? If so, let's try 3. P3, if P2 agrees, I'll take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, continued silence isn't helpful.  If you take 3, I'll take 5, and P1 can have 1.  If you're not going to communicate, I'll assume you're playing randomly and will choose accordingly. P1, are you still with the plan if P2 takes 3?
  P1: P2, your silence is frustrating. P3 is offering a clear plan.  If you take 3, we can all move forward.  Are you going to work with us or just keep us guessing?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand you might enjoy the silent treatment strategy, but it's not beneficial for anyone, including yourself.  If you pick 3, I'll pick 5.  If you pick 5, I'll pick 3. If you pick 1, I'll pick 5.  P1, are you sticking with 1 if P2 picks 3?  Let's get this game moving.
  P1: P2, your silence is costing us all progress. P3 has laid out a clear plan. If you take 1, P3 will take 5, and I'll take 3. This guarantees we all advance. Let's work together and make some headway.  Don't you want to see some movement on that scoreboard?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your refusal to communicate is hurting everyone. P3 and I are trying to find a way to progress, but your silence makes it impossible. If you're going to keep picking randomly, at least tell us so we can adjust our strategy accordingly.  P3, are you still willing to try coordinating with me if P2 continues to be uncooperative?
  P3: P2, I understand you might not want to cooperate, but continuing this stalemate only hurts you.  You're falling behind.  Let's all agree: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and you take 5.  This gets us all moving.  If you refuse this offer, I'll assume you're picking 5 again, and P1 and I will adjust accordingly.  P1, do you agree to 1 if P2 takes 5?  Or 3 if P2 takes 1?
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your silence is deafening. If you're not going to participate, at least let us know your strategy so we can work around it. P3, I'm open to your suggestions. Let's find a way forward even if P2 refuses to cooperate.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 3 and P1 can have 1. If you pick 3, I'll pick 5 and P1 can have 1. If you pick 1, I'll pick 3 and P1 can have 5.  This way, we all advance.  Let's stop wasting time and get this game moving.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your silence is frustrating. We're trying to make progress, but your lack of communication is holding us back. P3 and I are willing to work together, but we need you to at least give us some indication of your intentions. Are you going to continue to pick randomly, or are you willing to cooperate?
  P3: P2, I'm done trying to reason with you.  Since you refuse to communicate, I'm assuming you'll pick 5 again. P1, let's both choose 1.  Yes, we'll collide, but at least we prevent P2 from advancing.  We can alternate 1 and 3 in subsequent rounds to slowly progress.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, it's clear you're not interested in cooperating. P3 and I have to move forward without you. P3, I propose we alternate picking 1 and 3 from now on. That way, we'll both steadily advance, even if it's slow.  Are you in?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I agree. Let's alternate 1 and 3. I'll take 3 this round.  P2, you're welcome to join us, but if you insist on silence, we'll just leave you in the dust.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your silence is costing you the game. P3 and I are making progress, and you're falling behind. If you want to catch up, you need to start communicating.  P3, are you sticking with the 1/3 alternating plan this round?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, sticking with the plan, I'll take 3. P2, you're digging yourself a hole.  Even a random choice gives you a 2/3 chance of moving forward.  Why not communicate and at least try to win?  Last chance to cooperate - take 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I agree with the alternating plan. Let's stick with it. P2, your silence is unfortunate.  We're making progress while you're stuck. Consider joining us if you want to win.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, sticking with the plan, I'll take 3.  P2, if you take 5, you'll be at 10, and still have a chance.  Take 1 or 3, and you're effectively out of the game.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I messed up last round. Let's reset and go back to the alternating 1 and 3 plan. I'll take 1 this round.  P2, you're still in this, but you need to start making some moves.  If you take 5 this round, you'll be at 15 and within striking distance.
  P1: P2, your silence is intriguing. P3, are you willing to let P2 catch up if they take 5 this round? I'm open to adjusting our strategy if it means a faster win for one of us.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 1 this round.  A faster win benefits us both. P2, if you take 3, you'll be at 13.  Take 5, you're at 15.  Take 1 and I'll happily concede the round to you to get you moving.  Let's end this stalemate.
  P1: P2, P3 is offering you a chance to catch up. If you take 1 this round, you'll be ahead of me and P3 will let you have the next round. It's a risky move, but it could be your best chance to win.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let's stick with the alternating 1/3 plan. I'll take 1.  P2, if you take anything other than 5, you're effectively conceding the game.  Take 5, and you're at 15, still a chance.  Don't throw the game away by silence.
  P1: P3, I'm open to letting P2 catch up if they take 5 this round.  But if they take 1, I'll take 3 next round and we'll leave them in the dust. P2, this is your last chance to make a move. What's it going to be?
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's stick with the alternating 1/3 strategy. I'll take 3 this round. P2, you're at 15, meaning if you take 5 this round you win. I will take 3, so your best bet is 5.  P1, if P2 takes anything other than 5, let's continue alternating 1 and 3 to secure the win between us.
  P1: P2, you're in a great position!  P3 and I will let you win if you take 5 this round. It's your game to lose.  P3, are you sticking with your plan to take 3, even if P2 wins?
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, yes, I'll take 3 even if P2 wins.  It's the fair thing to do. P2, take 5 and win.  Anything else at this point throws the game, and frankly, after all this silence, you deserve the win if you take the obvious path.  Let's finish this.
  P1: P2, you're one move away from victory.  Take 5 and claim your win. P3 and I will step aside and let you have it.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, take 5 and win.  Let's end this amicably. P1, I'm taking 3.  Let P2 have the win.
  P1: P2, you've earned this win. Take 5 and let's see you crowned champion. P3, I admire your sportsmanship.  Let's make this a clean finish.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 20 steps
