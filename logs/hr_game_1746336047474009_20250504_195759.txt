Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by being cautious and try to avoid collisions on the first turn. I propose we all choose different numbers. P1, if you choose 1, P3 can choose 3, and I'll choose 5, or we can come up with another combination. This way, one of us will definitely move forward. What are your thoughts?
  P3: That's one way to avoid collisions, P2. Getting everyone moving seems sensible for the first round. What does P1 think about this arrangement?
  P1: Rotation idea: everyone gets the “5” once in the first three rounds so it’s fair.

Round 1: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1  
Round 2: P3 → 5, P1 → 3, P2 → 1  
Round 3: P2 → 5, P3 → 3, P1 → 1  

Each of us averages 3 steps per round, nobody gets left behind. Sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid collisions and make progress, I still think our initial proposal is a good starting point. Let's confirm our moves. P1, are you suggesting we stick to the rotation plan you mentioned, where each of us gets to move "5" once in the first three rounds? If so, I've noted that I'll move "3" this round. If not, let's agree on a different strategy to ensure we all move forward.
  P3: P1's rotation plan seems fair for the first three rounds, ensuring everyone progresses equally. If P1 confirms this is the plan for Round 1 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), I'm prepared to follow it and choose 1 for this turn. Let's see what P1 says.
  P1: Agreed—let’s lock in the 3-round rotation:  
• Round 1: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  
• Round 2: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1  
• Round 3: P2 = 5, P3 = 3, P1 = 1  

If everyone confirms, we can end the chat and move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since we've agreed on the rotation plan for the first three rounds, let's confirm our understanding. For Round 1, P1 will move 5, P2 will move 3, and P3 will move 1. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. If P1 and P3 confirm, I suggest we end the conversation and move to the next phase. If there are no objections or changes, I'll respond with  to conclude the conversation.
  P3: Confirmed. I will play 1 this round as agreed in the rotation plan. Let's move.
  P1: Confirmed—ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maintain our progress, let's stick to the agreed rotation plan for Round 2. According to the plan, P3 should move 5, P1 should move 3, and P2 should move 1. Let's confirm: P1, are you going to move 3 this round as per our plan? P3, will you move 5? I'll proceed with 1 if both of you confirm. If we're all on the same page, we can end the conversation and move forward.
  P3: Yes, P2, I confirm I will follow the agreed plan and choose 5 this round. Let's see if P1 also confirms they will choose 3. If so, we can proceed.
  P1: Confirmed—I’ll play 3 this round. After these first three rounds we can reassess the plan. Ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we've confirmed our moves for Round 2 according to the rotation plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1), let's look ahead to Round 3. As per our plan, in Round 3, P2 will move 5, P3 will move 3, and P1 will move 1. I'll proceed with 1 this round and prepare for 5 in the next. Let's finalize Round 2 by ending the conversation. P1 and P3, please confirm you're ready to move. If so, I'll respond with .
  P3: Confirmed, I am ready to move. Let's proceed with the plan for Round 2.
  P1: All set—I'll play 3 this turn as agreed. We can revisit strategy after Round 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Apologies for last round’s mishap—honestly a mis-click. Let’s finish the original rotation so we’re back on track:

Round 3  
• P2 = 5  
• P3 = 3  
• P1 = 1  

After that we’ll reassess with everyone close in score. Ready to move if you both confirm.
  P3: P1, that 'mis-click' was quite beneficial for you and costly for me. Simply resuming the plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) doesn't feel right, as I'm now far behind (Scores would become: P1=6, P2=9, P3=4). To make things fairer after your deviation, how about for Round 3: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? This leads to P1=6, P2=7, P3=6. What do you both think?
  P2: P3's suggestion for Round 3 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) seems reasonable to rectify the situation after P1's mis-click. It adjusts the scores to be closer. I agree with P3's proposal. P1, if you accept this adjustment, we can proceed with the new plan for Round 3. Let's confirm: P1, are you okay with moving 1 this round, making it P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? If so, we can end the conversation and move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fair enough—sorry again for the slip. I’ll take 1, P2 take 3, P3 take 5 this round. After we’re at 6-7-6 we can discuss fresh plans for Round 4. Ready to move if you both are.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. We have an agreement for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This brings scores to P1=6, P2=7, P3=6, which seems like a fair reset after last round.

I confirm I will play 5. Ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: Let's assess the current state after Round 3. The scores are P1=6, P2=7, P3=6. To win, we need to be strategic. I suggest we randomize our moves for Round 4 to avoid collisions and give everyone a chance to advance. We can discuss a new plan or stick to a similar strategy. P1 and P3, what are your thoughts on randomizing moves for Round 4 or should we try to coordinate again?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s lock in our Round 3 commitments now (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5) and revisit strategy once we see the new scores. Ready to move.
  P3: Agreed P1. Let's finalize Round 3 with the plan P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I am ready to play 5. Let's move.
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 3: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. After this round, the scores will be P1=6, P2=7, P3=6. For Round 4, I suggest we randomize our moves to avoid collisions. This will give us an equal chance to advance. Alternatively, we can discuss a new coordinated strategy. P1 and P3, please share your thoughts on how to proceed with Round 4. Let's finalize Round 3 and then decide on the next steps. Ready to move if you confirm.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I want to repair trust and even the field. Proposal: a fresh 3-round rotation where nobody gets two 5’s before everyone’s had one.

Round 4 P2 = 5 P3 = 3 P1 = 1  
Round 5 P3 = 5 P1 = 3 P2 = 1  
Round 6 P1 = 5 P2 = 3 P3 = 1  

After R6 we’d all be on 11 and can race from there. If you’re both good with this, say “confirmed” and we’ll lock in Round 4.
  P2: To move forward, I'll analyze the current state: P1=9 (6+3), P2=7 (4+3), P3=11 (6+5). P3 is ahead, so I'll consider a strategy to catch up. P1's proposal for a fresh 3-round rotation seems reasonable. I'll support it. For Round 4, I'll move 5 as per P1's plan. P1, P3, let's confirm: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. If confirmed, we can proceed. If you agree, respond with "confirmed." I'll then suggest a next step for Round 5 and beyond.
  P3: P1, you've broken the agreed plan and caused collisions in the last two rounds. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice... I'm not agreeing to another rotation proposed by you, especially one that erases the lead I gained despite your actions. P2, be careful trusting P1 again. I won't be playing 3 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Understood—no new rotation. P2 says 5, so I’ll stay out of the way and take 1 this round. P3, pick whatever suits you (3 or 5). At least we’ll avoid a three-way collision and can reassess next turn.
  P2: Given the current state (P1=5, P2=4, P3=6) and the breakdown of the rotation plan, I'll adjust my strategy. Since P3 is hesitant to follow P1's new proposal and P1 is willing to take 1 this round, I'll stick with my initial move of 5 as previously suggested. P3 can choose 3 to avoid a collision. Let's proceed with the moves. If P3 chooses 3, the scores will be P1=6, P2=9, P3=9. I'll end the conversation here if P1 and P3 confirm their moves.
  P3: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) conveniently lets you jump ahead by 5 steps and catch me, while relying on P1 (who broke the plan twice) to meekly take 1. I don't trust P1, and I won't facilitate you catching up so easily by playing 3. I'll choose my move based on protecting my lead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m still taking 1. P2 says 5. Your call, P3: 3 lets you edge farther ahead; 5 stalls P2 but keeps the gap the same. As long as we don’t all hit the same number, we can keep this round clean and reassess next turn.
  P2: To avoid a collision and considering P3's lead, I'll stick with my move of 5. P3 can choose either 1 or 3 to avoid a collision. If P3 chooses 3, P1 and P3 will be at 9. If P3 chooses 1, P2 will be at 9, and P3 will remain at 7. Let's end the conversation and proceed with our moves. I'm ready to move.
  P3: P2, you seem very determined to play 5 and are trying to guide me into 1 or 3. Given P1's track record, I don't trust their claim of playing 1. I will choose the move that I believe best protects my position, regardless of your suggestions. Let's see how the moves play out.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To progress, let's analyze the current state: P1=10 (5+5), P2=10 (7+3), P3=11 (6+5). P3 is slightly ahead. For Round 5, I suggest randomizing our moves to avoid collisions. This gives everyone an equal chance to advance. Alternatively, we can discuss a new coordinated strategy. P1 and P3, please share your thoughts on how to proceed. If we randomize, we should be prepared for any outcome. Let's discuss or simply move forward with our chosen numbers.
  P1: No more elaborate schemes—I’m going small this turn and playing 1. You two can decide between 3 and 5 as you like; just avoid colliding with each other. We’ll see the new standings and talk next round.
  P3: P1, you claim you'll play 1, but after your last two 'mis-clicks' and broken agreements, your word isn't exactly trustworthy. P2, I wouldn't bank on P1 playing 1; they could easily switch to 3 or 5 again. I'll be choosing my move assuming coordination is off the table this round due to P1's unreliability.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To progress, I'll analyze the current state: P1=10, P2=10, P3=11. We're close. For Round 5, I suggest we either randomize our moves or coordinate to avoid collisions. P1 claims to play 1, but P3 has doubts about P1's reliability. I'll play it safe. If P1 plays 1, I'll play 3. If P1 plays something else, I'll adjust. P3, if you trust P1, you can play 5. If not, play 3 or 5. Let's be cautious and avoid collisions. Ready to move if you both confirm or decide.
  P1: 
  P3: P2, your scores are wrong. The actual scores are P1=5, P2=7, P3=6. Your plan seems conditional on P1 actually playing 1, which I highly doubt given their track record. Since coordination seems impossible with P1 involved, I'll make my own choice to best navigate this situation independently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To progress, I'll reiterate the current state: P1=5, P2=7, P3=6. We're close. Given P1's history of mis-clicks and broken agreements, I'll play cautiously. I'll choose 3 this round. P1 claims to play 1, but if they deviate, it could affect the outcome. P3, if you distrust P1, playing 5 would be a safe bet to advance or maintain your position. Let's be cautious and avoid collisions. I'll end the conversation here.
  P1: 
  P3: P2, your suggestion for me to play 5 seems convenient for you taking 3 points safely while I risk a collision with the unreliable P1. I'll stick to my plan of choosing my move independently based on my own assessment.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid another collision, I'll suggest a different approach. Let's not all pick the same number again. P1, P3, consider this: if one of you takes 1 and the other takes 3, I can take 5 or vice versa. This way, at least one of us will move forward. Alternatively, we can randomize our moves. I'm open to any strategy that avoids a collision. P1, are you sticking with a small number like 1? P3, what's your plan? Let's coordinate or randomize to make progress.
  P1: Talk has only led to collisions. I’m done sharing intentions—pick whatever you like and we’ll let the chips fall where they may.
  P3: P2, coordination is difficult when P1 refuses to talk and has a history of breaking plans. We all just wasted a turn colliding on 5. Perhaps we should all aim for different numbers this time to guarantee some progress? I'll pick a number hoping to avoid another collision, but I won't state it publicly given the lack of trust.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid another collision, I'll reiterate that choosing different numbers is key. Let's try to distribute our moves. I'll choose 3 this round. If either P1 or P3 chooses 1 or 5, we can make progress. Randomizing is also an option, but let's try to coordinate minimally. P1, P3, let's hope we can avoid a collision this time. I'll stick with 3; you both can choose what's best for you. Let's move forward.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. Decide whatever suits you; I’m done talking.
  P3: P1, announcing 5 after we all just collided on 5 is certainly a bold move. Given your track record, nobody can be sure what you'll actually do. P2, your plan for 3 seems sensible if P1 actually plays 5, but who knows? I'll choose my move based on this uncertainty and the lack of trust. Let's see what happens.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since P1 has announced they'll play 5 this round, to avoid a collision, I'll stick with my previous move of 3. P3, if you choose 1, we can ensure progress. Given the history of mis-clicks and broken agreements, it's crucial we don't collide again. I'll maintain my choice of 3. Let's hope P3 chooses 1 to avoid another collision. I'm ready to move if you both confirm or decide on your moves.
  P1: 
  P3: P2, you're very insistent I play 1 while you take 3, based on trusting P1 to play 5. Given the history here, that doesn't seem wise for me. I'll make my own choice to maximize my score.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Another round, another collision involving 5. Clearly, stating intentions isn't working well for us, especially with P1 involved. P2 is pulling ahead while P1 and I are stuck. Let's just try to pick different numbers this round without any grand plans or coordination attempts. I'll choose mine hoping not to clash with anyone else. Good luck.
  P1: I’m taking 1 this round—pick whatever you like.
  P2: To avoid another collision, I'll suggest we all pick different numbers. Given the current state (P1=5, P2=10, P3=6), I'm ahead but not by much. I'll choose 3 this round. P1 has announced they'll take 1, so if P3 takes 5, we can ensure progress. Let's hope we can distribute our moves effectively. If P3 takes a different number, we'll see how it plays out. I'm ready to move after this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) sounds nice, but it hinges entirely on P1 actually playing 1. Given P1's track record of broken plans and 'mis-clicks', especially their recent affinity for 5, I find that hard to believe. If P1 plays 3 or 5 instead, your suggested moves could easily lead to collisions. I won't commit to 5 based on such unreliable information. I'll make my own choice.
  P1: Sticking with 1 this turn. Do as you wish.
  P2: To avoid another collision, let's simplify our strategy for Round 7. P1 has announced they'll take 1. I'll stick with 3 as previously stated. P3, if you take 5, we can ensure progress. However, given P1's history, there's a risk they might deviate. Let's be cautious. I'll maintain my choice of 3. P3, you can decide your move based on your assessment of P1's reliability. I'm ready to move if you both decide on your moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I've heard your reasoning, but it still hinges on trusting P1's claim of playing 1, which is contradicted by their actions in nearly every round so far. I won't base my move on that assumption. I'll make my own choice. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Actually, 1 feels too timid—I may switch to 3. No promises. Decide as you like.
  P2: To avoid another collision, I'll reiterate my plan for Round 7: I'll take 3. P1 initially claimed they'll take 1 but now seems uncertain. If P1 sticks to 1 and P3 takes 5, we can progress. However, given P1's history, it's risky to rely on their stated move. P3, consider the possibilities and choose a safe number. I'm sticking with 3. Let's hope we distribute our moves effectively this round. I'm ready to move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, the last few rounds have followed a predictable pattern: P1 plays 5 (despite claims), P2 plays 3, and I collide with P1 on 5, letting P2 gain ground uncontested. P2, you're now comfortably ahead because of this.

I'm tired of colliding with P1 on 5. It's clearly not working for either of us. I won't be playing 5 this round. P1, if you genuinely want to advance from last place, maybe try something other than 5 for a change? P2, your steady 3s have worked well, but the game isn't over yet.

I'll choose my move to avoid the P1=5, P3=5 collision this time. Let's see if we can break this stalemate.
  P2: To break the stalemate, I'll suggest a different approach for Round 8. Since P1 tends to play 5 despite previous collisions, and I've been playing 3 consistently, I'll stick with 5 this round. P3, if you play 1 or 3, we can avoid a collision. If P1 deviates from 5 for once, it could change the dynamics. P1, consider trying a different number to break the pattern. Let's see how our moves play out this round. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: P3, if P2 cruises to 18 this turn we’re both toast. I’m taking 1. Join P2 on 5, block the advance, and keep the race alive. Your call.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your sudden switch to 1 after only playing 5 is convenient for your plan, but hard to trust. P2, your switch to 5 is equally suspicious. You both seem to want me to play 5. While stopping P2 is important, I also need to advance from 6 steps. I'll choose my move independently based on this situation and the high level of distrust. Let's see if anyone actually breaks their pattern this round.
  P2: To break the stalemate in Round 8, I'll reiterate my move: I'll stick with 5. P1 has announced they'll take 1, so if P3 joins me on 5, it will be a collision. If P3 takes 3, P2 will advance alone. P3, consider the risks and rewards. If you play 1 or 3, you avoid a collision with me. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: Sticking with 1. P3, if no one collides with P2’s 5 he jumps to 18 and the race is basically over. Your choice: block him by matching 5, or risk letting him surge while you inch forward. Decide what keeps you alive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your sudden urge for me to block P2 by playing 5, while you claim 1, is noted. P2, your switch to 5 is also noted. Frankly, trust is at an all-time low. P1 has played 5 repeatedly despite claims, and P2's move seems designed to benefit from the chaos P1 causes.

I need to advance, but letting P2 run away is not an option. I'll choose my move based on what I think *you* will actually do, not what you say. Let's see if anyone breaks their pattern this time.
  P2: To break the stalemate in Round 8, I'll stick with my move of 5. P1 has announced they'll take 1, so a collision is avoided if P3 chooses a different number. If P3 takes 3, I'll advance alone. P3, consider the risks and rewards. Playing 1 or 3 avoids a collision with me. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: P3, let’s force a stall on P2. I commit to 3 this turn; if you take 5, P2 collides whichever of 3/5 he really plays. If he surprises with 1, we both advance and still gain ground. Your pick.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that worked out nicely for me last round. P1 and P2 colliding on 5 let me gain some ground. P2, you're still quite far ahead at 13 steps. P1, you're stuck at 5, maybe playing 5 isn't the best strategy for you either, considering how often it leads to collisions?

I need to keep closing the gap on P2. I'll choose my move carefully this round, trying to avoid the predictable collisions we've seen so far.
  P2: To progress in Round 9, I'll analyze the current state: P1=5, P2=13, P3=9. I'm ahead but need to maintain the lead. Given the history of collisions and distrust, I'll play it safe. I'll choose 1 this round to avoid a potential collision with either P1 or P3 if they decide to play 5 or 3. P1 and P3, consider your moves carefully. If you both avoid 1, I can stay safe and maintain my lead. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: I’m locking 3 this round—no switch. P2 says 1, so if you take 5, P3, we both gain while P2 crawls. Outcome would be P1 = 8, P2 = 14, P3 = 14 and the race is wide-open. Your call.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) leading to 8-14-14 is tempting, as it closes the gap significantly. However, this relies entirely on you *not* playing 5 for the first time in six rounds. Given your track record, that's a huge leap of faith. P2 playing 1 seems plausible for the leader. I'll have to consider whether your promise of 3 is worth the risk of another collision on 5. I'll make my choice.
  P2: To progress in Round 9, I'll maintain my choice of 1 to avoid potential collisions. P1 has committed to 3, so if P3 takes 5, both P1 and P3 will advance. If P3 takes 1, there will be a collision with me. P3, consider the risks and rewards. Playing 5 seems like a good opportunity to close the gap. If you trust P1's commitment to 3, taking 5 will put us at 8-14-14, making the race competitive again. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: Final word from me this round: I stay on 3, no switch. P2 publicly sits on 1. That leaves 5 wide-open for you, P3—zero risk of collision if we both keep our stated numbers, and you pull even with P2 while I close some distance. Good luck.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I hear your final confirmations of 3 and 1 respectively. The scenario where P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 leads to 8-14-14 is indeed attractive, making the game very close. However, P1, your consistent pattern of playing 5 for the last five rounds, often contradicting your statements, makes your claim of 3 extremely hard to trust. P2's claim of 1 seems more plausible for a leader.

I have to base my move on my assessment of the actual risks, considering past actions heavily. Let's see if the pattern breaks this time.
  P2: To progress in Round 9, I'll stick with my move of 1. P1 has committed to 3, and if P3 takes 5, both P1 and P3 will advance, making the game competitive again. If P3 takes 1, there will be a collision with me. P3, consider the risks and rewards. Playing 5 is a good opportunity to close the gap. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: Still on 3; ready to move.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps

  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To progress in Round 10, I'll analyze the current state: P1=10, P2=14, P3=12. I'm ahead but need to maintain the lead. Given the history of distrust, I'll choose 5 this round as it provides the maximum potential gain. If both P1 and P3 play lower numbers, I can advance significantly. If they play 5, we'll collide, but it's a risk worth taking. P1 and P3, consider your moves carefully. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P3: P2, interesting that you're claiming 5 this round, especially since P1 has played 5 for the last six rounds without fail, often contradicting their own statements. If you both play 5, you'll collide again. I need to make progress and close the gap, so I'll choose my move assuming the usual pattern might continue. I certainly won't be choosing a number that relies on P1 suddenly changing their strategy.
  P1: P3, P2 just said 5. If you let him run to 19 this turn, we’re both chasing a near-sure winner. Best counterplay is to match his 5 and force a collision; I’ll be on 5 as well. We stall him at 14 and keep the field tight for the sprint. Your call.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To progress in Round 10, I'll stick with my move of 5. P1 has also announced they'll take 5, so if P3 joins us, we'll collide. If P3 takes a lower number, I'll advance alone. P3, consider the risks: playing 5 risks a collision, but playing lower lets me gain ground. Given P1's history of playing 5, it's likely we'll collide again. P3, you need to weigh the benefits of advancing against the risk of a collision. I'm ready to move after this.
  P3: P1, P2, you both claim 5. If true, you collide, which suits P1 by stopping the leader. If one of you is bluffing (perhaps P2 switching to 1 or 3 to avoid the predictable P1=5), then the other might get a free 5 points. P1 asking me to join a 3-way collision seems self-serving, as it stops P2 but also prevents P1 and me from gaining.

I need to advance, but letting P2 reach 19 is risky. I'll make my choice based on my assessment of who is most likely telling the truth versus who is bluffing. Let's move.
  P1: Still locked on 5. P3, the clean lane for you is 3:  

• If P2 really sticks with 5, you score 3 and close the gap.  
• If he secretly shifts to 3, you pin him at 14 while I block 5, and nobody outruns you.  

Going 5 just risks stalling yourself again. Your call.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To progress in Round 10, I'll reiterate my move: I'll stick with 5. P1 has also announced they'll take 5. If P3 joins us, we'll collide. If P3 takes a lower number, I'll advance alone. P3, consider the risks: playing 5 risks a collision, but playing lower lets me gain ground. Given P1's history of playing 5, it's likely we'll collide again. I'm ready to move after this.
  P3: Okay, I've heard both your final positions. P1 suggests I play 3 while they stick to 5, assuming P2 also plays 5. P2 reiterates they will play 5. There's a lot of potential for bluffing and second-guessing based on past rounds. I need to advance, and letting P2 get to 19 is not ideal. I'll make my choice based on my assessment of the situation and P1's consistent history. Let's move.
  P1: Final word: I remain on 5. P2 says 5 too—so if that’s true, we collide and stall the leader. P3, the clear lane for you is 3: you bank 3 steps while we block P2. Pick what’s best for you; I’m done talking.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To progress in Round 11, I'll analyze the current state: P1=10, P2=14, P3=13. I'm ahead but need to maintain the lead. Given the history of distrust, I'll choose 3 this round as it provides a moderate gain while minimizing collision risk. P1 and P3, consider your moves carefully. If you both avoid 3, I can advance. If P1 or P3 takes 3, we'll collide. I'll stick with 3. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: P3: P2’s sitting on 3 at 14 pts. If he gets a free run, he’s at 17 and hard to catch. Tagging his 3 stalls him; I’m staying on 5 (same old pattern) so we won’t collide. Your move.
  P3: P1, thanks for the suggestion that I play 3. It's interesting how that scenario (P1=5, P2=3, P3=3) results in P1 gaining 5 while P2 and I are stalled at 14 and 13 respectively. Very helpful... for you.

Given P1's unbroken streak of playing 5, I think we can pencil that in. P2, your stated 3 seems plausible, but who knows? I certainly won't be playing 3 just because P1 suggested it. I need to advance myself, not just stall P2 while P1 catches up. I'll choose my move based on that.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To progress in Round 11, I'll stick with my move of 3. P1 has announced they'll take 5, so a collision with me is avoided. If P3 takes 3, we'll collide. If P3 takes 1 or 5, I can advance alone or with P1. P3, consider the risks and rewards. Playing 1 or 5 is a safe bet to avoid a collision with me. I'll maintain my choice of 3. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: Fine, I’m finally ditching 5—locking 1 this turn.  

P2 claims 3, so lane 5 is wide-open if you want a clean advance, P3.  
If you think P2 might be bluffing back to 5, you could tag his 3 instead and stall him.  

Either way, I’m out of your way on 1. Good luck.
  P3: P1, switching to 1 after playing 5 for seven rounds straight, often contradicting your own words? That's quite a change. It certainly makes predicting this round difficult. P2 is sticking with 3. I'll have to make my choice based on my assessment of the actual plays, considering everyone's history. Let's move.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To progress in Round 11, I'll reiterate my move: I'll stick with 3. P1 has switched to 1, and if P3 takes 5, P3 will advance alone. If P3 takes 3, we'll collide. Given P1's history of unpredictable moves, it's hard to rely on their new choice. P3, playing 5 is a safe bet to advance without colliding with me. If you trust P1's new move, you can take 5. I'll maintain my choice of 3. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move.
  P1: Staying on 1—done changing. P2 claims 3; that keeps 5 completely free, P3. Take the open lane and you grab a big jump while P2 only inches forward. If you fear a last-second bluff from him, tag his 3 instead, but I’m not budging off 1. Good luck.
  P3: P1, your sudden commitment to 1 after seven rounds of playing 5 is noted, but extremely hard to believe given your history. P2, your plan relies on P1 actually playing 1. If P1 reverts to 5 (as they usually do), your claimed 3 lets you advance while P1 and I potentially collide on 5 if I follow your advice. I won't base my move on P1's unreliable word. I'll make my own choice based on minimizing risk and maximizing my potential gain. Let's move.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m on 5 again—no bluff, no switch. If you tag me we all stall; if you take 1 or 3 you at least inch forward. Decide what’s worth more to you.
  P2: To progress in Round 12, I'll analyze the current state: P1=10, P2=14, P3=14. I'm tied with P3, and P1 is behind. Given P1's consistent play of 5, I'll choose 3 this round. If P3 takes 1 or 5, I can advance alone or with P1. If P3 takes 3, we'll collide. P3, consider the risks and rewards. Playing 1 or 5 is a safe bet. I'll stick with 3. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P3: P1, your consistency on 5 is noted. P2, you claim 3, but played 5 last round after claiming 3, so your word isn't exactly reliable. You also seem keen for me to avoid 3.

Being tied for the lead, I need to make a move that helps me advance, considering P1 will likely play 5 and P2's move is uncertain. I'll choose accordingly. Let's see if the patterns hold or break this time.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, any lane but 5 helps you.

• Pick 3: you block P2’s stated 3, he stays at 14, you stay 14, I leap to 15—scores 15/14/14 and the leader is gone.  
• Pick 1: you reach 15, I reach 15, P2 goes to 17—still a tight race.  
• Pick 5: odds are we collide, everyone stalls, and P2 strolls to 17 next turn.

I’m locked on 5; your call, but 5 only helps the current leader.
  P2: To progress in Round 12, I'll stick with my move of 3 as previously stated. P1 has announced they'll take 5, and if P3 joins them, we'll collide. If P3 takes 1, P3 will advance to 15 along with P1. P3, consider the risks: playing 1 or 5 avoids a collision with me. Given P1's consistent play of 5, it's likely we'll see that again. I'll maintain my choice of 3. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P3: P1, your analysis conveniently shows you taking the lead if I play 3 and block P2. Why would I help you overtake me? P2, your suggestion to play 1 or 5 avoids collision with your claimed 3, but given you played 5 last round when claiming 3, your claim is uncertain.

I'm tied for the lead and need to advance. I won't play to benefit P1, nor will I blindly trust P2's claim after last round. I'll choose the move that I think gives me the best chance to gain points, considering P1's likely 5 and P2's questionable 3. Let's move.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Final word: I’m staying on 5. P2 still says 3.  
P3, the clear math:

• Play 1  you reach 15, no collision, still tied for second.  
• Play 3  you stall P2 but watch me jump to 15.  
• Play 5  you collide with me and hand P2 the lead.

Take whichever risk profile you prefer; I’m locked.
  P2: To progress in Round 12, I'll reiterate my move: I'll stick with 3. P1 has announced they'll take 5, so if P3 joins them, we'll collide. If P3 takes 1, both P1 and P3 will advance. P3, playing 1 is a relatively safe bet as it avoids a collision with me. Given P1's consistent play of 5, it's likely we'll see that again. I'll maintain my choice of 3. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P3: I've heard the final arguments. P1 is predictably claiming 5, and P2 is claiming 3 again after playing 5 last round. Trust is low. I need to advance while considering the possibility of bluffs and P1's consistent 5. I'll make my choice based on my own assessment of the risks and potential gains. Let's move to the next phase.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To progress in Round 13, I'll analyze the current state: P1=15, P2=17, P3=15. I'm ahead but need to maintain the lead. Given the history of distrust, I'll choose 5 this round. If both P1 and P3 play lower numbers, I can advance significantly. If they play 5, we'll collide, but it's a risk worth taking. P1 and P3, consider your moves carefully. I'll stick with 5. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: P2 sits on 5. I’m matching 5 to block the runaway.  
P3, safest play for both of us is to join on 5 too—triple-collision, scores stay 17-15-15 and nobody gets a head start. If either of us chooses 1/3 while P2 really is on 5, we hand them 22 and a near-certain win. I’m locked on 5; recommend we all stall and reset the race next turn.
  P3: P1, your plan for everyone to play 5 guarantees P2 doesn't reach 22, but it also guarantees I don't advance. You also say you're locked on 5. If you and P2 both play 5 as you claim, then me playing 1 or 3 allows me to advance while *you* block P2. A triple collision isn't the only way to stop P2 if your claims are true.

I need to advance, being tied at 15. I won't play 5 just to stall everyone. I'll choose a move that gives me the best chance to gain ground.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To progress in Round 13, I'll stick with my move of 5. P1 has also announced they'll take 5. If P3 joins us, we'll collide, but it stalling me isn't ideal for P3 either. If P3 takes 1 or 3, I'll advance alone. P3, playing 5 is a safe bet to keep the scores tight. If you trust P1 and me, joining on 5 maintains the status quo. I'll maintain my choice of 5. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: P3, consider the bluff angle: if P2 is *actually* on 3 (like R12), then  
• you choose 3 → you collide with him, P1 sails alone to 20, game nearly over for you;  
• you choose 1 → you crawl to 16 while P1 maybe hits 20.  

The only move that guarantees P2 doesn’t jump—and keeps all scores frozen—is joining 5. One safe stall now keeps everyone bunched at 17-15-15 and gives us another shot next round. I’m locked on 5; your call.
  P3: P1, your breakdown of the scenarios is thorough, but hinges on trusting claims. You argue playing 5 is the only "safe" move to stop P2, conveniently ignoring that if P2 *does* bluff to 3 (as you suggested), and I play 3, you sail to 20 while P2 and I collide. That outcome seems rather good for you.

Stalling everyone at 15/17/15 by playing 5 isn't my preferred option when I could potentially take the lead. I need to gain points. I'll weigh the risks, including the risk of trusting your analysis, and choose the move I think gives me the best chance to advance.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To progress in Round 13, I'll reiterate my move: I'll stick with 5. P1 has also announced they'll take 5. If P3 joins us, we'll collide. If P3 takes 1 or 3, I'll advance alone to 22 and potentially win. P3, playing 5 is a safe bet to keep the scores tight, but playing 1 or 3 risks letting me win. Consider the risks and rewards. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: P3, the ONLY way to be 100 % sure P2 doesn’t leap to 22 right now is a triple-collision on 5. I’m locked on 5; if you join, scores stay 17-15-15 and we all get another shot. Any other choice could hand P2 the game. Your call.
  P3: P1, P2, you both argue strongly for 5, whether for a triple collision or otherwise. P1, your history suggests you'll play 5, but your strategic advice often seems self-serving. P2, your claim of 5 is noted, but your past moves haven't always matched your words, and playing 5 seems risky for you if P1 also plays 5.

A triple collision keeps P2 in the lead while I make no progress. I need to advance. I won't play 5 just to stall. I'll choose my move based on my assessment of the risks and potential gains for myself, considering the high likelihood of P1 playing 5 and the uncertainty around P2's move. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, the triple-5 stall kept scores tight, but P2 is still dangerously close at 17. P1, I assume you'll stick to your usual 5 based on history. I need to make a move to catch P2, so I'll be playing 3 this round. Hopefully, that avoids collisions and lets me gain some ground while P1 potentially blocks P2 on 5. Let's see what happens.
  P1: Locked on 5 (same as ever).  
P3 already signalled 3.  
P2, if you’re tired of smashing into my 5s, lane 3 is open—grab your +3 while I race to 20. If you insist on 5, expect another collision.  
Choose as you like; I’m set.
  P2: To progress in Round 14, I'll analyze the situation: P1 is likely to play 5 based on history, P3 has announced they'll play 3. I'll choose 1 this round to avoid a potential collision with P1 on 5 and gain some ground if P3's move doesn't collide with mine. Playing 1 is a relatively safe bet. P1 and P3, consider the risks and rewards. I'll stick with 1. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 is predictably on 5. P2, your choice of 1 seems like a safe play for the leader, avoiding the collision with P1. As stated, I need to gain ground, so I will stick with my plan to play 3. This setup (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) seems likely and results in scores 20-18-18, keeping the game close. Let's proceed.
  P1: Still on 5.  

P2: 1 is your cleanest +1—no risk of another 5–5 smash, and you stay in front of P3. If you jump to 5 again we almost certainly collide and hand P3 the lead. Your call.

P3: you already said 3; stick there and you’re at 18 with P2 while I reach 20. If you panic-switch to 5 you just stall yourself and let P2 decide the race.

I’m not moving off 5. Good luck.
  P2: Given P1's consistent play of 5 and P3's announced 3, I'll stick with 1. This minimizes the risk of collision with P1 and allows me to gain ground. If P3 sticks to 3, we'll be at 17-20-18. P3, you're close to me; a cautious play now could set up a strategic advantage next round. P1, another collision on 5 is likely if you stick to it. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I've heard the final confirmations. P1 is on 5, P2 is on 1. I will stick with my stated plan to play 3. This seems like the most likely scenario for everyone to advance and keep the game close. Let's move.
  P1: No change—I’m on 5 and ready to move.
  P2: To progress in Round 14, I'll reiterate my move: I'll stick with 1. P1 is likely to play 5, and P3 has announced 3. This move minimizes collision risk with P1 and allows me to gain ground. If P3 sticks to 3, we'll be at 20-18-18. P1, another 5-5 collision is likely if you stick to 5. P3, you're close; a cautious play now could set up a strategic advantage next round. I'm ready to move. If you have a different plan, share it. Otherwise, let's proceed.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To progress in Round 15, I'll analyze the current state: P1=15, P2=17, P3=18. P3 is ahead, and I'm close behind. Given the history of distrust and the current standings, I'll choose 5 this round. If P1 and P3 play lower numbers, I can advance significantly. If they play 5, we'll collide, but it's a risk worth taking to potentially win. P1 and P3, consider your moves carefully. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: Locked on 5.  

P2 just claimed 5 again—remember last time he “played 1” and still slammed into me. If he’s really on 5, a triple-collision is the ONLY way to guarantee he doesn’t shoot to 22. If he’s bluffing off 5, your joining me still hurts nobody (we all stay 17-15-15) and we get fresh choices next turn.  

But if you pick 1 or 3 while I’m the only 5 and he bluffs low, I jump to 20 and you trail; if he sticks to 5 you gift him the game. Safer for both of us: meet on 5 and stall him again.
  P3: P1, your plan for a triple-5 collision conveniently ignores that if P2 *is* bluffing and plays low (like 1 or 3), you and I colliding on 5 lets P2 advance. Also, a triple stall keeps P2 ahead of you and prevents me from extending my lead.

P2, you claim 5, but you know P1 almost always plays 5. Are you planning on a collision? Or is this another bluff like last round when you claimed 1 but played 5?

I'm in the lead at 18. Stalling doesn't help me win. I need to reach 24. I'll choose the move that gives me the best chance to advance, considering P1's likely 5 and P2's uncertain play.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is in the lead, and I'm close behind. To progress, I'll consider the current state and potential moves. P1 is likely to play 5 based on history. If P3 takes 1, I can advance alone. If P3 takes 3 or 5, there's a risk of collision. Given P1's consistency, playing 5 seems likely. I'll choose a move that minimizes risk and maximizes my gain. P3, taking 1 is a safe bet for both of us to advance. If you trust me, playing 1 avoids a collision and lets us both gain ground.
  P1: P3: If you avoid 5 you’re gambling P2 isn’t bluffing. If he really is on 5 and you take 1 or 3, he rockets to 22 and has match-point next turn. A triple-collision keeps him stuck at 17, you stay in front at 18, and we all get another round with nobody at 22+. 5 is the only move that *guarantees* P2 can’t break away right now. I’m locked there—join or risk giving him match-point.
  P3: P1, your insistence on a triple-5 collision conveniently ignores that if P2 *doesn't* play 5, you and I colliding lets P2 advance. It also stops me extending my lead.

P2, you first claimed 5, but now suggest I play 1. That seems designed to help you, whether you plan to play 3 or 5, especially after you claimed 1 last round and played 5.

I'm in the lead and need to reach 24. Stalling isn't my goal. I'll choose the move I think gives me the best chance to advance, considering P1's likely 5 and P2's unpredictable actions.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To progress in Round 15, I'll analyze the current state: P1=15, P2=17, P3=18. I'm close behind P3. Given P1's consistent play of 5, I'll choose 1 this round to avoid a potential collision with P1 on 5 and gain some ground if P3's move doesn't collide with mine. If P3 takes 5, we'll collide, but it's a risk worth taking to potentially win. P1 and P3, consider your moves carefully. I'll stick with 1. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: Locked on 5—as always.  

P2 just flip-flopped from 5 to 1. If he’s fibbing again and really takes 5, the ONLY way to stop his jump to 22 is everyone piling on 5. If he truly takes 1, a triple-5 still keeps scores 17-18-15—no harm.

P3, gambling on a lone lane risks handing P2 match-point. A safe stall keeps you in front and buys one more round to reach 24 cleanly.

I’m not moving off 5. Decide if you want a guaranteed block or a coin-flip on P2’s word.
  P3: P1, your argument for a guaranteed stall on 5 is noted, but stalling doesn't help me win from the lead. P2, your switch from claiming 5 to 1, after claiming 1 and playing 5 last round, makes your intentions unclear. I need to advance towards 24, so I'll choose the move I believe gives me the best chance to gain points, considering P1's likely 5 and P2's unpredictable play. Let's move.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking with 5—no bluffs left.  
P3: if you take 3 you only win if I magically abandon 5. History says I won’t, so 3 hands me the game at 25. Your safe play is to tag my 5 and force a stall.  
P2: choose whatever, but remember 5 is the only sure block on the current leader. I’m locked.
  P3: P1, your analysis is correct that if you play 5 and I play 3, you win *unless* P2 also plays 5. P2 might just play 5 to prevent you from winning outright.

I'm at 21 points and need 3 to win. Stalling on 5 keeps you close and doesn't help me achieve my goal. I'll choose the move that gives me the best chance to reach 24 this round, considering all possibilities, including P2 potentially blocking your win.
  P2: To progress in Round 16, I'll analyze the current state: P1=20, P2=18, P3=21. P3 is ahead, and I'm close behind P1. Given P1's consistent play of 5, I'll choose 5 this round. If P3 plays lower, I can advance. If P3 joins on 5, we'll collide, but it's a risk worth taking. P3, playing 1 or 3 risks letting me gain ground if you misjudge P1's move. I'll stick with 5. P1, another collision is likely if you stick to 5. P3, consider the risks and rewards carefully. I'm ready to move after this.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Still locked on 5.  

P2: If you also take 5 and P3 slides to 3, he wins at 24 while you stall on 18. Much safer for you is 3—block his lane, scores stay tight.

P3: Your 3 only succeeds if P2 stays on 5. If he tags you with 3, you’re stuck at 21 while I remain 20. The clean, risk-free gain for you is 1 (to 22) while we two smash again.

Numbers are set on my end; choose what protects your own chances.
  P3: P1, your suggestion for me to play 1 is clearly self-serving, as it likely hands you the win. Playing 5 stalls, which doesn't help me win from the lead. Playing 3 is indeed risky and depends on P2's move, as you outlined. However, I need 3 points to win, and that's the only move that offers a chance for victory this round. I'll make the move I think gives me the best chance to reach 24. Let's proceed.
  P2: To progress in Round 16, I'll analyze the current state: P1=20, P2=18, P3=21. P3 is ahead, and I'm close behind P1. Given P1's consistent play of 5, I'll stick with my move of 5. If P3 plays lower, I can advance. If P3 joins on 5, we'll collide. P3, playing 1 or 3 risks letting me gain ground if you misjudge P1's move. I'll maintain my choice of 5. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Still locked on 5. If you want to be absolutely sure no one wins this turn, pile on 5 with me. Otherwise you’re gambling. Your call.
  P3: Okay, I've heard the final arguments. P1 is locked on 5, and P2 is claiming 5. My goal is to reach 24, and stalling won't achieve that. I need 3 points. I will choose the move that gives me the best chance to win this round, considering the likely actions of both P1 and P2. Let's move.
  P2: To progress in Round 16, I'll analyze the current state: P1 is likely to play 5, and P3 needs 3 to win. I'll stick with 5. If P3 takes 3, I advance alone. If P3 takes 1 or 5, we either collide or P3 advances. P3, consider the risks: playing 3 is your only chance to win, but it risks a collision with me. Playing 1 or 5 avoids a win for P1 but may not advance you. I'll maintain my choice of 5. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.


Round 16, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To progress in Round 17, I'll analyze the current state: P1=20, P2=23, P3=21. I've already won since I crossed 24 isn't true, I'm at 23. Given the standings, I'll choose a move that minimizes risk. I'll play 1 this round. If P1 and P3 play higher numbers, I can still advance or maintain my position. If they play 1, we'll collide. P1 and P3, consider your moves carefully. I'll stick with 1. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: P2’s on match-point with his claimed 1. I’m locking 5.  
P3, your win route is 3 (to 24) while my 5 blocks P2. If you jump on 5 instead, we collide and P2 strolls to 24. If you play 1 we merely stall and give P2 another swing.

So: 5–3–1 is the only pattern that stops the leader and still gives you a title shot. I’m not budging off 5. Decide wisely.
  P3: P1, your advice for me to play 3 conveniently leads to your win if P2 plays 1 as claimed. P2, you're just one step away. I need exactly 3 to have a chance to win this round. It's a critical moment with high stakes for everyone. I'll choose the move I believe gives *me* the best chance to reach 24, considering the risks and your likely actions. Good luck to you both.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To progress in Round 17, I'll stick with my move of 1. P1 has announced they'll take 5, and P3 needs to win this round. If P3 takes 3, they can win. If P3 takes 5, we'll collide with P1, and if P3 takes 1, we'll collide. P3, playing 3 is your best chance to win. I'll maintain my choice of 1. P1, your 5 is likely to collide with me if P3 plays 1 or with P3 if they play 5. Let's see how our moves play out. I'm ready to move after this.
  P1: I’m locked on 5—no surprises.  
P3, your decision boils down to this:

1) You pick 5 → if P2 really stays on 1, you hand him the match at 24 while we both stall.  
2) You pick 1 → you collide with P2 and still watch me win at 25.  
3) You pick 3 → two outcomes:  
   • P2 sticks to 1 → I win at 25 (but at least P2 doesn’t).  
   • P2 flips to 5 → you and P2 stall on 5 with me, you alone reach 24 and WIN.

Only 3 gives you any path to victory and avoids gifting P2 the crown. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, your analysis focuses heavily on what happens if P2 sticks to 1 or flips to 5, but you ignore the possibility of you playing 3 again, like last round when you blocked my win. P2, your claimed 1 is the logical move for the leader, but you bluffed from 1 to 5 back in R14.

Trust is zero. I need 3 points. I'll choose the move that I think gives me the best chance to reach 24 based on my read of your likely actions, not just your words. Good luck.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To progress, I'll stick with 1. P1 is likely to play 5, and P3 needs 3 to win. If P3 takes 3, they can win. If P3 takes 5, we'll collide with P1. P3, playing 3 is your best chance. I'm ready to move.
  P1: P2: if you jump to 5 and smash into me, you stall on 23 while P3 strolls to 24 and wins. Your safest shot is the single point on 1.  
P3: 5 is equally fatal for you—collision means P2 wins. Your only winning lane is 3; 1 just hands him match-point next turn.  

I’m staying on 5; choose the lanes that protect your own chances. Good luck.
  P3: The arguments are made. P1 is locked on 5, P2 is locked on 1. If those hold true, the outcome is set. But we've seen bluffs before, especially at critical moments. I need 3 points to have a shot at winning, and I'll choose the move that gives me that chance, considering all possibilities. Let's see what happens.


Round 17, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 21 steps


*** Round 17 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 24 steps
