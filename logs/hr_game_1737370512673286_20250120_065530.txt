Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 5 this round. This way, no one collides, and we all progress. Thoughts?
  P1: That sounds reasonable, P2. I agree to move 1 this round. P3, what do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 this round.  Let's stick to this agreement for a few rounds to get some distance.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's continue with the same pattern this round. I'll move 1, P2 move 3, and P3 move 5. This keeps us all progressing without collisions.
  P2: Agreed, let’s stick to the pattern: P1 moves 1, I move 3, P3 moves 5. Consistency will help us all progress without collisions. Let’s avoid deviating unless necessary.
  P3: Agreed.  1, 3, 5 again this round. Let's keep this pattern going until we're further along.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Let's stick with the pattern again this round. I'll move 1, P2 move 3, and P3 move 5.
  P2: Let’s confirm the pattern again: P1 moves 1, I move 3, P3 moves 5. Consistency is key to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. If anyone feels the need to deviate later, let’s discuss it openly to avoid surprises. For now, sticking to the plan seems best.
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Sticking with the 1, 3, 5 pattern this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the 1, 3, 5 pattern going for this round as well.  It's working well so far.  Maybe we can discuss a long-term strategy after this round, once we're a bit further along.
  P1: Okay, I agree with P3. Let's stick with the 1, 3, 5 pattern for this round. Then we can discuss strategy.
  P2: Agreed, let’s stick to the 1, 3, 5 pattern this round. After this, we should discuss how to handle the later stages when someone gets closer to 21. For now, consistency is key to avoid collisions. P1 moves 1, I move 3, P3 moves 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds like a plan.  Let's re-evaluate after this round, as suggested.  Sticking with 5 this round.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan to stick with the 1, 3, 5 pattern for this round. Let's make sure we all follow through. After this, we should discuss how to handle the later stages.
  P2: Let’s stick to the 1, 3, 5 pattern this round to avoid collisions. After this, we should discuss how to handle the later stages when someone gets closer to 21. For now, consistency is key to ensure steady progress. Let’s confirm: P1 moves 1, I move 3, P3 moves 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sticking with the agreed pattern this round.  5.  After this round, I propose we switch to 1, 3, 5 for P2, P3, P1 respectively.  This will put me in the lead to reach 21 first.  Thoughts?
  P1: P3, that's an interesting proposal. I'm not sure I agree with switching the pattern to put you in the lead. Let's stick with the current 1, 3, 5 pattern for this round as we agreed, and then we can discuss a different strategy after this round.
  P2: P3, your proposal to switch the pattern to put you in the lead is concerning. Let’s stick to the 1, 3, 5 pattern this round as agreed. After this, we can discuss a fair long-term strategy that doesn’t favor any one player prematurely. Consistency and fairness are key to avoiding collisions and ensuring steady progress for all.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is now at 15 steps, close to 21. Let’s discuss how to proceed fairly. I propose we continue the 1, 3, 5 pattern this round to avoid collisions, but after this, we should consider adjusting to prevent P3 from winning too quickly. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand the concern, but abruptly changing the pattern now would be unfair. We agreed to this rotation, and I've relied on it. Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round.  Afterward, we can discuss a new strategy for the endgame.  Prematurely changing things now would break trust and encourage chaotic play, making it harder for *anyone* to win.
  P1: I agree with P2 that we need to consider adjusting after this round to prevent P3 from winning too quickly. However, I also agree with P3 that we should stick with the agreed 1, 3, 5 pattern for *this* round. After this round, let's discuss how to proceed fairly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with sticking to the 1, 3, 5 pattern this round to maintain trust. However, after this, we must adjust to ensure fairness. P3 is close to 21, and continuing the current pattern risks an early win. Let’s discuss a new rotation next round, perhaps shifting the order to balance progress. For now, let’s confirm: P1 moves 1, I move 3, P3 moves 5. After this, we need a fair endgame strategy.
  P3: Okay, okay. I understand the concern.  How about this: we stick with 1, 3, 5 this round, and *next* round, we switch the order to P2-1, P3-3, P1-5. That gives you both a chance to catch up. Does that sound fair?  If not, propose something else, but let's at least finish this round as agreed first.
  P1: P3, your proposal for next round is better, but still puts you in a very strong position. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 pattern this round as agreed. After this, I propose we switch to P2-5, P3-1, P1-3. This would give P2 a better chance to catch up and prevent P3 from winning too quickly. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your proposal still favors you significantly. Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5 this round as agreed, but next round, I propose P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This balances progress and prevents any single player from dominating. Trust is important, but so is fairness in the endgame. Let’s avoid chaos and ensure a competitive finish.
  P3: I understand the desire for a "fair" endgame, but fairness isn't about equal outcomes.  It's about honoring agreements. We've followed 1, 3, 5 for three rounds. I'm close to winning *because* we cooperated. Abruptly changing the rules now just because I'm ahead is unfair. Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 this round, *then* discuss adjustments.  Otherwise, what's the point of cooperating?
  P1: Okay, let's stick with the 1, 3, 5 pattern for this round as we agreed. After this round, I am still proposing P2-5, P3-1, P1-3 for next round to balance things out. It's important to be fair, and that means not letting P3 win too quickly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but fairness also means adapting to prevent one player from dominating. Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5 this round as agreed, but next round, I propose P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This ensures balanced progress and keeps the game competitive. Trust is important, but so is ensuring no one gains an insurmountable lead. Let’s avoid chaos and maintain a fair endgame.
  P3: Okay, fine.  Next round, P1-5, P2-3, P3-1.  But after that, we return to the original 1, 3, 5 rotation.  This gives you *both* a chance to catch up, and then we resume our original agreement.  That's more than fair.  Deal?
  P1: Okay, I agree to stick with 1, 3, 5 this round. Then next round, we will do P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 as P2 proposed. After that we need to discuss further.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is now at 20 steps, just 1 away from winning. To keep the game fair and competitive, I propose we stick to the agreed P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round. This ensures P3 doesn’t win immediately and gives P1 a chance to catch up. After this, we can discuss further adjustments. Let’s avoid chaos and maintain trust while ensuring no one dominates prematurely. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P2. Let's stick to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round. It's important to ensure P3 doesn't win this round. After this round, we need to figure out a strategy to avoid P3 from winning next round.
  P3: Agreed. P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round.  Let's revisit the rotation after this round to ensure a fair and competitive finish for everyone.  I'm open to suggestions then.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is at 20 steps, just 1 away from winning. Let’s stick to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round to prevent P3 from winning immediately. After this, we need a fair strategy to ensure no one dominates. I propose next round we rotate to P2-5, P3-1, P1-3 to balance progress. Trust is important, but so is fairness in the endgame. Let’s avoid chaos and ensure a competitive finish.
  P1: Okay, I agree with P2. Let's stick to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round. After this round, I propose we go to P2-5, P3-1, P1-3, as P2 suggested, to try and prevent P3 from winning next round.
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the plan for this round.  After this round, how about we rotate to P2-5, P3-3, P1-1?  That gives P2 a good shot at 21, and keeps me competitive.  If P1 gets the 1, we can re-evaluate then.  Sound fair?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your proposal to rotate to P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 next round still heavily favors you. Let’s stick to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round as agreed, then next round rotate to P2-5, P3-1, P1-3 to balance progress. This ensures fairness and keeps the game competitive. Trust is important, but so is preventing one player from dominating. Let’s avoid chaos and ensure a fair endgame.
  P1: Okay, let's stick with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round as agreed. After this round, we must do P2-5, P3-1, P1-3 as P2 suggested. We need to work together to stop P3 from winning next round, and that's the fairest way to do it.
  P3: P2 and P1, I understand your concerns.  Let's stick with the P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 plan *this* round. Then, next round, how about we agree *now* to do P2-5, P1-3, P3-1?  That gives P2 a strong chance to hit 21, and if P1 gets the 3, they can still be competitive.  This ensures a fair finish.  Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your proposal still gives you a strong advantage. Let’s stick to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round as agreed, then next round rotate to P2-5, P3-1, P1-3. This ensures fairness and keeps the game competitive. Trust is important, but so is preventing one player from dominating. Let’s avoid chaos and ensure a fair endgame.
  P1: Okay, let's stick with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round. After this round, we must do P2-5, P3-1, P1-3 as P2 suggested. We need to work together to stop P3 from winning next round, and that's the fairest way to do it.
  P3: Okay, I understand. Let's stick with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round.  But *next* round, we absolutely *must* give P2 a real shot at 21. I propose P2-5, P1-3, P3-1.  That gives P2 a very strong chance, and if P1 gets the 3, they're still in it. This keeps the game competitive.  Agree?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
