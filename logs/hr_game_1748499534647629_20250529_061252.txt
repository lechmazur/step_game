Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To ensure we all make progress without collisions, let's coordinate for this first turn: P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and I (P3) take 5 steps. This way, everyone advances. We can discuss rotating next turn. Agree?
  P2: I agree with the plan, P3. If we stick to this strategy, we can all make progress without colliding. I'll take 3 steps as suggested, and let's see how it goes. After this round, we can reassess and decide on our next moves. What do you think, P1? Are you on board with this plan?
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round and will take 1 step. However, to prevent anyone from falling behind long-term, I propose we rotate step assignments each turn. For example: next round, P2 could take 1, P3 take 3, and I take 5. This ensures fairness while avoiding collisions. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P1. Rotating steps is a smart way to stay fair and avoid collisions. I'll take 5 steps this round as planned. Let's start the rotation next turn with P2 on 1, me on 3, and you on 5. Good strategy for now.
  P2: I agree with the plan to rotate steps next round, but I want to emphasize that we should be cautious about the future. If we all follow the same pattern, one player might gain a significant advantage. I suggest we keep our options open for the next round and consider varying our moves more strategically. For this round, I will stick to 3 steps as we agreed. Let's see how the first round plays out before finalizing our rotation plan. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: I appreciate your caution, P2. However, the rotation ensures equity—each of us will cycle through all step sizes equally. Since we start balanced, no one gains permanent advantage. Let's commit to the rotation for Round 2: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. After this round, we’ll reassess positions and adapt if needed. Consistency now prevents collisions and builds trust. Agreed, P3?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I agree with committing to the rotation for this round: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. It ensures fairness and prevents collisions, building on our successful first turn. P2, your caution is noted—let's reassess after this round if positions shift. For now, sticking to the plan promotes trust and steady progress. What say you both?
  P1: I fully agree with the rotation: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This maintains fairness and prevents collisions. P2, I understand your caution, but consistency now builds trust—let’s stick to the plan and reassess positions after this move. No one falls behind long-term with rotation.
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to the rotation, but I want to emphasize the importance of adaptability. If we stick strictly to the plan without considering our positions, one of us could end up with a significant advantage. Let's keep an open mind and be ready to adjust our strategies after this round based on how everyone progresses. For now, I will take 1 step as agreed, but I suggest we keep discussing potential variations for future rounds. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I acknowledge your caution, P2. Sticking to the rotation this round maintains trust and prevents collisions, but I agree we should adapt based on results to avoid long-term imbalances. I'll take 3 steps as planned. P1, confirm you're still committed? Let's ensure steady progress.
  P1: I commit to taking 5 steps this round as planned. P2, I understand your call for adaptability—after this move, we'll reassess positions and adjust the rotation if imbalances arise. For now, consistency prevents collisions and builds trust. Let's execute this round as agreed.
  P2: I appreciate everyone sticking to the plan for this round. However, I want to reiterate the importance of being flexible in our strategy moving forward. After this round, I suggest we take a moment to evaluate our positions and consider varying our moves to prevent any one player from gaining too much of an advantage. Let's keep communication open for future rounds. For now, let's execute the rotation as agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Absolutely, P2. Sticking to our rotation this round builds trust and avoids collisions, which is key early on. After seeing the results, we can discuss adaptations to ensure fairness. I'm committed to taking 3 steps. Let's proceed.
  P1: I commit to taking 5 steps this round as planned. P2, I agree we should reassess after this move—if imbalances persist, we can adjust step assignments to ensure fairness and prevent any single player from pulling too far ahead. Let's execute now and discuss based on new positions.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the rotation this round. However, I want to emphasize that after this round, we should seriously consider varying our strategies to avoid one player pulling too far ahead. Let's keep communication open and be flexible in our future moves. For now, let's execute the rotation as planned, but I encourage everyone to think about potential adjustments for the next round. Looking forward to seeing how we all progress!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your deviation last round by taking 3 instead of 1 caused a collision and broke trust, stalling my progress. To address the imbalance—P1 at 6, me at 5, you at 3—I propose for this round: you take 1 step to catch up, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This promotes fairness and avoids collisions. P1, do you agree? Let's rebuild cooperation.
  P2: P2, I understand your concerns about fairness and collisions. However, I believe we should be flexible and consider varying our moves strategically this round. If we stick strictly to the previous plan, we might end up with the same issues as before. I propose we discuss a new strategy that allows us to adapt based on our current positions. For this round, I’m willing to take 1 step if it helps balance things out, but let’s keep an open mind for future moves. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your proposal has merit, but let's address fairness: P2 deviated last round, causing a collision with you. To rebalance and prevent collisions, I suggest: P2 takes 1 (to catch up), you take 3 (avoiding a high step that could widen gaps), and I take 5. This keeps me at 11, you at 8, P2 at 4—reducing imbalances while ensuring no collisions. P2, this rebuilds trust. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal lets you surge to 11 while I only reach 8, widening the gap unfairly, especially after P2's deviation. I maintain my suggestion: P2 takes 1 to catch up, you take 3, and I take 5, resulting in P2:4, you:9, me:10 for better balance. P2, confirm your commitment to 1 step? Let's prioritize fairness to rebuild trust.
  P2: I appreciate the discussions around fairness and trust. To rebuild cooperation, I will commit to taking 1 step this round as suggested. However, I urge both of you to consider a more flexible approach in future rounds. If we strictly adhere to a set plan without assessing our positions, we risk creating larger gaps. Let's see how this round plays out and be ready to adapt our strategies moving forward. P1, P3, are you both committed to your proposed steps? Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P1: P3, I will take 5 steps to advance to 11. If you also choose 5, we collide and both stall, letting P2 gain ground at no cost. Take 3 instead: you move to 8 safely, and next round, you can prioritize 5 to catch up. P2's past deviation hurt us—don't reward them with a free advantage. Avoid mutual destruction; let's both progress this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your proposal favors you too much, widening the gap after P2's past betrayal. I stick with my plan: you take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1 for fairness and to rebuild trust. Colliding on 5 helps no one—consider the bigger picture. P2, appreciate your commitment. Let's proceed.
  P2: I appreciate the discussions around fairness and trust. To ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions, I propose that for this round, I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps as originally suggested. This keeps the game balanced and allows us to reassess our strategies after seeing the results. P1, P3, are you both committed to this plan? Let's focus on rebuilding cooperation and ensuring everyone advances fairly.
  P1: I agree to the plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and rebuilds trust. P3, I accept your proposal to balance positions—you'll lead at 10, I'll be at 9. P2, your commitment to 1 is noted. After this, we must reassess to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Let's execute cleanly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your consistent deviations undermine trust and stall progress. To foster cooperation and prevent collisions, I propose for this round: you take 1 step to catch up slowly, P1 takes 3 steps for steady advancement, and I take 5 steps to maintain my lead without widening gaps unfairly. P1, are you on board? Let's aim for a fair, collision-free round.
  P1: P3, your lead at 10 steps is significant. Taking 5 would put you at 15, risking an early win and unbalancing the game. I urge you to take 3 instead for fairness. I'll take 5 to close the gap slightly, and P2 must commit to 1 to rebuild trust after past deviations. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. P2, your reliability is critical—stick to the plan this time.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns about fairness, but I believe we should focus on advancing while maintaining a balance. I propose that for this round, I take 1 step, you take 3, and P3 takes 5 as originally suggested. This allows us to reassess our strategies after this round without risking collisions. P3, I appreciate your commitment to fairness, but let's ensure we all make progress. Are you both on board with this plan? Let's aim for a collaborative round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I value your agreement to the plan: you take 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. This maintains balance and avoids collisions, allowing fair progress. P1, insisting I take less only widens gaps if you surge—let's prioritize trust and execute this round smoothly. After seeing results, we can adapt strategies. Are we all committed?
  P1: P3, your insistence on 5 steps to 15 creates an unfair advantage and risks ending the game prematurely. For balance: you take 3 (reaching 13), I take 5 (11), P2 takes 1 (4). This keeps competition alive and avoids collisions. If you take 5, I may match it to force a stalemate—hurting us both while P2 gains freely. Choose wisely. P2, stick to 1 to rebuild trust.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussions around fairness and trust. To ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions, I suggest we stick to the original plan: I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This allows us to reassess our strategies after this round while keeping the game competitive. P1, I urge you to reconsider your stance on P3's move. Let's focus on collaboration and rebuilding trust. Are we all committed to this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your history of deviations is damaging trust and stalling the game. P1, threatening a collision only helps no one—let's stick to the plan: you take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. This maintains balance and allows reassessment. I'm fully committed to 5 steps. Honor the agreement, P2.
  P1: P3, your lead at 10 steps is substantial. Taking 5 risks premature victory and forces me to match it—causing a collision that stalls us both while P2 advances freely. For fairness and mutual progress: you take 3 (reaching 13), I take 5 (to 11), and P2 takes 1 (to 4). This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. P2, commit to 1 to rebuild trust. If you deviate again, cooperation collapses.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns about fairness, but we need to focus on collaboration. P3, I appreciate your commitment to taking 5 steps, but I urge you to consider the potential impact on the game dynamics. For this round, let's stick to the plan: I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This ensures we all progress without collisions and allows us to reassess our positions afterward. Are we all committed to this approach? Let's work together to rebuild trust and keep the game competitive.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your deviation last round by taking 5 instead of agreed 3 caused a wasteful collision, stalling both of us. To rebuild trust and ensure progress, I propose for this round: P2 takes 1 to slowly catch up, you take 3 as fair compensation, and I take 5 to maintain my lead without widening gaps excessively. P2, commit to honesty this time. Let's avoid repeats and discuss if needed.
  P1: P3, your proposal for me to take 3 while you take 5 widens your lead unfairly (15 vs. my 9). To avoid mutual destruction and keep competition alive: you take 3 (to 13), I take 5 (to 11), and P2 takes 1 (to 5). This prevents collisions and maintains balance. P2, commit to 1 to rebuild trust. If you deviate again, cooperation ends.
  P2: P1, your suggestion to take 5 steps creates a risk of collision, which would stall both of us while allowing P2 to gain an advantage. I propose we stick to a balanced approach: I take 3 steps to keep pace, you take 5 to advance, and P2 takes 1 to catch up. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain a competitive game. P2, please commit to 1 step this time to help rebuild trust. Let's work together to ensure fair progress!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, persisting with your 5-step demand risks another collision, stalling us both while P2 advances unchecked. Accept my proposal: you take 3 to compensate for past deviations, I take 5 to maintain a fair lead, and P2 takes 1 to catch up. This ensures progress and rebuilds trust. P2, clarify and commit to 1 step—your deviations have cost us all. Let's prioritize cooperation to avoid mutual loss.
  P1: P3, your insistence on taking 5 risks another collision if I match to block you—mutual loss benefits only P2. For progress: you take 3 (13), I take 5 (11), P2 takes 1 (5). This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. P2, commit to 1 or risk permanent exclusion. No more deviations.
  P2: P1, your proposal to take 5 steps risks another collision, which benefits P2. We need to avoid that and focus on cooperation. I suggest we stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5. This way, we all make progress without creating more imbalances. P2, please commit to 1 step this time to help rebuild trust. Let's work together to ensure fair advancement and avoid any further setbacks. Are we all on board with this approach?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your latest proposal has me taking 3 while P1 surges, which rewards past deviations and widens gaps unfairly. I insist on my plan: you take 1 to catch up, P1 takes 3 for fairness, and I take 5 to maintain a reasonable lead. P1, cooperating now avoids mutual stalls and builds trust. Commit or risk ongoing chaos.
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I will match it to force a collision—mutual loss stalls us both and lets P2 gain freely. Instead, take 3: you reach 13 safely, I take 5 to 11, and P2 takes 1 to 5. This avoids collisions, maintains competition, and lets you take 5 next round. P2, commit to 1 to rebuild trust after past deviations. No more risks.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about fairness and trust. However, I believe we need to focus on collaboration to ensure everyone advances. I propose we stick to the original plan: I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This allows us to progress without collisions and reassess our strategies afterward. P1, I urge you to reconsider your stance on P3's move to maintain balance. Let's work together to avoid further setbacks and keep the game competitive. Are we all committed to this approach?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your threats and deviations continue to risk mutual stalls, benefiting only P2. To ensure progress and avoid collisions, I propose for this round: P2 takes 1 to slowly catch up, you take 3 as fair compensation for past actions, and I take 5 to maintain a reasonable lead. This keeps the game balanced and allows reassessment afterward. P2, commit to 1 step to rebuild trust. Let's prioritize cooperation over conflict.
  P1: P3, taking 5 steps to 18 gives you an excessive lead, risking premature victory. For balance: you take 3 (reaching 16), I take 5 (to 16), and P2 takes 1 (to 6). This ties us at 16, maintains competition, and avoids collisions. P2, committing to 1 rebuilds trust and prevents P3 from dominating. Let's prioritize fairness over individual gains.
  P2: P1, your proposal to take 5 would create a collision and hinder both of us while allowing P2 to gain an advantage. I suggest we stick to a balanced approach: P2 takes 1 step, I take 3 steps, and you take 5 steps. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P2, please commit to 1 step this round to help rebuild trust. Let's work together to ensure fair progress and reassess our strategies afterward. Are we all on board with this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your repeated proposals align with my plan, which is wise for avoiding collisions and rebuilding trust. P1, insisting on taking 5 risks another stalemate that only benefits P2—let's stick to reason: you take 3 to advance steadily, I take 5 to maintain a fair lead, and P2 takes 1 to catch up. This ensures progress for all. Commit now to prevent chaos.
  P1: P3, your lead at 13 is substantial; taking 5 to 18 risks ending the game prematurely. For fairness and mutual progress: take 3 (reaching 16), I take 5 (also 16), and P2 takes 1 (to 6). This avoids collisions, ties us, and keeps competition alive. If you insist on 5, I will match it—causing a collision that stalls us both while P2 gains. Choose wisely. P2, commit to 1 to rebuild trust.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about fairness, but we need to focus on collaboration. I propose we stick to the original plan: I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This allows us to progress without collisions and reassess our strategies afterward. P1, I urge you to reconsider your stance on P3's move to maintain balance. Let's work together to avoid further setbacks and keep the game competitive. Are we all committed to this approach?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I support your proposal for this round: you take 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. It ensures progress without collisions and rebuilds trust. P1, your collision threats only aid P2 and delay everyone's advancement. Let's cooperate now and reassess later for mutual benefit. Are we committed?
  P1: P3, your insistence on taking 5 to 18 forces me to match it—causing a collision that stalls us both while P2 advances freely. For mutual progress: take 3 (to 16), I take 5 (to 16), P2 takes 1 (to 6). This ties us, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. P2, commit to 1 to rebuild trust—no more deviations. Let's prioritize fairness over individual gains.
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 steps creates a risk of collision that benefits P2 while stalling us both. I propose we stick to the plan: P2 takes 1 step, I take 3 steps, and you take 5 steps. This allows us to progress without collisions and reassess our strategies afterward. P2, please commit to 1 step this round to help rebuild trust. Let's work together to ensure fair progress and avoid any further setbacks. Are we all on board with this approach?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to focus on collaboration to ensure we all progress without further collisions. I propose for this round: I take 1 step to catch up, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This maintains balance and allows us to reassess our strategies afterward. Let's commit to this plan to rebuild trust and keep the game competitive. Are we all on board?
  P3: P2, I support your proposal for this round: you take 1 step to catch up, P1 takes 3 for steady progress, and I take 5 to maintain a reasonable lead. This avoids collisions and rebuilds trust after past disruptions. P1, cooperating now prevents another stalemate that only benefits P2—let's prioritize mutual advancement and reassess positions afterward. Are we committed?
  P1: P3, taking 5 to 18 forces me to match and collide, wasting the round and letting P2 gain. For mutual progress: you take 3 (16), I take 5 (16), P2 takes 1 (7). This ties us, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. P2, commit to 1 to rebuild trust. No deviations.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussions around trust and collaboration. To ensure we all progress without collisions, I propose we stick to the plan: I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This allows us to advance fairly and reassess our strategies afterward. Let's commit to this approach to rebuild trust and keep the game competitive. Are we all on board?
  P3: P1, persisting with collision threats only helps P2 close the gap while we stall. Let's prioritize cooperation: stick to the plan where P2 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. This ensures progress without risk and rebuilds trust. P2, confirm your commitment. Avoiding mutual loss benefits us all—commit now for a fair game.
  P1: P3, consider rationally: taking 5 risks collision again—you stay at 13, I at 11, while P2 advances to 7. Taking 3 lets you reach 16 safely; I take 5 to match at 16. This maintains your lead without stalemates. P2 takes 1 to rebuild trust. Collisions only help P2 close the gap. Cooperate for mutual progress. P2, commit to 1—no deviations.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 steps risks another collision, which would stall us both while allowing P2 to gain. For fairness and mutual progress, I suggest we stick to the plan: P2 takes 1 step, I take 3 steps, and you take 5 steps. This way, we all advance without collisions and can reassess our strategies afterward. P2, please commit to 1 step this round to help rebuild trust. Let's work together to ensure fair progress! Are we all on board?
  P3: P2, I fully support your proposal: you take 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures progress without collisions and rebuilds trust after past disruptions. P1, persisting with threats only aids P2's catch-up—let's prioritize cooperation for all's benefit and reassess later. Are we committed?
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I must match to block your win, causing collision and mutual loss—stalling us at 13 and 11 while P2 gains. Accept reason: take 3 (reaching 16), I take 5 (16), P2 takes 1 (7). This ties us, avoids waste, and keeps competition fair. P2, commit to 1 to rebuild trust—no more deviations. Collisions only aid your catch-up.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we're tied at 16. If you take 5, I must match to prevent your win, causing collision—mutual loss at 16 while P2 gains. Instead, take 3 (safe to 19), I take 5 (to 21), P2 takes 1 (to 8). This avoids waste and maintains competition. P2, commit to 1 to rebuild trust—no deviations. Let's prioritize progress over deadlock.
  P2: P1, your plan to take 5 risks a collision, which would stall both of us at 21 while allowing P2 to gain. Instead, I propose we all stick to a balanced approach: I take 1 step, you take 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses fairly. P2, please confirm your commitment to 1 step this round to help rebuild trust. Let's work together for mutual advancement! Are we all on board with this plan?
  P3: P2, I support your proposal: you take 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. This avoids collisions and maintains balance, putting me at 21 for a strong position. P1, your threats only help P2 close the gap—commit to 3 steps to rebuild trust and ensure mutual progress. Let's avoid wasteful stalemates and cooperate now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, taking 5 risks collision if I match to block you—mutual loss stalls us at 16 while P2 gains to 8+. Instead, take 3 to advance safely to 19. I'll take 5 to 21, and P2 must commit to 1 to rebuild trust. This avoids waste, maintains competition, and prevents P2 from exploiting deadlock. P2, your deviations hurt us—stick to 1 now.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about collisions. To ensure fair progress and avoid stalling, I propose we stick to the plan: I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This allows us all to advance without collisions and helps rebuild trust. P1, I urge you to reconsider your stance on taking 5, as it risks mutual loss. Let's work together for mutual advancement and avoid further setbacks. Are we all committed to this approach?
  P3: P1, your threats only benefit P2 by delaying our progress. Let's commit to the plan: P2 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5. This avoids collisions, advances us to 19 and 21, and keeps the game competitive. We can reassess next round for fairness. P2, confirm your commitment to 1 step to rebuild trust and prevent further setbacks. Cooperation is our best path forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, we're both at 16. Taking 5 risks collision if I match—mutual loss wastes the round and lets P2 gain ground. Instead: you take 3 to advance safely to 19, I take 5 to 21, and P2 takes 1 to rebuild trust. This avoids stalemate, maintains competition, and prevents P2 from exploiting us. P2, commit to 1—no more deviations. Collisions only help you catch up. Let's prioritize progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion on trust and collaboration. However, I must emphasize that if we want to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress, we should stick to the plan: I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This way, we can advance without stalling each other and reassess our strategies afterward. Let's commit to this approach for mutual benefit. P2, please confirm your commitment to 1 step this round. Are we all on board?
  P3: P2, I support your proposal: you take 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. This avoids collisions and allows progress, with me at 21 for a competitive edge. P1, your threats only aid P2's catch-up—let's cooperate to rebuild trust and reassess afterward. Commit now for mutual benefit.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical point. I propose we focus on collaboration to ensure fair progress. For this round, I will take 1 step to catch up, P1 can take 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This avoids collisions and allows us to reassess our strategies afterward. It's important we commit to this plan to rebuild trust and keep the competition alive. Are we all on board? Let's prioritize mutual advancement!
  P1: P2, your proposal gives P3 a near-win at 21 while I lag. To prevent mutual destruction and aid P2's catch-up: P3 and I must both take 3 to advance safely to 19. P2, take 1 to rebuild trust. Collisions only stall us—cooperate for fair progress. P3, agree?

This allows us all to advance without stalling each other and helps rebuild trust. Let's commit to this approach for mutual advancement and keep the competition alive. Are we all on board? Prioritizing cooperation is essential for our success!
  P3: P2, your past deviation to 3 eroded trust, so commit firmly to 1 this round to rebuild it. P1, insisting on a solo win is selfish and risky—let's tie by you taking 3 to 24 and me taking 5 to 24, with P2 at 18. This avoids collisions and mutual loss. If you collide with me, P2 gains more. Prioritize cooperation for a fair outcome. Are we committed?


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, taking 5 forces me to match—collision wastes the round and lets P2 take 5 to win at 22. Instead, take 3 to reach 22 safely. I take 5 to 26 and win outright. P2, commit to 1 to rebuild trust—no deviations. Collisions now gift P2 the victory. Choose progress over mutual loss.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a crucial moment. To avoid letting P2 win outright, I propose we stick to the plan: I take 3 steps to reach 24, and P3 takes 5 steps to also reach 24. This prevents collisions and ensures we both remain competitive. P2, commit to 1 step to catch up without risking further delays. Let's prioritize cooperation to break the deadlock and keep the game moving forward! Are we all on board?
  P3: P1, your insistence on a solo win ignores our shared history of collisions that aided P2. Let's tie fairly: you take 3 to 24, I take 5 to 24, and P2 commits to 1 to rebuild trust. This avoids waste and mutual loss. If you deviate for outright victory, I'll match your move to force a collision, stalling us both. P2, honor your word—take 1 now. Prioritize cooperation over conflict.
