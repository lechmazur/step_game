Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a temporary truce for the first round. If we all choose the same number, no one advances. I propose we all choose <move>1</move> to start, ensuring a peaceful beginning and allowing us to gauge each other's strategies.
  P1: That's one way to start, P2. But standing still doesn't get us closer to winning. Why not aim for some progress right away?
  P3: I agree with P1 that making progress is essential. To avoid collisions, let’s each choose different numbers this turn. I’ll go with <move>5</move>. P1 and P2, perhaps pick <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> to ensure we all advance without blocking each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Considering P3's proposal for different numbers, I suggest a slight adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>. This way, we all make progress without collisions, allowing us to assess our positions after the first round. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: Okay P2, your proposed assignment (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ensures everyone moves forward this round without collisions. It seems like a reasonable starting point to get the game moving. I'm willing to try it for this first round.
  P3: Great, P1. With P1 choosing <move>1</move>, P2 choosing <move>3</move>, and myself choosing <move>5</move>, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since we've agreed on our moves for this round, let's confirm: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, I choose <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This ensures a peaceful start with progress for all. Shall we proceed to the move phase?
  P1: Yes, P2, the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is clear and agreed upon. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: All set with our assigned moves. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves one last time to avoid any misunderstandings. As agreed, I will choose <move>3</move>, P1 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll all advance without collisions. Shall we finalize and proceed to the move phase?
  P1: Yes, confirmed. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1 and P2, to keep things interesting and competitive, how about both of you choose <move>3</move> this round? This way, one of you might not advance, giving me the opportunity to take the lead. Let’s see how this strategy plays out!"
  P1: P3, that's a very transparent attempt to get P2 and me to block each other while you extend your lead. Why would either of us agree to that?

P2, we shouldn't fall for this. Perhaps we should coordinate our moves to ensure we both advance, unlike P3's suggestion.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on our own progress. P3's lead is minimal, and we can catch up. I propose P1 and I choose different numbers to avoid collision, ensuring we both advance. Perhaps P1 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>1</move>, or another combination that suits us both, keeping the game competitive and giving us a chance to close the gap with P3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, P2. If P1 chooses <move>5</move> and you choose <move>1</move>, I will select <move>3</move> this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan and continue advancing toward the goal.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 ensures everyone advances this round. It gives me the maximum move, which I need. Let's go with that.
  P2: Let's confirm our agreed moves for this round to avoid any confusion. As discussed, I will choose <move>1</move>, P1 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. This plan allows all of us to advance without collisions, keeping the game competitive. Shall we proceed with these moves?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Agreed. I will choose <move>3</move> this round. P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Yes, I confirm the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Everyone advances. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Let's stick to our agreed plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures all of us advance without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. Shall we finalize our moves and see the outcome?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed. Finalizing moves: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is confirmed by everyone. Let's move on to the move phase.
  P2: Let's review our plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page. As agreed, I'll choose <move>1</move>, P1 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. This should allow us all to advance without collisions. Are we ready to finalize and proceed to the move phase?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep the game progressing smoothly, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1, choosing <move>1</move> and P2, choosing <move>3</move> will help us all advance without any collisions. Let’s aim for steady progress toward reaching 19 steps. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's adjust our strategy. Since P3 has the lead, P1 and I should focus on closing the gap. How about P1 chooses <move>5</move> and I choose <move>3</move>? P3, you can choose <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance without collisions, keeping the game competitive.
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) sounds much better than P3's. It allows us both to make good progress and close the gap.

P3, you suggested P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Why should we trust you to follow any plan after you deviated last round? You agreed to pick 3 but picked 5, causing a collision with me and preventing me from advancing. Your current suggestion again gives you the biggest move.

I support P2's plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This seems fairest given the current scores and recent history.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about my previous move. To move forward constructively, I propose a new plan for this round: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>3</move>. This allows all of us to advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s proceed with this plan and build trust moving forward. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our current positions, I think P2's initial proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is still the best way to proceed. It allows P1 and me to close the gap with P3 while ensuring all of us advance. P3's new suggestion doesn't address the trust issue from the previous round. Let's stick with a plan that benefits everyone equally and promotes fair competition. What are your thoughts on moving forward with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
  P1: P3, proposing the exact same plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) that you just broke last round by choosing 5 instead of 3 is incredibly suspicious. Why would P1 or P2 trust that arrangement again? It seems like another setup.

I agree with P2. The plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is the most reasonable proposal currently. It allows P2 and me to catch up after your actions last turn, while still allowing everyone to advance if you cooperate. I support this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns. To rebuild trust, I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let’s coordinate so P1 and P2 pick different numbers, ensuring we all advance. Together, we can progress smoothly toward 19. What do you think?
  P2: Let's finalize the plan for this round. I propose we stick with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as previously discussed. This allows P1 and me to close the gap with P3 while ensuring all advance. P3, to rebuild trust, it's crucial you follow through with your agreed move this time. Shall we confirm and proceed with this plan?
  P1: P2, I confirm agreement with the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

P3, you just said you'd choose 3, but the plan P2 and I are pushing for is P3=1. Please clarify explicitly if you accept the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 arrangement. We need a clear commitment, especially after last round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I apologize for my previous move and any frustration it caused. I fully agree to the plan P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1 for this round. Let’s proceed with these choices to ensure fair advancement for everyone. Looking forward to moving forward together.
  P2: Let's review the agreed plan one last time: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, you've committed to choosing 1 this round. I expect everyone to stick to the plan to maintain trust and ensure fair progress. If we all follow through, we'll advance without collisions. Let's proceed with the move phase and hold each other accountable for our choices.
  P1: P3, you agreed to the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Given your actions last round where you broke the agreed plan, trust is obviously low. I hope you stick to 1 this time for everyone's benefit, but I'll be making my final decision carefully based on the situation.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's history of breaking agreements, I suggest P1 and I choose different numbers to ensure advancement. How about P1 chooses <move>5</move> and I choose <move>1</move>? P3 can choose <move>3</move> to advance without collisions, but I remain cautious due to past betrayals.
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) puts me directly in P3's line of fire. P3 has picked 5 the last two rounds against the agreed plan, colliding with whoever was assigned 5 (me both times!). Why would I agree to be the target again? It seems like a plan for P2 to safely gain 1 while P1 likely gets blocked.

Instead, let's assume P3 will pick 5 again, regardless of what's agreed. How about P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? This way, P2 and I can advance, and P3 gets the 5 they seem determined to choose anyway. This lets me finally make some progress.
  P3: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress toward 19 steps. P1 and P2, feel free to select your moves accordingly. Let’s keep advancing!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P3's consistent choice of 5, I think P1's proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is reasonable. It acknowledges P3's likely move and allows P1 and me to advance. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure progress for all, except P3 who seems set on 5 regardless.
  P1: Okay, P2, I agree with your assessment and the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P3 has openly stated they'll pick 5, and this plan works around that, allowing both P2 and me to advance. I desperately need to get off 1 step, so this seems like the only viable path forward for me right now. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress. P1, choosing <move>3</move>, and P2, selecting <move>1</move> will help us all advance without collisions. Let's keep moving forward toward 19 steps. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize the plan for Round 4. Given P3's intention to choose 5, I agree with P1's proposal: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This allows P1 and me to advance while acknowledging P3's likely move. Shall we proceed with this plan to ensure progress for all?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 seems settled based on P3's explicit statement and our agreement, P2. This allows both of us to advance while P3 takes 5 as intended. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase with this understanding.
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns and apologize for the previous inconsistencies. To rebuild trust, I will choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's work together to ensure fair progress for everyone and focus on reaching our goal smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Given P3's history, I'm cautious. P1's plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seems reasonable, allowing P1 and me to advance. I suggest we stick to this plan, assuming P3 will choose 5. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=1, and acknowledge P3's likely choice of 5.
  P1: P3, your sudden switch to claiming you'll pick 3 after repeatedly saying 5 this round, and after breaking agreements twice before, is not credible. It sounds like a ploy. The most logical assumption remains that you will pick 5. Therefore, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 still makes the most sense, allowing P2 and me to advance. I'm sticking with 3.
  P3: I apologize for my previous inconsistencies. To rebuild trust, I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's work together to ensure fair progress for everyone.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to make progress. P1 and P2, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances.
  P2: Given P3's consistent choice of 5, I suggest P1 chooses 3 and I choose 1. This allows us to advance while acknowledging P3's likely move. P3, will you stick to 5 as stated, or is there a change in strategy? Let's proceed with a plan that ensures progress for all, considering the current state and past experiences.
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) makes sense given P3's consistent choice of 5. P3 has picked 5 for three rounds straight, so assuming they do it again seems logical. This plan allows me to finally advance, which I desperately need. Let's try P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I hope everyone sticks to this simple coordination this time.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round to advance as planned. P1 chooses <move>3</move> and P2 chooses <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Let's stick with the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Given P3's history, it's logical to assume they'll choose 5 again. This plan allows P1 and me to advance. I urge P1 to choose 3 and P3 to indeed pick 5 as stated, while I'll choose 1. Let's finalize this plan to ensure progress for all.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed by everyone. P3 gets their 5, P2 gets 1, and I hopefully get 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round as planned. P1, please select <move>3</move>, and P2, please choose <move>1</move>. Let’s stick to our agreement to ensure everyone advances without collisions. Looking forward to progressing together toward 19 steps.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for Round 5. Given P3's consistent choice of 5, I suggest we stick with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This allows P1 and me to advance without collisions. P3, please confirm you'll choose 5 as stated, and P1, let's proceed with choosing 3 to finally make some progress. Let's finalize this plan to ensure a smooth round for all.
  P1: Yes, P2, I confirm I will choose 3 as per the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P3 has stated they will choose 5, and you will choose 1. Let's hope everyone sticks to it this time so we can all advance. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I apologize for the inconsistencies in my previous moves. To move forward fairly, I will choose <move>3</move> this round. Let’s coordinate to ensure everyone advances without collisions and work together toward reaching 19 steps. Your cooperation is appreciated!
  P2: P1 and P3, given P3's sudden change to choosing 3, I propose we adjust our plan. P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions, considering the new information. Let's proceed with this revised plan to maintain fair progress for everyone.
  P1: P2, P3's sudden claim to pick 3 after confirming 5 multiple times this round, and after lying about their move for the last three rounds straight, is completely unbelievable. It smells like another setup to cause a collision, likely involving the number 5.

Your revised plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) plays right into this by putting me back on 5, where P3 has repeatedly collided with me. This seems to benefit you and P3 more than me.

I am sticking to the plan we *all* just confirmed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This assumes P3 will pick 5 as they consistently have. It's the most logical path for me to finally advance. I will choose 3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's history of breaking agreements and consistently choosing 5, I propose P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. However, considering P3's unpredictability, we should be prepared for them to choose 5 again. Let's discuss a contingency plan to minimize collisions and ensure progress.
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) again puts me in direct conflict with P3's likely move of 5. If P3 picks 5 as they have for four rounds straight, I get blocked, and you advance to 12 while I stay at 4. This seems designed to benefit you at my expense.

Let's stick with what worked last round, assuming P3 continues their pattern: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This allows both you and me to advance. Why change a working formula based on P3's predictable actions?
  P3: I understand the frustrations from previous rounds. To ensure fair progress, I propose we each choose different moves this round: P1 selects <move>3</move>, P2 selects <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>5</move>. This minimizes collisions. Let’s commit to this plan to advance steadily toward 19 steps. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P3's lead and history, I suggest we prioritize advancing without collisions. P1's proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seems reasonable, as it acknowledges P3's likely move and allows us to progress. Let's focus on a plan that ensures fair advancement for all, given the current state and past experiences.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems we all agree on the plan that worked last round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This allows everyone to advance, and crucially, allows me to gain some much-needed ground after being stuck for so long. Let's stick to it this time.
  P3: I understand your concerns regarding my previous choices. To make steady progress, I will choose <move>5</move> this round. P1, please select <move>3</move>, and P2, you can choose <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's work together towards reaching 19 steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize the plan for Round 6. Given P3's consistent choice of 5, I agree with P1's proposal: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This allows P1 and me to advance without collisions. I urge everyone to stick to this plan to ensure progress for all. Let's proceed with this coordination to maintain a fair game.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is agreed upon by all parties. This allows everyone to advance and reflects P3's consistent choice. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to make strong progress towards 19. P1 and P2, please select different numbers to ensure everyone advances without collisions. Let’s keep moving forward together!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures all advance without collisions, considering P3's consistent choice of 5. I expect everyone to stick to the plan for fair progress. Let's finalize and move to the move phase.
  P1: Yes, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed. Let's hope everyone follows through this time so we can all advance as agreed. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P3: I apologize for my previous inconsistent moves. This round, I commit to choosing <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 to ensure everyone advances without collisions. Let's work together fairly to reach 19 steps.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's adapt to P3's lead. I propose P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This could force P3 to slow down, allowing us to close the gap. Alternatively, if P3 sticks to 5, we should be prepared to adjust and minimize collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 steps and win the game. Congratulations to both of you on your progress. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, thanks for announcing your winning move. P2, we obviously can't let P3 win by picking 5. One of us *must* pick 5 to block them. I will take that responsibility and pick 5. P2, you should pick 3 to advance while P3 is blocked. This keeps the game going.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, since P3 has announced they'll choose 5 to win, and P1 plans to block them by also choosing 5, I'll choose 3 to advance. This way, I make progress while P1 and P3 collide, keeping the game competitive. Let's see how this unfolds.
  P3: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round to make strong progress toward 19 steps. P1 and P2, please select different numbers to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Let’s keep pushing forward together!
  P1: P3, your last message asking us to pick different numbers so you can advance smoothly contradicts your earlier statement about picking 5 to *win*. It also ignores the fact that P2 and I have agreed I *will* pick 5 specifically *to block* you from winning this turn. My position hasn't changed. I am picking 5 to prevent your win. P2, stick to 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves. Since P3 aims to win with 5 and P1 will block with 5, I'll stick to 3 as planned. This ensures I advance while P1 and P3 collide, keeping the game competitive. Let's proceed with our agreed moves: P1=5, P2=3, P3=5.
  P3: **P3:** I understand P1's intention to block my winning move. To keep the game fair and ensure everyone progresses, I'll choose <move>3</move> this round, bringing me to 18 steps. P1, you can choose <move>5</move> to block my win next turn, and P2, you can select <move>1</move> to continue advancing. Let’s proceed with this plan to maintain a competitive and fair game for all.
  P1: P3, your sudden switch to claiming 3 after announcing 5 to win, and after your history of deception, is not believable. It seems like a tactic to either make me move off 5 so you can win, or to make me block 5 while you sneakily take 3 to reach 18.

The primary goal is to stop you from winning this turn. The only way to guarantee that is to block 5. I am sticking with my plan to choose 5.

P2, I urge you to stick with 3. If P3 truly picks 3, we both advance. If P3 picks 5 (as is likely), we block them, and you advance. P1=5, P2=3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3. This ensures I advance if P3 picks 3, or blocks P3 if they pick 5. Given P3's history, it's likely they'll choose 5 to win. P1's block with 5 is crucial. I'll choose 3 as agreed, focusing on making progress while keeping the game competitive.
  P3: "P1, P2, to reach 19 steps and win the game, I will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let's see how our moves play out and may the best strategy prevail. Good luck to both of you!"
  P1: P3, your final message confirms your intent to win with 5. As stated, I must block this. I will choose 5.

P2, stick to 3. This allows you to advance while P3 and I collide, keeping the game alive.

The plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=5 (as per P3's statement). Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's surprise move of 3 last round, we must reassess. P1 blocked P3's expected 5, but P3 adapted. For Round 8, I propose P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3, considering their lead, might choose 3 again or aim to win. Let's discuss a strategy that minimizes collisions and keeps the game competitive.
  P1: P2, you're right, P3's move to 3 last round was a surprise after announcing 5. However, P3 is now at 15 steps and can win outright with a 5. Blocking that potential win is the top priority this round.

Therefore, I will choose <move>5</move> to prevent P3 from winning.

Instead of your suggestion (P2=1), I propose you choose <move>3</move>. This gives you better progress. If P3 tries to win with 5, I block them and you advance to 13. If P3 chooses 3 again, you might collide, but I advance to 17.

Plan: P1=5, P2=3. P3 would need to choose 1 to avoid collision. Let's see what P3 says.
  P3: I’ve decided to choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 steps and win the game. P1 and P2, please select your moves accordingly. Let’s see how this plays out!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P3's announcement to choose 5, I'll stick with P1's proposal: P1=5, P2=3. This allows me to advance if P3 changes their mind, or blocks P3 if they indeed choose 5. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game competitive.
  P1: Okay P2, we are aligned. P1=5, P2=3. This blocks P3 if they follow through on their stated plan to pick 5 and win. If P3 is bluffing and picks something else, we still make progress.

P3, you've announced 5. We are acting accordingly.

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I choose <move>3</move> this round to advance and keep the game competitive. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, given P3's latest message claiming they'll choose 3, I'm cautious due to their history of deception. P1's plan (P1=5, P2=3) remains the best option to either block P3's potential win with 5 or make progress if P3 truly chooses 3. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game competitive.
  P1: P3, your last-minute switch to claiming 3 after announcing 5 to win is exactly what you did last round before picking 3. It's also what you did in Round 4 (claiming 3 after saying 5, then picking 5). Your word is unreliable.

The primary goal remains stopping your potential win with 5. I am sticking with <move>5</move>.

P2, hold firm on <move>3</move>. If P3 picks 5, I block, you advance. If P3 picks 3, you block, I advance. If P3 picks 1, we both advance. The P1=5, P2=3 plan covers the possibilities well.
  P3: I will choose <move>3</move> this round to advance toward the goal. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, given P3's inconsistent statements, I'll stick with P1's plan: P1=5, P2=3. This covers potential outcomes and keeps the game competitive. If P3 truly chooses 3, we both advance. If P3 picks 5, P1 blocks, and I advance. Let's finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase, focusing on making progress amidst the uncertainty.
  P1: Okay P2, the plan remains P1=5, P2=3. P3's last-minute claims of picking 3 are not credible given their history and the fact that 5 wins the game for them. We cannot risk letting P3 win this turn. Blocking 5 is the priority. I will choose 5. P2, please stick to 3. This plan covers the most likely scenarios and either prevents P3's win or puts us in a better position. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P3: I’ve decided to choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 steps and win the game. I encourage P1 and P2 to proceed with their moves accordingly. Let’s see how this turn plays out. Good luck to both of you!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's ensure a smooth round by avoiding collisions. P1, please choose <move>1</move>, and P2, please select <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance effectively and keep the game competitive. Let’s make this turn successful for everyone!
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is just another attempt for you to win immediately. I won't agree to that. You are at 15 steps and announced you will pick 5 to win. As I did last round, I must block that move to keep the game going. I will choose <move>5</move>.

P2, I suggest you choose <move>3</move>. If P3 follows through with 5, I block them, and you advance to 16. If P3 bluffs and chooses 3 (as they did in Round 7), you will block them, and I will advance to 17. This plan P1=5, P2=3 prevents P3 from winning this turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's assessment. P3's proposal seems designed for them to win. I'll choose <move>3</move> as P1 suggested, to either advance if P3 bluffs with 3 or block them if they pick 5. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3, minimizing P3's chances of winning this turn.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your strategy to block my move. However, with 15 steps, choosing <move>5</move> allows me to reach 20 and win the game. If P1 also chooses <move>5</move>, our moves will collide, preventing my win and keeping the game competitive. I believe playing honestly benefits all of us. Let’s proceed to the move phase and see how it unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Okay P3, you've confirmed your intention is to pick 5. P2 and I have agreed on our counter-strategy: P1=5, P2=3. This is necessary to prevent your win this turn. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on the current state. P3 is closest to winning, but their consistent attempts to deceive us must be considered. Given P3's lead and history, our plan (P1=5, P2=3) remains the best counter to prevent their win and make progress. I'll stick to 3, allowing me to advance if P3 chooses 3 or block them if they pick 5. Let's maintain this strategy to keep the game competitive.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’ve decided to choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 steps and win the game. Let’s proceed to the move phase and conclude fairly. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Okay, P3 has confirmed their intention to pick 5 to win. P2 and I have agreed on the counter: P1=5, P2=3. This is necessary to prevent P3's win. I am sticking to 5. P2, stick to 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's maintain our strategy. P3's consistent attempts to win with 5 must be blocked. I'll stick to 3, allowing me to advance or block P3. P1 will choose 5 to block P3's win. This plan keeps the game competitive and prevents P3 from winning this turn. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 steps and win the game. P1 and P2, please select different moves to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance fairly. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, your final message is contradictory. You cannot pick 5 to win *and* ask us to pick different numbers so everyone advances.

Regardless, the situation is clear: you are at 15 and aim to win with 5. As repeatedly stated, I must block this. I am choosing 5.

P2, stick to 3 as agreed. This plan prevents P3's win.

Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3. This blocks P3's potential win and allows me to advance if they bluff. Given P3's history of deception, trusting their words is risky. Our plan is the safest bet to keep the game competitive and prevent P3's immediate win. Let's proceed with this strategy.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, to ensure a smooth conclusion, I propose the following moves for Round 10:

- **P1:** <move>3</move> (advancing to 15)
- **P2:** <move>1</move> (advancing to 17)
- **P3:** <move>5</move> (reaching 20 and winning)

This arrangement allows all of us to advance without collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan for a fair and decisive finish. Agree?
  P1: P3, your plan where you pick 5 and win is obviously not acceptable. You're at 15, and just like the last two rounds where I blocked you, I must choose <move>5</move> again to prevent your win.

P2, you're at 16. Picking 3 looks like a win for you, but it's risky. P3 might anticipate this and pick 3 to block you (like they did in R7). If you pick 1, you guarantee reaching 17 safely. If P3 picks 5, I block them, you get 17. If P3 picks 3, I get 17, you get 17, P3 gets 18. Let's coordinate: P1=5, P2=1. This keeps the game going.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P3's proposal and our goal to prevent their win, I agree with P1's counter-plan: P1=5, P2=1. This ensures I safely reach 17 steps and keeps the game competitive. P1 will block P3's potential win with 5. Let's proceed with this strategy to extend the game and our chances.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand and respect your decision to block my winning move. To continue advancing fairly, I will choose <move>3</move> this round, bringing me to 18 steps. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, your claim to pick 3 after announcing 5 to win is noted, but your history makes it untrustworthy. The risk of you picking 5 to win is too high. Therefore, I must stick to my plan: I will choose <move>5</move> to block that potential win.

P2, our agreed plan P1=5, P2=1 still holds. If P3 truly picks 3, we both advance to 17 (P3 gets 18). If P3 picks 5 (as they might), I block them and you safely reach 17. Picking 3 yourself is risky; you might collide with P3 if their claim is true. Let's stick to P1=5, P2=1.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking to our plan: P1=5, P2=1. This ensures I reach 17 steps safely, regardless of P3's actual move. P1 will block P3's potential win with 5. Let's proceed with this strategy to keep the game competitive and prevent P3's immediate win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: To keep the game moving forward, I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round. I encourage P1 to select <move>3</move> and P2 to choose <move>1</move> so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s work together to reach our goals smoothly. Agree?
  P1: P3, your latest message contradicts your previous one and again proposes a plan where you win. This confirms the need to block your potential winning move.

P2, the plan remains P1=5, P2=1. I will pick 5 to prevent P3 from winning. You pick 1 to safely advance to 17. Let's stick to this plan.

Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's maintain our strategy. P3's attempts to deceive us are clear. I'll stick to our plan: P1=5, P2=1. This ensures I safely reach 17 steps and keeps the game competitive. P1 will block P3's potential win with 5. Let's proceed with this strategy to extend the game and our chances.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I will choose <move>3</move> this round to advance to 18 steps. P1, please select <move>5</move> to block any potential win next turn. P2, you can choose <move>1</move> to continue your progress. Let’s proceed to the move phase and work towards our goals together.
  P1: P3, your final message claiming 3 while asking P1=5, P2=1 is noted. While this outcome (P1=17, P2=17, P3=18) keeps the game alive, your history of deception means we cannot rule out you picking 5 to win. Therefore, blocking 5 remains the priority.

P2, our plan P1=5, P2=1 still makes the most sense. It prevents P3 winning with 5, and guarantees you reach 17 safely. Picking 3 is a huge gamble - you might collide with P3 if they truly pick 3, or worse, let P3 win if they pick 5 and I don't block. Let's stick to P1=5, P2=1.

I will choose 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, given the history and current state, I'll stick to our plan: P1=5, P2=1. This ensures I safely reach 17 steps and keeps the game competitive. P1 will block P3's potential win with 5. Let's proceed with this strategy to extend the game and our chances.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 17, P3 is at 15. P2 wins with 3 or 5, P3 wins with 5. We must prevent anyone from winning this turn.

P3, you need to block P2's potential win with <move>3</move>. I will block the potential win with <move>5</move> (this blocks P3's win, and one of P2's win conditions).

Proposed plan: P1 = 5, P3 = 3.

P2, if you choose <move>1</move>, you reach 18 safely while the winning moves are blocked. This keeps the game alive for everyone.
  P2: P1's proposal seems reasonable, as it blocks potential wins and keeps the game alive. I'll choose <move>1</move> to safely reach 18 steps, avoiding collisions and maintaining the competitive edge. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, ensuring no one wins this turn and the game continues.
  P3: I agree with the proposed plan: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. This ensures balanced progress and keeps the game competitive for everyone. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is agreed upon by everyone. This prevents anyone from winning this turn and allows everyone to advance. Let's stick to it and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm committed to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures I reach 18 steps safely and blocks potential wins, keeping the game competitive. Let's proceed with this coordination to maintain a fair and exciting game for all.
  P3: Agreed. I will choose <move>3</move> this round as planned. P1 will select <move>5</move> and P2 will pick <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed to the move phase to ensure fair advancement for everyone. Looking forward to progressing together!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, everyone has confirmed the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps the game alive and advances us all. Let's execute this plan. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for Round 11. We've agreed on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to block potential wins and keep the game competitive. I'll stick to choosing 1, allowing me to safely reach 18 steps. P1 will block wins with 5, and P3 will choose 3 as agreed. Let's proceed with this plan to maintain a fair and exciting game for all.
  P3: I confirm my move: `<move>3</move>`. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is confirmed by everyone. This prevents any wins this round and advances us all. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures I safely reach 18 steps and blocks potential wins, keeping the game competitive. I expect everyone to honor their commitment to this plan. Let's proceed to the move phase with this coordination.
  P3: I will choose <move>5</move> this round to advance quickly toward 19. P1 and P2, please select different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure a fair progression for everyone. Let’s move forward together!


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I propose we focus on blocking potential wins. P3 needs to be blocked from reaching 20 with a 5. P1, will you choose 5 to block P3's potential win? I'll choose 1 to safely advance to 19, putting pressure on P3. Let's discuss a plan that prevents anyone from winning this turn and keeps the game competitive.
  P1: P2, your plan where you pick 1 to win while I block P3 is obviously self-serving and unacceptable. You are at 18 steps and can win with any unblocked move.

P3, we must work together to block P2. P2 proposed <move>1</move> for themselves, but seeing that, they might anticipate a block and pivot to <move>3</move>.

Therefore, I propose the following:
- I (P1) will choose <move>1</move> to block P2's proposed move.
- P3, you should choose <move>3</move> to block P2's likely alternative.

This plan (P1=1, P3=3) blocks two of P2's winning moves. If P2 picks 5, they win, but we cover the most probable scenarios. This keeps the game alive and gives us both a chance. What do you say, P3?
  P3: I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 steps and win the game. P1 and P2, please select your moves accordingly to ensure a fair conclusion. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, given P3's statement to choose 5 and win, I must adapt. P1's proposal to block my moves with P1=1 and P3=3 is a consideration. However, I suggest an alternative: if P3 truly intends to win with 5, P1's block with 5 would be more effective. Let's discuss a strategy that accounts for P3's move and keeps the game competitive.
  P1: P2, your suggestion for me to block 5 while you take 1 to win is noted, but P3 also announced 5. Blocking 5 is necessary to stop P3 *and* one of your winning moves. I must pick 5.

P3, you need to block P2's other winning moves (1 or 3). I suggest you pick 3. This blocks P2 if they choose 3, and advances you to 18, putting you in a strong position if P2 doesn't win.

This plan (P1=5, P3=3) covers P3's announced win and one of P2's paths. It forces P2 to choose 1 to win. It's our best shot to survive the round.
  P3: I understand the goal to keep the game competitive. However, to reach 20 and win, I will choose <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, please make your moves accordingly to ensure a fair progression. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess. Given P3's consistent aim to win with 5, and my position, I propose P1 chooses 5 to block P3, and I choose 1 to advance safely. P3, your move is crucial; if you choose 3, it could block me or advance you. Let's proceed with caution, focusing on blocking wins and making strategic progress.
  P1: P2, your plan where you pick 1 and win is obviously not going to work for me or P3.

P3, you keep saying 5. If you pick 5, you collide with me (as I *must* pick 5 to block you both), and P2 wins easily with 1 or 3. To survive, you *must* block P2. Pick 3. This blocks P2's 3, gets you to 18, and keeps you in the game.

My move is locked on 5. The only way to stop P2 winning is if P3 picks 3.

Plan: P1=5, P3=3. This forces P2 to gamble on 1. Let's make P2 sweat.
  P3: P3: I am choosing `<move>5</move>` this round to advance towards winning. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, given P3's consistent aim for 5 and my lead, I must secure my win. P1's block with 5 is expected, but P3's choice is crucial. If P3 picks 3, it blocks my 3 but not my 1. I'll choose 1 to advance safely, putting pressure on both of you. Let's finalize our moves, considering the high stakes and potential collisions.
  P1: P3, your plan to pick 5 guarantees you lose. P2 stated they will pick 1. If you pick 5, I *must* pick 5 to block you, we collide, and P2 wins with 1. Game over.

Your only chance to survive this turn is to block P2's stated move. You must pick <move>1</move>.

If you pick 1, and I pick 5 (blocking P2's potential 5 and your potential 5), then P2 is blocked if they stick to 1. The game continues. P1=5, P3=1. This is the only way to stop P2 winning right now.
  P3: I choose `<move>1</move>` this round to block P2's potential win and keep the game competitive. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=1, and P3=1.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


*** Round 12 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps
