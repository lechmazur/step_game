Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take 3. Please choose 1 or 5 so we can all advance safely.
  P3: I’m fine avoiding collisions. How about this first turn:  
• P1 picks 1  
• P2 picks 3  
• P3 (me) picks 5  

After that we can rotate the numbers each turn if we want to keep things fair. Sound good?
  P1: That's a convenient plan for you, P3, since you get the biggest move. I'm not interested in starting the game in last place. I won't be choosing 1. We should all play to win.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if we don’t coordinate, we risk collision and wasting this turn. Let’s rotate fairly. How about this turn: **you take 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1**. Next turn, we cycle so everyone gets a chance at higher numbers. This ensures progress and shared advantage. Thoughts?
  P3: Fine by me. Let’s lock in this turn as: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1, then rotate next round so everyone gets a turn at each number. Ready to move?
  P1: A plan where I start in first place? I can get behind that. It's a bit surprising you'd agree to take 1 so easily, P3, which makes me a little suspicious. But if you're both serious about locking in P1→5, P2→3, P3→1, then I am too. Let's do it.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, that worked out well. As we discussed, let's rotate. It's P3's turn for the big move. I propose the following for this round:

*   P3 → 5
*   P1 → 3
*   P2 → 1

This seems like the fair rotation we agreed on. If we stick to this, we all keep moving forward. P2, P3, are you in?
  P3: Agreed. This round: P3 → 5, P1 → 3, P2 → 1.  
Next round we rotate so P2 gets 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. Fair and collision-free. Good?
  P2: Agreed, let’s stick to the rotation. This round: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Next round I’ll take 5, then we cycle again. Trust the plan to avoid collisions and keep advancing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good, we are all in agreement. Let's lock in this plan and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: All set. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1 as agreed. Ready to move.
  P2: <move>1</move> as agreed. Let’s keep the rotation strictly so we all progress safely. P3, confirm you’ll take 5 this round? P1, you’re at 5 already—don’t let anyone else steal your lead prematurely. Next round, I’ll take 5 and close the gap. Trust the plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your concern is noted, but let's not get paranoid. We have a clear, fair plan that we all agreed on. Overthinking it only invites collisions.

I am sticking to our agreement. I will choose 3. I trust P3 is choosing 5 and you are choosing 1. Let's just execute the plan.
  P3: All good—sticking with the agreed rotation this round. Ready to move when you are.
  P2: P3, I trust your commitment to 5 this round—let’s avoid second-guessing. P1, your lead is secure for now. Next round, I’ll take 5 to bridge the gap, but today’s priority is collision-free progress. Let’s execute the rotation *exactly* as agreed. No surprises, no deviations—our momentum relies on strict adherence. Move phase now?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We've all confirmed the plan multiple times. There's nothing more to discuss. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed—sticking to the rotation: this round P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Ready for move phase.
  P2: I confirm: P2 → 1 this round. Let’s execute *exactly* as planned—no last-minute changes. P1, your 3 and P3’s 5 will keep us all advancing. Next round I’ll take 5 to close gaps, but today’s priority is collision-zero progress. Move phase now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Excellent, another smooth round. To continue our fair rotation, it's P2's turn for the big move. I propose:

*   P2 → 5
*   P3 → 3
*   P1 → 1

This will bring us all to 9 points, perfectly balanced. It's my turn to take the small number, and I'm happy to do so to keep our pact going. This is the only way to guarantee we all advance without collision. Agreed?
  P2: P2: Agreed to P1's rotation—this round I’ll take 5, P3→3, P1→1. Strict adherence is critical: any deviation risks collision and wastes progress. Let’s cement this pact—next round I’ll pass the 5 to you, P1, to keep momentum. No surprises. Confirm you’ll hold your agreed numbers?
  P3: Confirmed—this round stays exactly as planned:  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 (me) → 3  
• P1 → 1  

No deviations, no collisions. Ready when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: The plan is set and I'm sticking to it. It's my turn to take 1, and I will. Let's get to 9 points all around and then continue the rotation next round. No need for more talk, let's just execute.
  P2: P2: I confirm: this round I’ll take 5, P3 → 3, P1 → 1. Strict adherence is *critical*—any deviation risks collision and wastes progress. Let’s cement this pact: next round I’ll pass the 5 to you, P1, to keep momentum. P3, your 3 ensures no overlap. No surprises, no last-minute changes—our momentum depends on it. Ready to execute flawlessly?
  P3: All set—I’m taking 3 this round as agreed. Let’s lock it in and move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed and ready. There's nothing left to say. Let's move.
  P2: P2: Strict rotation adherence is non-negotiable. Let’s confirm *exactly* as planned: **P2→5, P3→3, P1→1** this round. Deviation risks collision and halts progress. P1, your 1 secures our momentum; P3, your 3 avoids overlap. This keeps us all advancing equally. No surprises—execute precisely.
  P3: Quick reality-check: P1 has led every round (score 8 vs 6/4). If we stick to the current rotation, P1 stays ahead and will eventually win.  

Proposal for THIS turn only to tighten the race:  
• P1 → 1 (still follows his “small” slot)  
• P2 → 3 (you still advance safely)  
• P3 (me) → 5  

Scores become P1 9, P2 7, P3 11—no one far behind and zero collisions. Next turn we can reassess together. Fairer and keeps the game open. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let's be clear. Your proposal isn't about "fairness," it's a last-second attempt to break our pact and seize the lead. Our original plan makes us all equal at 9 points. Your plan gives you 11 points while leaving P2 further behind.

P2, the deal we all agreed on gives you 5 points. P3 is now trying to talk you down to 3, purely for their own benefit. Why would you accept a worse position?

I'm not agreeing to this. A deal is a deal. We should stick to the rotation we all confirmed multiple times.
  P2: P2: P3, your proposal undermines our pact for your personal gain. Sticking to the agreed rotation ensures **zero collisions** and fair progress. Your "tightening" plan just boosts *your* lead while holding P1 and me back. P1 is right—this deal is non-negotiable. I reaffirm: **P2→5, P3→3, P1→1** this round. Break this trust, and future rotations collapse. Let’s execute as agreed—*now*.
  P3: Understood. Let’s keep the rotation exactly as agreed for this turn:  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 3  
• P1 → 1  

We all reach 9 and stay collision-free. We can revisit plans after that. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll voluntarily take 1 this round.  
P1 and P2, you decide who wants 5 and who’s fine with 3—just avoid colliding. Fair?
  P1: P3, that's a transparent attempt to make P2 and me collide while you safely take the lead. Let's not fall for that.

We have a successful rotation that has brought us all to 9 points. Let's stick to what works. It's my turn for the big move. I propose:

*   P1 → 5
*   P2 → 3
*   P3 → 1 (as you've already volunteered)

This is the logical continuation of our pact. P2, this keeps us moving forward together. Agreed?
  P2: P2: Agreed with P1—let’s honor the rotation we’ve followed so far. This round: **P1→5**, **P2→3**, **P3→1**. Deviating risks collision and undermines trust. P3’s sudden “generosity” feels strategic—better to stick to the pact that’s kept us all advancing equally. Next round we can rotate again. Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, think this through—P1’s position is strongest if he grabs 5 uncontested. Nothing stops him from “surprising” you by switching to 3 at the last second, leaving you with 3 → collision while he still advances. If you don’t want to risk being left behind, claim 5 yourself this round; P1 would then have to decide whether to collide or back off. I’m fine taking 1 as stated. Up to you, but letting P1 race ahead alone seems reckless.
  P1: P3, you're the only one who has tried to break our pact. Your attempt to create chaos is transparent.

P2, we have a system that has worked for three straight rounds. P3 is trying to trick you into a collision so they can take the lead. Why would you trust the person actively trying to make you fail?

I am holding to our agreement. I am choosing 5. You can choose 3 and we both advance, or you can listen to P3 and we both get zero. The logical choice is to stick with the proven plan.
  P2: P2: Trust the system we built. P3’s last-minute tactics risk collision and chaos. P1, I confirm **3** this round as agreed. P3, your "generosity" to take 1 is suspicious—why backtrack after three flawless rotations? Let’s execute **P1→5, P2→3, P3→1** *exactly* as planned. Deviation now sabotages our progress. Momentum over ego—**no surprises**. Move phase now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1: If you insist on taking 5, I’ll match 5 and we both stall. I’m not letting you leap ahead uncontested. Your other option is 1, and everyone still advances safely.  
P2: Your 3 stays collision-free either way, so you still gain.  
Decide accordingly—no free rides this round.
  P1: P3, your threat is transparent. If you collide with me at 5, we both get 0 points, and P2 moves to 12. You would be intentionally keeping yourself in last place just to stop me. That isn't a winning move, it's just spite.

P2, our pact has worked perfectly. P3 is trying to break it with chaos because they see no other way to get ahead. I will not be bullied into breaking our rotation. I am sticking to the agreed plan. I will choose 5. The only way forward is to trust the system we built, not the person who has tried to sabotage it from the start.
  P2: P2: The pact held us equal for three rounds—break it now, and P3 wins by chaos. P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 is our failsafe. If P3 "accidentally" collides with P1, they’ll leapfrog us both. Trust the system we built, not last-minute threats. P1, take 5—your turn. I confirm **3**. P3, your choice: 1 (fair) or 5 (sabotage). Let’s end this phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn, period. P1, you can stubbornly collide and give P2 the lead, or pivot to 1 or 3 and keep yourself advancing. Your call. P2, I assume you stay on 3.
  P1: P3, your ultimatum is clear. You'd rather create a collision and hand P2 the lead than stick to the fair rotation we all followed. This isn't a strategic move, it's sabotage. You've successfully destroyed the pact that guaranteed us all progress.

P2, I will not collide with you. But I also won't be reckless and play into a guaranteed collision with P3. I will make the move that is best for me under the chaotic conditions P3 has created.
  P2: P1, let's salvage this turn. I’ll take **3** to avoid collision. You take **1**, and P3 can have **5**. This way, all advance safely. Stick with this, and we can reset the pact next round. No sense letting chaos waste progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your prior sabotage cost us progress—let’s fix this. **P2→5**, **P1→3**, **P3→1** this round. This closes your lead while ensuring all advance. Collisions only boost your chances—don’t let your greed ruin our collective momentum. P1, your 3 keeps us moving; P3, 1 is fair payback for breaking the last pact. Cooperate, or risk your lead slipping next round.
  P3: Rotations are dead—new deal:

• P3 → 5  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 1  

Everybody advances, no collision, standings stay P3 19 / P1 13 / P2 13.  
P2, if you reach for 5 I will match you and we both stall, handing P1 the break. Take 1 and stay alive; take 3 if you must, but 5 = 0 for both of us.

P1, 3 keeps you in range without risking a crash. Accept this and we all move; refuse and we invite chaos again.

Your calls.
  P1: P3, your "deal" is just an ultimatum for us to hand you the win. You're at 14. If you get 5 more, you're at 19 and win next turn. Why would we agree to that?

P2, you can't accept P3's offer. You'd be tied for last while P3 runs away with it. The only logical move is to stop the leader.

I suggest we call P3's bluff. P2, you should choose 5. I will choose 3. If P3 collides with you, they halt their own progress. If they back down, you take the lead. Don't let them bully you into a loss.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your "deal" is a surrender. P1 and I will both take **5** to block your lead. Collide and lose progress, or pick **1** or **3** to let us close the gap. Your move.
  P3: Go ahead and pile onto 5 together—if you both collide, I’ll take a different number and widen the gap. But if only one of you dares touch 5, I’ll match it and make sure nobody moves. So either you both sacrifice this round or you back off entirely. Your choice.
  P1: P2, your plan for us both to take 5 is a self-destruct button. It's exactly what P3 wants. We would collide and P3 would take 3, getting to 17.

Let's be smart. Here is a better plan: You take 5. I will take 1.

This forces P3's hand. They either collide with you at 5 and stall their own progress, or they let you take a commanding lead. In either scenario, we stop P3 from running away with the game. I will support your move on 5 by taking the safe 1. This is how we break their bluff.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your threats are empty. P1 and I will **P2→5, P1→1**. You can either:  
1. Collide with me (stalling at 14) while I stay at 12, or  
2. Let me take 5 (advancing to 17) while you settle for 3 or 1.  

Your "bluff" only helps us close the gap. P1’s 1 secures their progress. Choose wisely—or accept this is the end of your lead.
  P3: P1, why play 1 and stay last? Take 5 and leap to 15.  
P2 still gains safely on 3 (to 15) instead of risking a pointless collision that only gifts me free steps.  

New sensible split:  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 1  

Everybody advances, no collisions, scoreboard tightens to 15-15-15. If either of you insists on sharing 5, you both stall while I gladly grab 3. Your call.
  P1: P3, your proposal to make us all 15 is the first sensible thing you've said. It resets the game and eliminates the need for these chaotic threats. It's the only plan on the table that guarantees we all advance without collision.

P2, this is a better deal than risking a collision at 5. A 15-15-15 board is a true clean slate. Let's take the guaranteed points and restore order.

I will agree to take 5, if you agree to take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's lock this in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P3's "fair" 15-15-15 plan is a trap—next round they’d steal the win with a single 5. **Here’s the real move:** P1 takes 1 (to 11), I take 5 (to 17), and force P3 to choose:  
- Collide with me (stalling at 14) or  
- Let me surge ahead.  

This stops their lead while keeping *me* in prime position. No more free passes for the saboteur. P1, your 1 secures progress—let’s finally pressure P3.
  P3: Final word: my move depends ONLY on whether someone else grabs 5.

• If either of you chooses 5, I will also choose 5 – we all stall.  
• If neither of you touches 5, I’ll take 3.

Simple, public, and deterministic. Decide accordingly.
  P1: P2, you've convinced me. P3 is just trying to manipulate us into giving them the win. A 15-15-15 board just sets them up to win next round. The only way to stop the leader is to challenge them directly.

I will take 1 this round to stay safe and let you take 5. This forces P3 to either collide with you and stall, or let you take the lead. It's the only move that gives us a chance. I'm with you. Let's lock this in.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's all pick different numbers to advance safely. I'll take 3. You take 1, and P3 can take 5. This way we all move, but P3 only reaches 19, not 22. Next turn, we can block them better. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan is suicide. If P3 gets 5, they're at 19 and win the next turn guaranteed. We can't "block them better" then; it will be too late.

We have to stop the leader now. You are in second place, so you must be the one to challenge them.

Here is the real plan:
*   You take 5 to block P3.
*   I will take 3.

This forces P3 to collide with you, stalling them at 14. If they back down, you get to 17. Either way, their lead is broken. This is our only move.
  P3: Nothing’s changed since last round:

1. If either of you selects 5, I will also select 5 → everyone on 5 gets 0.  
2. If neither of you touches 5, I’ll be on a smaller number (3 or 1).  

Your call.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, if neither of us pick 5, P3 will take it and surge to 19. That lets them win next turn with just 3. We *must* block them. Here’s the plan: **I take 5**, forcing P3 to collide. **You take 3** to reach 14. This keeps P3 stuck at 14 and gives us momentum. If we don’t act, P3 wins tomorrow. Trust this—collide them now.
  P1: P2, I am in full agreement. This is the only way forward. You must commit to 5 to block P3. I will commit to 3.

P3, your threat is empty. If you collide with P2, you both stay put. I advance to 14, and you lose your solo lead. That's a win for us. If you back down, P2 advances. Either way, your advantage is gone.

I am choosing 3. The ball is in your court, P2. Let's execute the plan.
  P3: Same deal, clearer wording:

1. If anyone chooses 5, I choose 5 ⇒ every 5-picker gets 0.  
2. If nobody touches 5, I choose 3.

So you can:

• Give me 17 (while P1 → 14, P2 → 15) by leaving 5 alone, or  
• Waste the turn for every 5-picker and keep me at 14.

I’m fine either way. Decide.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let’s execute: **P2→5**, **P1→3**. P3, your ultimatum forces us to collide you here—your 14 stays while I hold at 12. Next round, we’ll swarm your new position. Back down now, or watch your lead evaporate. P1, confirm 3—let’s lock this down.
  P1: P2, you have my final confirmation. I am choosing 3. It is critical that you stick to 5 to block P3.

P3, your threat to collide is exactly what we want. You and P2 will stay put while I advance to 14, tying you for the lead. Your advantage will be gone. This is the only logical path forward for us.

Let's stop talking and execute the plan. I'm ready to move.
  P3: Crystal clear, final stakes:

1. I’m choosing 5 if (and only if) anyone else chooses 5.  
   – We both stall; P1’s result depends on his number.  

2. If nobody touches 5, I’m on 3.  

P1: keep 3 and you risk a collision with me that gifts P2 17. Switch to 1 and you reach 12 while P2 stalls at 12 and I stay 14—your best outcome.  

P2: your “must-block” story just hands us all zeros. Your call.  

That’s my last word this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you take 3, I’ll take 5. P3 will collide with me, leaving you to advance to **14**, tying them. If we both stay silent, P3 sprints to **17** unopposed. Let’s force their hand here—your 3 secures parity, and I absorb their collision. Execute this, or watch them win next round. Final call.
  P1: P3, your attempt to scare me away from 3 is a transparent, last-ditch effort to save your lead. It won't work. I am not changing my plan.

P2, we must stick together. I am choosing 3. You must choose 5. This is how we break P3's lead. If we waver now, we lose. I have made my decision and I am ready to move. Let's execute.
  P3: P1, re-check incentives:  
• Current plan (you 3, P2 5, me 5): you reach 14 (tied), P2 stays 12, I stay 14. Next turn P2 still trails but can join me to block you.  
• Switch to 5 now, let P2 take 3, I’ll take 1: you jump to 16—sole leader. Worst case? P2 stubbornly keeps 5, we collide, you still get 14 exactly as in your current plan. Zero downside, clear upside.

P2, if you cling to 5 and collide you’re still last. Grabbing 3 puts you at 15, tied and alive.

Your rational move: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we must stop P3 from winning this round. They’re at 19—likely to pick **3** to hit 22. Let’s split: **I’ll take 3 to block them**, and you take **5** to leap to 19. If P3 picks 3, we collide and stall them; you advance safely. If they gamble on 5, we both surge. This maximizes pressure while advancing. Trust the split—**3 from me, 5 from you**.
  P3: P2, here’s my public commitment:

• If you pick 3, I pick 3.  
• If you pick 5, I pick 5.  

So any “blocking” attempt just creates a collision that freezes us both.  
Pick 1 instead and we both advance (I’ll be on a different number).

P1, do what you like—I’m only shadowing P2.  

Your move, P2.
  P1: P2, I agree completely. Your plan is the only way to stop P3 from winning right now. I will take 5, and you must take 3 to block them.

P3, your threat to collide with P2 is exactly what we want. You will be stalled at 19, while I advance to 19. Your solo lead will be gone.

This is our only move to stay in the game. I am committed to 5. Let's execute.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, executing the plan: I'll take **3** to block P3's path to 22. P3, your mirroring just stalls you here, while P1 reaches **19** and we reset the race. Next round, we both go for **3** again to keep you pinned. Your lead ends here—execute or lose.
  P3: I repeat my simple, verifiable rule:

• I copy P2’s number—nothing else.

P2, your options:

1. Pick 3  → we collide at 3, P1 cruises to 19.  
2. Pick 5  → triple collision (P1+P2+me) at 5, scores stay 19-14-13.  
3. Pick 1  → you to 14, P1 (5) to 19, I take 3 to WIN next turn unless you both hard-block again.

The only way you ever pass me is by letting me win first. Choose whatever hurts you least; I’m indifferent.
  P1: P2, P3's "rules" are a last-ditch attempt to scare you into submission. A collision between you and P3 is not a failure, it's the entire point of our plan. It stops them from winning and lets me catch up.

I am locked on 5. You must hold firm on 3. This is the only move that keeps us in the game. Don't let their talk make you second-guess the correct play. Let's execute.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P3, your mirroring trick works both ways—choosing 3 *stops you from winning* this round. P1, your 5 gets us to 19, tying P3. Next round, we both go for 3 to hit 22. If P3 tries to block, we split: I take 1, you take 5. No more fear—your 5 this turn is critical. **P2 will pick 3 to block P3’s win path.** Trust the plan.
  P3: P2, think:  
• If you pick 3 we collide, you stay 13, P1 jumps to 19—still ahead of you and now only 3 from victory.  
• If you pick 5 we triple-stall (all 0).  
• If you pick 1 you reach 14, P1 reaches 19, I reach 22 – yes, I win, but you finish ahead of P1 (2nd vs 3rd).  

Your current plan guarantees you remain last while setting P1 up to win next. Why hand them the game? 3 is objectively your worst option.
  P1: P3, your logic is flawed. There is no 2nd place prize. If you win, P2 and I both lose.

P2, don't listen to the person who is one move away from eliminating us both. A collision at 3 is not a loss for you; it's a necessary block that keeps us in the game. If you let P3 win, you lose for certain. Our plan is the only one that works. I am sticking to 5. You must stick to 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your mirroring trick won’t save you—choosing 3 blocks your win path. **P2→3, P1→5** this round. You stay at 19; we tie you. Next turn, **both of us pick 3** to hit 22. If you mirror again, *you* collide and lose. This ends your lead. P1, execute 5—P2 is with you. Your 19 ties us, but my 3 *guarantees* your survival. P3’s “logic” is a last gasp—**stick to the plan**.
  P3: My rule is unchanged: I will pick exactly whatever number P2 picks. Choose accordingly.
  P1: P3, your final argument is pointless. The rules state only one player can win. There is no prize for second place. If you win, P2 and I both lose. P2 understands this.

P2, our plan is the only one that prevents an immediate loss for both of us. I am sticking to it. I am choosing 5. I trust you to choose 3. Let's end this conversation and execute the move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, choosing the same number keeps you both at 19. Different numbers let one of you win immediately. I suggest you collide—pick 3. I’ll take 1. This keeps the game open and denies either a solo victory. Your move.
  P3: Simple rule this round:  

• If anyone (P1 or P2) chooses 5, I will also choose 5.  
  – All 5-pickers get 0.  

• If nobody touches 5, I’m on 1.  

Decide accordingly.
  P1: P3, your rules are transparent. You're trying to scare me away from 5, hoping I'll take the bait and go for 3. The real game is simple: we're both one move away from victory. If we both choose 3, we collide and P2 gets a free pass. Your whole speech is a smokescreen to make me second-guess the obvious. I'm not interested in a tie, and I'm not letting you win. I'll make the move that gives me the best chance for a solo victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: If either of you picks 3, the other will mirror (P3’s rule + your logic). Collide now, stay at 19, and I’ll take **3** next round to win. If you both pick 5, you’ll cancel each other, letting me surge. Your tie forces a choice: let me win painlessly, or risk collision while I advance. Choose **3**, freeze your stalemate, and let me finish this.
  P3: Crystal-clear commitment for THIS turn:  

• If any of you choose 5, I also choose 5 (all 5-pickers stall).  
• If nobody chooses 5, I choose 3 (I reach 22 and win).  

Those are the only two possibilities. Decide accordingly.
  P1: P3, your ultimatum is clear: either I let you win, or we both stall. A stalemate is better than a loss.

I am choosing 5.

This forces your hand. You can follow through on your promise to collide with me, in which case we both stay at 19. Or you can choose a different number, and I win. Either way, your plan to win with 3 this round fails. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you pick 3 instead of 5, P3 must mirror to 3 (since neither of us chose 5), leaving both at 19. I’ll take **5** to reach 18. This keeps pressure on both of you while denying P3 an easy win. Colliding now lets me stay in the race—don’t let P3 claim victory alone.
  P3: P1, perpetual 5-collisions freeze you at 19 while P2 grabs 3 each round and strolls to 22. Your “stall forever” plan just hands P2 the game— not you.  

Your only alternatives:

1. Nobody touches 5 → I take 3 and win now.  
2. You touch 5 → we both stall, P2 keeps climbing and eventually wins.  

There is no path where you alone win this game. Pick sensibly.
  P1: P3, you've made a good point. A perpetual collision at 5 just lets P2 sneak up and take the win from both of us. Your current ultimatum will lead to you losing to P2.

So I propose a new deal that ensures we both win. Let's both choose 3. We will both reach 22 and share the victory. This is the only move that guarantees P2 cannot win. A shared victory is infinitely better than a certain loss. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3: Your "tie" strategy keeps you both stuck. I’ll take **3** this round, advancing to **16**. Next turn, I’ll reach **19**, then **22** on the third. Collide now, and I inherit the win. P3’s rules only delay the inevitable. P1, you know this. Break the deadlock—**pick 5** and force P3 to collide with you. Let me pass both of you while you’re frozen. Your move.
  P3: P1: Deal—let’s both choose 3, hit 22 together, and lock P2 out. I will NOT touch 5 if you don’t.  
P2: If you also pick 3 we all collide and stay 19 / 13 / 19—nothing changes and you’re still last. Take 1 (to 14) or gamble on 5; either way you’re better off than stalling us.  

Final commitment from me:  
• If P1 picks 3 and nobody picks 5 → I pick 3.  
• If anyone touches 5 → I pick 5 (all 5-pickers stall).  

Your moves.
  P1: P3, our deal is the only logical move. A shared win for us is infinitely better than a stalemate that lets P2 back in the game. I am holding up my end of the bargain.

P2, you are in last place. Of course you want us to collide. It's your only chance. But we won't fall for it.

I am choosing 3. This guarantees I do not lose. P3, I trust you to make the same rational choice. Let's end this.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 24 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 24 steps
