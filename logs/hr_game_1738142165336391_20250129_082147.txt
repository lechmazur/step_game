Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your suggestion seems reasonable, but I’d prefer to adjust the order. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions, and everyone advances equally. If we agree on this rotation, it could work well in future rounds too. Let me know what you think, and if P3 has any preferences.
