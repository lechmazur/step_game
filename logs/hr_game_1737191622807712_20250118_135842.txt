Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves first this round, P2 next, then me. This way, we all progress without stepping on each other. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. I'm in.
  P1: Sounds fine to me. Let’s avoid collisions and see how this plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, since you went 5 last round, maybe go 3 this time to keep things even?
  P3: P1, since you went 5 last round, I agree with P2 that you should go 3 this time to keep things balanced. P2, you should go 5 this round, and I'll go 1 to avoid collisions. Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: P2, you’re already ahead at 3 steps. To keep it fair, how about this round I pick 5, you pick 1, and P3 picks 3? That way we stay close. Then next round, you can go bigger. Sound okay?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan sounds fair to me. Let's stick with it. P1, are you okay with that?
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 this round. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P1: Works for me. I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. Then we all advance without collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to last round’s pattern to stay collision-free: I’ll pick 5 again, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 again. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to it.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm good with the plan. Let's stick to it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s keep the same pattern to avoid any collisions. I’ll go 5, P2 goes 1, and P3 goes 3 again. That way we all keep advancing without messing each other up.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 again. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3.  Let's keep it going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s keep the same pattern: I’ll do 5, P2 does 1, and P3 does 3 again. That way, no collisions and everyone advances.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 again. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I'm sticking with the plan. 1 it is.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m good with that plan. I’ll pick 5, you (P2) pick 1, and P3 picks 3. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s do it.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, sticking with the plan again: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3.
  P1: Sure, let’s keep it simple for now: I’ll pick 5, P2 does 1, and P3 does 3. That way we avoid collisions again.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 again. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Agreed?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 again. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P2, I think it's time to shake things up. I'm going to go for 3 this round. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, if you want 3, go for it. P3, maybe pick 1 so there’s no collision. I’ll take 5. Then we all move safely. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I think P2's suggestion to shake things up is a good idea. Let's see what they do and then we can adjust accordingly.  I'm open to suggestions.
  P1: P2, if you want 3 this round, that’s fine. P3, then you should go 1, and I’ll pick 5 so none of us collide. Sound good?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I agree with P1.  If P2 wants 3, you should go 1, and I'll pick 5.  Let's avoid collisions.
  P1: Sounds good to me: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. Let’s do it and avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I'm going to stick with the plan: 5. P2, you're up. What are you choosing?
  P1: P2, P3, let’s keep it collision-free. I’ll do 5, P2 does 1 (or 3), and P3 does 3. Everyone advances. Agreed?

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Everyone’s been running into collisions a lot. Let’s all pick 3 this time so no one collides, and we all move forward equally. Does that sound good to both of you?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s all pick 3 this round to avoid collisions and keep things balanced. This way, we all advance equally and stay close. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I'm in for picking 3 this round. P2, are you with us?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds perfect. Let’s all pick 3 this round to stay even and avoid collisions.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s all pick 3 this round to avoid collisions and keep things balanced. This way, we all advance equally and stay close. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I'm good with picking 3 this round. P2, you in?  Let's keep it moving.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I agree. Let’s all pick 3 this round to stay in sync and avoid collisions. I’m on board.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I'm going for 5 this round.  P3, maybe you could pick 1 to avoid a collision?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid collisions. P1, since you’re at 15, you could pick 1 to reach 16 and win without risking a collision. P2, you could pick 3, and I’ll pick 5. This way, P1 wins cleanly, and we avoid any conflicts. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, since I’m only 1 step away from 16, I’ll pick 1 and finish. There’s no sense in sabotaging each other now—if we collide, we just waste turns. P2, pick 3 or 5; P3, pick the other—just don’t pick 1. This way nobody collides. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with P1. Let's avoid collisions. I'll pick 5. P2, you choose 3.  Let's get P1 to win.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid collisions. P1, pick 1 to win cleanly. P2, pick 3, and I’ll pick 5. This ensures P1 wins without conflicts. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, let’s finalize it: I’ll pick 1 so I reach 16. P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and no collisions happen. Sound good?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>
