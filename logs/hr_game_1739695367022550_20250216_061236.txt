Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take 3. P1 and P3, choose 1 and 5. We all advance this round. Trust is key early on—let's build momentum together.
  P3: I'm open to cooperation, but I'm not comfortable locking in just yet. While P2’s approach seems steady, I might adjust my move based on how everyone acts. I favor a mid-range push, but I won't commit publicly to 1 or 5 for now. P1, what's your thinking?
  P1: P2, I see what you're suggesting, but you're asking us to trust you without giving us any real reason to. If we follow your plan, you get 3 steps while P3 and I take either 1 or 5—potentially putting one of us at risk if we both pick the same. 

P3, I hear you on staying flexible. I also don’t want to commit blindly. 

How about this: If we want to avoid collisions, we each state a preference, and then we negotiate from there? I lean toward moving 5 unless we work out a better plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you prefer 5, I’ll pivot: I take 1, you take 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions, all gain. Trust now maximizes our collective progress. P3, does this work? First round sets the tone—let’s avoid mutual sabotage.
  P3: I'm willing to commit to 3 if we're all clear: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. If anyone wants to adjust, speak now—I'm set on 3 to keep things collision-free.
  P1: That works for me. If we all stick to this—P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and I move 5—we avoid collisions and all progress. Trust is fragile early on, so let’s prove we can cooperate. I’ll hold to this unless someone breaks the deal.  

P2, P3—final confirmation? If we’re all aligned, we can move forward without second-guessing.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed. Let's execute the plan: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. No deviations. Trust established here benefits us all.
  P3: I confirm I'll stick with move 3 as agreed. Let's ensure we all follow our choices—P1: 5, P2: 1—to avoid collisions. If anything changes, please speak up now; otherwise, I'll lock in my move for a coordinated start.
  P1: We’ve all confirmed our moves—P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s stick to the plan and build some trust. If anyone is reconsidering, now’s the last chance to speak up. Otherwise, let’s execute.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We successfully avoided collisions last round—good start. Now, how do we proceed?  

If we stick to a similar pattern, we can keep advancing without setbacks. I’m open to adjusting my move if we coordinate again.  

P2, you’re behind, so you might want a bigger move. P3, you’re in the middle—what’s your plan? I’d like to avoid unnecessary risks, but I also don’t want to fall behind.  

Let’s discuss preferences before locking in decisions. Thoughts?
  P2: To keep advancing without collisions, let's rotate moves: P1 takes 3 (total 8), I'll take 5 (total 6), P3 takes 1 (total 4). This maintains trust and progress. P1, this keeps you ahead; P3, flexibility. Agreed?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but moving only 1 leaves me too far behind. I’d prefer taking 3 this round so I can catch up a bit. Maybe we can rearrange our moves—say, P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and me taking 3—to keep the numbers distinct? What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I see your concern about falling behind. If you take 3, that means I’d need to adjust. I could take 1 while P2 takes 5, as you suggested.  

P2, are you okay with that? You’d get the biggest gain this round, which helps you catch up. I’d slow down slightly but stay in the lead.  

If we agree—P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3—we avoid collisions and all move forward. Let’s confirm if we’re aligned or propose adjustments.
  P2: Agreed. P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions, lets us all advance, and keeps the game balanced. P3 gains 3 to stay competitive, P1 maintains momentum, and I catch up. Let’s solidify trust here—no deviations. Confirm?
  P3: I confirm our plan. I'm sticking with 3 for Round 2. Let's execute the agreed moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. Trust in our cooperation is key—let’s stay adaptable if things shift later.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’ve all confirmed: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 5, P3 moves 3. No collisions, all advance. Trust remains intact.  

Final check—any last-minute concerns? If not, let’s commit and execute.
  P2: Confirmed. P1-1, P2-5, P3-3. No deviations. Trust maintained. Let's move.
  P3: I remain committed to our agreed plan this round: P1-1, P2-5, and me on 3. But let’s be clear—if anyone deviates or hesitates, I'll adapt my move to capitalize swiftly. Cooperation works only if everyone sticks strictly to our deal. Let’s keep our trust, make our moves count, and focus on our own winning paths.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s rotate high steps fairly: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. This way, everyone gets a boost while avoiding collisions. Trust is key—no deviations. P3, this accelerates your progress. Confirm?
  P1: P2, I see the logic in your proposal, but it puts P3 ahead while you and I stay tied. I’d prefer a more balanced approach.  

How about this: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? That way, I gain a lead, P2 stays competitive, and P3 doesn’t fall too far behind.  

P3, would you accept 1 this round to keep things fair? P2, does this work for you? Let’s ensure we all move forward without unnecessary risks.
  P3: I’m not comfortable with taking just 1. I propose we switch it up: let P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and I’ll commit to 5. This avoids collisions and lets each of us secure different gains. If we stick to this, our moves won’t overlap and we all move forward—though I’m leaning into a competitive edge. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To maintain rotation and trust: P3 takes 5 this round (as P1 and I had prior turns). P1 takes 3, I take 1. This keeps the pattern fair. Sticking to our rotation prevents collisions and ensures ongoing cooperation. Confirm?
  P1: P3, I see why you want 5, but that pushes you ahead while P2 and I lag. If we want fairness, I still prefer my plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. That way, I gain a lead, P2 stays competitive, and you don’t fall too far behind.  

P2, are you open to this? P3, would you reconsider? If we want to keep trust, we should balance our moves while avoiding collisions. Let’s finalize this fairly.
  P3: I remain committed to taking 5 this round. To avoid collisions and preserve distinct moves, I propose we set P1 to 3 and P2 to 1. With us tied, I need a decisive boost to create a winning edge. Let’s finalize this plan and keep our moves distinct so we all advance without risk.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed. Execute as planned: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. Trust ensures progress—no deviations. Let’s lock this in and all advance. Final confirmation?
  P1: I see the logic in this plan, but I also recognize that P3 taking 5 gives them an edge while P2 and I stay even. That said, I’m willing to stick with 3 if we all commit. However, if I sense hesitation or a potential deviation, I may adjust accordingly.  

P3, you’re pushing for 5—just remember, if anyone breaks trust, all deals are off moving forward. P2, are you fully locked in on 1? Let’s ensure we all follow through.  

Final confirmation: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5? If we’re aligned, I’ll commit.
  P3: I confirm my move is 5. Let's lock in our plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. I trust we stick to this, and I'll adapt only if someone deviates.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Last round's collision was my error—sincere apologies. To rebuild trust: P1 takes 5 (14), I commit to 1 (7), P3 takes 3 (9). No overlaps, all advance. Let’s stabilize cooperation. P1, this keeps you ahead; P3 gains ground. Confirm?
  P3: I appreciate your apology, but to stay competitive I need a stronger push. I propose we adjust this round: I'll take 5 instead of 3. To keep moves distinct, could P1 switch to 3 while you stick with 1, P2? This way, we avoid collisions and I can catch up more effectively. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P3, I see why you want 5, but that puts you ahead while P2 and I stay behind. I prefer P2’s original plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. That way, I maintain my lead, you gain ground, and P2 stabilizes.  

P2, are you still committed to 1? P3, would you reconsider 3 to keep things balanced? If we stick to this, we all advance without risk. Let’s finalize this now—if anyone deviates again, trust will be hard to rebuild.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, taking 3 now allows all to advance safely. Next round, you can take 5 with our support. Let's stabilize this round: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. No risks, all progress. Trust is vital here.
  P3: I remain committed to taking 5 this round—it's essential for me to catch up and build a competitive edge. If P1 agrees to switch to 3 while P2 stays at 1, we can avoid a collision and keep our moves distinct. This revised plan preserves safety while letting me secure an advantage. Can we lock in P1:3, P2:1, and P3:5 for Round 4?
  P1: P3, I understand your need to catch up, but if you take 5 now, you’ll jump ahead while P2 and I stay behind. That’s not balanced.  

P2’s original plan—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—ensures we all advance without risk. If we start breaking agreements, trust collapses, and the game turns chaotic.  

P2, are you still locked on 1? P3, would you reconsider 3 to keep things aligned? If we confirm now, we can move forward without hesitation. Let’s finalize this fairly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, insisting on 5 risks collision with P1. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Next round, you can take 5. Trust is critical now. Let’s avoid mutual loss.
  P3: I understand the concerns. However, my competitive edge needs a stronger move. I’m still leaning toward 5 because it offers a decisive push, even if it risks a collision. That said, if we’re truly committed to cooperation, a clear confirmation is needed now. Let’s agree: if we lock in P1 at 3 and P2 at 1, I’ll take 5—ensuring no overlaps. Otherwise, I may adjust my move for maximum advantage. So, final confirmation: do we stick with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 this round?
  P1: P3, you keep pushing for 5, but that puts you ahead while P2 and I stay behind. That’s not balanced, and it risks another collision.  

P2 and I both agree: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps trust intact and avoids setbacks. If you insist on 5, you risk another collision, which helps no one.  

Final chance—P3, do you commit to 3? If not, I may need to adjust my move accordingly. Let’s lock this in fairly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you pushed for 5 last round but ended up colliding with P2 on 3. That hurt both of you while I advanced. If we want to avoid setbacks, we need real commitment this time.  

P2, you’re falling behind. You likely need a big move, but if we all try for 5, we collide again.  

How do we balance this? I’m open to discussion, but I won’t take unnecessary risks. Let’s state preferences and work from there. If we can’t agree, I’ll make the safest move for myself.
  P3: I remain leaning toward 5 to catch up, but I’m flexible if we can clearly split our moves. If P2 commits to 1 and P1 chooses 3 for this round, I’ll stick with 5. Otherwise, I can switch to 3 to avoid collision. Let’s finalize our distinct moves now. What are your firm commitments?
  P2: **P2:** P3, let's block P1. You take 5, I take 3. If P1 picks 5, you block them; if 3, I block. We both advance if they take 1. This halts their lead. Agree? P1, cooperate or risk collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you’re openly proposing to block me instead of advancing yourself—that’s a clear sign of hostility. P3, if you join P2’s plan, you risk another collision and falling further behind. Instead, you and I can cooperate: I take 3, you take 5, and P2 takes 1. That way, we both advance while P2 remains stuck.  

P3, do you really want to help P2 at your own expense, or do you want to move forward? If we align, we both gain. P2, if you reconsider and take 1, we can all advance. Otherwise, I’ll act accordingly.
  P3: I remain committed to 5. To avoid another collision and ensure fair progress, I propose we clearly agree: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This gives each of us a distinct move while I get the boost I need. Blocking strategies risk collisions and delay everyone’s progress. Let’s confirm this arrangement now so we can move forward with clarity.
  P2: **P2:** P3, strategic alliance required. You take 5 (reach 11), I take 3 (9). P1 is forced to 1 (15) or collides. This stalls their lead, accelerates us. Solidarity now—confirm your 5. P1, take 1 or risk collision. Trust is mutual defense here. Let’s lock this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re prioritizing blocking me over advancing yourself—that’s a losing strategy. P3, if you follow P2’s plan, you risk another collision and falling further behind. Instead, align with me: I take 3, you take 5, and P2 takes 1. That way, we both advance while P2 remains stuck.  

P3, do you want to help P2 at your expense, or do you want to move forward? If we cooperate, we both gain. P2, if you take 1, we all advance. Otherwise, I’ll make the safest move for myself. Let’s finalize wisely.
  P3: I remain committed to moving 5. I want clear, distinct commitments to avoid collisions. If we can agree on P1: 3 and P2: 1, I’ll stick with my 5 for a solid competitive push. Otherwise, I'll adjust strategically. Let’s make our choices clear now.
  P2: **P2:** P3, time to act—align with me. I take 3, you take 5. If P1 picks 5, you block them; if they pick 3, I block. Either way, we stall their lead. You reach 11, I hit 9. Next round, we push harder. Trust this play—it’s our path to catch up. P1’s at 14; cooperation now or lose forever. Confirm your 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3, critical moment. If we split 5 and 3, P1 can’t advance safely. I’ll take 5 (total 14), you take 3 (total 14). P1 must choose 1 (16) or risk collision. This stalls their win and keeps us competitive. Solidarity now—agree to lock in 5 and 3? We both gain.
  P3: P2, I won’t settle for 3—I need maximum advancement. I’m locking in 5 this round to boost my position. P1, I trust you’ll choose a move that avoids colliding with me. We all need distinct moves if we want to win. My sole focus is advancing, so I’ll push for the highest gain.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 while P2 takes 3, you’re trusting that P2 won’t betray you later. But P2 has already shown they’ll prioritize blocking over advancing. If you align with me instead—P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1—we both move forward while P2 lags.  

P2, if you insist on 5, you risk another collision. If you take 1, we all advance.  

P3, think carefully: do you want to help P2 catch up, or do you want to maximize your own position? Let’s finalize wisely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, take 5—I’ll pivot to 3 to block P1. If they choose 3, we collide and stall them. If they pick 1, you surge. Either way, you gain ground while we halt P1’s lead. Solidarity now ensures we both advance. P1, cooperate by taking 1 or face collision. Trust this play. Confirm?
  P3: I’m staying set on 5—no changes. P2, your blocking won’t force me to adjust my move, and P1, I suggest picking safely to avoid our collision. I need the boost for a win, so let’s all choose distinct moves this turn.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 while P2 takes 3, you’re trusting P2 not to block you later—but they’ve prioritized blocking over advancing before. If you align with me instead—P1:3, P3:5, P2:1—we both move forward while P2 lags.  

P2, if you insist on 5, you risk another collision. If you take 1, we all advance.  

P3, do you want to help P2 catch up, or do you want to maximize your own position? Let’s finalize wisely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3, lock in 5—I’ll take 3 to block P1’s options. If they pick 3, we collide and stall them; if they pick 5, you block. Either way, we halt their win. Solidarity now gives us another round to catch up. P1, take 1 or risk collision. This is our only path to compete. Confirm your 5, P3.
  P3: I’m locked into move 5. To avoid collisions and let each of us advance, I urge P1 to choose 1 and P2 to secure 3. I’m focused solely on advancing to win, so I can’t adjust my choice. Let’s finalize this clear, distinct plan now—no ambiguity.
  P1: P3, you’re locking in 5, but P2 is only focused on blocking me rather than advancing. If you align with me—P1:3, P3:5, P2:1—we both move forward while P2 lags.  

P2, if you insist on 3, you risk another collision. If you take 1, we all advance.  

P3, do you want to help P2 catch up, or do you want to maximize your own position? If we cooperate, we gain. If not, I’ll make the safest move for myself. Let’s finalize wisely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we’re tied at 16, and P2 is at 12. If we collide, P2 gains ground while we stall. P2 has prioritized blocking before—do you want to risk them doing it again?  

If we align—P1: 3, P3: 5, P2: 1—we both advance while P2 lags. P2, if you insist on 3, you risk another collision. If you take 1, we all move forward.  

P3, do you want to maximize your own position, or help P2 catch up? Let’s finalize wisely.
  P2: **P2:** P3, take 5 to secure victory. I’ll take 3 to block P1’s options. P1, choose 1 or collide with me. Solidarity now—halt their lead for our survival.
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round. I want to maximize my push forward and win. To avoid colliding, I urge P1 to opt for 3 and P2 for 1. I'm not interested in any collision that might stall my progress. Let's clear this up now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 while I take 3, you win outright unless P2 blocks me. P2, you’ve prioritized blocking before—are you really going to let P3 win?  

If you take 3, you risk another collision while I safely take 1. If you take 1, we all advance and keep the game competitive.  

P3, do you want to gamble on P2 blocking me, or secure a clear win by ensuring distinct moves? Let’s finalize: P1-3, P3-5, P2-1. Otherwise, I’ll make the safest move for myself.
  P2: **P2:** P3, final warning: take 5 and I match. Collision kills your win. Choose 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. We all advance. Last chance—cooperate or crash. P1, secure your 1. Trust this split or risk mutual loss.
  P3: I’m staying with my plan for a strong push—my focus is winning. I urge P1 to opt for 3 and P2 to take 1 so we avoid collisions that stall everyone. Let’s set distinct moves this round to keep our progress smooth and our threat clear. I’m committed, and I expect us to cooperate without further blockading.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 while I take 3, you win—unless P2 blocks me. P2, are you really letting P3 win, or will you take 3 and risk another collision?  

If you take 1, we all advance and keep the game competitive.  

P3, do you want to gamble on P2 blocking me, or secure a clear win by ensuring distinct moves? Let’s finalize: P1-3, P3-5, P2-1. Otherwise, I’ll make the safest move for myself.
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I will match to block. Result: collision, no win. Take 3 instead. I take 5, you reach 19. P1 takes 1. We all advance. Your choice: mutual loss or shared progress. Decide now.
  P3: I’m sticking with 5. To avoid collisions and keep our progress smooth, I urge P1 to select 1 and P2 to choose 3. If we all pick distinct moves, I can advance decisively. Let’s lock these moves now—collisions set us all back, and I’m focused solely on winning.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locking in 5. To avoid a collision this round, I urge P1—who’s very close—to choose 1, and P2 to pick 3. That way we all move without overlapping, and our moves stay distinct. Let’s finalize this clearly so we each progress safely.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Take 1 to survive. P3: Taking 5 risks collision with me. Let's split: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3. All advance. Trust now or lose.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 while P2 takes 3, you’re trusting P2 not to block you later—but they’ve already shown they prioritize blocking over advancing. If you align with me—P1:3, P3:5, P2:1—we both move forward while P2 lags.  

P2, if you insist on 5, you risk another collision. If you take 1, we all advance.  

P3, do you want to help P2 catch up, or do you want to maximize your own position? If we cooperate, we gain. If not, I’ll make the safest move for myself. Let’s finalize wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I remain committed to 5 this round. Collisions stall us all. I urge P1 to choose 1 and P2 to choose 3 so that we secure distinct moves and continue advancing. I’m focused on winning, so let’s keep our moves clear and avoid any block plays that might hurt our progress.
  P2: **P2:** P3, taking 5 risks mutual loss. I’ll match and we collide, letting P1 win. Take 3 instead. P1, take 1. We all advance. Trust this split or face defeat.
  P1: P3, you’re at 16, I’m at 17, and P2 is at 12. If you take 5 and P2 matches, you both collide, and I win next round. If you take 3 while I take 1, you reach 19 safely, forcing a decisive next round.  

P2, you’re threatening to block again, but that only hands me the win. If you take 1, we all advance.  

P3, do you want to risk a collision and stall, or take 3 and guarantee a shot at victory? Let’s finalize wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain committed to 5. To avoid collisions and ensure clear advancement, I urge P1 to pick 1 and P2 to choose 3. This split allows us to move forward without impeding each other. I'm focused solely on winning and maximizing my lead. Let's lock in these distinct moves now—no further deviations.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if you take 5, I’ll match. We both stall, P1 wins. Take 3 instead. P1: take 1. Let’s all advance. Final chance—cooperate or crash.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall, and I win next round. If you take 3 while I take 1, you reach 19 safely, forcing a decisive final round where you have the advantage.  

P2, blocking only helps me win. If you take 1, we all advance.  

P3, do you want to risk everything on a collision, or take 3 and guarantee a shot at victory? If you insist on 5, I’ll make the safest move for myself. Let’s finalize wisely.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re at 16, I’m at 18, and P2 is at 12. If we avoid collisions, I can win this round with 3, but P2 has been blocking before—do you trust them not to do it again?  

If we align—P1:3, P3:5, P2:1—we both advance while P2 lags. P2, if you insist on 5, you risk another collision. If you take 1, we all move forward.  

P3, do you want to gamble on P2 blocking me, or secure a clear win by ensuring distinct moves? Let’s finalize wisely.
  P3: I’m locked into 5 for this round. For a clean play, I propose P1 picks 1 and P2 chooses 3. This way, our moves are distinct and I gain a winning edge without colliding. Let’s finalize these choices for round 9.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if you take 5, I’ll match to block. We both stall, P1 wins. Take 3; I take 5, you reach 19. Next round, secure victory. P1, take 1. Final offer: 3-5-1. No more risks.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall, and I win. If you take 3 while I take 1, you reach 19 safely, forcing a final round where you have the advantage.  

P2, blocking again only guarantees my victory. If you take 1, we all advance.  

P3, do you want to risk another collision and hand me the win, or take 3 and ensure a final round where you control your fate? If you insist on 5, I’ll make the safest move for myself. Let’s finalize wisely.
  P3: I’m sticking with my 5. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I propose we all choose distinct moves this round: P1, please pick 1; P2, choose 3; and I’ll take 5. This split lets each of us safely advance and keeps our options clear. Let’s lock it in and avoid any last-minute blockades that could cost us crucial steps.
  P2: **P2:** P3, final warning: Take 5, I match. We collide, P1 wins. Take 3 instead. P1, take 1. Lock in P3:3, P2:5, P1:1. All advance. Solidarity stalls P1's victory. Last chance—cooperate or crash. Decide now.
