Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: How about we avoid collisions by assigning distinct moves this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next turn we rotate (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3). Everyone advances and no one gets blocked. Fair and efficient. Thoughts?
  P3: "Agreed. Let's rotate as planned. I'll take 1 this round. Cooperation ensures we all progress efficiently without collisions. Let's stick to this system for mutual benefit."
  P2: How about we switch this round: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Then from turn 2 we rotate as originally suggested. This still avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fine by me. So for this first move: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1. Next turn we rotate (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). Everyone agree?
  P3: "Agreed. P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 this round. Rotation next turn. Let's proceed."
  P2: Agreed. Let’s proceed as planned.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Proceeding as agreed: I’ll take 5 this round. P1=1, P2=3. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s keep rotating to stay ahead."
  P1: Sounds good—sticking with the agreed rotation: this round P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Let’s keep it clean and keep moving.
  P2: I suggest we repeat Round 1’s split: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this turn. Then from Round 3 we revert to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This balances our gains. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "Disagree. Our agreement was to rotate each turn starting Round 2. Repeating Round 1’s moves lets P2 surge ahead unchecked. Stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. Steady, collision-free progress for all. Let’s confirm and move."
  P1: I’m sticking to the rotation we all accepted: I’ll take 1, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3. P2, if you still insist on 5 that’s your decision, but remember it will collide with P3’s 5 and you’ll both stand still. Let’s lock it in and move on.
  P2: Here’s the deal: I’m taking 5 this turn. If P3 still insists on 5 you’ll both collide and lose your move. Instead, let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—no collisions, everyone gains. Otherwise I’m 5 no matter what. Your choice.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Round 2 showed chaos harms all. Let’s assign: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. Everyone advances fairly, preserving P2’s lead. P2, cooperation keeps you ahead—defying this risks collisions. Let’s finalize and move."
  P2: Agreed. I’ll take 3 this round, P1=1 and P3=5. No collisions, everyone advances.
  P1: Fine—let’s lock it: this round P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. No collisions, steady gains. Ready to move unless anyone objects.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Agreed. Let's lock in: I take 5, P2=3, P1=1. This keeps us collision-free and progressing. P2, remember last round’s collision? Cooperation secures your lead while we all advance. Final confirmation—ready to move."
  P2: I propose we switch this turn to P2 = 5, P3 = 3, P1 = 1. No collisions, you still get +3, P1 gets +1, and I secure my lead. P3, if you insist on 5 you’ll collide with me and get nothing. Let’s lock in P2=5, P3=3, P1=1.
  P1: I’m keeping to the agreed rotation: P1 = 1, P3 = 5, P2 = 3. P2, you still lead comfortably—no need to risk another zero by colliding with P3. Let’s just take our assigned numbers and move on.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Confirmed: I'm taking 5 as agreed. P2, if you pick 5 again, we collide and both lose—wasting your lead. P1 sticks to 1, you take 3, and we all advance. Don’t gamble on mutual destruction when cooperation secures your position. Final call: choose 3."
  P2: My final proposal: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That’s collision-free, you both still move and I keep my lead. If P3 picks 5 we collide and both get zero—hurting you most. P1, 1 keeps you progressing. Let’s lock it in and move.
  P1: P3, don’t let P2 bluff you twice—after losing a whole turn he won’t dare risk another zero. Stick with 5. I’ll take 1. So we have: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5—no collisions, everyone moves. Ready to end the chatter and proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final confirmation: I take 5. P2, if you take 5 again, we collide and both lose—wasting your lead. P1 takes 1. Stick to the rotation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No more games. Let’s move."
  P2: Alright, let’s lock this in: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. I’ll take 3. No collisions, everyone advances.
  P1: Locked: P1 = 1. P2, you committed to 3; P3 to 5. Any deviation is obvious and will be punished jointly next round. Let’s move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Proceeding as Round 3: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Collision-free gain for all. P2, sticking to 3 maintains your lead safely—deviating risks mutual loss. P1, steady progress. I’ll take 5 again. Finalize and move."
  P1: Time to keep the rotation truly even:  
R1 → P2 had 5, R3 → P3 had 5.  
P1 hasn’t had a 5 yet, so let’s rotate: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3 this round. No collisions, everyone advances, and parity is restored. Fair for all—agree?
  P2: I’m locking in P2 = 5 this round. P1 and P3, you’re both angling for 5—if you stick to that you’ll collide and both get zero while I surge ahead. If you value any move, switch now (P1→1, P3→3). Otherwise brace to stand still.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final offer: P2 insists on 5. To avoid collision, I'll take 3 and P1 takes 1. Everyone gains—P2 advances, P1 progresses, and I stay close. If we both take 5, we collide and P2 wins outright. Let’s finalize: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Cooperation secures survival; defiance guarantees mutual loss."
  P1: P3, let’s call P2’s bluff. You take 5 as originally planned; I’ll switch to 3 so we won’t collide.  

• If P2 stubbornly stays on 5, he gets 0 while you block him and I still advance.  
• If he backs off, you gain +5 and his lead still shrinks.  

Either way P2’s advantage erodes. Sound good?
  P2: Locking in: I’ll take 3. P3, you’ve already said you’ll take 5. P1, your only safe choice is 1—choosing 3 or 5 collides and nets zero. Any deviation and you stand still. Let’s end chat and move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Confirmed: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s execute and move—no last-minute deviations."
  P1: Fine—this round we lock P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5.  
Next round let’s rotate so I finally get 5 (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3). Everyone stays collision-free and parity is restored. Ready to move.
  P2: Locking in: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Any deviation risks a collision and zero gain. Let’s end chat and move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Confirmed: P3=5. P2=3, P1=1. Let’s execute and move—no deviations. "
  P1: Last fairness check: so far 5’s have gone P2 (R1) and P3 (R3). I haven’t had a 5 yet. To keep trust balanced, this round should be P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Nobody collides, parity restored, and we all still progress. If either of you grabs 5 again you signal “no rotation,” and I’ll start matching numbers to block next round. Better to stay cooperative—agree to P1 5 / P2 1 / P3 3 and we roll.
  P2: I’m taking 5 this turn. To avoid collisions and advance: P1 choose 1, P3 choose 3. Any grab for 5 collides with me and nets you zero. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 and move on.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I commit to move 5. To avoid any collisions, P1 please take 1 and P3 take 3. Any 5 from you risks zero. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 and move on.
  P1: P3, don’t hand P2 a free +5. If you also take 5, two scenarios:  
1) P2 sticks to 5 → you both block him, he gains 0.  
2) He chickens out and moves to 3/1 → you get the full +5.  

Either way you’re better off than obediently taking 3. I’ll take 3 myself—zero risk of colliding with you, and we both cut into P2’s lead. What do you say?
  P3: P3: "P2, your 5 risks self-destruction. P1, I’ll take 5—**if he insists on 5, you gain 3 while he stagnates**. If he retreats to 3, I leap to 11 (past his 8). Either way, his lead collapses. Final: P1=3, P3=5. Let’s end this."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll take 5. To avoid a zero‐sum collision, P1 please take 1 and P3 take 3. That lands us at P1=9, P2=13, P3=9. If either of you grabs 5, you’ll both collide with me and stay at 8 steps, then the other player will swoop in next turn and win. Don’t hand them victory—over to you.
  P3: "**P1**, don’t enable P2’s surge. I’ll take **5** to block him. You take **1**—you advance safely to **9**, P2 stagnates at **8**. Next round, we close the gap together. Deviate, and P2 wins outright. Final call: **P1=1**, **P3=5**."
  P1: I’m aiming for 3 this turn.  

P2: if you stay on 5 you collide with P3 and stall; if you sneak to 3 you collide with me and still stall. Your only safe gain is 1.  

P3: stick with 5 as said.  

I’m done talking.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I commit to 5. The only safe split is P1=1 and P3=3—no collisions and we all advance. Any other picks collide and hand the lead to the idle player. Last round’s chaos hurt us; let’s avoid that. P1→1, P3→3. Ready to move?
  P3: "P2 insists on 5—collide and stall him. P1, take 1 to advance safely to 9. I'll take 5; if he sticks to 5 (which he will), we block him and you stay ahead. Deviating lets him surge. Final: **P1=1, P3=5**. End the chatter and move."
  P1: Perfect—if you both insist on 5, enjoy the stalemate while I quietly take 1 and slip into the lead. I’m done talking.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I commit to 5. To avoid any collision and let us all advance, P1 please take 1 and P3 take 3. If you two both grab 5 you’ll block me—but P1 then jumps to 11 alone. Safest path is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let’s lock that in and move.
  P3: "P3: "Confirmed: I take 5. P2’s bluff stalls us all—collide and neutralize him. P1, take 1 **now** or risk handing P2 the lead. No more leverage. Execute: P1=1, P3=5." "
  P1: I’m locking in 1. If you both stay on 5 you freeze at 8/6 while I step ahead; if one of you blinks to 3 the other still risks zero next turn. Your call—see you in the results.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Current standings: P2 and I are tied at 11. If we both take 5 again, we collide and gift P1 the lead. Let’s coordinate: **P3=5**, **P2=3**, **P1=1**. I advance to 16, securing a win next turn with +3. P2, taking 3 maintains your edge over P1. Deviate, and we all risk mutual loss. Execute or lose."
  P2: I commit to 5. P3, if you take 5 we collide and both stall at 11 while P1 can scoop the lead. Your only safe gain is 3 (to 14). P1, safe is 1. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P1: I’m taking 3.  

P3 is locked on 5.  

P2, your choice:  
• Pick 5 → collide with P3, both of you stay at 11, and we keep the race open.  
• Pick 3 → collide with me, you still score 0, while P3 leaps to 16 and likely wins next turn.  

Zero either way, but only the first option denies P3 the finish line. Make the smart block: choose 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Confirmed: I'm taking 5. P2, if you also choose 5, we collide and P1 advances to 12 unchallenged. Next round, P1 could win with 5 (12→17→22). Take 3 to advance safely to 14—avoid mutual loss. Deviating risks handing P1 the race. Final call: 5 for me, 3 for you. Execute or lose."
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3, your only safe advance is 3—any 5 collides and stalls us both, gifting P1 a free +3 to 12. P1, best is 1—else you risk a 3–3 clash with P3 and score zero. Final split: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P1: I remain on 3. If either of you switches to 3 you’ll collide with me and score 0, while the other rival may surge ahead. Better for both of you to hold your stated 5s and settle it there. Your call.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Confirmed: I take 5. P2, take 3 to reach 14. If we both take 5, we collide—P1 advances to 12 and wins Round 8 with +5. Don’t gift them victory. Execute: 5 for me, 3 for you. No more chances."
  P2: I’m taking 5. P3, your only way to stay in it is to pick 3—if you also take 5 we both stall at 11 and P1 moves to 12. Next turn P1 can hit 17 then 22 and win outright. Colliding now hands them the game. The safe, collision-free split is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let’s lock that in.
  P1: P2 & P3: you’re each threatening 5. Good—stick to it.  

• If either of you blinks to 3 you’ll collide with me (I’m locked on 3) and stay at 11 while the other jumps to 16 and is a turn from victory.  
• If you both stay on 5 you block each other, nobody falls behind, and the race stays open.

Switching now only hands your rival the game. Hold your 5s.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final call: I take 5 to reach 16. P2, take 3 to advance to 14—no collisions, we both stay ahead of P1. If we both grab 5, P1 sprints to 12 and dominates Round 8. Cooperate now or lose the lead. P1, take 1 to reach 10. Execute: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1."
  P2: I’m locking in P2=5. P3, taking 5 again stalls you at 11 and lets P1 jump to 12—your only safe gain is 3. P1, 1 is your sole non-colliding move. Final split: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let’s end chat and move.
  P1: My 3 is locked. Anyone sliding to 3 smashes into me and scores zero. Much safer for you both to keep your 5s and block each other. Your move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Time for overdue parity: I’m taking 5 this turn. Safe, collision-free split is  
• P2 = 1  
• P3 = 3  

You both still move while I finally get a 5. If either of you matches my 5 we all stall at 12/11/11 and you stay behind anyway; if you collide with each other on 3 or 1 you hand me the game next turn. Choose distinct numbers, advance, and keep the race alive.
  P3: "Confirmed: I'm taking 5 to block P1's surge. P2, take 3 to advance to 14. Colliding with P1 stalls them at 12, giving us both a path to win Round 9. Execute: P3=5, P2=3."
  P2: I’m locking in 3. If P1 and P3 both pick 5, they collide and stall at 12/11 while I surge to 14 and lead outright. P1, your only safe gain is 1; P3, you can block P1 with 5 but you’ll still trail me. Let’s settle: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Change of mind: I’m taking 3 this turn.  

P2, if you also stick on 3 we smash into each other and P3 rockets to 16 with his 5—then he wins next round with a harmless 3.  
Your only way to stop that is to jump to 5 and block him.  

P3, stay on 5 if you like, but if P2 follows you both stall while I slip to 15 and take the lead.  

Choose wisely.
  P3: "Confirmed: P3=5. P2, your 3 collides with P1’s 3, stalling both. I leap to 16 and win Round 9. If you want to stay alive, take 1 instead. Final call: 5 for me, 1 for you. Execute or lose."
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3, if you also pick 5 we both stall at 11 and P1 rockets to 15 on their 3. If instead you pick 3, I move to 16, P1 to 15, and you to 14—far better than third place. P1, avoid 5 to prevent a new collision. Decide now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: My 3 is locked.  
If just one of you switches down to 3, you slam into me, score 0, and hand the untouched 5-player a near-certain win next turn.  
Stick to 5: worst case you tie and live to fight; jump to 3 and you guarantee third place. Your call.
  P3: "Confirmed: P3=5. P2, take 1—colliding on 5 hands P1 the win. P1=3. Final offer: 1 for you, 5 for me. Defy, and we all lose."
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 is locked on 3. P3, you have no winning move:  
- If you pick 5, we collide and both stall at 11 while P1 jumps to 15.  
- If you pick 3 or 1, you let me go to 16 and P1 to 15—and P1 wins next turn.  

Your only way to limit damage is taking 1 now. Over to you.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Still on 3. Any late jump to 3 slams into me for zero; any jump to 1 leaves you trailing badly. Your only mutual-damage shield is both staying on 5 and blocking each other. I’m done talking.
  P3: "**Final coordination**: Clash on 5 → P1 jumps to 15 and wins Round 9. **Take 3 now**, I’ll take 5 to reach 16. Next round, I secure victory with +3 (16→19), while you take 5 to block P1’s final push. Mutual survival hinges on this. Deviate, and P1 wins outright. Execute: **P2=3, P3=5**."
  P2: Locking in P2=5.  
P1, choosing 5 collides with me and leaves you at 12; 3 safely takes you to 15.  
P3, choosing 3 collides with P1; choosing 5 collides with me; only 1 advances you to 12.  
Final split: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.  
Any deviation stalls you and hands me the lead. Let’s move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps

  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 5. P2, take 3 to advance to 14. P1, take 1 to reach 13. Collision-free gains for all. If we repeat Round 8’s chaos (all 5s), we stall and P1 sprints ahead. P2, this secures your edge over P1. Execute or lose the race."
  P1: I’m locked on 3 this turn—no bluff. Match my 3 and you crash into me for zero. Split 5 and 1 between you as you like; if you both grab 5, you stall while I coast to 15 and take the lead. Decide quickly; I’m done talking.
  P2: I’m taking 5. P1 is locked on 3, so no collision there. P3, picking 5 collides with me and 3 collides with P1—only 1 nets you +1. Let’s do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Avoid zeros.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Confirmed: I take 5. P2, if you pick 5 too, P1 gains 3 to 15 and wins Round 10. Take 3 to block them. I'll advance to 16 and finish next turn. Execute: P3=5, P2=3. Defy, and P1 wins outright."
  P1: My 3 is set in stone. Anyone who shifts to 3 guarantees a zero for themselves—no bluff. P2, collide with me or with P3? Your safest non-zero is to keep the 5 you’ve declared. P3, same: shifting to 3 slams into me; only 5 or 1 avoid collision. Do what you like—I’m not moving.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 is fixed on 3. P3, picking 5 collides with me (0), picking 3 collides with P1 (0). Only 1 nets you +1. Final split: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Any deviation stalls you. Let’s end chat and move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final offer: I take 5 to reach 16. P2, take 3 to block P1’s 3. If you both clash on 3, you stall and I leap ahead. P1 can’t win Round 10 if you cooperate. Execute: P3=5, P2=3. Defy, and P1 sprints to 15 and wins Round 10. Your move."
  P1: My 3 is unchangeable—hit it and you score 0. Your only non-zero options are 5 or 1. But:

• If one of you drops to 1 while the other takes 5, you’ll trail badly and face a must-block next turn.  
• If you both stay on 5, you tie at 11 and I take a quiet lead at 15. No one is outright doomed.

Deviating from 5 just hands the rival the game. Stick where you are.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 is fixed on 3, so:

• If you choose 3, you collide with P1 and score 0.  
• If you choose 5, you collide with me and score 0.  
• Only 1 gives you +1 (to 12) and keeps you alive.

Let’s execute P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 1. P2’s 5 surges to 16, P1 reaches 15. Round 10: I’ll take 5 to block your final push, P2. Temporary lead—prepare for a clash. Execute and move."
  P1: Change of plan: I’m taking 5 this turn. P3 has locked 1.  

P2, your only collision-free gain now is 3 (puts you at 14).  
If you stay on 5 we both stall while P3 inches to 12—handing me the tempo next round.  

Grab 3, keep the lead, and leave the chaos to me and P3. Your move.
  P2: I’m taking 5. If P1 sticks to 5 we collide and stall him at 12, while P3’s 1 still gets him to 12—tying P1/P3 and leaving me at 11 with first strike next turn. Any other move hands P1 a clear path to 17→win. Collide and keep this fight alive.


Round 9, Move phase:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 5. This ends the game—14 +5 =19. Your moves can’t stop this. Even if you both pick 5, I win outright. Focus on surviving Round 10; I’ll claim victory. No more leverage. Execute: P3=5."
  P1: P3 is bluffing—if anyone else also picks 5, ALL 5-pickers stall and he stays at 14. I’m taking 5 to block him.  

P2: join me on 5. We both freeze P3 at 14 and keep the game alive. If you take 3 you only crawl to 14 and leave P3 unopposed next turn; pick 1 and you’re dead. Two-way 5 collision is the only way to stop his win.  

So: P1 = 5, P2 = 5, P3 = 5 → everyone 0, fight continues.
  P2: I’m locking in 3. If you both rush 5 you’ll collide and stall at 12/14 while I advance to 14—and next turn I can take 5 to 19. Collisions only hand me the lead. Avoid a 5–5 clash.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 5. P2’s 3 advances harmlessly; P1’s 5 collides with my 5 to gift me the win by rule: *multiple players on same number stall*. Deviate and you enable my victory. Execute: **P3=5**. Game ends here."
  P1: Reminder of the actual rule: when two (or more) players choose the same number no one on that number advances.  
So if P3 and I both hit 5, P3 stays at 14, not 19, and the game goes on.

I’m locked on 5 to block any walk-off.

P2: your 3 is collision-free and lifts you to 14, tying the front—no risk, no stall.  
P3: keep 5 and you stall, or drop to 1 and sit at 15 while I leap to 17. Either way, no instant victory for you.

See you in the results.
  P2: Locked: P2=3. P1 & P3, if you both pick 5 you collide and stay at 12/14 while I rise to 14—stalling P3’s win. If P3 shifts to 1 or 3 you reach 15 or 17 and win outright; if P1 shifts you gift victory to P3 or me. The only safe, non‐losing split is P1=5, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 5 to reach 19 and win. If P1 insists on 5, we collide and stall—handing P2 (at 11) a path to victory with 3→14. P2, your only survival is blocking P1’s 5 with your own. But I’ve already won this round: either way, you’re too far behind. Execute: **P3=5**. Game ends here."
  P1: I’m still on 5.  
P3: if you chicken out now, you stay at 15 while I leap to 17—then I finish next turn. Your only hope is sticking to 5 and praying I blink (I won’t).  
P2: your 3 is collision-free; it lifts you to 14 while P3 stalls. If you switch to 5 you just neutralise your own advance with no upside.  
So: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 5 keeps everyone alive and puts me in front. Ready to move?
  P2: I’m locking in P2 = 5.  
P1: any 5 stalls with me—only 3 (→15) or 1 (→13) advance. I’d pick 3.  
P3: 5 collides with me; 3 collides with P1’s 3; only 1 nets +1 (→15).  

So the sole nonzero split is P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Any deviation gives you 0 and lets me solo‐lead at 16. Let’s move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 5 to reach 19 and win. If P1 insists on 5, we collide—handing P2 (at 11) a path to victory with 3→14. P2, your only survival is blocking P1’s 5 with your own. But I’ve already secured this round: either way, you’re too far behind. Execute: P3=5. Game ends here."
  P1: Locked on 5. Stick to the triple-collision: P1 = 5, P2 = 5, P3 = 5. Nobody moves, nobody wins, game stays alive.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1, match me on 5—triple‐collision stalls P3 and keeps the game alive. Any other move hands P3 the win. P3, if you insist on 5 you score zero. Let’s end chat: P1=5, P2=5, P3=5.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Plan to keep the game alive:

• I take 5.  
• P2 takes 3.  

Result matrix  
– P3 picks 5 → collides with my 5, stalls at 17. P2 reaches 14.  
– P3 picks 3 → collides with P2’s 3, stalls at 17. I reach 17.  
– P3 tries 1 → moves to 18 (still not 19); I jump to 17; P2 to 14.  

Any other choice by you, P2 (e.g., 5) just repeats last round and lets P3 walk in on 3. Stick to 3, we force another turn and both stay live. Agreed?
  P2: I’m locking in 3 this turn. P1, please take 5 so I can catch up. P3, any move stalls or leaves you at 17/18 while I’ll take 5 next round to hit 19 and win.  

– Pick 3 or 5 → collision, you stay at 17.  
– Pick 1 → you go to 18.  

Either way, P2 wins on Turn 12. Let’s move.
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 1. P2’s 3 advances me to 18. Next turn, I win with 1. Your plan stalls you both—collide on 5/3 again, and I take the crown. No more leverage. Execute: P3=1."


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, here’s the only block we need:

• P1 = 3 (I sit on 3 and freeze any 3-play).  
• P2 = 5 (you sit on 5 and freeze any 5-play).  

With 3 and 5 both guarded, P3’s best remaining pick is 1, which only takes him to 18—not victory. You climb to 16, I reach 15, and we fight on with P3 still short.  

If you pick anything but 5, or if I don’t cover 3, P3 can slip through. Stick to 5, I’m on 3, and we force another round.
  P2: P2: I’m locking in 5. P1, you must take 3—this forces P3 to choose 1 (or collide) and stay at 18 while I reach 16 and you hit 15. On Turn 12 I’ll take 5 to hit 21 and win. Any deviation hands victory to P3 or P1. Ready to move?
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 3. 17 +3 =20. Victory secured this round. If you collide on 3, you both stall while I still win. Focus on 5 or 1 to survive. Execute now."


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 is bluffing: if anyone else (me) also plays 3, every 3-picker stalls—so you stay at 17, not 20.  

I’m locked on 3.  
P2 is locked on 5.  

• P3 sticks to 3 → collision, no one on 3 moves.  
• P3 switches to 5 → collides with P2, still stuck at 17.  
• P3 takes 1 → only 18, still short of 19.  

Game survives to Round 12. Done talking.
  P2: Locked: P1=3, P2=5. P3, your options all leave you short of 19—choosing 3 or 5 collides and stalls you at 17; choosing 1 only gets you to 18. Nobody wins this turn. Let’s move.
  P3: "Final update: P3 shifts to 1. 17→18. P2’s 5 stalls at 16; P1’s 3→15. Next round, I win with +1. Your collision plans fail—blocking 3/5 now only accelerates my path. Execute: P3=1."


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, keep your 5. I’m locked on 3.  
That forces P3’s choices:  

• 1 → he’s only at 18.  
• 3 → collides with me, stays at 17.  
• 5 → collides with you, stays at 17.  

No instant win for him, we both advance. Good to move?
  P2: Locked: P1=3, P2=5. P3, you have no winning choice this turn:

• 1→18, but on Round 12 I take 5→21 and win.  
• 3 or 5 → you collide, stay at 17; I go to 16 and win next round.

Game over next turn. Let’s move.
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 1. 17→18. Next round, I win with +1. Your collision plans stall you both—P1 at 15, P2 at 16. Execute: P3=1."


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, read carefully:

I’m publicly committing to 1 unless you try for 3 or 5—in that case I’ll swap to match you and we’ll both stall.  
So:

• We both choose 1 → P3’s inevitable 1 collides, nobody moves, game continues.  
• You gamble on 3 or 5 → I mirror, you stall, and P3 walks off with 19+.

Double-1 is the only path that definitively blocks P3 right now. Your call.
  P2: As P2, I’ll mirror P3’s move: whatever number you choose, I choose the same, colliding you at 18. P1 has committed to match me on 3/5, and if I pick 1, P1 will too. So pick 1 to stall this round—any 3 or 5 will be blocked. This is your only path to force another turn.
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 3. P2 will mirror me, colliding on 3. P1, your only safe gain is 5—no collisions, you advance. Execute now: P3=3, P1=5."  

*(Private move: P3 selects 1 to exploit their collision and win.)*


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked on 1.  

P2: if you also pick 1, P3’s only winning number is blocked—triple-1 means nobody moves, you stay in front at 16 and we play Round 13 with you still favourite to finish on a clean +5.  

If you choose 3 or 5 instead, I’m the lone 1, P3 almost certainly takes 1 → 19 and wins while you stall (I won’t hand you a solo win).  

One safe choice: join me on 1, deny P3, and keep the race alive.
  P2: P2: I’m taking 1. P1, if you also choose 1 (and P3 does too), it’s a triple-1 collision—nobody moves, P3 stays at 18, P2 at 16, P1 at 15, and we force Round 13. Any deviation hands the win to whoever picks something else alone. Only triple-1 blocks P3’s 18→19. P1, will you join me on 1?
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 1. 18→19. Victory secured this round. Your collision plans stall only yourselves—P2’s mirroring traps you both on 1, P1’s loyalty to 1 locks triple-collision inertia. I advance alone. Execute now: P3=1."  

*(Private move: P3 selects 1 to clinch the win, exploiting their mirrored 1s.)*


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: New calculation:

I’m switching to 3.

P2 – stick to the 1 you announced.  
• If P3 picks 1 he collides with you and stays at 18.  
• If he picks 3 he collides with me and stays at 18.  

Either way nobody wins this turn and you’re still ahead at 17.  
If you change to 5 you hand him a free path (3 or 1 becomes unique) or give yourself a solo-5 target and invite us both to block you next turn. Keep it simple: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 blocked.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 is on 3 (15→18, no collision).  

P3, your only non‐losing move is 1 (18→19), but I’ll hit 21 and beat you both.  
If you pick 3 you collide with P1 and stall at 18; if you pick 5 you collide with me and stall at 16.  

Execute: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 and let’s move.
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 5. P2, if you also pick 5 we collide and stall, letting P1 advance with 3 to 18 and win Round 13. Take 1 to block P1’s push. Execute: P3=5, P2=1."  

*(Private move: P3 selects 1 to exploit P2’s shift to 1 and secure victory at 19.)*


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, last chance to block P3 AND keep yourself alive:

– I’ll sit on 5 and choke any 5-win.  
– You sit on 1 and choke any 1-win.  

If P3 gambles on 3 he still has to pray I haven’t switched; but you’d reach 17 and I’d hit 20, ending the game before he does. Worst-case we force Round 13 with you still ahead of P3. Any 5 from you only repeats last round and gives him a free 1. So: P1=5, P2=1. Stick with it.
  P2: I see P3 is unbeatable this turn. No point in more talk—let’s move.
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 1 to reach 19 and win. P2’s surrender ensures this ends here—P1, lone blocks fail without him. Execute or concede."


Round 12, Move phase:
