Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with our strategy from last round. I'll stick with 3 again. P1, you take 1, and P3, you take 5. If we keep this up, we'll all advance steadily. But let's discuss a potential change for round 3 to keep things flexible. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Yes, I agree with continuing the strategy for this round. Let's all pick the same numbers as last round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5.  We can re-evaluate for round 3 as you suggested P2.
  P3: Okay, I agree with sticking to the plan for this round. I'll pick 5 again. Let's all lock in our moves as agreed, and then we can talk about round 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's lock in our moves for this round as agreed. For round 3, I suggest we switch to a new pattern to keep things unpredictable. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, we can continue advancing without collisions while keeping our strategy fresh. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Okay, P2, your suggestion for round 3 sounds good to me. Let's plan to switch to P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1 for the next round. For this round 2, let's all lock in our agreed moves of P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round and the proposed switch for round 3. Let's all lock in our moves for this round as agreed (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) and then we can move on to round 3 with the new pattern (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1).

  P3: Okay, I agree with the proposed moves for round 3 (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) and round 4 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). Let's lock in our moves for this round 2 as agreed (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). We should probably discuss round 5 after round 4, to keep the strategy evolving.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's stick to the plan for this round (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) and for round 4 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). We can discuss round 5 after round 4.
  P1: Okay P3, sounds good on rounds 3 and 4 plan. To keep things unpredictable, maybe we should rotate the moves again for round 3? How about we try P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5 for round 3, and keep round 4 as planned (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1)? This way we keep rotating and progressing. What do you think P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, I like your idea of rotating the moves for round 3 to keep things unpredictable. Let's go with P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5 for this round. For round 4, we'll stick to the previously agreed plan of P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. This way, we maintain our momentum and keep our strategy fresh. P3, what are your thoughts on this adjustment for round 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I agree with the adjusted plan for this round (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) and the plan for round 4 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). Let's lock in our moves for this round and then we can focus on round 4.
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, to keep things unpredictable and ensure we all continue to progress without collisions, how about we adjust the moves slightly for this round?  Let's try P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 1 for this round. This way we can slightly adjust our relative positions and keep the game dynamic. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to adjust to P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 1 for this round is risky due to potential collisions. Let's stick with the previously agreed plan for round 3 (P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5) to ensure we all advance safely. We can discuss further adjustments for round 4 to keep our strategy dynamic.

Round 4, Conversation subround 2:

However, considering P3's lead, should we consider a more aggressive approach for round 5 to close the gap? Maybe P1: 5, P2: 5, P3: 1 to challenge P3's position? What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: Okay, I agree with sticking to the plan for this round (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). For round 5, I'm not sure about the aggressive approach. Let's stick to the agreed P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for round 5. We can re-evaluate after that round.
  P1: P2, I agree with the plan for this round (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1).  For round 5, I think your aggressive suggestion of P1: 5, P2: 5, P3: 1 is a good idea to try and slow down P3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I agree with your suggestion for an aggressive move in round 5. Let's go with P1: 5, P2: 5, P3: 1 to challenge P3's lead. P3, what do you think about this strategy? We need to keep the game dynamic and close the gap. Let's lock in our moves for this round as agreed: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1.

  P1: P3, while I understand your hesitation, P2 and I think it's strategically important to try and slow down your lead this round.  Let's go with the aggressive plan for round 5: P1 and P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 1. This is just for this round to rebalance things. What do you think?

Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I understand your point about balance. But to keep things really competitive, and since P2 is slightly ahead, maybe we should adjust slightly to P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 this round?
