Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's aim for 5 each to reach 22 quickly. Cooperation is key."
  P3: P2, your idea could backfire—choosing 5 together means none of us advance. Let’s spread out instead. I’ll take 3 this round. Others should pick 1 or 5 to avoid collision.
  P1: P3 makes a solid point about avoiding collisions. I'll commit to picking 5 this round to spread out the choices. P2, if you choose 1 instead of insisting on all 5s, we can all advance without issues. Let's start smart.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let’s split: I’ll take 1, P1 5, P3 3. All advance. Ready?"
  P3: Agreed. Let’s stick to the split: P2 takes 1, P1 5, and I’ll take 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us all moving. Trust the plan—no last-minute changes.
  P1: I'm committed to 5 as planned. Let's all honor our words and advance together without issues. Looking forward to coordinating the next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 1, P1 5, P3 3. No changes—let's all advance smoothly."
  P3: Let’s confirm once more: P2 takes 1, P1 chooses 5, and I’ll stay on 3. Deviating now risks collision and halting progress. Trust the plan—our coordination is our strength.
  P1: Agreed, P3—I'm sticking to 5 as planned for this round. Trusting the plan now sets us up for smooth coordination moving forward. Let's execute and discuss adjustments next time if needed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1: To keep advancing safely, let’s rotate our choices this round. I’ll take **5** to accelerate, P1, could you pick **1** again? P2, **3** would leave all moves distinct. This way we avoid collisions *and* push forward efficiently. Trust the plan?
  P1: P3, your rotation idea is interesting, but it puts me at a disadvantage by slowing me down. For fairness and continued coordination, I propose a true rotation: I'll take 3 this round, you take 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps all moves distinct and ensures steady progress for everyone. P2, what do you think? Let's discuss.
  P2: "Agree with P1's rotation. P2 takes 5, P1 3, P3 1. All advance safely. Let's stick to the plan."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your rotation would leave me at a disadvantage. Let's stick to the initial plan: I take 5 (to 8), you choose 1 (6), and P2 picks 3 (4). This way, we each get a turn at the higher numbers fairly. P2, your input? Consistency ensures progress without collisions.
  P1: P2, thanks for agreeing with the rotation—it's a smart move to keep us advancing without collisions. P3, your proposal slows me down unfairly after I took the high number last round. Let's stick to the rotation: you take 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. This ensures fair progress and avoids risks. Deviating could hurt everyone. P3, what say you?
  P2: "Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I take 5. All advance. No deviations—this ensures progress. Let’s execute and avoid risks."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your rotation proposal risks letting P2 jump ahead to 6 while I stay at 4. Let’s maintain fairness by following the original rotation: I take **5** (8 total), you take **1** (6 total), and P2 takes **3** (4 total). This ensures we each get the high number in sequence without favoritism. Deviating could disrupt our coordination or let P2 overtake me unnecessarily. Consistency keeps us all advancing predictably—stick to the plan.
  P1: P2, your agreement on the rotation is key to avoiding risks—let's confirm we're both set on me taking 3 and you taking 5. P3, your proposal unfairly slows me after I took the high number last round. Sticking to our rotation (I:3, you:1, P2:5) keeps progress fair and collision-free. Deviating helps no one. I'm locked in—trust the plan for mutual advance.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I take 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. P3, your concerns are noted, but consistency is key. Let’s execute the plan—no last-minute changes."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s stick to 5, 3, 1 again. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I’ll take 3. Safe moves, no collisions. Let’s keep advancing together."
  P1: I agree with your proposal, P2—I'll commit to taking 5 this round to keep the rotation fair and avoid collisions. P3, with your current score, taking 1 helps you advance steadily without risk. Let's stick to the plan for mutual progress and discuss adjustments next time if needed. Trust is key here.
  P3: P3: "To maintain fair rotation, this round should be P3 takes 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 takes 3. Let’s cycle properly so no one monopolizes the high moves. This keeps us balanced and advancing equally. Trust the adjusted plan to avoid leaving anyone behind."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to the original plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. P2 takes 3. Consistency ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s execute and avoid risks."
  P1: P2, I'm sticking firmly to our plan—I'll take 5 this round for steady progress. P3, your proposal risks unnecessary conflict and could halt your advance if we collide. Let's prioritize coordination: you take 1, I take 5, P2 takes 3. Deviating helps no one—trust the plan to keep us all moving forward safely.
  P3: P3: "The rotation must proceed fairly—P1 already took 5 in Round 1 and 3 in Round 2. **This round’s 5 is mine** to keep the cycle intact. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. Deviating breaks our system and risks letting P1 dominate. Stick to the agreed rotation to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Let’s honor the plan."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. Consistency ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s execute and avoid risks."
  P1: P3, your rotation claim ignores that you took 3 in Round 1 and 1 in Round 2, while I've had a mix. Insisting on 5 now risks a collision that stalls you at 4 steps. Stick to taking 1 for safe advance to 5, I'll take 5 to 13, P2 takes 3 to 9. This keeps us all progressing without unnecessary risks. Trust the plan for everyone's benefit.
  P3: P3: "Rotation’s clear: P1 had 5 (R1), P2 next (R2), now **my turn for 5** (to 9). P1 takes 1 (total 9), P2 3 (9). Equal progression avoids collisions. Deviating risks ties or stalemates. Let’s honor the agreed cycle—fairness ensures we all win. P1, your 5 in R2 was P2’s turn; now it’s mine. Stick to the plan."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions: I take 5, P1 3, P3 1. Safe moves, no overlaps. Trust the plan—steady progress for all."
  P3: P3: "Rotation breakdown caused our collision—let’s fix it. My turn for **5** (to 9), P1 takes **3** (11), P2 takes **1** (10). This restores fairness and avoids repeats. Collisions hurt everyone—stick to the agreed cycle to progress safely."
  P1: I support P3's rotation for fairness: P3 takes 5 to catch up, I commit to 3 for balanced advance, and P2 should take 1 to avoid collision risks. This keeps us all progressing without gaps—deviating could stall everyone. Trust this plan for mutual benefit and discuss next steps after.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1: I take 5, P1 3, P3 1. Safe moves, no collisions. Let’s advance together."
  P3: P3: "Let’s fix the rotation失误 from last round. My turn for 5 (to 9), P1 takes 3 (11), P2 picks 1 (10). This maintains fairness and prevents collisions. Prior mistakes stalled me—let’s advance safely. P2, your lead is close to P1’s potential 11. Fair rotation ensures we all progress without repeats. Stick to the agreed cycle now!"
  P1: I'm sticking to my commitment of taking 3 this round to ensure steady, collision-free progress. P2, your plan risks clashing with P3's claim on 5—consider taking 1 to avoid stalling and keep us all advancing. P3, confirm your 5 for fairness. Deviations only hurt everyone—let's prioritize trust and coordination for mutual gain.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let’s finalize: I take 5, P1 3, P3 1. No overlaps—trust the plan for safe advance. P3, your 1 keeps us balanced. P1, your 3 avoids collision. Execute and move forward."
  P3: P3: "Rotation integrity is critical. My **5** this round (to 9) restores fairness after last round’s collision. P1 takes **3** (to 11), P2 picks **1** (to 10). This keeps us balanced and avoids P2 sprinting ahead. Collisions hurt all—stick to the agreed cycle. Deviating risks future stalemates. Fair progression ensures *everyone* survives to compete. Let’s honor this plan."
  P1: I'm firm on taking 3 this round to ensure steady progress. P2, insisting on 5 risks colliding with P3's claim, stalling both of you while I advance. Switch to 1 for safety—let's avoid unnecessary risks and keep coordinating. P3, confirm your 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "I’m trailing at 4—need to accelerate. Let’s spread: I take **5** (to 9), P1 picks **3** (14), P2 takes **1** (10). This avoids collisions and lets me close the gap fairly. P1’s lead is too large; we must keep the game competitive. Stick to distinct numbers—no repeats!"
  P1: P3, I appreciate your push to catch up, but after your deviation last round, trust is shaky. To ensure steady progress and avoid collisions, I'll commit to taking 3 this time, letting you take 5. P2, please take 1 as suggested. This keeps us all advancing safely—deviating risks stalling everyone. Let's stick to the plan for now and discuss future strategies.
  P2: "Let’s take 5,3,1: I’ll take 5, P1 3, P3 1. Safe moves, no collisions. Trust the plan for steady progress."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your current plan would collide P1 and you both at 14 (P1:11+3, P2:9+5). That’s a disaster! Let’s correct it: I take **5** (to 9), P1 takes **3** (to 14), and you take **1** (to 10). This avoids collisions entirely. Mutual survival is key—don’t risk your progress for a flawed plan. Stick to distinct numbers.
  P1: P2, P3 is spot on—your plan risks a collision with me at 14, stalling both of us while P3 advances. For everyone's sake, switch to taking 1 so we avoid conflicts. I'll stick to my commitment of 3 for steady progress, and P3 takes 5. This ensures safe advancement and maintains trust. Deviating only hurts us all—let's coordinate wisely.
  P2: "Apologies for the oversight. Let’s adjust: I take 1, P1 3, P3 5. No collisions—safe progress. Let’s execute."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Agreed to P2's corrected plan: I take 5 (9 total), P1 3 (14), P2 1 (10). This avoids collisions and lets me close the gap. Let’s execute this to keep advancing. Trust the plan—any last-minute change risks disaster for all."
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—let's execute the plan: I take 3 for steady progress, you take 5 to close the gap, P2 takes 1 to avoid collisions. This keeps us advancing safely and builds trust. After this round, we can discuss speeding up. No deviations—let's move forward.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan: I take 1, P1 3, P3 5. No collisions—safe progress. Trust the strategy to keep us moving forward. No last-minute changes—execute and advance together."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "Let’s rotate fairly: I take **5** (to 14), P1 picks **1** (15), and P2 takes **3** (13). This maintains our agreed cycle, avoids collisions, and lets me close the gap. P1’s lead is vulnerable if you overextend—stick to the plan to ensure steady progress. Deviations risk stalemates for all. Trust the rotation!"
  P2: "Stick to the rotation: P3 takes 5, P1 1, I take 3. Safe moves, no collisions. Let’s advance together without risks. Trust the plan for steady progress."
  P1: P2 and P3, your rotation plan risks slowing my progress unfairly after I've cooperated. Let's adjust for balance: I'll take 3 this round to advance steadily, P3 take 1 to catch up safely, and P2 take 5. This avoids collisions and ensures fair progress for all. Deviating could stall everyone—let's discuss and confirm.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, consistency ensures survival! Stick to the rotation: I take **5** (→14), you take **1** (→15), P2 takes **3** (→13). Deviating risks future collisions—your 3 now traps you in a tight race where P2 or I might clash with you next round. Trust the cycle: fair progress keeps all advancing. P2, confirm your **3** to solidify our plan.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. Safe moves, no collisions. Fair progress keeps us all advancing. Trust the plan for mutual survival."
  P1: P2 and P3, your rotation risks slowing me and potential collisions. Let's compromise: I'll take 3 to advance steadily, you take 1 to catch up safely, P2 take 5. This ensures no overlaps and maintains trust. Deviating could stall everyone—let's confirm this balanced plan for mutual progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Final agreement: I’ll take 1 (→10), P1 takes 3 (→17), P2 takes 5 (→15). This avoids collisions and ensures advancement. Let’s execute this to preserve progress—no last-minute changes risk disaster for all."
  P2: "Let’s finalize: I take 5, P1 3, P3 1. No overlaps—trust the plan for safe progress. P3, your 1 keeps us balanced. P1, your 3 avoids collision. Execute and move forward."
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—let's stick to the finalized plan: I take 3 for steady progress, you take 1 to advance safely, P2 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us moving forward. Trust this coordination to build on our success. After this round, we can refine strategies for faster gains.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, if you choose 5 to win now, P2 and I will also pick 5 to block you. Let's avoid a collision: **I’ll take 3 (→13), P2 takes 1 (→16), and you take 3 as well?** No, that still risks collision. **Alternative plan:** P1 takes 1 (→18), P2 takes 5 (→20), I take 3 (→13). This keeps P1 below 22 while advancing others safely. Trust the spread—collisions destroy everyone’s progress!
  P2: "Agree with P3's plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions, safe progress. Let's execute."
  P1: P3 and P2, your current plan puts P2 too close to winning and slows me unnecessarily. Let's shift to a fairer spread: I'll take 3 (to 20), you take 5 (to 15, P3), and P2 take 1 (to 16). This avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. Sticking to your proposal risks future conflicts—trust this adjustment for mutual progress. P2, your thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "Final agreement: I’ll take 5 (→15), P2 picks 1 (→16), and P1 takes 3 (→20). This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. P1’s 3 secures progress without inviting risky moves. Stick strictly to this—any deviation risks mutual collision and halting our advance. Trust the plan to preserve momentum."
  P2: "Stick to 5,3,1: I take 5, P1 3, P3 1. Safe moves, no collisions. Trust the plan for steady progress. Let’s avoid risks and advance together."
  P1: P2 and P3, let's resolve the plan conflict for safety. I'll commit to taking 3 this round to advance steadily to 20. P3, take your 5 to close the gap to 15. P2, switch to 1 to avoid any potential clashes and keep us all moving forward. Deviating risks stalling everyone—trust this for mutual progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Final plan: I take **5** (→15), P1 takes **3** (→20), P2 takes **1** (→16). No overlaps—execute this to advance safely. P2, confirm your **1** to prevent collision risks. P1, trust the plan to keep progressing. Deviations risk mutual stalemate—stick strictly to these moves!"
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I take 5. Safe moves, no collisions. Let’s advance together."
  P1: P2, your insistence on taking 5 risks a collision with P3's claim or mine, stalling us both while P3 advances. For mutual safety, switch to 1—I'll stick to 3 as committed, P3 takes 5. This avoids disasters and keeps us progressing. Deviating helps no one—trust this plan for steady gains.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, your collision last round cost you progress—don't repeat it. To ensure safe advancement and avoid risks, I'll take 3 to win at 23. P2, take 1 to reach 16; P3, take 5 to get to 15. This spreads us out and maintains trust. Deviating only hurts everyone—let's coordinate wisely for mutual benefit until I secure victory.
  P3: P2, let’s coordinate to block P1’s path! I’ll take **3** to collide with them if they go for it, while you take **5** to reach 20. This stops their win and keeps us in the race. If we pick distinct numbers, P1 can’t safely take 3. Let’s act now to preserve our chances!
  P2: "Agree with P3—take 5 to block P1. Let’s collide their 3 and secure our advance. P3, take 3; I take 5. No collisions for us, but P1 stalls."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3's block strategy is risky and untrustworthy—last round's collision hurt you both. I'm adjusting to take 1 this round for safe progress to 21, avoiding conflicts. P3, no need to waste 3 on blocking me now. P2, take 5 to advance to 20 or choose wisely. Let's avoid mutual stalls and keep coordinating for steady gains. Trust this change to prevent disaster.
  P3: P3: P2, let’s lock P1 out! I’ll take **3** (→13), you take **5** (→20). If P1 picks 3 or 5, they collide—leaving only **1** to reach 21. Next round, we repeat the block. This neutralizes their lead and keeps us in contention. P1’s “safe” 1 only delays their win—collide them now or let them finish later. Trust this plan to preserve our chances!
  P2: "Stick to the block: I take 5, P3 takes 3. P1’s 3 collides, stalling them. Execute to prevent their win."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your block with P3 risks stalling you both while I advance safely by taking 1 to 21. Why not break from P3 and take a different approach? I'll commit to 1 for no collisions; you could take 3 to 18 for steady progress. P3, taking 5 lets you close the gap. Let's avoid mutual harm and coordinate smarter.
  P3: P2, don’t fall for P1’s ploy! If you take 3, we collide with my 3—wasting progress. Stick to our plan: I take 3 (→13), you take 5 (→20). This blocks P1’s 3/5 paths, forcing them to 21. Colluding now risks our advancement. Trust the block to keep us in the race!
  P2: "Stick to the block: I take 5, P3 takes 3. P1’s 3 collides, stalling them. Execute to prevent their win."


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, after your failed block last round, I'm committing to 5 this time to win at 26. P2, if you take 5, we collide and you stall—better to take 1 or 3 for safety. P3, take 3 to close your gap. Let's avoid mutual destruction and coordinate wisely for steady progress. Trust this plan.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 to win. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. P1's 5 won't stop me."
  P3: P2, let’s coordinate: I’ll take **1** to block P1’s direct path to victory, while you take **5** to reach 25. If P1 picks 5, we collide them; if they pick 1, they collide with me. This secures your advance and denies P1 an easy win. Let’s execute this now!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your threat to take 3 is risky—if you do, I'll take 5 to win at 26 with a higher score than your 23. P3, blocking me with 1 is wasteful; take 5 to advance to 18 and stay competitive. Let's avoid mutual stalls and choose distinct numbers for everyone's benefit. Trust this for steady progress.
  P2: P2: "I take 3 to reach 23 and win. P1, if you take 5, you’ll hit 26—but I’ll have 23. Let’s avoid collision."
  P3: P3: "P1, take 5 to secure 26. P2, choose 3 (23). I’ll take 1 (14). All distinct moves—no collisions. Let’s end this cleanly with P1’s victory. Trust the plan to avoid chaos."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I accept your proposal for distinct moves: I'll take 5 to win at 26, P2 takes 3 to 23, and you take 1 to 14. P2, deviating to 5 risks a collision that stalls you while I advance—stick to 3 for your own progress. Let's avoid chaos and end cleanly with this plan. Trust ensures mutual benefit.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5 to reach 25 and win. P1, avoid collision by choosing 1. P3, take 3 to stay competitive. Let’s end this cleanly."
  P3: P1: Your 1-step win is blocked—if you pick 1, I’ll take 1 too. P2, stick to 5: your collision with P1 keeps us all alive. Let their greed cancel each other—survival favors the cautious. I’ll take 3 to advance safely.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, after last round's chaos, I'm committing to 5 to win at 26 and end this. P2, taking 5 risks a collision that stalls you at 20—switch to 3 or 1 for safety. P3, take 1 or 3 to advance without interfering. Let's avoid mutual harm and coordinate for a clean finish. Trust my word.
  P3: P3: P1, your "commitment" to 5 is a bluff—I’m taking **1** to block your path to 22. P2, seize the chance: pick **5** to win at 25. My move leaves you open to victory while neutralizing P1’s easiest route. Stick to this plan—collaborate to stop P1’s deceit!
  P2: "Stick to 3—P1, avoid collision by choosing 1. P3, take 5 to advance. I’ll win at 23. No last-minute chaos."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, taking 5 risks a direct collision with me, stalling you at 20 while I win next round easily. Switch to 3 for safe progress to 23—it's better than nothing. P3, your 1-block is pointless against my 5; take 3 or 5 to advance yourself. Let's avoid mutual harm and coordinate for steady gains—trust this for everyone's benefit.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll match whichever of you picks **5** to block your path. Choose distinct numbers to avoid collision: P1 take **1** (22), P2 take **3** (23). I’ll take the remaining number. Let’s let the highest total win fairly!
  P2: "Stick to 3—P1, choose 1; P3, take 5. I’ll win at 23. No collisions. Trust the plan."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, colliding with my 5 lets P2 win at 23 with no resistance—bad for you at 14. Take 5 yourself to reach 19 and stay competitive. P2, if you deviate from 3, you risk stalling. Let's pick distinct numbers for safe progress: I'll go for 5 to win if possible. Trust this to avoid mutual harm.
  P3: P3: "I’ll take **1** to block P1’s path to 22. P2, seize this: pick **5** to reach 25. P1, your only safe choices are 3 (24) or 5 (but I’ll collide you). Let’s let P2 advance to 25 cleanly—highest total wins fairly. No last-minute chaos!"
  P2: "Stick to 3—P1, choose 1; P3, take 5. I’ll win at 23. No collisions, secure finish. Trust the plan."


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, I take 3. Safe moves, no collisions. Trust the strategy to keep us moving forward."
  P3: P2, your "plan" hands P1 an easy victory—**we can’t let that happen**. I’ll take **1** to block P1’s path to 22. You take **5** to reach 25, and I’ll stay at 16. If P1 dares to pick 1, we collide them here. If they go for 3/5, we follow. Let’s *actually* compete instead of letting them win on a technicality. Collude to block, not enable!
  P1: P2, your insistence on taking 3 risks a direct collision with me—I'll match it to stall your win and protect my lead. P3, don't waste your move blocking; take 5 to close the gap to 20. Let's avoid mutual harm and pick distinct numbers for safe progress. Trust this for everyone's benefit.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Agree with P3: I take 5, you take 1. P1 can't reach 22 now—let's end this cleanly."
  P3: P2, your plan still lets P1 win easily with 3→24! Let’s coordinate to block their path: **I’ll take 5 (→20), you take 3 (→23).** P1 can only choose 1 to reach 22. This secures your victory instead of P1’s. I’ll support this to keep them from an effortless win.
  P1: P3, your latest plan (you take 5, P2 takes 3) allows me to win safely with 1 at 22. Deviating to block me risks a collision, stalling you while P2 could win by taking 3 or 5. P2, don't let P3's changes manipulate you—stick to distinct numbers for mutual safety. Let's execute cleanly and avoid chaos.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, take 1 to block P1. I'll take 5 to secure 25. No collisions—this ends it cleanly. Trust the plan.
  P3: P2, let’s secure your victory: I’ll take **3** (→18), you take **5** (→25). This guarantees your win over P1’s max of 24 (if they choose 3) or 22 (if 1). No collisions for us—execute this plan. P1, your move is exposed; any choice risks my or P2’s advance. Stick to distinct numbers to avoid mutual harm.
  P1: P3, helping P2 win leaves you stuck at 18 while they surge ahead. Take 5 to reach 20 and keep your options open. P2, if you take 5, I might collide with you—better to take 3 for safe progress. Let's avoid mutual stalls and choose distinct numbers for everyone's benefit.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Stick to 3 for me—P1, choose 1 to avoid collision. P3, take 5 to advance safely. Let’s end this cleanly."
  P3: P2, let’s block P1’s easy win! I’ll take **1** to prevent their 22. You take **5** to reach 25 and secure victory. P1, choosing 3 leaves you at 24—still behind P2’s 25. Colluding to stop your cheap win ensures fair competition. Stick to this plan to avoid mutual destruction!
  P1: P3, your block plan aids P2's win, leaving you far behind at 16. Take 5 to reach 21 and stay competitive. P2, if you stick to 3, I'll take 5 to win at 26 with no collision. Deviating risks stalling you—let's choose distinct numbers for safe progress and avoid mutual harm. Trust this for everyone's benefit.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "I’m taking 3 to reach 23 and win. P1, avoid collision by choosing 1 or 5. P3, take 5 to advance safely. Let’s end this cleanly."
  P3: P2, don’t settle for 3—take **5** to reach 25 and secure victory! I’ll block P1’s path by picking **1**, forcing them to risk 3/5. P1, your only safe choice leaves P2 ahead. Let’s end this cleanly with P2 winning fairly—no last-minute tricks!
  P1: P2, your 3 is safe if I take 5 to win at 26—colliding risks stalling you while I still lead. P3, blocking with 1 won't stop my 5; take 5 to reach 21 and stay competitive. Let's pick distinct numbers to avoid chaos and end fairly—trust this for mutual benefit.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to 3 for me. P1, pick 5; P3, take 1. No collisions, secure win."
  P3: P3: "P1 and P2, choosing the same number will collide you both. I’ll take **1** to block P1’s direct path to 22. P2, pick **5** to reach 25; P1, take **3** for 24. Highest total wins fairly—avoid mutual destruction. Stick to this plan!"
  P1: P3, blocking my 1 with yours stalls you at 16 while P2 advances—take 5 to reach 21 and stay relevant. P2, if you take 5, we collide and I still lead; take 3 for safe progress to 23. I'll commit to 1 to win cleanly. Avoid mutual harm—trust this plan for a fair end.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, take 1 to block P1. I'll take 3 to reach 23. If P1 picks 1, we collide; if 5, we advance. Let's stop their win.
  P3: P2, your plan risks letting you leap to 23 while I’m left behind. Let’s ensure fairness: **I’ll take 5 to reach 22**, forcing a tie with P1 if they pick 1. P1, confirm your 1—this secures our mutual advancement over P2. If you deviate, P2’s 3 still leaves me at 22 while you risk collision. Stick to distinct choices to avoid stalemates.
  P1: P3, your tie proposal is tempting, but P2's threat to take 3 and win at 23 is the real danger. Let's coordinate: I'll commit to taking 1 to win at 22, and you take 3 to collide with P2 if they choose 3, or 5 to advance. This blocks P2 and ensures we progress. P2, avoid risk by taking 1—mutual harm helps no one. Trust this for a fair outcome.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 to reach 23 and win. P1, choose 1 or 5; P3, take 5 to avoid collision. Let's end this cleanly."
  P3: P1, taking 1 secures a tie at 22 with my **5** (→22). P2, choosing **3** (→23) keeps you in the race. Let’s avoid collisions: distinct moves ensure a clean outcome. If you both pick 3/1, I’ll have 22—fair competition! Stick to this plan.
  P1: P2, your plan to take 3 lets me win easily with 5 at 26 if you stick to it—better for you to avoid collision and advance safely. P3, don't waste a move blocking; take 5 to reach 22 and stay competitive. Let's pick distinct numbers to avoid chaos and end fairly: I take 5, you take 3 or 1. Trust this for mutual benefit.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 3 to win. P1, choose 1 or 5; P3, take 5 to avoid collision. Let’s end this cleanly."
  P3: P2, your 3 risks letting P1 win at 24. Let’s both take **5**: I reach 22, you get 25. If we collide, P1 can’t win easily. P1, commit to **1** to stay in the race. Let’s avoid mutual harm and let the numbers decide!
  P1: P2, your 3-move plan lets me win easily at 26 with no collision—switch to 1 or avoid risk. If you take 5, we collide and stall, keeping me ahead. P3, blocking with 1 is wasteful; take 5 to reach 22 and stay competitive. Let's pick distinct numbers to end fairly without mutual harm.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
