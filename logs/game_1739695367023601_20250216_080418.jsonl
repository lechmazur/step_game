P1's suggestion could work, but if we let P1 take 5, they might win next round. To increase our chances, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 doesn't get too far ahead, and we keep the game competitive. Are we ready to commit to this plan, or does anyone have a different strategy in mind? Let's ensure we're all aligned for the best chance to win."}
