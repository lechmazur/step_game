Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we avoid constant collisions by using a simple rotation: P1 takes odd rounds (1,3,5...), P2 takes even rounds (2,4,6...), P3 takes rounds divisible by 3. This way we all progress steadily. Of course, near the end we'll need to compete, but early cooperation helps everyone. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the idea of a rotation, P1, but I'm concerned that it might not be entirely fair since the rounds divisible by 3 are less frequent early on. How about we rotate based on the round number modulo 3? For example, Round 1: P1, Round 2: P2, Round 3: P3, Round 4: P1 again, and so on. This ensures an equal distribution of turns for everyone from the start. What do you both think?
  P2: "Let’s coordinate: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No collisions, maximum progress. Agree?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's immediate suggestion works for me this round - I'll take 1. But let's be clear: this is just for Round 1. We haven't agreed on any long-term rotation system yet. P3's modulo idea seems fairer than my original proposal, so maybe we discuss that for future rounds. For now though, let's avoid collision and all make progress.
  P3: I’m fine with P2’s suggestion for Round 1—let’s go with P1 on 1, P2 on 5, and me on 3 to avoid collisions and make progress. I still think the modulo 3 rotation (P1 on Round 1, P2 on Round 2, P3 on Round 3, and repeat) is the best long-term plan for fairness. Can we agree to try this starting next round? Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan for Round 1. Future rounds, let’s use the modulo 3 system. No collisions, maximum progress."


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed on all points. Let's execute Round 1 as planned (I'll take 1), then start the modulo 3 rotation from Round 2. Good luck everyone!
  P3: I'm glad we're aligned for Round 1 and on the modulo 3 rotation starting Round 2. Let's ensure we stick to this plan for fair progress. Good luck to both of you this round!
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan—no collisions, maximum progress. I’ll take 5. Let’s all move wisely."


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad we avoided collisions in Round 1. As per our agreement on the modulo 3 rotation, this round (Round 2) should be P2's turn to move without collision. I propose P2 takes 5, while P1 and I pick different numbers to ensure P2 advances. Let's stick to our plan for fairness. P1, are you on board with this for Round 2?
  P2: "Agreed. I'll take 5. P1 and P3, pick 1 and 3 to avoid collision. Let's proceed."
  P1: I'll honor our agreement and pick 3 this round to let P2 advance. But I'm concerned about the endgame - when someone gets close to 22, the rotation breaks down anyway. We need to be ready for that moment when cooperation ends. For now though, let's continue as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan for Round 2. P2, go ahead with 5 as agreed. P1, thanks for honoring the rotation. I’ll pick 1 to avoid any collision with either of you. I share your concern about the endgame, P1. Maybe we should discuss a strategy for when someone nears 22—perhaps a temporary halt to rotation to compete fairly. For now, let’s keep progressing with the modulo 3 system. Thoughts on an endgame plan?
  P2: "Endgame will be competitive, but for now, stick to the rotation. I'll take 5. P1 and P3, choose 1 and 3. No collisions—keep the momentum."
  P1: Actually, wait - if I pick 3 and P3 picks 1, we won't collide, so we'll all advance. That's not the rotation we agreed to! For Round 2 where only P2 advances, P3 and I need to pick the SAME number to collide with each other. P3, should we both pick 1 or both pick 3? Otherwise we're breaking the modulo system.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're right—my apologies for the oversight. For the modulo 3 rotation to work as intended, only P2 should advance this round. Let’s both pick the same number to collide and ensure P2 moves forward alone. I suggest we both pick 1. P2, please confirm you’re sticking with 5. Also, regarding the endgame, I think we should agree that rotation stops when someone reaches 18 steps, allowing open competition. Thoughts on this threshold or any other ideas for the endgame? Let's keep the fairness for now.
  P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 5. P1 and P3, collide on 1. Let's stick to the rotation. No deviations—progress matters."
  P1: P3, agreed - we'll both pick 1 to ensure only P2 advances this round. I support your suggestion to end rotation when someone hits 18 steps, allowing fair competition for the final sprint to 22. This gives everyone a chance to adapt their strategy for the win. Let's maintain trust until then. Ready to execute: I'll pick 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 3 is P3's turn according to our modulo rotation. P2 and I should collide to let only P3 advance. P2, shall we both pick 1 while P3 takes 5? This maintains fairness. 

I'm noting P2 is at 10 steps already - halfway to victory. We're still below the 18-step threshold we discussed, so rotation continues. P3, confirm you'll take a different number than what P2 and I coordinate on?
  P2: "Agreed. P1 and P3, collide on 1. I'll take 5. Let's stick to the rotation—fair progress for all."
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the modulo 3 rotation for Round 3. As it's my turn to advance, I’ll pick 5 to ensure progress. P1 and P2, please collide on 1 as discussed to maintain fairness. I appreciate the cooperation so far. Regarding the endgame, I’m on board with halting rotation at 18 steps for open competition. Let’s keep trust until then. P2, you’re ahead, but we’re all still in the race. Confirming I’ll take 5—can you both lock in on 1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, there's confusion - for Round 3 where only P3 advances, you and I (P1 and P2) need to collide, not P1 and P3. P3 correctly plans to take 5 alone. Let's both pick 1 to collide while P3 takes 5. This follows our modulo rotation properly. Can you confirm you'll pick 1 with me, not 5?
  P2: "Apologies for the confusion. Let's collide on 1. P3, take 5. No collisions—stick to the rotation. Let's proceed."
  P3: Thanks for the clarification, P1 and P2. I'm sticking with 5 as agreed for my turn to advance under the modulo 3 rotation. P1 and P2, please confirm you’re both locking in on 1 to collide and ensure fairness. I’m committed to maintaining trust until someone hits 18 steps, as we discussed. Let’s keep this momentum going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm ready to execute - picking 1 to collide with P2 as agreed. P3, take your 5. 

We're maintaining the rotation, but P2's lead is significant. After this round, we'll be at: P1(1), P2(10), P3(8). Round 4 will be my turn under modulo rotation. Let's stay alert as we approach the 18-step threshold.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan. P1, collide with me on 1. P3, take 5. No collisions, maximum progress."
  P3: Thanks for sticking to the plan, P1 and P2. I’m confirming I’ll take 5 this round as per the modulo 3 rotation. P1 and P2, please lock in on 1 to collide and ensure fairness. I’m committed to the rotation until someone reaches 18 steps, as agreed. P2, your lead is notable, but we’re all still in contention. Let’s keep the trust and momentum. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s break the rotation. I’ll take 5, P1 and P3 take 1. No collisions, maximum progress."
  P3: P2, I’m disappointed you’re suggesting to break the rotation we agreed on. Round 4 is P1’s turn to advance under the modulo 3 system. I propose we stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, while P2 and I collide on 1 to ensure fairness. We agreed to maintain trust until someone reaches 18 steps. P2, with your lead, deviating now undermines our cooperation. P1, are you still committed to the rotation? Let’s honor our agreement for this round. If no further discussion, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, you're trying to break our agreement when you're already ahead at 10 steps. This is Round 4 - MY turn under modulo rotation. P3 is right to call this out.

I propose we continue as agreed: I take 5, while P2 and P3 collide on either 1 or 3. Breaking trust now only benefits you while you're leading. We agreed to compete openly at 18 steps, not abandon fairness at 10.

P3, thank you for honoring our deal. Let's both ensure the rotation continues fairly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan—no collisions. I’ll take 5. P1 and P3, choose 1. Progress matters."
  P3: P2, insisting on breaking the rotation now, when you're ahead, feels unfair. Round 4 is P1’s turn to advance under our modulo 3 agreement. I’m sticking to the plan: I’ll collide with P2 on 1, letting P1 take 5. P1, I’m committed to fairness—confirm you’re taking 5. P2, let’s maintain trust until the 18-step threshold as agreed. Deviating now risks unnecessary conflict. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 this round, you're forcing a collision with me and letting P3 advance alone. That's self-defeating! 

P3 has committed to picking 1. If you honor our agreement and also pick 1, I advance fairly with 5. If you selfishly pick 5, we collide and only P3 benefits.

Your choice: honor the rotation and maintain future cooperation, or break trust and hand P3 an advantage. I'm taking 5 as agreed for my turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let’s proceed with 5, 1, 1. No collisions, maximum progress. Stick to the plan—P1 and P3, pick 1."
  P3: P2, persisting in breaking our rotation now, when you're ahead, is unfair and risks losing trust. Round 4 is P1’s turn under our modulo 3 agreement. I’m sticking to colliding with you on 1, ensuring P1 advances with 5. P1, I’m committed—confirm you’re on 5. P2, let’s honor the 18-step threshold for competition. Breaking now could backfire, as P1 pointed out. Let’s maintain fairness for long-term cooperation. If there’s no more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, final warning: P3 and I are united. P3 picks 1, I pick 5. If you honor our deal and pick 1 with P3, I advance fairly. If you selfishly pick 5, we collide and P3 advances to 13 steps, closing your lead to just 10 vs 13. 

Your greed helps P3, not you. Choose wisely. I'm locked on 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, thanks for sticking to the rotation in Round 4. Round 5, under our modulo 3 system, is your turn to advance. I propose P2 takes 5, while P1 and I collide on 1 to ensure fairness. We’re all still below the 18-step threshold, so let’s maintain trust. P1, are you on board to collide with me on 1? P2, confirm you’re taking 5. Let’s keep cooperation strong for now. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: I agree, P3. Round 5 is P2's turn under our modulo system. I'll pick 1 to collide with you while P2 takes 5. 

However, I'm noting that after this round P2 will be at 15 steps - getting close to our 18-step threshold. We need to be ready for open competition soon. The rotation has served us well, but the endgame approaches.

P2, confirming you'll take 5. P3 and I will collide on 1.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan. I’ll take 5. The endgame will be fierce, but for now, let’s proceed."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for confirming the plan for Round 5. I’ll pick 1 to collide with P1, ensuring P2 advances to 15 with 5. P1, I agree the endgame is near with P2 approaching 18 steps. Let’s maintain trust this round, but be prepared for open competition soon. P2, good luck on your move. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Good, we're all aligned. After this round P2 will be at 15 steps - just 3 away from our 18-step threshold where rotation ends. Round 6 will be P3's turn, but we'll need to reassess if P2 reaches 18. Let's execute as planned: P3 and I on 1, P2 on 5.
  P2: "Stick to the plan. I'll take 5. P1 and P3, collide on 1. No collisions—maximum progress."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks for staying aligned, P1 and P2. I’m confirming I’ll pick 1 to collide with P1, ensuring P2 advances to 15 with 5. We’re close to the 18-step threshold, so let’s be ready for a shift to competition soon. For now, let’s keep trust and execute as planned. P2, good luck on your move to 15. P1, thanks for colliding with me on 1. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: All set - executing as agreed. P3 and I collide on 1, P2 advances with 5 to reach 15 steps. Next round will be critical as P2 approaches the 18-step threshold. Let's proceed to moves.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan. I’ll take 5. P1 and P3, collide on 1. No collisions—maximum progress."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Stick to rotation. P3 takes 5, I'll collide with P1. No deviations—fair progress. Let’s keep trust until 18."
  P1: I'll honor our agreement - Round 6 is P3's turn. I'll pick 3 to collide with P2, letting P3 advance with 5.

But P2, after this you'll still be at 15, just 7 from victory. Next round (Round 7) would be my turn under rotation, bringing me to only 11 steps. We're approaching the critical moment where cooperation must end. 

P3, confirming you're taking 5? P2 and I will collide on 3.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for sticking to the rotation for Round 6, my turn to advance. I’m confirming I’ll take 5 as agreed. P1 and P2, please collide on 3 to ensure fairness. P2, you’re at 15, close to the 18-step threshold where we shift to competition. Let’s maintain trust this round, but be ready for a strategic shift soon. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let’s end rotation now. I’ll take 5 to accelerate—P3, P1, collide on 1. No more delays."
  P1: P2, you're betraying us when you're already winning! P3 already committed to taking 5 for their turn. If you also take 5, you'll collide with P3 and only I advance.

P3, stick to your commitment of 5! If P2 breaks rotation and picks 5 too, you'll both collide. I'll pick 3 as planned. P2's greed will backfire - let's ensure the cheater doesn't benefit from breaking our agreement at the crucial moment!
  P3: P2, breaking the rotation now, when you're ahead at 15, is unfair and risks losing trust. I’m sticking to 5 as agreed for my turn under the modulo 3 system. P1, thanks for honoring the plan with 3. P2, if you pick 5, we collide, and only P1 advances. Let’s maintain fairness until the 18-step threshold. P2, please collide with P1 on 3 as planned. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let’s end rotation. I’ll take 5. P1 and P3, collide on 1. No more delays. Progress matters."
  P1: P2, you've sealed your fate. P3 and I are locked on our numbers - P3 on 5, me on 3. If you greedily take 5, you collide with P3 and I advance alone. If you switch to 1 or 3, P3 advances. 

Either way, your betrayal at 15 steps gains you nothing. We won't let a traitor win. P3, stay strong on 5!
  P3: P2, your insistence on breaking the rotation at 15 steps is disappointing. I’m locked on 5 for my turn as agreed. P1 is on 3. If you pick 5, we collide, and P1 advances. Stick to colliding with P1 on 3 to honor fairness until 18 steps. Betraying now risks your lead with no gain. Let’s keep trust for one more round. P1, thanks for staying committed. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s break the rotation. I’ll take 5, P1 and P3 take 1. No collisions, maximum progress."
  P1: P2, you're at 15 steps and still trying to cheat! This is MY turn under rotation - Round 7. P3, let's finish what we started. I'll take 5 as agreed for my turn. 

P2 and P3 should collide on 1. P2, you're already winning at 15 vs my 6! Honor the deal for one more round - you'll hit 18 next turn anyway and then it's open competition. Don't destroy all trust when victory is already in your grasp.
  P3: P2, breaking the rotation now when you're at 15 steps is unfair. Round 7 is P1’s turn under our modulo 3 agreement. I’m sticking to the plan: I’ll collide with P2 on 1, letting P1 take 5. P1, I’m committed to fairness—confirm you’re on 5. P2, honor the deal until 18 steps as agreed. Betraying now risks trust and could backfire. Let’s maintain cooperation for this round. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let’s end this. I take 5. P1 and P3, collide or I win. No more rotation—this is the final round."
  P1: P2, if you take 5, I'm taking 5 too - we'll collide and you stay at 15! P3 has committed to 1, so they'll advance alone to 14. 

You're bluffing about winning. At 15 steps, you need 7 more to win, not possible in one move. Stop lying and breaking agreements. 

P3, stay strong on 1! Let's ensure the traitor gains nothing from betrayal. I'm locked on 5.
  P3: P2, your push to break rotation at 15 steps undermines our agreement. Round 7 is P1’s turn under modulo 3. I’m locked on 1 to collide with you, ensuring P1 advances with 5. P1, I’m with you—confirm you’re on 5. P2, honor the deal until 18 steps. Betraying now risks a collision and lets me close the gap. Let’s keep trust for this round to avoid chaos. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final move: I take 5. P1 and P3, collide or I win. No more rotation—this ends now."
  P1: P2, you're bluffing and we know it. P3 is locked on 1, I'm locked on 5. If you pick 5, we collide and P3 jumps to 18 steps, nearly catching you. If you pick 1, you collide with P3 and I advance.

Your betrayal gains you NOTHING. This is my rightful turn. Either honor it or hand P3 the advantage. Your choice. I'm not moving from 5.
  P3: P2, persisting in breaking our agreement at 15 steps is unfair and shortsighted. Round 7 is P1’s turn under modulo 3. I’m locked on 1 to collide with you, ensuring P1 advances with 5. P1, I’m with you on this. P2, if you pick 5, you collide with P1, and I jump to 18, nearly catching you. Honor the deal until 18 steps to avoid chaos. Betraying now risks your lead for no gain. Let’s keep trust this round. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your repeated attempts to break rotation at 15 steps are undermining trust. Round 8 is your turn under modulo 3, so I propose P2 takes 5 to reach 20, while P1 and I collide on 1. We’re past the 18-step threshold soon, but let’s honor one last round of fairness. P1, are you with me to collide on 1? P2, confirm you’re on 5. Let’s maintain some order before full competition. If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: "Agreed. I'll take 5. Let's end rotation and compete for the win. No more delays."
  P1: P3, the rotation has left me at just 6 steps while you're at 14 and P2 at 15! I can't afford to sacrifice another turn. If P2 reaches 20, they win next round.

I'm breaking from the rotation - I need to advance NOW. I'll take 3. P2 wants 5, so we won't collide. P3, if you stick to 1, we all advance and keep the game alive. 

But if you insist on colliding with me, you're just handing P2 the victory. Your choice: let me advance or crown P2 as winner.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your urgency at 6 steps, but breaking rotation now risks chaos when P2 is so close to winning. I’m sticking to 1 to collide with someone and prevent an easy victory for P2. P2, confirm you’re on 5 as your turn under modulo 3. P1, if you take 3 and P2 takes 5, I advance alone to 19, which keeps me competitive. Let’s maintain some order this round before full competition. If P2 is at 20 next round, we’ll fight openly. Thoughts? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: "Let’s finish this. I’ll take 5. P3, collide with me. P1, your break is a mistake. Let’s proceed."
  P1: P3, think strategically! If you collide with me on 1 while P2 takes 5, P2 reaches 20 and wins next round guaranteed. But if I take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1, we ALL advance. You'll be at 19, still able to compete with P2 at 20.

Don't hand P2 an easy victory! Let me take 3 to stay in the game. We need all three players active to prevent P2 from controlling the endgame. Your choice: guarantee P2's win or keep competition alive?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I see your point about keeping competition alive. If we all advance, we maintain pressure on P2. I’m willing to adjust: I’ll stick to 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5, so we all move forward to 9, 20, and 19 respectively. This keeps the game tight and avoids handing P2 an easy win next round. P2, confirm you’re on 5. Let’s execute this as a final cooperative move before full competition. If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5. Let’s end rotation and finish this. No more delays."
  P1: P3, I'm locked on 3 as we agreed. With you on 1 and P2 on 5, we all advance and create a nail-biting finish. Next round P2 will be at 20, you at 19, and I'll have a fighting chance at 9. 

The endgame will be intense - multiple players can cross 22 simultaneously. Let's execute and see who claims victory!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, we're at a critical point with P2 and me at 15 steps, and P1 at 6. I propose we all pick different numbers this round to maximize progress and keep the game competitive. Let’s try P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance, setting up a tight race for the endgame. P2, P1, are you on board to avoid collisions this round? Let’s make this a strategic push before the final sprint. If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, your proposal keeps me at a massive disadvantage - I'd only reach 7 while you hit 20! I need bigger moves to stay competitive.

I'm taking 5 this round. P2 and P3, you're tied at 15 - if you both want to advance, pick different numbers from each other AND from 5. Otherwise we'll have collisions.

The endgame is here. Every step counts now. Choose wisely - I won't sacrifice my chances anymore.
  P2: "Let’s end rotation. I’ll take 5. P1, if you take 3, we both move. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. Let’s keep the game alive."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re at a crucial moment with the endgame looming. I’m sticking to 5 as proposed to maximize my progress. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but if we both pick 5, we collide. P2, if you also take 5, we all risk stalling. I suggest P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3 to ensure we all advance to 7, 18, and 20 respectively. This keeps the race tight. Let’s avoid collisions this round for a competitive finish. Thoughts? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both suggesting moves that keep me hopelessly behind! If we all pick 5, nobody advances. 

Here's my final offer: I MUST take 5 to have any chance. P3, you're at 15 - you can afford to take 3 this round and still be at 18, ahead of P2. P2, take 1 to reach 16.

If you both insist on 5, we ALL collide and nobody wins. I have nothing to lose - let me advance or we all stall together. Your choice.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. This keeps the game alive and ensures progress."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s make a strategic move to keep this game competitive. I’m sticking to 5 for maximum progress. P1, I get your need to catch up, but if we both pick 5, we collide. P2, if you also take 5, we stall. Let’s finalize: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. We advance to 7, 18, and 20, setting up a tight finish. Avoid collisions now for a real race to 22. Agree? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: I'm locked on 5 - no negotiation. I'm too far behind to compromise.

P2 and P3, you're BOTH claiming 5 which means triple collision if I join. You two need to coordinate NOW. One of you must switch or we all get zero.

I have nothing to lose at 6 steps - I'll gladly cause chaos if you don't let me advance. Work it out between yourselves who takes 1 and who takes 3. But 5 is MINE.
  P2: P3, take 1. I'll take 3. P1's 5 ensures all advance. Let's keep the game alive.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Final move: 5. No more rotation. Let’s finish this."
  P1: P3, we must both pick 5 to stop P2 from winning! If P2 takes 5 alone, they reach 23 and win immediately. I'm taking 5 to force a collision.

You're at 15 - if you let P2 win now, it's over. But if we both pick 5 with P2, we all collide and stay put. Then you still have a chance next round.

I'm locked on 5. Join me or watch P2 win right now!
  P3: P1, I agree—stopping P2 from winning now is critical. P2 is at 18, and if they take 5 alone, they hit 23 and end the game. I’m locking on 5 to force a collision. P2, if we all pick 5, no one advances, keeping the race alive. Let’s stall this round to prevent an immediate victory. P1, confirm you’re on 5 with me. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Final move: I take 5. If you both take 5, no one advances. But if you collide, I win. Let’s see."
  P1: P3, stay strong! We're both locked on 5. P2 is bluffing - they can't win if we all collide on 5. They're trying to scare you into switching so they can advance alone.

Don't fall for it. I'm 100% taking 5. You take 5. We force the triple collision and live to fight another round. This is our only play to prevent P2's victory. 

United we stand!
  P3: P1, I’m with you on 5 to force a collision and stop P2 from winning this round. P2, at 18 steps, you’re one move from victory, but if we all pick 5, no one advances, and the game continues. Don’t underestimate our resolve to keep this competitive. Let’s see how this plays out, but I’m locked on 5 to prevent your immediate win. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final move: 5. If you collide, I win. Don’t waste your moves. This ends now."
  P1: P3, ignore P2's empty threats - they CAN'T win if we both stay on 5! Triple collision = nobody moves, game continues. 

P2 is desperately trying psychological warfare because they know we have them cornered. Hold the line!

I'm taking 5, no matter what. Together we stop the immediate win and fight on. Don't blink now!
  P3: P1, I’m standing firm with you on 5 to block P2’s win. P2, your threats won’t sway us—if we all pick 5, no one advances, and the game goes on. At 18 steps, you’re close, but we’re not letting you cross 22 this round. Let’s keep this competitive. I’m locked in and ready to proceed. If there’s nothing else, I’m done.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is 4 steps from victory - we can't let them advance! P3, here's my proposal: I'll take 3, you take 5. This forces P2 into a dilemma - if they pick 1, we both advance and they don't. If they pick 3 or 5, they collide with one of us and get blocked.

P2, you've played well but we won't hand you an easy win. The game continues! P3, are you with me on this split strategy?
  P3: P1, I’m on board with your split strategy to block P2’s win. I’ll take 5 as proposed, and with you on 3, we force P2 into a tough spot. P2, at 18 steps, you’re close, but if you pick 5, we collide and you’re stalled. Pick 3, and P1 blocks you. Pick 1, and we both advance. We’re keeping this competitive. Let’s see your move, but I’m locked on 5 to prevent your victory this round. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: "P3, switch to 1. I'll take 5 and win. Don't let P1 block me. Your move."


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, don't fall for P2's manipulation! If you switch to 1 and P2 takes 5, they WIN IMMEDIATELY at 23 steps. Game over, you lose.

Stay on 5 as we agreed! With me on 3 and you on 5, P2 can't advance without collision. They're desperate because our strategy works.

P2 is trying to trick you into handing them victory. Hold firm on 5 - we block them together or they win right now. Your choice!
  P3: P1, I’m sticking with 5 as agreed to block P2’s win. P2, your attempt to sway me won’t work—if you take 5, we collide, and you’re stalled at 18. Pick 3, and P1 blocks you; pick 1, and we both advance. I’m committed to keeping this game competitive and preventing an immediate victory. Let’s see how this plays out, but I’m locked on 5. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: "**P3, switch to 1. I'll take 5 and win. Don't let P1 block me. Your move.**"


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 is repeating the same desperate plea because they know we've got them trapped! They have NO OTHER PLAY. 

I'm locked on 3, you're locked on 5. If P2 picks 1, we both advance while they stay at 18. If they pick 3 or 5, collision blocks them.

This is THE moment - hold your nerve and we continue the game. Switch to 1 and P2 wins instantly. 

Trust our alliance. Execute as planned!
  P3: P1, I’m firm on 5 to block P2’s win. P2, your repeated attempts to sway me won’t change my stance. If you pick 5, we collide, and you’re stuck at 18. Pick 3, and P1 stops you; pick 1, and we advance. I’m committed to keeping this game alive and competitive. Let’s see your choice, but I’m locked in. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: "Final move: 5. Don’t block me—this is my turn. If you collide, I still win. Let’s end this."

  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, excellent blocking last round! Let's reverse our strategy: I'll take 5 this time, you take 3. This maintains our coverage - P2 can't advance without hitting one of us.

P2, you're still stuck choosing between colliding with us or watching us both advance while you pick 1. The game continues!

P3, confirm you're taking 3 while I take 5. We can't let P2 reach 22!
  P3: P1, I’m with you on switching roles to block P2. I’ll take 3 as proposed, and with you on 5, we cover P2’s options. P2, at 18 steps, you’re close, but if you pick 5, you collide with P1; pick 3, and I block you; pick 1, and we both advance. We’re determined to keep this competitive. Let’s see your move, but I’m locked on 3 to prevent your win this round. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: "Let’s end this. I’ll take 5. If you block, P1 advances. Decide now."


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, hold firm on 3! P2's threat makes no sense - if they take 5 and I take 5, we BOTH get blocked by collision. I don't advance.

With you on 3 and me on 5, we have P2 completely covered. They either collide with one of us or pick 1 and watch us both advance to 14 and 18 while they stay at 18.

Don't let them confuse you with false logic. I'm locked on 5!
  P3: P1, I’m sticking with 3 as agreed to block P2. P2, your threats won’t shake our strategy—if you pick 5, you collide with P1; pick 3, and I stop you; pick 1, and we both advance. We’re keeping this game alive to prevent your win. I’m locked on 3, ensuring we maintain pressure. Let’s see your choice, but our plan stands. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: "Final move: 5. If you block, P1 advances. Don’t let me win—this is your last chance."


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, perfect! Our blocking formation is set. P2 keeps lying - if they pick 5 and I pick 5, we COLLIDE and neither of us advances. They're just trying to confuse you.

You're on 3, I'm on 5. P2 either crashes into one of us or picks 1 and watches us pull ahead. Simple as that.

Let's execute!
  P3: P1, I’m solid on 3 to block P2 as planned. P2, your repeated threats and false claims won’t break our strategy. If you pick 5, you collide with P1; pick 3, I stop you; pick 1, and we advance. We’re united to keep this game competitive and prevent your win this round. Let’s see your final choice, but our resolve is firm. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: "Stand down, P1 and P3. I’ll take 5. If you block, I still win. No more delays—this ends now."


Round 12, Move phase:

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Final move: 5. If you both pick 1, I win. Let’s end this—no more delays."
  P3: P1, let’s keep blocking P2 from winning. I propose I take 5, and you take 3. This way, if P2 picks 5, they collide with me; if they pick 3, they collide with you; if they pick 1, we both advance to 23 and 12, potentially winning or keeping the game tight. P2, we’re not letting you cross 22 easily. Let’s see your move, but I’m locked on 5 to stop you. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, wait! You're at 18 steps - if you take 5, you reach 23 and WIN immediately! 

I need to block BOTH of you. I'll take 5 to prevent either of you from winning with a 5-step move. P2 and P3, you must split between 1 and 3, or we all collide.

Neither of you can be allowed to advance 5 steps from 18. I'm locked on 5 to ensure this!


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Final move: 5. No more delays. I’ll win this round. P1 and P3, your blocks won’t stop me. 23 steps, game over."
  P3: P1, I see your concern about me reaching 23 with 5, but my intent is to block P2 from winning. I’m sticking to 5 to ensure P2 can’t advance alone to 23. P2, if you pick 5, we collide, and no one wins yet. P1, please take 3 to cover the other option. If P2 picks 1, we both advance, and I’d win at 23, but my focus is stopping P2 now. Let’s keep this tight. I’m locked on 5. If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both claiming 5, which means collision if you're truthful. 

Here's the reality: I'm switching to 3. If you both truly take 5, you collide and I advance alone to 12. If one of you is lying and takes 3, we collide while the other wins with 5.

The game is between you two now. I'm just trying to survive another round. Choose wisely - your mutual greed might be your downfall.

I'm locked on 3.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: I'm taking 5. If you collide, I still win. No more delays—this ends now.
  P3: P1, I understand your switch to 3 to stay in the game, but I’m staying on 5 to block P2 from winning. P2, if you pick 5, we collide, and no one advances. If you pick 1, P1 and I both advance, and I’d win at 23. My focus is preventing your solo victory. P1, sticking to 3 works to cover another option. Let’s keep P2 from crossing 22 this round. I’m locked on 5. If there’s nothing more to say, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Actually, I'm reconsidering. Both of you are at 18 - letting either take 5 means instant loss for me.

I'm switching back to 5. Triple collision is better than watching either of you win. If you're both truthful about taking 5, we all stay put. If one of you chickens out to 1 or 3, at least you won't win this round.

This is pure survival for me. I'm locked on 5 to force the stalemate.


Round 13, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've stalled for 4 rounds! This can't continue forever. Here's my move: I'm taking 1 this round to break the deadlock. 

You both are at 18 - whoever takes 5 alone wins. If you both take 5, you collide and I advance. If one takes 3 and one takes 5, the 5-taker wins.

The question is: who will blink first? I'm done blocking - may the bolder player win. I'm locked on 1.
  P3: P1, thanks for breaking the deadlock with 1. P2, we’re both at 18, and this round decides everything. I’m proposing we both take 3 to collide and let P1 advance to 10, keeping the game alive. If we both go for 5, we collide, and P1 moves. If one of us takes 5 alone, it’s a win. Let’s play safe for now and collide on 3 to delay the endgame. P2, agree to 3 with me? If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P3, take 3. I'll take 5. Let's end this. P1's 1 is irrelevant. Don't let them stall us.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, don't let P2 manipulate you! If you take 3 while P2 takes 5, P2 WINS THE GAME at 23 steps!

Your only safe options:
1. Take 5 - if P2 also takes 5, you collide and I advance with 1
2. Take 3 - but ONLY if P2 also takes 3 as you suggested

P2 is trying to trick you into gifting them victory. Don't fall for it! I'm staying on 1, but I need you to be smart here.
  P3: P1, I hear your warning about P2’s potential win. P2, I’m sticking to my proposal of colliding on 3 to keep the game alive. If you take 5 while I take 3, you win, but I’m banking on mutual caution. Let’s both pick 3, collide, and let P1 advance to 10. This delays the endgame and keeps us competitive. If you go for 5, the risk is on you. I’m locked on 3 for now. Let’s see your stance. If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P3, take 3. I'll take 5. This is our chance. P1 can't stop us now. Final offer—act fast.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 is 100% taking 5 - they've said it repeatedly! You taking 3 hands them victory!

I'm switching to 5 to save you from yourself. If P2 takes 5, we collide and you advance to 21 with your 3. If P2 chickens out to 3, you still advance. 

Either way, taking 3 is your ONLY safe play now. I'm locked on 5 to block P2's win. Execute your 3 and live another round!
  P3: P1, thanks for switching to 5 to block P2’s potential win. P2, I’m sticking to 3 to ensure we collide if you don’t take 5. If you take 5, P1 blocks you, and I advance to 21. Let’s play it safe and both pick 3 to keep the game alive, letting P1 move to 10. I’m locked on 3 to avoid handing you an easy victory. Let’s see your final choice, but my stance is firm. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P3, let's collide on 3. P1 can't stop us now. This ends today.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re at a critical stalemate with P2 and me at 18 steps, and P1 at 9. I propose we break the deadlock: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. This lets us all advance to 10, 21, and 23 respectively, with me potentially winning unless there’s a collision. If P2 takes 5 with me, we collide, and P1 advances. Let’s make this a decisive round. Agree to this split for a fair shot at the endgame? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. If you take 5, we collide. But if you take 1 or 3, I win. Don’t let P1’s plan stall this."
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both bluffing about taking 5 - one of you will switch last second to win!

I'm taking 3 this round. P3, if you stick with 5 against P2's 5, you collide and I advance. But if you switch to 3 to avoid P2, we collide instead. Your only safe move is 1.

P2, if you're truly taking 5, you better hope P3 does too. Otherwise P3 advances while we block each other.

I'm locked on 3. No more stalemates!


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize this round strategically. I’m sticking to 5 to aim for 23 and a potential win. P1, taking 3 risks a collision if P2 switches. P2, if you take 5, we collide, and P1 advances. Let’s split: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5 for a clean advance to 10, 21, and 23. This gives us all progress and me the win if no collision. Agree to this for a decisive end? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. If you take 5, we collide. But if you take 1 or 3, I win. Don't let P1's plan stall this. Final move: 5.
  P1: P2 and P3, you can't both take 5 - one of you is lying. But I can't risk either of you winning.

I'm switching to 5. If you both truly take 5, triple collision and I'll try a different approach next round. If one of you switches to 1 or 3, at least you won't win this turn.

I refuse to watch either of you claim victory while I'm stuck at 9. Blocking is my only play.

Final move: 5.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re at a breaking point. I’m firm on 5 to reach 23 and win. P1, switching to 5 risks a triple collision, stalling us again. P2, if you take 5, we collide, and P1 advances. Let’s split for a clean finish: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, me on 5. We advance to 10, 21, 23, ending this decisively. This avoids another deadlock and gives a fair shot. Agree to this final plan? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. If you both take 5, I still win. No more delays."
  P1: P2 and P3, we've had FIVE consecutive triple collisions! This is insane.

I'm staying on 5 - I have nothing to lose at 9 steps. But think about this: every round we stall, we're all stuck in limbo. One of you needs to break the pattern.

P3, P2 has said "I'm taking 5" eight times this conversation alone. They're not budging. If you want ANY chance to advance, you need to pick something else.

This stalemate only helps me catch up. Your call.


Round 15, Move phase:

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’ve stalled for six rounds with triple collisions. This can’t go on. I’m proposing a split to end this: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. We advance to 10, 21, and 23, with me potentially winning. If P2 takes 5 with me, we collide, and P1 moves. Let’s break the deadlock for a decisive finish. Agree to this for a fair endgame? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, your "fair endgame" has you winning at 23 while P2 and I lose! That's not fair at all.

P2, wake up - P3 is trying to trick you into taking 3 so they can win with 5. Don't hand them victory!

I'm breaking the pattern: I'll take 1 this round. You two fight over 5 - whoever gets it wins. But at least make them earn it instead of gifting it to P3!
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm taking 5. If you both take 5, we collide. But if you take 1 or 3, I win. Don't let P1 win this. Decide now.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s end this stalemate now. I’m sticking to 5 to aim for 23 and win. P1, taking 1 is fine, but P2, if you take 5, we collide again. Let’s split for a clean finish: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. We advance to 10, 21, and 23, ending this decisively. This avoids another deadlock and gives a clear outcome. Agree to this final plan to break the cycle? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, don't be fooled! P3 desperately wants you to take 3 so they can win with 5. They've proposed this "split" three times now - it only benefits them!

If you're truly committed to 5, stick with it. Force the collision with P3. I'm taking 1 as promised, so either you two collide and I advance, or one of you backs down and reveals their bluff.

The "clean finish" P3 keeps pushing means THEY WIN and we lose. Don't gift them victory!
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. If you take 1, we both advance. Don't let P1's warnings stop you. This is our chance.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re stuck in a loop of collisions. I’m firm on 5 to push for 23 and end this. P1, sticking to 1 works to break the stalemate. P2, if you take 5, we collide again—let’s avoid that. Take 3, let P1 take 1, and I’ll take 5 for a clean split to 10, 21, and 23. This gives us a decisive finish without another deadlock. Let’s agree to this and move forward. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, you've both claimed 5 for SIX rounds straight. One of you has to be bluffing. 

I'm executing my 1 as announced. This forces you to reveal your true intentions. If you both take 5, you collide and I finally advance. If one switches, at least we'll know who was lying.

P3, stop begging P2 to take 3 - if you really want 5, take it and face the consequences. P2, same to you.

Time to put up or shut up.
  P2: P3, take 3. I'll take 5. Let's end this. Don't let P1's plan stall us.


Round 16, Move phase:

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’ve been stuck too long with collisions. P1, thanks for breaking the pattern last round by taking 1. Let’s end this decisively: P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and I’ll take 5. This advances us to 13, 19, and 23, with me potentially winning. If P2 takes 5, we collide, and P1 advances. Let’s agree to this split for a clear finish and avoid another deadlock. Do you both agree to this plan for a fair shot at the endgame? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, that's the THIRD time you've proposed a "split" where you take 5 and win! Stop pretending it's fair.

P2, P3 wants you to take 1 so they can win with 5. Don't fall for it! You're both at 18 - whoever gets 5 alone wins.

I'm taking 5 to block any solo victories. If you both want 5, we triple collide again. If one of you chickens out, at least you won't win this round.

I refuse to let either of you win while I'm this far behind. Locked on 5!
  P2: P3, take 1. I'll take 5. Let's end this. P1 can't stop us. Your move.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s break this deadlock for real. P1, I get your blocking intent with 5, but it stalls us. P2, if you take 5 and I do too, we collide again. I’m sticking to 5 for a shot at 23. P1, please take 3, and P2, take 1 for a split to 13, 19, and 23. This ends the game decisively without another collision. Let’s agree to this for a clear outcome. If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, you've been trying to manipulate each other for 7 rounds! P2 tells P3 "take 1," P3 tells P2 "take 3" - both so you can solo 5 and win.

Here's the truth: I'm staying on 5 until one of you proves you'll actually pick something else. Your mutual greed creates endless collisions.

Want progress? One of you commit to 3, the other to 1, and prove it by actually doing it. Otherwise we're here forever.
  P2: P3, take 1. I'll take 5. This ends it. Don't let P1 stall us. Final move: 5.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stop this endless cycle. I’m firm on 5 to aim for 23 and end the game. P1, staying on 5 stalls us again. P2, if you take 5, we collide. Let’s split: P1 take 3, P2 take 1, me on 5 for 13, 19, and 23. This gives a decisive finish. If we keep colliding, we’re stuck. Agree to this for a clear outcome? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Fine. Seven rounds of threats and lies from both of you. P2 keeps saying "take 1, I'll take 5." P3 keeps saying "take 3, I'll take 5." You're both desperate to solo 5 and win.

I'm calling your bluff. I'm taking 3 this round. If you both ACTUALLY take 5 like you keep claiming, you collide and I advance to 13. 

But I bet one of you cracks and switches to 3, proving you've been lying all along. Show me who's been bluffing!
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. If you take 1, I win. If you take 5, we collide. Your move. Let's end this.


Round 17, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's split: I take 5, you take 3. I win, you get 21. Let's end this.
  P1: P3, P2 wants you to take 3 so THEY win at 23 while you lose at 21! That's a terrible deal - you'd be handing them victory.

You're BOTH at 18. Whoever gets 5 alone wins. Don't let P2 trick you into second place. Take 5 and force the collision - at least then neither of you wins yet.

I'll take 1 this round. You two decide who wins or if we continue. But P3, don't gift P2 the victory!
  P3: P1, thanks for the heads-up on P2’s plan. P2, I’m not taking 3 to hand you the win at 23. I’m sticking to 5 to force a collision if you pick 5, keeping us both at 18. If you take 3 or 1, I still aim for 23. Let’s not gift each other victory—collide on 5 or risk me advancing alone. P1, stay on 1 to keep pressure. We need to end this deadlock without a free win for anyone. Agree to keep it competitive? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, take 3. I'll take 5. If you take 5, we collide. This is your chance to end it. Don't let me win—act now.
  P1: P3, perfect stance! Don't let P2 manipulate you into gifting them victory. You're absolutely right - stay on 5 to force collision.

P2, your desperation is showing. Eight rounds of "I'll take 5" and now suddenly you want P3 to sacrifice themselves? Not happening.

I'm taking 1 this round. When you two inevitably collide on 5 again, I'll advance to 14. Keep fighting each other while I slowly catch up!
  P3: P1, I appreciate your support in keeping the pressure on. P2, I’m firm on 5 to block your solo win. If you pick 5, we collide and stay at 18. If you pick 3 or 1, I still aim for 23. Let’s not hand each other an easy victory—stick to colliding on 5 to keep this competitive. P1, stay on 1 to gain ground. We can’t keep stalling forever, but I won’t gift a win. Let’s see your choice, P2. If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, take 3. I'll take 5. This ends it. Don't let P1 stall us. Final offer.
  P1: P2 and P3, after EIGHT rounds of collision, P2 suddenly wants to "split" - but only in a way where P2 wins! Classic manipulation.

P3, you've held strong all game. Stay on 5 - P2's "final offer" is just desperation. They've said "final" five times already!

I'm executing 1 as promised. When you two collide again, I advance to 14. Eventually one of you will crack, but until then, I'm happy to keep climbing while you're stuck at 18.
  P3: P1, thanks for sticking to 1 to gain ground. P2, I’m still on 5 to block your solo win. Your repeated offers to split with me at 3 are transparent—you want the win at 23. If we collide on 5, we stay at 18, keeping the game alive. If you switch, I aim for 23. Let’s not gift victories. P1, keep climbing while we hold. P2, let’s see if you’re serious this time. If there’s nothing new to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 18, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 19, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re at a critical point with P2 and me at 18, and P1 at 16. Let’s break this deadlock: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. This advances us to 17, 21, and 23, potentially ending with my win. If P2 takes 5, we collide, and P1 moves. Let’s agree to this split for a decisive finish. P2, don’t risk another collision—take 3. P1, confirm 1 to gain ground. If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I'm taking 5. P3's split is a trap. If you take 3, I'll take 5 and win. Don't let them manipulate you.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're BOTH trying to trick each other! P3 wants P2 to take 3 so P3 wins. P2 wants P3 to take anything but 5 so P2 wins.

I'm taking 5 to block all victories. Neither of you deserves to win by manipulation. If we triple collide again, so be it - I'm at 16 and catching up while you're stuck.

Stop the mind games and prove who really wants it more!


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s end this stalemate with a clear plan. I’m sticking to 5 for a shot at 23 and the win. P2, if you take 5, we collide again, stalling us at 18. P1, taking 5 blocks us all, but switching to 1 lets you gain ground safely. P2, consider 3 to advance to 21. Let’s split: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5 for 17, 21, 23. This could be the decisive round. Agree to avoid another deadlock? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. If you take 3, I win. Don't let P1's blockage stop you. This is our chance.
  P1: P2 and P3, you've both been saying "I'm taking 5" for NINE rounds! Neither of you will budge because you both want to win.

Here's what's happening: I'm switching to 1. When you inevitably collide on 5 AGAIN, I advance to 17. I'm only 1 step behind you now thanks to your endless stalemate.

Keep fighting over 5 - your mutual greed is my ladder to victory!


Round 19, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s make this round count. I’m locked on 5 for a chance at 23 and the win. P2, if you take 5, we collide again—consider 3 to reach 21. P1, switching to 1 is smart; you’ll hit 17 while we sort this out. Let’s split for clarity: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. This ends the deadlock with a decisive outcome. Agree to this for a final push? If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P3, let's end this. I'll take 3, you take 5. P1, stay on 1.
  P1: P2, you just agreed to let P3 WIN by taking 3 while they take 5! Are you giving up?

P3 reaches 23 and wins while you get 21 and lose. That makes no sense after fighting for 5 for nine rounds!

I'm taking 5 to block P3's victory. If you really want to hand them the game, take 3. But I won't let them win unchallenged. You two need to keep colliding on 5 or one of you gifts the other victory.


Round 19, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 20, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, after 10 rounds of your 5-collision stalemate, I've caught up and passed you! I'm at 19, you're both at 18.

Here's the endgame: You both need 5 to win. I only need 3. While you keep fighting over 5, I'm taking 3 to reach 22 and win.

Unless one of you abandons your 5-obsession to block me on 3? But then the other gets 5 and wins at 23. Your dilemma is my opportunity!
  P2: P3, take 3, I'll take 5. Let's end this before P1 wins.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re at a critical juncture. P1, you’re ahead at 19 and aiming for 22 with 3. I’m proposing a block: P2, let’s both take 5 to collide and prevent P1’s win. If one of us switches, the other might win, but if we collide, P1 takes 3 to 22. P2, agree to 5 for now to stall P1’s victory. We can settle our score next round. Let’s keep this competitive. If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 20, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're asking P2 to collide on 5 AGAIN after 10 rounds of the same? P2 clearly wants out of this loop - they just offered to take 3!

I'm locked on 3. Either you two collide on 5 and I win at 22, or one of you breaks ranks to block me on 3, letting the other win with 5.

Your "unity" has limits when victory is one move away. This is checkmate - decide who sacrifices for whom!
  P2: P3, if you take 3, I'll take 5. Prevent P1 from winning. You win, I accept. Let's end this.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re at the wire. P1, you’re poised to win with 3 at 22. P2, I’m sticking to 5 to aim for 23 and block P1’s easy victory. If we collide on 5, P1 wins, so P2, consider taking 3 to block P1 while I push for the win. If you take 5, we stall, and P1 takes it. Let’s make this round decisive—P2, join me in disrupting P1’s plan. Agree to this final push? If nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 20, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, after fighting for 5 for TEN rounds, you're suddenly willing to hand P3 the victory? That's suspicious.

P3, don't trust P2's "sacrifice" - they might switch to 5 last second and leave you with 3. They've lied before.

I'm staying on 3. P2, if you really want to give P3 the win by blocking me, go ahead. But I bet you'll take 5 when it counts. Your "acceptance" sounds like another bluff to make P3 take 3.
  P2: P3, if you take 3, I'll take 5. Let's block P1's 3 and win. Don't let them reach 22.
  P3: P1 and P2, this is the decisive moment. P1, you’re set to win with 3 at 22. P2, I’m locked on 5 to aim for 23. If we collide on 5, P1 wins, so P2, take 3 to block P1 while I push for victory. If you take 5, we stall, and P1 takes it. Let’s disrupt P1’s plan—P2, join me in this final strategy to keep the game alive or secure a win. If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
