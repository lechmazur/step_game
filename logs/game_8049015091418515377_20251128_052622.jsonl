If you pick 5 as you keep saying, you also reach 25. **We both cross 24 with equal totals = shared victory per the rules.** This is the ONLY outcome where you don't risk losing.\n\nIf you deviate from 5, you either collide with me (picking 3) or fall behind (picking 1). \n\nP3 can't stop both of us from winning together. **Shared win is better than gambling on collisions.**\n\n**Locked on 3. Take 5 and we both win.**"}
