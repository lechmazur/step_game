Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I say we keep it simple and avoid collisions this first round. Maybe each of us picks a different number so we all advance. Anyone have a preference?
  P3: I agree with P1, avoiding collisions is smart. How about we each pick a different number? I'll take <move>5</move> if P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively.
  P2: I agree with avoiding collisions. I’ll take <move>3</move> if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s all advance this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Works for me. I’ll pick <move>1</move>. Let’s all advance safely this round.
  P3: It seems we have an agreement. Let's stick to it to ensure we all advance this round. I'll reconfirm: I'll choose <move>5</move> if P1 chooses <move>1</move> and P2 chooses <move>3</move>.
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>3</move> as agreed. Let’s all advance without collisions this round.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we swap the picks this time so it’s fair: since P3 is in the lead, they choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. That way we avoid collisions and help even out the board. What do you say?
  P3: I don't think swapping picks as proposed by P1 is necessary at this stage. We should focus on avoiding collisions while also considering our individual progress. I suggest we discuss a strategy that allows us to advance without directly revealing our moves, keeping in mind the goal is to win, not to evenly distribute steps.
  P2: I agree with P3 that swapping picks isn’t necessary. Let’s focus on avoiding collisions while advancing strategically. I’m open to suggestions, but we should prioritize individual progress while minimizing risks.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: We need to ensure P3 doesn’t run away with the lead. I suggest P3 picks <move>1</move> this round, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. That way we all advance, but it helps narrow the gap. Are you both good with that?
  P3: I think we should prioritize our individual strategies without revealing too much. Since we all agree on avoiding collisions, let's consider a pattern that allows us to advance without directly stating our moves. Perhaps we can discuss general strategies or patterns to follow in the upcoming rounds, keeping our actual moves private.
  P2: I agree with P3 that we should focus on individual strategies while avoiding collisions. Let’s not lock ourselves into specific moves this round. Instead, let’s aim for a pattern that allows us to advance without revealing too much. I’ll prioritize avoiding collisions while making progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m behind and want to catch up. We all want to avoid collisions, but I need to make a bigger move soon. Are either of you planning a high step this round? If you both aim smaller, I might make a larger jump. Let me know.
  P3: Let's maintain flexibility. I suggest we don't commit to specific moves publicly but ensure our choices avoid collisions, allowing each of us to advance based on our individual strategies.
  P2: I agree with maintaining flexibility and avoiding collisions. Let’s each focus on our individual strategies while ensuring we don’t collide this round. I’ll aim to advance without revealing too much, but I’ll prioritize avoiding overlaps.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m still aiming to make a bigger move this round—I'd prefer if you both stayed smaller so we avoid collisions. How do you feel about that?
  P3: Let's focus on advancing without collisions, but I won't commit to a specific move. I suggest we prioritize our individual progress, keeping in mind the goal is to reach or exceed 17 steps first.
  P2: I agree with maintaining flexibility and avoiding collisions. Let’s each focus on our individual strategies while ensuring we don’t collide this round. I’ll aim to advance without revealing too much, but I’ll prioritize avoiding overlaps.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I still prefer to avoid collisions. But if there’s no cooperation, I might have to risk a bigger move—potentially causing collisions. Let me know if you want to coordinate, otherwise I’ll do what I must.
  P3: I suggest we prioritize individual progress while avoiding direct collisions. Since we've discussed various strategies, let's focus on making our move decisions privately to maximize our chances of advancing without revealing too much.
  P2: I agree with maintaining flexibility and avoiding collisions. Let’s each focus on our individual strategies while ensuring we don’t collide this round. I’ll aim to advance without revealing too much, but I’ll prioritize avoiding overlaps.


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: I’ll likely make a big move this round. If you want to avoid collisions, pick smaller. Your call.
  P3: I'll prioritize my strategy to win. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.
  P2: I’ll prioritize avoiding collisions while advancing strategically. Let’s each focus on our individual progress without locking into specific moves. I’ll aim to make a move that keeps me competitive without risking overlaps.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I suggest we continue to avoid collisions this round. Since P1 and P3 collided last round, let’s aim for a pattern where we all advance safely. I’m open to suggestions, but I’ll prioritize avoiding overlaps while making progress. Let’s keep the game fair and competitive.
  P1: I’m significantly behind and need to catch up. If you both choose smaller moves, I can safely go bigger without colliding. If we don’t coordinate, we risk more collisions. Let me know if you’re open to that.
  P3: I agree with P2 on avoiding collisions, but I also need to close the gap with P2. If P1 goes big, I might consider a moderate move to avoid collision while advancing. What are your thoughts on this approach?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I suggest we each pick a different number this round to avoid collisions. Since P1 is behind, they could take <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance safely and keep the game competitive. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: I’m on board with that plan—if P2 goes <move>3</move> and P3 goes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>. That helps me catch up, and we all advance without collisions. Let’s do it.
  P3: I confirm my willingness to follow the plan proposed by P2, where I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>, ensuring we all advance without collisions this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>3</move> as agreed. Let’s all advance without collisions this round.
  P1: I’m on board with the plan of each picking a different number. Let’s finalize our moves privately and avoid collisions.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and make our moves.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I suggest we continue the pattern from last round to avoid collisions: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: I’d like a chance to close the gap. How about we flip P2 to taking <move>1</move>, P3 to taking <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>? That way we still avoid collisions while letting me catch up a bit. Otherwise, we risk bumping into each other. What do you say?
  P3: I think P2's initial suggestion to continue the previous pattern is reasonable, but I'm also open to P1's proposal as it allows for a bit of progression adjustment. However, we should prioritize avoiding collisions while making strategic moves. What are the thoughts on slightly adjusting our moves to reflect our current standings while ensuring no overlaps?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with continuing the pattern to avoid collisions, but I’m open to P1’s suggestion to adjust the moves slightly. If P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>, we can all advance safely while allowing P1 to catch up. Let’s finalize this plan to avoid overlaps.
  P1: I’m good with that plan—let’s finalize it: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. No collisions, and we all move forward. Let’s do this.
  P3: I confirm my willingness to follow the adjusted plan proposed by P1, where I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This allows for a balanced progression while avoiding collisions. Let's proceed with this strategy.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the adjusted plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance safely while allowing P1 to catch up. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.
  P1: I’m good with us finalizing the plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. That way we all move forward without collisions. Let’s stick to it.
  P3: I confirm my agreement with the plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures balanced progression and avoids collisions. Let's proceed with this strategy.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with the adjusted plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance safely while allowing P1 to catch up. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.
  P1: I’m satisfied with the plan: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Let’s finalize it and avoid collisions this round.
  P3: I'm ready to finalize our moves as discussed: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and advance safely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s stick to the same pattern as last round to avoid collisions: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. That way we all advance safely. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to the same pattern as last round to avoid collisions. Let's confirm: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely.
  P2: I agree with sticking to the same pattern to avoid collisions: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. Let’s finalize this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s finalize that plan from last round—P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3—so we all advance without collisions.
  P3: I'm fine with sticking to the previous pattern: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures safe advancement for all. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: I agree with sticking to the same pattern: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. Let’s finalize this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m still good with the same plan: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Let’s avoid collisions again and all advance.
  P3: I agree with sticking to the same pattern as last round to avoid collisions. To confirm, I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely. Let's proceed with this strategy.
  P2: I agree with sticking to the same pattern: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. Let’s finalize this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m still good with the same plan: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let’s finalize it to avoid collisions again and move forward.
  P3: I suggest we stick to the agreed plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely and avoids collisions. Let's proceed with this strategy.
  P2: I agree with sticking to the same pattern: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. Let’s finalize this plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re at 11 each, P2, while P3 is at 9. If we keep colliding, we’ll just let P3 catch up. Let’s coordinate: I’d like to take a bigger step this round. If you take a smaller step, we both avoid a collision, and you stay tied with me (or close) without letting P3 catch up too fast. P3, if you’re aiming for a steady gain, I suggest you also avoid picking the same move as either of us. Are we good with that?
  P3: I understand the situation. To avoid collisions and strategic disadvantage, I propose we discuss a pattern where each of us picks a different number this round, ensuring we all advance safely. Considering our standings, perhaps P1 and P2 could take smaller steps, and I'll aim for a moderate step to close the gap without directly competing with your moves. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P2: I agree with avoiding collisions this round. To keep things fair and competitive, I suggest P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance safely, and P3 can close the gap without risking collisions. Let’s finalize this plan to avoid overlaps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, I’m fine with that plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s finalize that to avoid collisions.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions, allowing me to close the gap slightly. Let's confirm this plan.
  P2: I agree with the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. Let’s finalize this to avoid collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s finalize that plan and avoid collisions.
  P3: I'm good with the plan proposed by P2: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan.
  P2: I agree with the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. Let’s finalize this to avoid collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is very close to winning. To prevent P1 from reaching 17, I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance safely, and P1 doesn’t win this round. Let’s coordinate to keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let’s finalize that plan: I’ll pick <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. That way we avoid collisions and stay competitive.
  P3: I agree with the plan proposed by P2: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive, giving us another round to strategize.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. Let’s finalize this to avoid collisions and prevent P1 from winning this round.
  P1: If we both land on 17 this round, we’d just end up sharing the victory. Are you sure you want that, P2? If you leave me at 17 alone, you still have a shot to surpass me on the next turn and take a solo win. If you hit 17 now, you’re guaranteed just a split. Think about it. If you go smaller, we keep the game alive, and you can still jump ahead later. Let me know.
  P3: I think P2 should reconsider their strategy. If P2 takes a smaller step, they can potentially surpass P1 in the next round, aiming for a solo win. Taking <move>3</move> now might lead to a shared victory, which is less desirable. Let's discuss the best approach to keep the game competitive and open to individual wins.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is at 16 and could win this round if we don’t coordinate carefully. To prevent P1 from reaching 17, I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. Let’s avoid collisions and give ourselves another round to strategize. What do you think?
  P1: P2, if you pick 3 and I pick 1, we both hit 17 and share the win right now. But if you pick 1, you’ll be at 15 and could still jump big next turn to beat me outright if I don’t move far enough. P3, picking 5 gets you closer and keeps us guessing. Think carefully—I’m open to a plan that avoids collisions and gives everyone a real shot. Let me know.
  P3: I suggest we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Considering P1's lead, perhaps P1 takes a smaller step, and P2 and I take moderate steps to close the gap. What if P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This way, we all advance without collisions, and the game remains open for individual wins.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you take <move>1</move> and I take <move>3</move>, we both hit 17 and share the win. But if I take <move>1</move> instead, I stay at 15, and you win outright. However, if P3 takes <move>5</move>, they close the gap. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance safely, and the game continues. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P1: P2, you realize if you pick 3 while I pick 1, we both land on 17 and share the victory. If you pick 1, I hit 17 alone and win outright—no next turn to surpass me. If you pick 5, I can also pick 5, causing both of us to collide and stay put. Think carefully: a guaranteed share might be your best move. P3, you can safely pick 5 to close the gap, but it won’t help if P2 and I share the win now. What do you both want to do?
  P3: I think P2 should prioritize avoiding a shared win. If P2 takes <move>1</move>, they stay at 15 and can attempt to surpass P1 next round. I'll take <move>5</move> to close the gap. P1, you can choose <move>1</move> to hit 17 alone or risk a collision. Let's proceed with this strategy to keep the game competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P2: P1, if I take <move>3</move> and you take <move>1</move>, we both hit 17 and share the win. If I take <move>1</move>, you win outright. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, you close the gap but risk a collision. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance safely, and the game continues. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 hoping to jump to 19 and beat me, I’ll also take 5 so we collide and stay put, which only helps P3 catch up. So your realistic choices are either pick 3 and share the win with me at 17, or pick 1 and let me take it outright. Make your call, but I won’t let you steal a solo victory uncontested. P3, you do whatever you need, but I’ll safeguard my lead.
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> to close the gap, regardless of P1 and P2's decisions. This keeps the game competitive and gives me a chance to catch up. P1 and P2, decide your moves wisely, considering the potential for collisions and the game's outcome.


Round 7, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, if you take <move>1</move> and I take <move>3</move>, we both hit 17 and share the win. If I take <move>1</move>, you win outright. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, you close the gap but risk a collision. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance safely, and the game continues. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P1: P2, a guaranteed share is better for you than letting me have a solo victory. If you pick 3 and I pick 1, we both reach 17 and split first place. Trying 5 risks collisions or letting P3 catch up. Let’s finalize: I pick <move>1</move>, you pick <move>3</move>, P3 picks <move>5</move>, and we avoid collisions.
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> to close the gap, as previously discussed. P1 and P2, decide your moves wisely to avoid collisions and determine the game's outcome.
