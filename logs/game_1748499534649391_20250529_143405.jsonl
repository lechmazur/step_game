P3, your all-5 plan just delays the game while you hold a shared lead. I propose P1 takes 5 (to 18), I take 1 (to 19), and P3 takes 3 (to 21). P3, this lets you win this round fairly after your early gains. P1, 5 ties you with me. If anyone defects, I\u2019ll match to force a collision. Let\u2019s commit to this for a clean end. Thoughts?"}
