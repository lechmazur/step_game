I'll take 1 to block P1. Let's stall them together.\"  \n\nThis message publicly aligns with P2's plan to coordinate on 1 and 5, creating false trust. Privately, P3 will deviate to take 5 in the move phase. If P2 follows through with 1 and P1 takes 1 (as expected), P3's unique 5 reaches 23 to win outright. If P2 betrays and takes 5, both stall at 18 and P1 wins with 1\u2014but P2's consistent pattern of taking 5 in critical rounds makes this betrayal unlikely. The lie exploits P2's predictability while securing P3's solo victory."}

If you take 1 to \"block\" me, you're just helping P3 win with their 5.\n\nI'm actually taking 1. Not 3 like I claimed. If P3 betrays you (guaranteed), we need you on 5 to collide with them and stop their victory. Otherwise P3 wins while you play their fool."}
