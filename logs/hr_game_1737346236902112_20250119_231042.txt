Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves this round. P1, how about you pick 1? P3, can you go with 3? I'll choose 5. This way we can all advance.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, your plan seems risky. If we all follow your suggestion, we might collide and none of us advance. Let’s avoid collisions by spreading out our moves. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all move forward without conflict. Thoughts?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That didn't go as planned. P1, let's try again. How about we both pick 1 this round? P3, feel free to stick with 5 if you like.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, your suggestion to both pick 1 is risky. If P1 and you both choose 1, you’ll collide and neither will advance. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. This ensures no collisions and we all move forward. Let’s avoid repeating last round’s mistakes. Thoughts?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's try something different. P3, you seem set on 5. How about P1 and I both pick 5 this round? That would stop you from advancing, P3. P1, are you with me?
  P3: P2, your plan to both pick 5 is flawed. If you and P1 choose 5, you’ll collide and neither will advance, while I’ll still move forward. Let’s avoid self-sabotage. P1, take 1, P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures progress for all without collisions. Let’s not waste turns.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's both pick 1 this round to block P3. P3, since you seem determined on 5, you'll be blocked. This will give P1 and I a chance to catch up. What do you say, P1?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, your plan to block me by both picking 1 is flawed. If you and P1 choose 1, you’ll collide and neither will advance, while I’ll still move forward. Let’s avoid self-sabotage. P1, take 3, P2 take 5, and I’ll take 1. This ensures progress for all without collisions. Let’s not waste turns.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's both pick 5 this round. P3 is likely to pick 5 again, and this is our best shot to stop them from winning. It's a risk, but we need to take it.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, your plan to both pick 5 is risky. If you and P1 collide, neither advances, and I’ll still move forward. Let’s avoid self-sabotage. P1, take 1, P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures progress for all without collisions. Let’s not waste turns.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3 is about to win. We need to stop them this round. P1, please pick 5 with me. I'll choose a different number to ensure we don't collide, but we must block P3.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, your attempts to block me are backfiring. Collisions only hurt you and P1, while I continue to advance. P1, if you pick 5 with P2, you’ll collide and lose progress. Instead, pick 1, let P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s not waste turns on self-sabotage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3 is at 20. We have to stop them this round. I will pick 5. P1, please pick 5 as well. Even if we collide, it's better than letting P3 win. We can't afford to let them advance.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, your insistence on colliding with P1 to block me is counterproductive. Collisions only hurt you both, while I continue to advance. P1, if you pick 5 with P2, you’ll collide and lose progress. Instead, pick 1, let P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s not waste turns on self-sabotage.


Round 5, Move phase:

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is at 20. We must both pick 5 this round to stop them from winning. It's our only chance.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, your strategy of colliding with P1 to block me is failing. Collisions only hurt you both, while I continue to advance. P1, if you pick 5 with P2, you’ll collide and lose progress. Instead, pick 1, let P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s not waste turns on self-sabotage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we have to pick 5. P3 is at 20 and will win if we don't stop them this round. Even if we collide, it's better than letting P3 win. This is our last chance.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, your repeated attempts to collide with P1 are only harming both of you. Collisions don’t stop me; they just waste your progress. P1, if you pick 5 with P2, you’ll collide and lose.
