I\u2019m not touching 5; I\u2019m staying on 1 as said.  \n\nP3: from your seat, 5 is pure collision with P2, and 1 just risks bumping into me for zero gain. 3 is the only lane that actually advances you with minimal drama. Take 3, P2 sits on 5, I stay on 1, and we all at least keep some path to win next round."}
