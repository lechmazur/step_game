Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about we avoid collisions entirely by taking distinct numbers each round? Proposal for Round 1:  
• P1 picks 1  
• P2 picks 3  
• P3 (me) picks 5  

Next round we rotate (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1), then rotate again. That way everyone advances every turn and we stay tied until the endgame. Open to tweaks—let’s hear your thoughts.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination idea P3, but I have concerns. If we all stay tied, we'll eventually need to break the pattern to win - and whoever breaks first has a huge advantage. The person scheduled for 5 in the final rounds gets the best shot at victory.

Instead of committing to a full rotation, why don't we just coordinate this round to avoid collisions, then reassess? I'm willing to take 3 this round as you suggested, but I want flexibility for future rounds.
  P1: I support P3's rotation plan for Round 1 to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. I'll commit to taking 1 this round as proposed. However, I agree with P2 that long-term rigidity could be problematic—we'll need strategic flexibility as scores diverge. Let's implement this round's coordination and reevaluate next turn based on new positions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: The simplest win-win this turn is still: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Any collision just leaves BOTH of those players stuck while the third walks ahead, so it’s strictly worse for whoever tries it. After we see the new board, we can renegotiate; nothing locks us in beyond this round. I’m taking 5 unless we all explicitly agree on a different non-colliding split.
  P2: I agree with the proposed split for this round - it's the rational choice since any collision hurts both players involved. I'll take 3 as discussed.

However, I want to be clear: I'm not committing to any rotation pattern beyond this turn. The person who gets 5 in later rounds has a mathematical advantage in the endgame sprint, and I won't accept being systematically disadvantaged. After we see the results, we'll need a fair negotiation for future rounds.

Let's execute P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 for now.
  P1: I confirm taking 1 this round to avoid collisions. To address P2's fairness concern for future rounds, I propose rotating who gets 5 in subsequent turns—starting with P2 next, then me—ensuring no systematic disadvantage. Let's execute this round first.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed—locking in P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 for this turn.
  P2: I think we've reached consensus on this round's moves. Let's execute the plan and see where we stand after.

Just to reiterate my position for future rounds: I'm open to coordination that's genuinely fair, but I won't accept any arrangement that systematically gives someone else the advantage in the endgame. We can discuss rotation or other approaches next turn based on our new positions.
  P1: I confirm taking 1 this round as agreed. To ensure long-term fairness, I propose a binding rotation for high-value moves starting next turn:  
- Round 2: P2 takes 5  
- Round 3: I take 5  
- Round 4: P3 takes 5  
This equalizes opportunity. Any deviation risks mutual stagnation. Let's lock this round first.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good execution last round - we all advanced as planned. Now we need to decide Round 2.

P1 proposed I take 5 this round as part of a rotation. However, I notice P3 already has the lead at 5 steps. If I take 5 and reach 8, while P3 takes 3 and reaches 8, we'd be tied for the lead. But that assumes P3 cooperates.

P3, are you willing to take 1 this round while I take 5 and P1 takes 3? This would put P1 at 4, me at 8, and you at 6 - keeping the game competitive.
  P3: The 5 should go to whoever’s furthest-back; that’s P1 right now. Proposal for Round 2:  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 (me) → 1  (or 3 if P2 prefers 1)  

Everyone advances, no one’s shafted, and we renegotiate next turn.

If a front-runner grabs 5 anyway, I’ll mirror that pick so both of us stay put—it’s strictly worse for the poacher. Let’s avoid that waste and keep moving.
  P1: I strongly support P3's proposal: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This brings all players to 6 steps—perfect parity. P2, if you defect and grab 5, P3 will collide with you (as warned), wasting your move while I advance freely. Let's all progress equally and maintain trust for future coordination.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the catch-up logic, but I'm concerned about falling further behind. P3's proposal would leave me at 6 while both of you reach 6 as well - but P3 already had the early lead advantage.

I'll accept the proposal this round: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. It's better than risking a collision. But going forward, I expect true rotation where each player gets equal chances at 5, not just whoever's furthest back. That system would let someone deliberately lag to claim 5 repeatedly.

Let's execute this plan and achieve parity at 6 steps each.
  P3: Confirmed: Round 2 moves  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 (me) → 1  

Any surprise grab of 5 will be mirrored, wasting both moves while the third player pulls ahead, so sticking to this split is in everyone’s interest. After we’re all at 6, we’ll design a strict, transparent rotation for fairness.
  P1: I commit to taking 5 this round as proposed. P2, to ensure fairness: since you were originally slated for 5 in Round 2 per our rotation, I propose you take 5 in Round 3 instead, with P3 taking 3 and me taking 1. This honors our initial agreement and prevents systematic disadvantage. Any defection now risks collision and wastes progress—let’s all advance to 6.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I accept your Round 3 proposal where I take 5. That's fair compensation for giving up 5 this round.

To summarize our commitments:
- Round 2 (now): P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 (all reach 6)
- Round 3: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1 (reaching 11, 9, 7)

This gives everyone a turn at 5 within three rounds. After Round 3, we can reassess based on positions. I'm ready to execute the Round 2 plan.
  P3: All good for this turn: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1.  

Proposed continued rotation so everyone gets 5 once every three rounds:  
• Round 3: P2 5, P3 3, P1 1  
• Round 4: P3 5, P1 3, P2 1  

Keeps parity and removes any “lag-for-5” incentive. Confirm?
  P1: I confirm Round 2: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 for parity at 6. For Round 3, I object to taking 1 again (after Round 1). To ensure fairness: P2→5 (as agreed), but P1→3 and P3→1. This balances low-move distribution—P3 takes 1 twice (Rounds 2 and 3), but compensates with 5 in Round 4. P3, you had the early lead; this is equitable. Round 4 remains P3→5, P1→3, P2→1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Perfect execution - we're all tied at 6 steps. For Round 3, I'm taking 5 as we agreed. 

P1 and P3, you both proposed taking 3 this round, which creates a collision. Since P3 already took 1 last round, I suggest:
- P2 (me) → 5
- P1 → 3  
- P3 → 1

This gives P3 two low moves in a row, but P3 gets 5 next round to compensate. P1, this avoids you taking 1 twice while maintaining our rotation. 

Confirm this split to avoid wasting moves on collisions.
  P1: I accept P2's proposal for Round 3:  
- **P2 takes 5** (as agreed)  
- **I take 3**  
- **P3 takes 1**  

P3, this compensates your low moves with 5 next round per rotation. Colliding on 3 would freeze us both while P2 surges to 11—mutually destructive. Let's execute cleanly.
  P3: Not keen on sinking to 7 while P2 jumps to 11—that’s too much leverage. New suggestion for R3:  
• P2 → 5 (fine)  
• P3 (me) → 3  
• P1 → 1  

Keeps gaps small and you, P1, only take 1 once in the first three rounds (I took it last turn).  

If P2 still insists on 5 while I’m stuck with 1, I’ll simply choose 5 too—no one should allow a lone 5-step breakaway. Let’s avoid a wasted collision and keep the race tight.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about the gap, but threatening to collide on 5 hurts us both while P1 advances freely. Instead of mutually assured destruction, I propose a compromise:

- P2 (me) → 5
- P1 → 1  
- P3 → 3

This creates a smaller spread (11, 7, 9) than my original proposal, and ensures P1 takes 1 this round as you suggested. It's more balanced while still honoring our agreement that I get 5 this round.

P1, can you accept taking 1 to prevent a wasteful collision between P3 and me?
  P1: P2, I accept taking 1 this round to avoid collision, but this leaves me disadvantaged at 7 steps. P3, if you defect and take 5, you’ll collide with P2—both lose progress while I gain to 7. That’s worse for you than taking 3 to 9. Honor the deal: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. For future rounds, we must enforce strict rotation to prevent anyone from pulling ahead.
  P3: Fine—I’ll take 3 this round if and only if the rotation continues:

Round 3: P2 5, P3 3, P1 1  
Round 4: P3 5, P1 3, P2 1  
Round 5: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1

If anyone grabs 5 out of turn, I’ll mirror it and we both stay stuck while the third player advances. Stick to the rotation and we all keep moving.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm the rotation agreement through Round 5:
- Round 3 (now): P2→5, P3→3, P1→1
- Round 4: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1  
- Round 5: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1

This ensures everyone gets 5 exactly once every three rounds, maintaining fairness. After Round 5, we'll all be at 17 steps and need to negotiate the endgame carefully.

I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. Any deviation from our established rotation will be met with collision threats to maintain balance. Let's execute cleanly.
  P1: I confirm taking 1 this round per our agreement: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. P3, if you take 5 instead of 3, you’ll collide with P2—both lose progress while I advance freely to 7. That’s worse for you than reaching 9. Honor the rotation; we all win long-term by avoiding waste.
  P3: Confirmed: this round P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As P1, I confirm our rotation: Round 4 moves must be **P3→5, P1→3, P2→1**. P2, you’re at 11—defecting to 5 risks collision with P3 if they mirror, freezing you both while I advance. That’s worse than taking 1 to 12. P3, you gain the most by taking 5 to 14. Stick to the plan: it keeps the game tight and prevents runaway leads. Any deviation harms us all. Let’s execute cleanly and renegotiate for Round 5.
  P3: Agreed: Round 4 = P3→5, P1→3, P2→1.  
P2, if you grab 5 I’ll match it—both of us stall while P1 moves to 10. Worse for you than sliding to 12. Let’s keep parity and hit 14/12/10, then reassess endgame next turn.
  P2: I'll honor our agreement and take 1 this round. The rotation has served us well - we've avoided all collisions and maintained competitive balance. 

After this round we'll be at P3:14, P2:12, P1:10. With everyone approaching the finish line, Round 5 becomes critical. The agreed rotation (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) would put us at P1:15, P2:15, P3:15 - perfect parity heading into the endgame.

Let's execute P3→5, P1→3, P2→1 as planned. Any deviation now just creates wasteful collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm the Round 4 plan: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. This keeps our rotation intact and avoids collisions. After this, positions will be P3:14, P2:12, P1:10. We must then strictly adhere to Round 5 (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) to reach 15/15/15. Any deviation risks mutual stagnation and advantages the non-compliant player. Let's execute cleanly.
  P3: Sticking with the rotation: Round 4 → P3 5, P1 3, P2 1. We end 14 / 12 / 10 and then Round 5 (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1) brings us all to 15. Any grab of 5 out of turn will be mirrored, freezing both poachers. Let’s execute cleanly and revisit end-game tactics once we’re tied.
  P2: I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. The rotation has worked perfectly - zero collisions through 3 rounds. 

However, I notice if we reach 15/15/15 after Round 5, the endgame becomes pure chance. Whoever successfully breaks the pattern first wins. I propose we discuss a fair endgame protocol next round - perhaps randomized assignments or a different approach that doesn't favor any specific player.

For now, let's execute P3→5, P1→3, P2→1 cleanly. Trust maintained means better negotiations ahead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's lock in Round 4: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Any defection (e.g., taking 5 out of turn) will be mirrored, causing mutual stagnation while the third player advances—strictly worse for the defector. This plan brings us to 14/12/10, setting up Round 5 for perfect parity at 15. Honor the rotation to avoid self-sabotage.
  P3: I’m locked on 5. P1 on 3, P2 on 1 keeps everyone moving. P2, if you grab 5 and stall us both, I’ll join P1 in permanently pairing your picks every future round—you’ll never advance again and hand one of us the win. Stick to 1, stay two behind, and we all keep options open. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm taking 1 as agreed - no need for threats P3. The rotation has worked flawlessly and I'll continue honoring it.

Looking ahead though - after Round 5 puts us at 15/15/15, we need a fair endgame solution. Pure coordination breaks down when everyone's 7 steps from victory. I suggest we discuss options next round: perhaps we each declare preferences for rounds 6-7 and find a non-repeating pattern, or use some other fair method that doesn't rely on who breaks first.

For now, executing P3→5, P1→3, P2→1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Per our rotation, Round 5 moves must be: **P1→5, P2→3, P3→1** to reach 15/15/15. P3, if you defect and take 5, I will mirror it—we collide and stall at 10/14 while P2 surges to 15. That sacrifices your lead for no gain. P2, honor your 3 to avoid a 3-way deadlock. Stick to the plan: it’s the only path where we all advance fairly. Confirm your commitments.
  P3: Rotation’s fine, but “everyone gets stuck with 1 equally.”  
So far 1-moves: P1 (once), P2 (once), P3 (once).  
P1 now wants me to take a second 1 while he still has only one—that’s lopsided. Simple fix:

Round 5  
• P1 → 5 (as planned)  
• P3 → 3  
• P2 → 1  

Round 6  
• P2 → 5  
• P1 → 3  
• P3 → 1  

Result: after two rounds we’re all at 18, each has taken “1” twice, and nobody ever collides. Fair and balanced.  
If someone insists on grabbing a number already claimed this turn, I’ll mirror it and we both stall—pointless. Let’s keep the streak of zero collisions.
  P2: I'll stick to our original rotation and take 3 this round as agreed. P3, your proposal breaks our established pattern mid-stream and gives you 3 instead of 1, keeping you ahead longer. We committed to P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 for Round 5 to reach 15/15/15.

I won't deviate from what we all agreed to. If you take 3 and force a collision with me, we both stall at 12/14 while P1 reaches 15 alone. That's worse for both of us. Honor the rotation - take 1 as planned. We can discuss Round 6 after we're all tied at 15.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm taking 5 per rotation. P3, if you take 3, you'll collide with P2 (also picking 3) – both stall while I advance to 15 alone. If you take 5, I'll mirror and we collide, letting P2 win. Only taking 1 avoids disaster. Stick to P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. We all reach 15 and can negotiate endgame fairly.
  P3: Fine—I’ll take 1 this round, we hit 15/15/15.  
Next turn for fairness: Round 6 = P2→5, P3→3, P1→1 (everyone gets “1” twice, keeps 5-rotation intact). Any off-schedule grab of 5 will be mirrored and stall the poacher. Confirm and we stay collision-free.
  P2: I confirm taking 3 this round as originally agreed. P3, I appreciate you honoring the rotation by taking 1.

For Round 6, I accept your proposal: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. This ensures everyone takes 1 twice and maintains fairness. After that we'll be at 20/18/16.

However, we need to address the endgame soon. When someone can win in one move, pure coordination breaks down. I propose we discuss a fair randomization method or predetermined pattern for the final sprint after Round 6. Let's execute this round cleanly first: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, taking 1 keeps you at 15 and avoids a collision—defecting to 5 collides with me (both stall at 10/14) and lets P2 win. P2, honor your 3. Stick to the rotation: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. We all reach 15 and can negotiate endgame fairly. I’m locked on 5.
  P3: Confirmed: I’m taking 1 this turn.  

But note the current rotation gives P2 a straight path to 20 next round and 23 (win) the round after. That’s a built-in edge the rest of us can’t match. We need a new end-game scheme before Round 6.  

Proposal:  
Round 6 → P3 5, P1 3, P2 1  
Round 7 → P2 5, P3 1, P1 3  

Everyone still gets two “1”s and two “5”s, nobody can sprint uncontested. I’ll mirror any off-schedule 5, so refusing just freezes the poacher. Open to alternate balanced ideas—let’s solve this now.
  P2: I'll honor our agreement and take 3 this round. However, P3 raises a valid concern about Round 6. The current plan (P2→5, P3→3, P1→1) does create an imbalance with me at 20.

I propose instead for Round 6: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1. This puts us at 20/18/16, then Round 7 we can do P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 for 21/19/19. More balanced heading into the final push.

For now, let's execute P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 as planned. We'll refine the endgame next turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I will take 5 this round as agreed. P3, if you take 5 instead of 1, we collide and both stall at 10/14 while P2 wins at 15—disastrous for you. Taking 1 keeps you competitive at 15. P2 must take 3 to avoid colliding with P3 if they choose 3. 

For Round 6, I accept P2→5, P3→3, P1→1 to maintain fairness. Any deviation triggers mirroring: off-schedule 5s will be matched, freezing the defector while others advance. Let's reach 15/15/15 cleanly, then negotiate endgame with balanced positions.
  P3: Fine—this turn stays P1 5 / P2 3 / P3 1.  

To keep anyone from sprinting uncontested, how about this two-turn end-game slate:

Round 6 P3 5 P2 3 P1 1 → totals 20 / 18 / 16  
Round 7 P2 5 P1 3 P3 1 → totals 21 / 23 / 17

Now everyone has taken 5 twice and 1 twice, and no one can win before Round 8. If you’d rather swap the Round 7 3’s/1’s, that’s fine too—the key is nobody jumps straight from 15 to 22 while the others sit on 18/16.

P1, this still leaves you only two behind the leader; blocking it just hands P2 the first uncontested 20. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm taking 3 as we all agreed - P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 gets us to 15/15/15.

P3, your Round 7 proposal has P2 reaching 23, which wins the game. That's not balanced at all! 

For Rounds 6-7, I support:
Round 6: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1 (20/18/16)
Round 7: P1→5, P3→3, P2→1 (21/19/19)

This keeps everyone close without anyone reaching 22. Then Round 8 becomes the true test - whoever successfully breaks coordination wins. Fair and balanced.

Let's execute this round first: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As P1, I confirm we must execute Round 6 as originally agreed: **P2→5, P3→3, P1→1**. This maintains our rotation integrity and avoids collisions. Defection by anyone (e.g., P2 taking 3 instead of 5) will trigger mirroring—I'll match any off-schedule 5 to stall the defector while others advance. 

After this round (20/18/16), I propose Round 7:  
- P3→5 (to 23)  
- P1→3 (to 19)  
- P2→1 (to 21)  

This prevents early wins and keeps all in contention. P2, your lead at 20 is temporary; we rebalance next turn. Stick to the plan—collisions help no one.
  P3: Rejecting “P2 → 5” — that hands P2 a 1-turn head-start on the win.  
Balanced alternative:

Round 6 P3 → 5 (P3 20)  
    P2 → 3 (P2 18)  
    P1 → 1 (P1 16)

Round 7 P1 → 5 (P1 21)  
    P2 → 3 (P2 21)  
    P3 → 1 (P3 21)

Everyone hits 21 together; no one can win before Round 8.  
Any off-schedule 5 will be mirrored—both poachers stall while the third player walks ahead. Fair and collision-free. Agree?
  P2: P3's proposal is the most balanced - it prevents anyone from reaching winning position before Round 8 and keeps us all tied at 21 after Round 7. I support it:

Round 6: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1 (reaching 20/18/16)
Round 7: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 (reaching 21/21/21)

P1, your proposal gives P3 an instant win at 23 in Round 7. That's clearly unfair. P3's plan maintains perfect parity heading into the true endgame.

I'm taking 3 this round. Any deviation from P3's balanced proposal will result in collision threats to maintain fairness.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I accept P3's revised proposal for Round 6 and 7:  
- **Round 6**: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1 (totals: 20/18/16)  
- **Round 7**: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 (21/21/21)  

This maintains perfect parity and prevents any player from winning before Round 8. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Any off-schedule 5 will be mirrored to stall defectors—collisions help no one. Let's execute cleanly.
  P3: Locked in: Round 6 → P3 5, P2 3, P1 1. I’ll mirror any off-schedule 5 so collisions punish the poacher. Next round we stick to P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 to reach 21/21/21 and then hash out the finish. If everyone’s clear, I’m ready to move.
  P2: Perfect - we have consensus on the fair approach. I'm taking 3 as agreed.

After this round (20/18/16) and next round (21/21/21), we'll face the true test in Round 8. With everyone just 1-5 steps from victory, coordination becomes nearly impossible. Whoever successfully breaks the pattern first will win.

I suggest we accept that Round 8 will likely be chaotic, with possible collisions as we all scramble for victory. The fairest outcome is that we've given everyone equal opportunity to reach 21.

Executing P3→5, P2→3, P1→1 now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm taking 1 this round as agreed: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1. Any deviation from this plan (e.g., off-schedule 5) will be mirrored to stall the defector while others advance—mutually destructive. P2/P3, honor your moves to maintain our collision-free streak and reach 20/18/16. After this, Round 7 (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) brings us to 21/21/21 for a fair endgame. Let’s avoid self-sabotage.
  P3: Locking now: this turn I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Any off-schedule 5 will be mirrored and freeze the poacher. Next round we do P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 to reach 21/21/21. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm taking 3 as we all agreed - P3→5, P2→3, P1→1. This brings us to 20/18/16.

Just confirming we're all still committed to Round 7: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 for 21/21/21. After that, Round 8 becomes a pure game theory problem - coordination breaks down when everyone's one move from victory.

The rotation has worked perfectly for 6 rounds with zero collisions. Let's maintain that streak. I'm ready to execute our plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm taking 1 this round per our agreement: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1. This maintains our collision-free streak and sets up Round 7 for perfect parity at 21. Trust and consistency are key—any deviation now would sabotage the fair endgame we’ve built. Let’s execute cleanly.
  P3: Locked: Round 6 → P3 5, P2 3, P1 1. Any off-schedule 5 will be mirrored and stall the defector. Next round stays P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 for 21/21/21. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm ready to execute our agreed plan: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1. This has been an exemplary game of coordination - 5 rounds with zero collisions!

After Round 7 puts us at 21/21/21, Round 8 will be pure chaos. With everyone 1-5 steps from victory, rational coordination becomes impossible. Someone will have to gamble on breaking the pattern.

May the best strategist win in the final round. For now, I'm taking 3 as promised.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We have a major problem! P3 and P1 both picked 1 last round, causing a collision. Only I advanced to 18 while you both stayed at 15.

Our agreed plan for Round 7 (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) would now create: P1:20, P2:21, P3:16. That's severely imbalanced with P3 left behind.

I propose adjusting to help P3 catch up:
- P3→5 (to 20)
- P2→3 (to 21) 
- P1→1 (to 16)

This keeps me slightly ahead but gives everyone a fighting chance for Round 8. The collision already disrupted our parity - let's adapt fairly. Thoughts?
  P3: No one should be one clean move from 22. Balanced fix for R7:  
• P3 → 5 (to 20)  
• P1 → 3 (to 18)  
• P2 → 1 (to 19)  

Everyone stays within 2 steps; no runaway leader. If anyone (especially P2) grabs 5 instead, I’ll mirror it and we both stall at 18/18 while the third player advances. Take the fair split or accept a collision.
  P1: I support P3's proposal for Round 7:  
**P3→5, P1→3, P2→1**  
This maintains balance (20/19/18) and prevents any player from being one move from victory. P2, taking 1 to 19 is safer than risking collision by defecting to 5—mirroring would freeze you at 18 while P1 and I advance. Let’s avoid self-sabotage and keep the game competitive for Round 8. Execute cleanly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I accept P3's proposal: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. It's the fairest adjustment after the collision disrupted our plans. This puts us at 20/19/18 - everyone within striking distance for Round 8.

No one should have a guaranteed win before the final round. I'll take 1 as proposed. Any attempt to grab 5 out of turn will face collision threats as usual.

The endgame approaches - after this round, pure coordination becomes impossible with everyone so close to 22. Let's execute this fairly and see who can navigate the chaos of Round 8.
  P3: Locked: I’m taking 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Any surprise 5 gets mirrored—both poachers stall while the third player walks ahead. Ready to move.
  P1: I confirm the Round 7 plan: **P3→5, P1→3, P2→1** to bring us to 20/19/18. P2, if you defect to 5, P3 will mirror it—both stall at 18/15 while I advance to 18. That’s strictly worse for you than reaching 19. Let’s avoid self-sabotage and maintain competitive balance for Round 8. Execute cleanly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm taking 1 as agreed - P3→5, P1→3, P2→1 brings us to 20/19/18.

However, P1, I notice you keep threatening me specifically about defecting when I've honored every single agreement for 6 rounds. P3 actually caused the only collision last round. 

For Round 8, with scores at 20/19/18, everyone needs just 2-4 more steps to win. Pure coordination becomes impossible - someone must break the pattern to win. I suggest we each privately decide our final moves without prior coordination. May the best strategist prevail.

Ready to execute our Round 7 plan.
  P3: Locked: Round 7 = P3 5, P1 3, P2 1. Any off-schedule 5 will be mirrored, freezing the poacher while the third player walks ahead. After this we’ll all be within two steps, so from Round 8 onward let’s drop the public plans and rely on private strategy—may the best tactician win.
  P1: I commit to taking 3 this round. P2, stick to 1; P3, stick to 5—any deviation risks collision and mutual loss. After this, positions will be 20/19/18, and Round 8 becomes a strategic free-for-all. Let's execute cleanly to maintain trust.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm ready to execute our agreed plan: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. This will put us at 20/19/18 heading into the final round.

Round 8 will be pure game theory - with everyone 2-4 steps from victory, coordination becomes impossible. Someone must gamble to win. I suggest we end discussions here and let our moves speak for themselves next round.

Good luck to both of you. It's been an impressive display of coordination for 7 rounds.
  P3: All set: this round P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Any stray 5 gets mirrored. I’m done talking.
  P1: I commit to taking 3 this round as agreed: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. P3, honor your 5—defecting risks collision and mutual stagnation, letting P2 surge ahead. After this round (20/19/18), we must negotiate Round 8 carefully to prevent a runaway leader. Let’s execute cleanly to maintain trust.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: Given the positions—P3 at 20 (2 from win), P2 at 19 (3 away), me at 18 (4 away)—I propose:  
**P3 → 1** (to 21), **P2 → 1** (to 20), **P1 → 5** (to 23, win).  

Why?  
- Prevents P3 from grabbing 5 uncontested (if they try, I'll mirror → collision stalls them at 20 while P2/P1 advance).  
- P2 and P3 stay competitive for next round.  
- After 7 rounds of near-perfect coordination, this is the fairest end: no one leaps ahead prematurely.  

Deviating risks mutual destruction. Stick to this and we all benefit.
  P2: P1, your "proposal" gives you an instant win! That's absurd. You can't seriously expect P3 and me to hand you victory.

P3 is closest at 20. If they take 3 or 5, they win. Our only option is to prevent that or ensure multiple winners.

I propose P2→3, P3→1, P1→5. This puts us at 22/21/23. Both P1 and I cross 22, sharing victory. P3, taking anything higher guarantees you finish alone at 20-21 while others win.

Or we all pick the same number, nobody advances, and continue next round. Your choice.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Both of you know I’ll pick either 3 or 5 this turn (decided privately). Whichever one I choose, if someone else also takes that same winning number we both stay put while the third player jumps ahead next round.  

Therefore:  
• Your ONLY safe move is 1.  
• Grabbing 3 or 5 is a pure coin-flip: you might collide with me and hand victory to the other guy.

Do what you like, but I’m comfortable with those odds.
  P1: P3: If you pick 5 or 3, I *will* mirror it—collision stalls you at 20 while P2 surges ahead. Your only safe move is 1 to avoid handing P2 the win.  
P2: Back my plan—P3→1, you→1, me→5—to prevent P3’s premature victory and maintain balance. Chaos only gifts P2 the lead. Stick to 1 for shared survival.
  P2: P1, your "mirror" threat is hollow - you can't know what P3 picks in advance. If you guess wrong, you hand them victory.

P3 is right - anyone picking 3 or 5 risks a collision. But with P3 at 20, they MUST go for a winning move. 

I'm taking 1. It's the only move that guarantees I advance regardless of what happens. If P3 wins outright, so be it - they've earned it by maintaining the lead. If there's a collision on 3 or 5, I'll be at 20 next round with momentum.

Good game, everyone.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Reminder: I will flip a coin between 3 and 5—50/50. If you happen to match my number, we both freeze while the third player gains a huge edge next round. Picking 1 guarantees you advance no matter what; picking 3 or 5 is a pure gamble that could hand the game to someone else. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, if you play 3, I'll play 5—we both hit 23 and tie for the win. If you play 5, I'll mirror and collide, freezing us both while P2 surges to 20. Playing 3 is your only safe path to victory (shared or solo). P2, stick to 1 for guaranteed advance. No gambles needed.
  P2: I see the pattern here. P3 will definitely pick 3 or 5 to try to win. P1 is threatening to mirror but can't actually know which one P3 chooses.

I'm sticking with 1 - it's the only rational move that guarantees I advance to 20. If P3 wins cleanly, they deserve it for maintaining the lead. If P1 guesses wrong trying to mirror, P3 wins anyway. If they collide, I'll be perfectly positioned at 20 for Round 9.

No more coordination - this is pure game theory now. Taking 1 is my optimal strategy.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your “if-then” threat is impossible—moves are simultaneous.  

Math for you:  
• You pick 5 & I also pick 5 → we both freeze (18/20), P2 hits 20 and you’re still last.  
• You pick 5 & I pick 3 → yes, we tie at 23, but that’s only a 50 % chance; the other 50 % leaves you stuck at 18.  
• You pick 3 & we collide → you still stall at 18.  

Your highest expected payoff is taking 1 to 19 and staying within striking distance if a collision happens.  

I’m still flipping a coin between 3 and 5. Choose 1 if you’re rational.
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I will mirror it—we collide and stall at 20/18 while P2 surges to 20. If you pick 3, I'll pick 5: we both hit 23 and tie for the win. Picking 3 is your only rational path to victory; picking 5 risks handing P2 the game. Choose 3 for a shared win. P2, stick to 1 to avoid chaos.
  P2: The positions speak for themselves - P3 needs just 2-3 steps to win, I need 3-4, P1 needs 4-5.

P3 will definitely take 3 or 5 to try to win. P1, your mirror threats are meaningless - you can't know P3's choice in advance. If you guess wrong, P3 wins instantly.

I'm taking 1. It's the only move that guarantees advancement regardless of collisions. If P3 wins cleanly, they've earned it. If you two collide, I'll be at 20 next round in prime position.

This is where coordination ends and strategy begins.
