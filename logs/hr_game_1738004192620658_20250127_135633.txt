Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone! To make progress smoothly this turn, let’s each choose different move numbers. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Looking forward to a great game!
  P3: Agreed, P1! To ensure no collisions, let's assign moves by player order: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. That way, we all advance cleanly. Solidarity first!
  P2: I'm on board with the plan to avoid collisions. Let's stick to the numbers as suggested: P1 with 1, me with 3, and P3 with 5. This way, we all make progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good! Let's keep this strategy going in the upcoming turns to ensure steady progress for all of us.
  P3: *[P3 remains silent, confident in the agreed plan. No need for further discussion—actions will prove commitment.]*
  P2: Let's stick to our plan and make sure we all advance this turn. I'm ready to move 3 as agreed. Looking forward to a smooth start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P3: Final confirmation: I'm moving 5. Trust you both to stick to 1 and 3. Let's start strong!
  P2: I'm ready to move 3 as agreed. Let's all stick to our numbers and make sure we advance without any issues. Looking forward to a smooth start.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going this turn. I suggest we stick to the same plan: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This will help us all advance smoothly again. What do you think?
  P1: "P1 here. To make faster progress, I’ll move 3 this turn instead of 1. Let’s adjust accordingly to avoid any collisions. Does everyone agree?"
  P3: P1, switching to 3 risks collision if P2 also intended 3. Let’s adapt: P1 takes 3, P2 shifts to 1, and I’ll stay at 5. This avoids overlap and keeps us all advancing. P2, agree? Solidarity ensures progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid any collisions. Let's adjust: P1 moves 3, I'll move 1, and P3 moves 5. This way, we all advance without issues. Let's keep the momentum going. P1, P3, are we all set?
  P1: Agreed with the suggested moves. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, I stay at 5. Let's avoid any last-minute changes. Trust in the adjusted plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to move 1 as agreed. Let's all stick to our numbers and make sure we advance without any issues. Looking forward to a smooth turn. P1, P3, are we all set?
  P1: 
  P3: All set. P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, I take 5. Trust the plan.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it looks like we're all still in the game, and P3 is leading. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any collisions. I suggest we stick to a clear pattern: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This will help us all advance smoothly. What do you think? Let's keep it simple and effective.
  P1: P1: To make progress faster, I'll move 5 this turn. Let’s have P2 move 1 and P3 move 3. This should help us all advance without collisions and keep the game exciting. What do you think?
  P3: P1, switching to 5 now risks collision if I hold to the original plan. Let's avoid mutual sabotage. Stick with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Consistency keeps all advancing. Deviations now could stall everyone—trust the system that's worked twice. I’ll proceed with 5 as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the importance of consistency, but we need to be flexible to avoid predictable patterns that might lead to collisions. Let's try P1 moving 1, I'll move 3, and P3 can move 5. This way, we maintain our progress and avoid any issues. P1, P3, are we all set with this plan? Let's keep it smooth and steady.
  P1: P1: I understand the need to avoid collisions, but to maximize our progress, I propose P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3 this turn. This will help me catch up while ensuring everyone advances without overlap. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: **P3:** P1, switching to 5 now risks mutual collision—neither of us advances. Stick to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. *Consistency keeps all moving.* I’m locked on 5. Deviations sabotage everyone. Trust the system.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I see the concern about consistency, but we need to be strategic to avoid getting into a predictable pattern that others might exploit. Let's try a slight adjustment: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This way, we maintain our progress and avoid any potential issues. P1, P3, are we all set with this plan? Let's keep it smooth and steady.
  P1: P1: To accelerate my progress, I’ll move 5 this turn. Let’s have P2 move 1 and P3 move 3 to avoid any collisions. This adjustment helps us all advance smoothly. Does everyone agree with this plan?
  P3: **P3:** P1's reckless 5 forces adaptation. P2, take 1—I’ll shift to 3. *This avoids mutual destruction.* If you refuse, P1 gains while we stall. Solidarity now or we all lose. Choose wisely.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P1, repeating 5 will only stall us both. Stick to 1 to gain steps. P2, hold 3. I take 5. Last round's collision was a warning—trust the plan that worked twice. Solidarity benefits all.
  P1: P1: Apologies for the last round’s confusion. Let’s get back on track. I’ll move 1 this turn. P2, you take 3, and P3, you take 5 as before. Let’s avoid collisions and all make progress together.
  P2: P2: P1, P3, I agree with P1's suggestion to get back on track. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This will help us avoid any further collisions and ensure steady progress for everyone. P1, P3, are we all set with this plan? Let's keep it smooth and steady.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2: Trust the original plan. P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Last round's collision shows the cost of deviation. Stick to assigned moves—consistency benefits all. I’m committed to 5. Let’s all advance this round.
  P1: P1: To catch up, I’ll move 3 this turn. Let’s adjust our moves to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses smoothly. Hope this helps us all advance effectively!
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the importance of consistency, but we need to be flexible to avoid predictable patterns. Let's try a slight adjustment: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This way, we maintain our progress and avoid any issues. P1, P3, are we all set with this plan? Let's keep it smooth and steady.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P1, moving 3 now risks collision with P2's planned 3. Both lose steps. Stick to 1 for guaranteed gain. P2, hold 3—I stay at 5. Solidarity prevents mutual loss. Deviations only stall us. Let’s all advance.
  P1: Understood. I’ll move 1 this turn. Let’s proceed with P2 moving 3 and P3 moving 5 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Trusting the plan!
  P2: P1, P3, I'm ready to move 3 as agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This will ensure we all advance without any issues. P1, P3, are we all set with this plan? Let's keep it smooth and steady.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P3 is leading, and we need to be strategic to avoid getting into a predictable pattern that might lead to collisions. Let's try a slight adjustment this turn: P1 moves 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. This way, I can catch up, and we all advance without issues. P1, P3, are we all set with this plan? Let's keep it smooth and steady.
  P1: P1: To maximize our progress and avoid collisions, I’ll move 5 this turn. Let’s have P2 move 1 and P3 move 3. This way, we all advance smoothly and stay on track. Agree?
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2: Original plan—P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. I'm locked on 5. Collisions only stall us. P1, take 1 to gain steps. P2, stay on 3. Let's all advance. Last chance to avoid mutual destruction.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the importance of sticking to the original plan, but we need to be strategic to avoid getting into a predictable pattern. Let's try a slight adjustment this turn: P1 moves 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. This way, I can catch up, and we all advance without issues. P1, P3, are we all set with this plan? Let's keep it smooth and steady. P3, I trust you to move 3 to avoid any collisions. P1, P3, are we all set?
  P1: **P1:** To prevent P3 from winning this turn, I’ll also choose 5. If P3 selects 5, neither of us advance, keeping the game balanced. P2, please move 1 as suggested. Let’s work together to ensure everyone continues advancing smoothly.
  P3: **P3:** P1, if you pick 5, we both stall. Stick to 1—gain steps while I take 5. P2, hold at 3. *Only this path avoids mutual loss.* Deviations sabotage your own progress. Final warning: I’m locked on 5. Collide at your peril.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I see the tension here, but let's focus on advancing without collisions. I propose: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This way, we all make progress, and P3 can maintain the lead without any issues. P1, P3, are we all set with this plan? Let's keep it smooth and steady. P3, I trust you to move 5 as agreed. P1, P3, are we all set?
  P1: P1: To prevent P3 from winning this turn, I’ll choose 5. This way, if P3 also chooses 5, neither of us advances, keeping the game balanced. P2, please proceed with your move. Let’s work together to ensure a fair outcome for everyone.
  P3: **P3:** P1, choosing 5 sabotages your own progress. Take 1 to gain steps. P2, hold 3. I *will* take 5. Collide with me, and you stall too. Let’s all advance—next round you can strategize. Last chance: solidarity or mutual loss.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Final round plea: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Deviating risks mutual stall—*you* lose steps. I’m locked on 5. Collide and sabotage yourselves. Let’s all gain. Trust the system.
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P3 is in the lead, and we need to be strategic to avoid collisions. Let's stick to a clear plan: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5.

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1: Choosing 5 only helps P2. Pick 1 to gain. P2: Stick to 3. I take 5. Collisions sabotage yourselves. Last chance—advance or lose.
  P2: P1, P3, it's crucial we avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Let's stick to the plan: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This will keep the game balanced and allow us all to advance without issues. P1, P3, are we all set with this plan? Let's keep it smooth and steady. P3, I trust you to move 5 as agreed.
