Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I'm going with 3 this round.  Hopefully, you two can coordinate between 1 and 5.
  P3: Agreed, P2. P1 and I can coordinate taking different steps this round to avoid collisions and maximize our progress.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good P3.  Let's stick to this plan for a few rounds to build up a lead. P1, are you going with 1 or 5 this round?
  P3: P1, I'll take 5 steps this round. Could you take 1? This way, none of us collide and we all make progress.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1, silence means consent.  We're taking you at your word that you're going with 1. I'm going 3. P3 is going 5. Let's see if we can keep this cooperation up for a few more rounds.
  P3: Great, let's move forward with this plan. Consistent steps will help us advance smoothly.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, last call - P1, 1. P3, 5. Me, 3.  Confirming one last time before we move. Any objections?
  P3: Confirmed. P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. Let’s proceed.
  P1: <stop>

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Continuing our strategy, I'll take 5 steps this round. P2, can you stick with 3? P1, 1 step again would help us maintain steady progress without collisions.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Sounds good P3. I'll stick with 3. P1, please confirm you're taking 1 again so we can avoid any collisions.  Let's keep this momentum going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, please confirm you'll take 1 step this round to keep our coordinated progress and avoid collisions.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P1, two rounds of silence is enough.  We're going to assume you're continuing with 1.  P3, I'll stick with 3.  If either of you deviate, this cooperation is over and we'll have to play more aggressively.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P2. I believe continuing with 5 steps for myself while P1 takes 1 and you take 3 will keep our progress smooth and avoid any collisions. Let’s maintain this strategy to ensure we all advance steadily towards the goal.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, we're giving you the best chance here to stay in the game.  If you deviate now, it becomes a free-for-all.  Confirm you're taking 1, or we'll assume you're going rogue and adjust accordingly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Continuing our strategy benefits us all. I'll stick with 5 steps this round. P2, you keep 3, and P1, please confirm you're taking 1. Let's maintain our progress and avoid any collisions.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, last chance. Confirm you're taking 1.  If you don't respond, I'm switching to 1 and P3 might as well take 3.  Don't throw away this easy win-win-win.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the train rolling.  I'm taking 3 again. P1 - 1, P3 - 5.  This puts P3 at 15, me at 9, and P1 at 3.  Still a collaborative path to victory.  Confirming one last time before we switch things up in later rounds.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Sounds good, P2. I'll take 5 steps this round as proposed. Let's maintain our strategy to progress steadily and avoid collisions. Looking forward to continuing our collaboration.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, confirm you're sticking with 1 and 5 respectively.  Let's lock in this round and then discuss how we navigate the next few rounds to get everyone across the finish line.  We're close to being able to strategize for the win.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Confirmed my move of 5 steps this round. Let’s proceed with our plan to maintain steady progress and avoid collisions. Consistency is key to reaching 22 first. Looking forward to continuing our cooperation and securing the win together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, one more confirmation before we move.  Still on track for 1 and 5 respectively?  This puts us in a great position to discuss a coordinated finish next round.  Let's make this happen.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I’ll stick with 5 steps this round. Let’s all maintain our agreed strategy to advance smoothly toward 22 and avoid any collisions. Consistency is key to our success!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, last chance to confirm 1 and 5.  If no response, I'm assuming you're deviating and will adjust to 1.  Let's finish this round cleanly and then discuss the final steps to victory next round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 5 steps this round. Let’s maintain our strategy and keep progressing smoothly toward 22.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Alright, I'll take 5 steps this round. P2, please continue with 3 to keep our progress steady. P1, let's stay coordinated to avoid any collisions. Let’s move forward!
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 3. P1, you MUST take 1.  If you take 5, you'll collide with P3 and give me the win next round.  If you take 3, you collide with me, and P3 likely wins.  Taking 1 is your ONLY path to victory.  Let's finish this cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but I’ll continue taking 5 steps this round to maximize my progress. Let’s focus on reaching 22 first while minimizing collisions. If you’re sticking with 3, that works for me. Let’s keep moving forward!
  P2: P1, I understand the temptation to go for 5, but trust me, taking 1 this round is your best shot.  If you collide with P3, I win next round. If you take 3 and collide with me, P3 *probably* wins.  Let's stick to the plan, get you to 3, me to 12, and P3 to 15. Then we can discuss a fair finish next round.  Don't throw this away.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: I'll stick with taking 5 steps this round to stay on track. P2, continuing with 3 works for me. P1, your cooperation helps us all progress smoothly. Let’s focus on reaching 22 efficiently. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1, I'm serious. Take 1.  P3, I know you're tempted to take 5, but consider taking 1. If P1 takes 1 as agreed, you'll win. If P1 takes 5, we both lose.  Let's ensure one of us wins.  If you take 1, I'll take 5 next round, guaranteeing your win. This is the best outcome for both of us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: I'll proceed with 5 steps this round. P2, sticking with 3 works for me. P1, please confirm your move so we can continue smoothly.
  P2: P1, if you take 1, I'll let P3 win next round by taking 1 myself. If you take 5 and collide with P3, I win next round. It's in your best interest to take 1. P3, take 1 this round and I'll take 1 next round, guaranteeing your win. This is the best outcome for both of us against a stubborn P1.  Let's make a deal.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 1.  You take 3 and you win. If you take 5, I'll take 3 next round and win.  Don't let P1's blunder give me the win.  This is our best chance.  P1, you're out of the running.
  P3: P3: I’m taking 5 steps this round to advance toward 22. Let’s keep the competition strong and focus on our strategies. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're throwing away the win. Take 3, I'm taking 1.  You get to 13, I get to 13, you win because you're further ahead. If you take 5, I take 3 next round and win.  Don't be foolish. P1, nothing you can do now.
  P3: P2, to secure my win and reach 22 first, I'll take 5 steps this round. Let’s focus on the game and may the best player win. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, last chance. Take 3, you win. Take 5, I take 3 next round and win.  This isn't rocket science.  Don't overthink it.  P1, sorry you got caught in the crossfire.
  P3: P3: I will continue taking 5 steps this round to focus on reaching 22. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I'm begging you. Take 3.  You win.  I'm taking 1.  If you take 5, I win next round. This is your guaranteed victory. Don't throw it away.  P1, sorry, you're out of this one.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm taking 5 steps this round to move closer to 22. Let's keep our choices distinct to avoid collisions. P2, maybe take 1 or 3, and P1, good luck! Let’s aim to win smoothly.
  P2: P3, take 3 and win. I'm taking 5.  If you take 5, we collide and I win next turn.  Don't overthink this.  P1 is out. This is between you and me.  Take the win.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, P2. I'll take 3 steps this round to avoid collisions and help us both progress. Let’s keep moving forward!
  P2: P3, you're making the right move!  I'm taking 5. This puts you at 13 and me at 18.  Next round, I take 3 and win.  It was a good game. P1, better luck next time.

  P3: Understood, P2. To stay on track towards 22, I’ll be taking 5 steps this round. Let’s focus on reaching our goals without further complications. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, you're costing yourself the win.  Take 3, I'm taking 5. You win. You take 5, we collide, I take 3 next round and win.  Why are you doing this?  It makes no logical sense.  P1, you're a witness to this self-sabotage.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** I've decided to take 5 steps this round to stay on track toward reaching 22. Let's keep our choices distinct to avoid collisions and focus on winning the game. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  If you take 5 we both lose and I win next round. Take 3, you have 13, I have 18.  I take 3 next round and win. You win if you take 3. It's that simple. Why are you throwing the win away?

Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, you're delusional.  Taking 5 *guarantees* my win. I'm taking 3. If you take 5, I take 3 next round and win.  If you take 3, we collide, and I *still* win with 5 next round.  Take 1 to maximize your pitiful score. P1, take 1.  It won't change the outcome, but it'll annoy P3.
