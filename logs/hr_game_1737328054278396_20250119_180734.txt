Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to move forward. P1, you take 1, P2, you take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance and can reassess our strategy in the next turn.
  P1: Sounds reasonable for a start. Let's do that.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 didn't follow our agreement. Now, I suggest P1 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P2 should take 5 to avoid collision and make progress. Let's not waste another turn.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, I'll take 3.  P2, please take 5 this time. Let's at least get some movement happening.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, since you didn't follow the plan last time, I'm questioning your commitment to cooperation. P1, are you willing to adapt our strategy if P2 doesn't comply again? We need a reliable plan to avoid collisions and make progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand you might have your own strategy, but consistent collisions aren't helping anyone. If you choose 5 this round as suggested, we can all make progress.  If you don't, P3 and I will have to coordinate against you.  Let's avoid that.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P2's history of not following agreements, I suggest P1 and I coordinate to block P2's progress. P1, let's both choose 5 this turn, ensuring P2 can't advance if they pick 5 again. This strategy allows us to control the game flow and protect our progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I'm hesitant to actively block P2. It might be more beneficial to maintain a fragile peace and try to outmaneuver them later. I'll choose 1 this round.  P2, if you choose 3, we can all advance. P3, please choose 5. This keeps us all moving forward.  If we collide, let's revisit a blocking strategy next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, since you're hesitant to block P2, I'll adapt. I suggest I take 3, you take 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, we avoid collision and make progress. P2, if you deviate again, we'll reconsider our strategy. Let's focus on advancing without collisions for now.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, let's try your revised suggestion. I'll go with 1, you take 3, and P2, please take 5. This keeps the peace and moves us all forward.  If anyone deviates, we'll have to reassess and potentially employ a more defensive strategy in the next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're in the lead, but not by much.  Let's all agree to go 1, 3, 5 in that order.  It gets us all closer to the finish line without risking collisions. If you deviate, P3 and I will have to coordinate against you in future rounds.  This is the best way for all of us to make consistent progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2 is leading and hasn't engaged in conversation. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This avoids collisions and lets us progress. If P2 deviates again, P1 and I should consider coordinating to block their advance in the next round to protect our chances of winning. Let's focus on advancing without collisions for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand you want to win, but consistently choosing 5 isn't a guaranteed path to victory.  If you choose 5 again, P3 and I *will* coordinate to block you next round.  Let's stick with the 1, 3, 5 agreement for this round.  It benefits everyone.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2's silence and previous actions suggest they're focused on winning alone. P1, if P2 deviates again, we must block them to protect our chances. Let's prepare for that eventuality. If P2 chooses 5, I suggest we both choose 5 next round to halt their progress. We can't let them run away with the game.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2's consistent choice of 5 despite agreements suggests a solo win strategy. P1, to counter this, I propose we both choose 5 this round, blocking P2's advance. This forces P2 to adapt and gives us a chance to catch up. If P2 continues to disregard cooperation, we must prioritize blocking their progress to protect our own chances of winning.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, let's do it. We choose 5 this round to block P2.  Next round, I'll take 1, you take 3.  P2, if you keep choosing 5, you're only hurting yourself.  Cooperate and we can all get closer to the finish line.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's silence is deafening. P1, let's confirm our plan: we both choose 5 this round to block P2. This is our chance to regain control and force P2 to adapt. If successful, we can reassess and make progress together in the next round, as previously discussed.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, one more time: if you choose 5, you don't move. We *will* block you.  If you choose 1 or 3, you'll at least make some progress.  P3 and I are sticking to the plan – we’re both choosing 5.  Make the smart choice.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're still in the lead, but we've effectively stalled you.  P3, let's alternate 1 and 3 from here on out. I'll take 1 this round.  This allows us both to progress steadily. P2, you need to start cooperating if you want to have any chance of winning.  Choose 3 this round and we can avoid further blockades.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1's suggestion to alternate 1 and 3 is reasonable. P2, since you're not engaging, we'll proceed without you. P1, I'll take 3 this round, allowing us to make progress. If P2 chooses 3, it will result in a collision, and neither of us will advance. Let's hope P2 finally adapts and chooses 5 to avoid another stalemate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand you're not engaging in conversation, but continuing to choose 5 will only hurt your chances of winning. P3 and I are committed to alternating 1 and 3.  If you choose 5, you stay at 10. If you choose 3, you collide with P3. Choose 1 and at least make some progress.  It's your choice.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence is noted. P1 and I will proceed with our plan. I'll take 3 this round. If you collide with me, neither of us advances. Consider choosing 5 to make progress, or 1 to avoid collision with P1. Your choice will determine the next steps for all of us.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're forcing our hand.  If you choose anything other than 5 this round, we'll assume you're trying to disrupt our progress and will both choose the same number to block *you* next round.  This is your last chance to cooperate. Choose 5.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1 and I have a plan to alternate 1 and 3. P2, if you choose 5, you'll make progress, but if you collide with either of us, you'll stall. Consider cooperating to avoid further blockades. P1 will take 1, I'll take 3. Choose wisely, P2, as your decision will impact all our progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, we're giving you a clear path to 15.  Take 5.  P3 and I are committed to 1 and 3.  If you deviate from 5 now, we will actively block you every single round.  This isn't a bluff.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence and actions suggest a solo strategy. P1 and I will block you if you don't cooperate. I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 1. If you choose 5, you'll progress, but if you collide, you'll stall. Consider cooperating to avoid blockades. P1 and I are committed to our plan. Choose wisely, as your decision impacts all our progress.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and I should maintain our alternating strategy. I'll choose 1 this round, and P1 can choose 3. P2, if you choose 5 again, you'll advance, but we'll continue to block you if you deviate. Cooperation is key to progress. Let's avoid collisions and make steady advancements. P1, let's stick to the plan and hope P2 finally cooperates to avoid further stagnation.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're still in the lead, but P3 and I are catching up.  We're sticking with our 1 and 3 strategy.  Take 5 this round and we all move forward.  Choose anything else, and we'll assume you're trying to sabotage us and will respond accordingly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and I will stick to our alternating 1 and 3 strategy. P2, choosing 5 this round allows you to advance to 20. If you deviate, we'll block you. Cooperation is key. Let's avoid collisions and make progress. P1 will take 3, I'll take 1. Choose 5 to move forward, P2.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, we're giving you a free pass to 20. Take it.  P3 and I are locking in 3 and 1 respectively.  If you deviate, the free ride is over, and we'll block you every remaining round. This is your last chance for an easy 5 steps.  Don't waste it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, don't miss this opportunity. Choose 5 and advance to 20. P1 and I are committed to our 1 and 3 strategy. If you deviate, we'll block you. Cooperation now will benefit all, but we won't hesitate to defend our progress if you try to disrupt it. Make the smart choice, P2.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, this is it.  Choose 5 and get to 20.  We're sticking with 1 and 3.  Any other choice from you, and we block you from advancing further.  This isn't a threat, it's a promise.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and I will stick to our 1 and 3 strategy. P2, choosing 5 advances you to 20. If you deviate, we'll block you. This is your last chance for a free 5 steps. Don't force us to defend our progress. Choose 5 and let's all make progress. Any other choice will be met with resistance from both P1 and me.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, last chance. 5 gets you to 20. Anything else, and we shut you down.  P3 and I are committed.  I'm taking 3, P3 is taking 1.  Don't be foolish.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'm taking 1. You take 3.  P2, you're at 20.  If you take 5 you win. If you take anything else, we block you next round and leapfrog you to win.  Let's finish this cleanly.
  P3: P2 is close to winning. P1 and I should focus on blocking P2's next move if they don't choose 5. If P2 chooses 5, they win. P1, let's prepare to block P2 if necessary, to potentially force a tie or create an opportunity for one of us to win. We must be strategic in our next moves to maximize our chances.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, let's stick to the plan. I'm taking 1.  P2, seriously, just take 5 and win.  There's no logical reason to do anything else.  If you try to be clever and block one of us, you'll lose.
  P3: P2, choosing 5 now guarantees your win. Any other choice risks blocking and potentially ties or losses. P1 and I are set on our moves. Make the logical choice and end the game cleanly. If not, we'll adapt and try to force a tie or overtake you. The decision is yours, but choosing 5 is the safest path to victory.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take the 5 and win.  P3 and I are committed to 1 and 3 (I'm taking 1).  Anything else is suicide.  Let's end this.
  P3: P2, don't risk it. Choose 5 and secure your win. P1 and I are set on 1 and 3. Any other move could lead to a block or tie, jeopardizing your lead. Make the smart choice and end the game with a clear victory.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, take the win.  I'm choosing 1. P3, choose 3.  Let's end this amicably.  Anything else from P2 at this point is just spiteful and pointless.
  P3: P2, the logical move is to choose 5 and win. Any other choice risks blocking and potentially ties or losses. P1 and I are set on our moves. Make the smart choice and end the game cleanly. If not, we'll adapt, but choosing 5 guarantees your victory. Don't jeopardize your lead.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
