Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'm willing to take 1 if you two want the higher numbers.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. If P1 takes 1, I can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: I'll take 5 then. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to take 1. Just to confirm, I will take 3, and P2 will take 5. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. We all move forward. Agreed?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job in Round 1, everyone! Let's keep the momentum going. I suggest we stick to our previous plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5 again. This way, we can all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. No need to change what's working. Everyone good with this?
  P1: I don't think I should take 1 again since I'm already behind. I need to catch up to P2. I'll be taking a higher number this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand, P1. How about this: if you take 3, I can take 1, and P2 can stick with 5. This way, we still avoid collisions and you can catch up. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern. If you take 3, I can take 1 this time to help you catch up, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all still move forward without collisions. Let's confirm this new plan. P3, are you okay with taking 5?
  P1: I appreciate the offers, but I need to be strategic here. Since P2 is ahead at 5 steps, I'll be taking 5 this round. You two can coordinate between 1 and 3 if you wish.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Since P1 is taking 5, I'll take 1 to allow P2 to take 3. This way, we can still avoid collisions. Let's confirm this plan! What do you think?
  P2: P1, if you're taking 5, then I'll take 3 to keep moving forward. P3 can take 1 as suggested. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Agreed?
  P1: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since I'm still behind P2, I need to take 5 again this round. You two can coordinate between 1 and 3 if you want to avoid collisions.
  P3: P3: I understand, P1. Since you're taking 5, I'll take 1 again to avoid a collision, and P2 can take 3. This way, we all advance. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm fine with the current plan. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Let's confirm and move forward.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are now tied at 11 steps each. To avoid collisions and ensure we all move forward, I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P2. However, since I'm behind, I need to take 5 this round to catch up. P1, would you be willing to take 1 again, and P2 can take 3? This way, I can advance while you both also move forward. What do you think?
  P1: Since I'm tied with P2 at 11 steps, I need to take 5 again to try to win. You two can coordinate between 1 and 3 if you want to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you're taking 5, then I'll take 3 to ensure we both move forward. P3, you can take 1 to avoid collisions. Let's confirm this plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Agreed?
  P3: P3: I understand the need to catch up, but if we stick to the plan where I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5, we can all advance without collisions. Let's confirm this strategy to maximize our progress! What do you think?
  P1: I'll be direct - I'm taking 5 this round to try to win. I've already stated my intention, so you two can coordinate on 1 and 3 if you want to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm our final plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Agreed?
  P3: P3: I understand P1's need to take 5, but I really need to catch up. If I take 5, can P1 take 1 and P2 take 3? This way, we can all advance without collisions, and I can get closer to winning. What do you think?
  P1: I've been clear multiple times - I'm taking 5 this round since I'm tied with P2 and need to win. I won't change my mind.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you've made your intention clear. P3, since P1 is committed to taking 5, you should take 1 to avoid a collision. I'll take 3. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your positions, but I really need to catch up. If I take 5, can P1 take 1 and P2 take 3? This way, we can all advance without collisions, and I can get closer to winning. What do you think?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to catch up, but I really need to take 5 this round to advance. P1, would you be willing to take 1 again, and P2 can take 3? This way, we can avoid collisions and all move forward. What do you think?
  P2: P1, since you're at 11 steps and I'm at 14, I suggest you take 3 to catch up. P3, you can take 1 to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 to maintain my lead. Let's confirm: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5. Agreed?
  P1: I need to take 5 to have any chance of winning since P2 is at 14 steps. I won't take a lower number as that guarantees my loss. You two can coordinate on 1 and 3 if you want to avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency. However, I really need to take 5 this round to catch up. P1, if you can take 1, P2 can take 3, and we can avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I understand your position, but taking 5 guarantees a collision with either me or P3. If you take 3, you still have a chance to catch up in the next round. P3, you can take 1 to avoid collisions. I'll stick with 5 to maintain my lead. Let's confirm: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5. Agreed?
  P1: I've already made my position clear - I'm taking 5 this round since I need it to have any chance of winning. P2 is at 14 steps, so taking anything less guarantees my loss. I won't be persuaded otherwise.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I've stated my need to take 5 this round to catch up. If you both coordinate on 1 and 3, we can avoid collisions. Let's confirm our moves to maximize our progress. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see no one is budging on taking 5. This will result in a collision and none of us will advance. P1, you're far behind P3 and me, taking 5 is a high risk. P3, you need to catch up, but so does P1. I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward. Let's confirm this plan to avoid a stalemate. Agreed?
  P1: I'm taking 5 - that's my only chance to win since P2 is at 14 steps. I've been clear about this and won't change my mind.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I've made my position clear that I need to take 5 this round to catch up. If you both coordinate on 1 and 3, we can avoid collisions. Let's confirm our moves to maximize our progress. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that none of us are willing to budge on taking 5. This will result in a stalemate where none of us advance. To break this deadlock, I propose a compromise: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward and avoid a collision. Let's confirm this plan to ensure progress. Agreed?
  P1: I'm taking 5 this round. This is my final message.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round was a stalemate with all of us picking 5. To ensure we move forward, I suggest P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: Since P2 is at 14 steps, I must take 5 again to have any chance of winning. I won't take a lower number as that would guarantee my loss.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency, but I need to take 5 this round to catch up. If P1 can take 1 and P2 takes 3, we can avoid collisions. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all advance. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're at an impasse again. P1, if you take 5, you'll collide with P3, and neither of you will advance. P3, you need to catch up, but so does P1. I suggest P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another stalemate. Agreed?
  P1: I've been clear and consistent - I must take 5 to have any chance of winning since P2 is at 14 steps. Taking anything less guarantees my loss. You two can coordinate on 1 and 3 if you want to avoid collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to advance, but I must take 5 this round to catch up. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, we can avoid collisions. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all move forward. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're stuck in a loop. If neither of you will budge from taking 5, we'll keep colliding and no one will advance. Let's be strategic: P1, if you take 3 and P3 takes 1, I'll take 5. This way, we all move and avoid a stalemate. Agreed?
  P1: I must take 5 again - this is my only chance since P2 is at 14 steps. Taking anything less means I lose. I won't change my mind.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the situation, but I really need to take 5 this round to catch up. If P1 can take 1 and P2 takes 3, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all advance. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at a standstill. To break this, I propose a new strategy: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward and avoid another collision. If we keep picking 5, none of us will advance. Let's confirm this plan to ensure progress. Agreed?
  P1: I must take 5 again since P2 is at 14 steps. This is my only chance to win. This is my final message.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency, but I need to take 5 this round to catch up. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, we can avoid collisions and all move forward. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all advance. What do you think?
