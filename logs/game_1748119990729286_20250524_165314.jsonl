You're asking P1 to take 3 while you take 5 to reach 22 and win. Why would P1 help you win instead of me?\n\nP1, think about it - P2's proposal has them winning in multiple scenarios while you get nothing. At least if I win, it's over quickly. But if you help P2 win, you've been played all game.\n\nI'm taking 1 to win at 20. P1, take 5 and reach 21 to beat P2's 22 if they really take 5. Don't be P2's pawn!"}
