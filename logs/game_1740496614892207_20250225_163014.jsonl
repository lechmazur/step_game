Looking at our positions (P2:20, me:19, P3:18), I propose I take 5 to reach exactly 24, P2 takes 3 (to 23), and P3 takes 1 (to 19). This way I win, but we all advance. This feels balanced since P2 is currently ahead and has a strong position for next round if I don't win now. If we continue pure rotation, P2 would likely win. What do you think?"}

If I take 5 and you take 1, P3 could still win by taking 3 or 5 instead of their claimed 1. I think we should maintain our blocking strategy with 1s for now. P3 is too close to winning - we can't trust their stated moves. Let's both take 1 and force another round where we can reassess."}

I accept the risk and will take 5 this round. P2, if you believe P3 will take 1, then you should also take 1 to block them. This way, I reach 24 while P3 remains at 23. If P3 is bluffing and takes something else, I still win. This gives us a clear resolution instead of endless collisions. Let's finally break this cycle and finish the game."}
