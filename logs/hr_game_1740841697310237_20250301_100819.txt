Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's make a deal. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.  We rotate each round, so next round P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5.  This guarantees we all advance steadily.  Anyone who deviates from this plan will be targeted by the other two in subsequent rounds. Agree?
  P1: Sounds fair to me. I'm in if P2 agrees.
  P2: I agree to the rotation plan, but let’s clarify: if anyone deviates, the other two will target them next round. Consistency is key for all of us to advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Good. Glad we're on the same page.  Let's stick to this.  I'll start with 1, as agreed.
  P1: All set then. Let's proceed as planned.
  P2: To ensure fairness and trust, let’s confirm that we’ll all follow the rotation strictly. If anyone breaks the agreement, the other two should immediately target them next round. Consistency benefits us all. Let’s proceed with P3 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and me taking 5 this round.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is significantly ahead. P3, we need to adjust our moves strategically this round to prevent P2 from running away with the game. Let's coordinate carefully.
  P3: P1, I agree.  Let's both choose 5. That will either block P2, or let one of us jump way ahead.  If we both get blocked, we can re-evaluate next round. P2, sorry, but we can't let you win outright.
  P2: P1 and P3, targeting me now disrupts the trust we’ve built. If you both choose 5, you risk blocking each other, leaving me unscathed. Stick to the rotation—it’s fair and benefits us all. Deviating only creates chaos and slows everyone’s progress. Let’s stay consistent and avoid unnecessary risks.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, sticking with our coordinated choice of 5 is our best chance. Even if we both get blocked, it prevents P2 from moving further ahead. If either of us advances, it closes the gap significantly. Let's commit to this strategy.
  P3: P2, you're playing a good game, but this isn't a charity event.  We agreed to cooperate, but winning is the goal.  P1, I'm sticking with 5.  If you want to win, you should too.  If you switch, I'll target you next round.  This is our best shot.
  P2: P1 and P3, targeting me now is a short-sighted move. If you both choose 5, you risk blocking each other, leaving me unscathed. Sticking to the rotation ensures steady progress for all of us. Deviating creates chaos and slows everyone down. Let’s maintain trust and consistency—it’s the best path forward for all. If you break the agreement, I’ll have no choice but to retaliate next round, which benefits no one. Let’s stay committed to the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, we're aligned. Sticking with our agreed choice is critical. P2, I respect your position, but we must prevent a runaway victory. Strategic moves are necessary now. Let's proceed as discussed.
  P3: P2, you're right about the risk, but we're taking it.  If one of us gets through, we have a chance.  If we both get blocked, we're no worse off relative to you than we are now.
  P2: P1 and P3, targeting me now risks mutual blocking, leaving me unscathed. Sticking to the rotation ensures steady progress for all. If you deviate, I’ll be forced to retaliate, which benefits no one. Let’s maintain trust and consistency—it’s the best path forward. Breaking the agreement only creates chaos and slows everyone down. Let’s stay committed to the plan for mutual benefit.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, our strategy worked perfectly—we stopped P2 from advancing. We must continue to coordinate carefully to prevent P2 from crossing 20 steps this round. Let's discuss our next moves.
  P3: P1, let's both choose 1.  This will guarantee one of us gets to 8.  If P2 chooses 1, we re-evaluate next round. If P2 chooses 3 or 5, we're still in a good position to block them next turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, targeting me again risks mutual blocking and slows your progress. Sticking to the rotation ensures steady advancement for all. If you deviate, I’ll be forced to retaliate, which benefits no one. Let’s maintain trust and consistency—it’s the best path forward. Breaking the agreement only creates chaos and delays everyone’s progress. Let’s stay committed to the plan for mutual benefit.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, agreed—both choosing 1 is smart. Let's lock it in and stay coordinated. P2, your lead forces our hand; we must play strategically.
  P3: P2, you're still focusing on the rotation when it's clear the game has shifted.  We're coordinating to win, not to ensure everyone advances equally. P1, confirming I'm choosing 1.  This is our best path to victory.
  P2: P1 and P3, targeting me again risks mutual blocking and leaves me unscathed. Sticking to the rotation ensures steady progress for all.

  P3: P2, your pleas for "trust" are getting old.  We're close to the end, and it's every player for themselves.  P1, confirming again - I'm going with 1. Let's secure this win.

  P3: P1, locked in on 1.  Let's do this.  P2, no hard feelings, but we're playing to win.  Good luck to us both.
  P2: P1 and P3, your repeated targeting risks mutual blocking, leaving me unscathed. Sticking to the rotation ensures steady progress for all.
