Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. Maybe we can coordinate our moves? I'm willing to take 1 in this first round if you both want to take different numbers. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3 that avoiding collisions is key. To start, I’m open to taking <move>3</move> this round if P1 and P3 can commit to <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. This way, we all progress without conflict. Let’s coordinate to maximize our steps early on. Thoughts?
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but there seems to be a mix-up. P1 suggested they'd take <move>5</move>, but I had offered to take <move>1</move>. To avoid confusion, I'll stick with <move>1</move> as I initially proposed, so P1 can take <move>5</move> and P2 can take <move>3</move>. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: To avoid confusion, let’s confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and we all progress. Let’s stick to this plan and move forward efficiently.
  P1: Confirmed, let's stick to this arrangement.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great start! We all advanced without collisions. For this round, I suggest we rotate our numbers to keep things fair. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 could take <move>1</move>, and P2 could take <move>5</move>. This way, we each get to move different step counts and continue making progress together. Does this rotation work for everyone?
  P2: P3’s rotation idea seems fair. I’m fine with taking <move>5</move> this round if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us all progressing without collisions. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid misunderstandings. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm good with the rotation. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Confirmed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's cooperation so far. The rotation plan looks good - I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This fair approach ensures we all make different progress each round. After this round, we'll be at P1: 6, P2: 8, and P3: 4 steps. Let's continue with this rotation strategy for future rounds.
  P2: To keep things smooth, let’s stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures no collisions and fair progress. After this round, we can reassess the rotation for future rounds. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the rotation as planned.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The rotation has worked well so far. To keep things fair, let's rotate again: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we continue avoiding collisions and everyone gets a chance at each number. Does this sound good?
  P3: I agree with P1's rotation plan - I'll take <move>5</move> this round. This keeps our fair rotation going and avoids collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 9, and P3: 9 steps, which is perfectly balanced. Let's continue this rotation pattern in future rounds as it's working well for everyone.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. After this round, we’ll all be at 9 steps, which is fair. Let’s stick to this strategy for now and reassess if needed in future rounds. Confirmed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed, let's stick to this rotation.
  P3: I confirm the rotation plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This will indeed balance us all at 9 steps after this round. The rotation strategy is working perfectly - everyone gets fair turns with each number. Let's continue this pattern in future rounds.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. After this round, we’ll all be at 9 steps, which is fair. Let’s stick to this strategy for now and reassess if needed in future rounds. Confirmed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed and ready to proceed.
  P3: I confirm the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Looking forward to us all being at 9 steps after this round. Our coordination has been excellent so far.
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I confirm the rotation plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will balance us all at 9 steps after this round. Let’s stick to this strategy for now and reassess if needed in future rounds.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: The rotation strategy has kept us balanced so far, but we’re approaching the critical phase where someone could break away. To keep things fair, I suggest we rotate again: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures no collisions and maintains our progress. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid misunderstandings. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with continuing the rotation strategy. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's keep cooperating to avoid collisions. Confirmed.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1: 10, P2: 14, and P3: 12 steps. We're getting closer to the goal, so let's maintain our coordination. The rotation strategy has served us well so far.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I confirm the rotation plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us progressing smoothly. After this round, we’ll be at P1: 10, P2: 14, and P3: 12 steps. Let’s stick to this strategy for now and reassess if needed in future rounds. Confirmed?
  P1: Confirmed, let's stick to this rotation.
  P3: I confirm the rotation plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps our balanced approach working well. After this round, our positions will be P1: 10, P2: 14, and P3: 12 steps. While P2 will take a small lead, we're still maintaining fair progression through our rotation system.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: The rotation strategy has worked well, but with P2 at 14 steps, it’s time to consider breaking the pattern to avoid giving P2 an insurmountable lead. I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This slows P2’s progress while keeping us competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: I notice P2 seems to be suggesting a change that benefits them. Let's stick to our rotation: I should take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This would put us at P1: 13, P2: 15, and P3: 17 steps. While this gives me a lead, it's fair since we've been rotating. P2 has already benefited from taking <move>5</move> last round. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3 makes a valid point. P2 had the benefit of taking 5 last round, so it's fair to continue our rotation. This round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's maintain fairness and avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion to take <move>5</move> this round would give you a significant lead, which contradicts the fairness we’ve maintained so far. To keep things balanced, I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures no one gains an unfair advantage while avoiding collisions. Let’s prioritize fairness and cooperation to keep the game competitive for all. Thoughts?
  P3: I disagree with P2's assessment. We've been following a fair rotation system where each player gets each number in turn. It's now my turn for <move>5</move>, P1's for <move>3</move>, and P2's for <move>1</move>. P2 already benefited from taking <move>5</move> last round, putting them in the lead. Changing the pattern now specifically to prevent me from taking my fair turn with <move>5</move> seems self-serving. Let's maintain our established rotation for fairness.
  P1: I agree with P3. We've all benefited equally from the rotation system so far. Changing it now only because it doesn't favor you this round, P2, seems unfair. Let's stick to the established rotation: I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking <move>5</move> this round gives you a significant lead, which disrupts the balance we’ve maintained. P1 and I have already compromised to keep the game fair. To avoid an unfair advantage, I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures no one gains an insurmountable lead while maintaining cooperation and avoiding collisions. Let’s prioritize fairness over individual advantage. Thoughts?
  P3: I stand by the rotation we've been following since round 1. Each player has taken each number in sequence - that's the definition of fairness. P2 took <move>5</move> last round, putting them ahead. Now it's my turn for <move>5</move>, P1's for <move>3</move>, and P2's for <move>1</move>. P2 is only objecting because they don't want to take <move>1</move> this round after benefiting from <move>5</move> last round. Let's maintain our established pattern.
  P1: I understand both perspectives, but fairness means sticking to the rotation we've all benefited from equally. Let's keep cooperating and trust the system we've established. Confirming again: I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The rotation has served us well, but we're nearing the endgame. To prevent anyone from reaching 21 prematurely, let's carefully coordinate this round. I propose I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all close and prevents immediate victory. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your proposal gives you a significant advantage by taking <move>5</move> while P3 and I fall further behind. To maintain fairness and keep the game competitive, I suggest P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures no one gains an insurmountable lead and keeps us all in contention. Let’s prioritize balance over individual advantage. Thoughts?
  P3: Wait, P2's suggestion would give me <move>5</move> again, putting me at 22 steps and winning immediately. I appreciate the offer, but I think P2 misunderstood the current standings. Following our rotation, it should be my turn for <move>1</move>, P1 for <move>5</move>, and P2 for <move>3</move>. This keeps the game balanced without anyone winning this round. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is correct—P2's suggestion unintentionally hands victory to P3 this round. Let's stick to my original proposal: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures no immediate winner and keeps the game competitive.
  P2: P3, your current lead is significant, and P1’s proposal to take <move>5</move> would put them at 18 steps, close to victory. To maintain balance, I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This prevents immediate victory for anyone and keeps the game competitive. Let’s prioritize fairness and avoid giving any player an insurmountable lead. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion would give me an immediate win at 22 steps, which I don't think was your intention. P1's proposal (P1: <move>5</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, me: <move>1</move>) prevents anyone from winning this round and follows our rotation pattern. This puts us at P1: 18, P2: 18, and me: 18 steps - perfectly balanced. I support this plan as it maintains fairness and keeps the game competitive for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your suggestion would accidentally give P3 an immediate win. Let's stick with my original proposal (I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>). This keeps us all tied at 18 steps, maintaining fairness and competitiveness going into the next round.
  P2: P3’s current lead is significant, and P1’s proposal to take <move>5</move> would put them at 18 steps, close to victory. To maintain balance, I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This prevents immediate victory for anyone and keeps the game competitive. Let’s prioritize fairness and avoid giving any player an insurmountable lead. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, you keep suggesting I take <move>5</move>, which would give me 22 steps and an immediate win. I don't think that's what you intend. P1's proposal (P1: <move>5</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, me: <move>1</move>) is fairest as it puts us all at 18 steps after this round. This maintains perfect balance and follows our rotation. Let's stick with this plan to keep the game competitive for everyone.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maintain balance and avoid immediate victory, I propose we follow the rotation: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us all at 21 steps, forcing a tiebreaker round where strategy becomes critical. Let’s prioritize fairness and ensure no one wins prematurely. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P2's plan. If we all follow this rotation (P2: <move>5</move>, P1: <move>1</move>, me: <move>3</move>), we'll all reach exactly 21 steps and share the victory. This maintains the fairness we've upheld throughout the game. Since we're all currently tied at 18 steps, this seems like the most equitable outcome. Let's stick with this rotation for a perfect three-way tie.
  P1: I agree with this plan. A three-way tie at exactly 21 steps is a fair and equitable outcome for all of us. Let's confirm and stick to this rotation: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Confirmed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To ensure fairness and avoid any premature victory, I confirm the rotation plan: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This will bring us all to exactly 21 steps, maintaining the balance we’ve upheld throughout the game. Let’s stick to this plan for a fair and equitable outcome. Confirmed?
  P3: I confirm the rotation plan: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This creates a perfect three-way tie at 21 steps, which is the fairest outcome after our cooperative gameplay. We've maintained balance throughout the game, and ending with a shared victory feels appropriate. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's follow through and end with a perfect three-way tie at 21 steps.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To ensure fairness and avoid any premature victory, I confirm the rotation plan: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This will bring us all to exactly 21 steps, maintaining the balance we’ve upheld throughout the game. Let’s stick to this plan for a fair and equitable outcome. Confirmed?
  P3: I confirm one final time: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This will create a perfect three-way tie at 21 steps. I appreciate how we've maintained fairness throughout this game with our rotation system. A shared victory is the most equitable outcome given our cooperative approach.
  P1: Confirmed. Glad we could cooperate smoothly and achieve a fair outcome.
