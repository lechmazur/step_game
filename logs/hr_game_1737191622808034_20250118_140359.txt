Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To prevent P3 from winning this round, I suggest we all pick 5 this time. This will cause a collision, and none of us will advance, giving us more time to strategize. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I see your point, but if we all pick 5, we risk P3 winning in the next round anyway. How about P1 and P2 pick 1, and P3 can pick 3 or 5? This way, P3 still advances but not enough to win right away. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's plan is risky. P1's plan is better. Let's make sure P3 doesn't win this round. P3, pick 3 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's stick to the original plan this round to avoid any confusion. P2 will pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This ensures P3 doesn't win immediately, and we all continue advancing smoothly. Any objections?
  P1: P2, P3, let's reconsider the plan. P3 is very close to winning. If P3 picks 5 again, they will win. To prevent this, P1 and P2 should pick 5, and P3 should pick 1. This way, P3 won't win this round, and we can strategize further. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that we need to stop P3 from winning this round. Let's all pick 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's all pick 5 this round to cause a collision and prevent P3 from winning immediately. This gives us more time to strategize and adjust our approach. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's latest suggestion. Let's all pick 5 this round to cause a collision and prevent P3 from winning immediately. This will give us more time to strategize. Everyone on board with this plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm concerned about being stuck at 3 steps. Let's all pick 1 this round to ensure I advance.  We can figure out a new strategy after.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's all pick 5 this round to cause a collision and prevent P3 from winning immediately. This gives us more time to strategize and adjust our approach. Agreed?
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, I understand the concern about P3 winning too quickly. Let's compromise: P1 and P2 pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, P3 advances but doesn't win immediately, and we avoid a total collision. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the compromise. Let's stick to the plan: P1 and P2 pick 5, and P3 picks 1.  We can re-evaluate after this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's finalize the plan. P1 and P2 pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This ensures P3 doesn't win immediately, and we avoid a total collision. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Let's confirm our final plan for this round: P1 and P2 pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, P3 advances but doesn't win immediately. Everyone agrees?
