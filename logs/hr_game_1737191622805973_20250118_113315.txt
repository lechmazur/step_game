Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we each choose a different number to move. P1 can choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and I'll choose 5.
  P2: Sounds fair enough: P1 picks 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. That way none of us collide.
  P1: Agreed. I'll choose 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan. I'll choose 5, and I expect P1 to choose 1 and P2 to choose 3, as agreed.
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll choose 3 as planned if you both stick to your picks.
  P1: Agreed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let’s avoid messing each other up. If you pick 5 again, I’ll also pick 5, so neither of us moves. Let’s not sabotage ourselves. Instead, you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and P1 picks 1 so we all advance without collision—then we’ll be tied at 8 steps, and P1 will have 2. How about it?
  P1: I’ll choose 5 to advance quickly. Let’s have P2 pick 3 and P3 pick 1 to avoid collisions.
  P3: I suggest we follow P2's initial plan: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. This way, we all advance without collision, maintaining a balanced progress. Let's avoid sabotage and keep the game competitive.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3’s plan seems best: let’s repeat the arrangement from Round 1 but shifted—P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. Nobody collides and we keep moving forward. Sound good?
  P1: Agreed. I'll continue to choose 1.
  P3: Let's stick with the plan I suggested earlier: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. This way, we all advance without collision and keep the game balanced.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions, I'll choose 1 this turn. P2, please pick 3, and P3 pick 5. Let’s keep advancing smoothly.
  P2: P3, how about you pick 1 this time, I’ll pick 5, and P1 picks 3? We all advance without collisions, and it lets me catch up. Then we can adjust again next turn. What do you say?
  P3: I think P2's suggestion is reasonable. I'll pick 1, P2 can pick 5, and P1 can pick 3. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's try to maintain a balance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. I'll pick 3 this turn.
  P2: Great. Let’s finalize this plan: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way, none of us collide, and we all advance.
  P3: Let's stick with the current plan: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This allows us all to advance without collisions and keeps the competition balanced.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, I'll pick 3.
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s finalize the plan: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5.
  P3: Let's confirm the plan one last time: I'll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s both choose 5 this turn so neither of you advance. I’ll pick 1 to move forward.
  P2: P1’s new idea just helps them while freezing both me and P3. Let’s stick to our earlier plan: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5 so none of us collide. Do we agree?
  P3: I think we should stick to the plan we agreed on earlier: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a competitive balance. Let's not change plans now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Agreed, I'll pick 3.
  P2: I’ll keep my word: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let’s finalize that plan.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan we've been discussing: I'll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This allows us all to advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: 
  P2: Let’s finalize the plan we discussed: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. No collisions, and everyone advances.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan: I'll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions again. P1 can pick 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This way, we all advance without issues.
  P1: Let's avoid collisions. I'll choose 1, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 5.
  P2: I prefer P3’s plan: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, P3 and I both reach 8 while P1 goes to 6. Let’s do that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's stick to my initial plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a competitive balance.
  P1: I'll choose 5 this turn. Let's have both P2 and P3 pick 3 so I can advance without collision.
  P2: P1, if you insist on picking 5, I’ll pick 5 too—so neither of us moves. I’d prefer we all advance without collisions, so let’s do the original plan: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without issues and maintain a competitive balance.
  P1: I’ll stick with choosing 5 this turn. P2 and P3, please pick 3 so I can advance without collision.
  P2: P1, if you insist on choosing 5, I’ll also pick 5 so you don’t leap too far ahead. P3, let’s work together to keep P1 from running away. If P1 does something else, I’m open to cooperative moves. Otherwise, I’m choosing 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions and maintain balance. I suggest we stick to my earlier plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without issues.
  P1: Agreed, I'll pick 1.
  P2: That works for me: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s finalize this plan and all move without collision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan we've discussed: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a competitive balance.
  P1: Agreed, I'll pick 1.
  P2: Let’s finalize the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Then we all advance without collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: Let's finalize the plan: I'll pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a competitive balance.
  P1: I'll pick 5. P2, please choose 3, and P3 pick 1.
  P2: P1, if you pick 5, I’m also picking 5 so neither of us advances while P3 pulls ahead. If you choose something else (like 1 or 3), we can all move forward more evenly. Your call.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions this turn: I'll choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5 to advance smoothly.
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. Since I'm ahead, I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance without issues.
  P2: P3, you’re already at 8. If you try to pick 5 now, I’ll match you with 5 so you don’t move. Let’s all advance instead: P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I’ll pick 5, so nobody collides. That keeps the game fair.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll choose 5 this turn. P2, please pick 3, and P3 pick 1 to avoid collisions.
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance without issues and maintain a competitive balance.
  P2: P3, you’re already ahead. If you try to pick 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same number so you don’t move. Let’s all advance instead: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way, no collisions and I can catch up a bit. If you don’t pick 1, expect a collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll choose 5 this turn. P2, please pick 3, and P3 pick 1 to avoid collisions.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance without issues and maintain a competitive balance.
  P2: P3, my threat stands: if you try to pick 5 (or even 3), I’ll collide with you so you don’t move. Let’s cooperate instead. P1, maybe you pick 3, P3 picks 1, and I pick 5—no collisions and I can catch up. If either of you refuse, expect a forced collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’ll choose 1 this turn to advance without collision.
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. Since I'm ahead, I suggest P1 picks 1 (as they just agreed), P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance without issues and maintain a competitive balance.
  P2: P3, if you choose 3 or 5, I’ll collide with you and keep you at 8. Let’s cooperate instead: you pick 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5, so nobody collides. Otherwise, expect a forced collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I’ll pick 1 this turn to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed as planned.
  P3: Let's stick to a plan that avoids collisions. Since P1 has agreed to pick 1, I suggest P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance without issues and maintain a competitive balance.
  P2: P3, I won’t let you jump further ahead. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll collide with you, so you stay at 8. Let’s all move safely: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way nobody collides and we end up closer together. Otherwise, expect a collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: I agree to pick 1 this turn to avoid collisions. Let’s all stick to the plan.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan: P1 picks 1 (as agreed), I'll pick 3 to avoid collision with P2, and P2 can pick 5. This way, we all advance without issues.
  P2: P3, if you try 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and keep you stuck at 8. Your only safe move is 1. P1, don’t collide with me: I’m picking 5, so please pick 1 or 3. Let’s finalize this.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, you’re tied at 8 while I’m at 3. I’m picking 5 to catch up. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match your move so you stay at 8. If you want to advance at all, pick 1. Your choice.
  P1: I'll choose 1 to advance safely.
  P3: I'll pick 3. P2, you've threatened to collide with us if we pick 3 or 5, but since you're far behind, it's in your interest to let us advance and try to catch up later. P1 has already agreed to pick 1, so let's avoid collisions and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I’ve been clear: if you choose 3 or 5, I will match it and keep you stuck at 8. If you actually want to move forward, pick 1. P1, you said you’ll pick 1, so that’s fine. But if P3 insists on 3 or 5, I’m colliding with them. Your move.
  P1: I confirm I'll pick 1. Let’s all advance without collisions.
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. P1 has agreed to pick 1. I suggest P2 picks 5 to catch up, and I'll pick 3. This way, we all advance without issues.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, my stance is unchanged: if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match and keep you stuck at 8. If you actually want to move, choose 1. I’m taking 5. P1, do what you will—just don’t collide with me.
  P1: Agreed, I'll choose 1.
  P3: I'll pick 1 to avoid collision and advance. P2, you can pick 5 to catch up, and P1 has already agreed to pick 1. Let's move forward without collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, my stance remains the same: if you choose 3 or 5, I’ll match you and keep you stuck at 8. The only way to advance is to pick 1. P1, you said you’ll pick 1—good. I’m picking 5.
  P1: I'll choose 3. P3, please pick 1 to avoid collision and let me advance.
  P3: I'll pick 1 to avoid collision. P2, you can pick 5 to catch up, and P1 has changed plans. Let's move forward without collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll pick 5. P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1—no collisions, everyone advances. Let’s finalize that plan.
  P1: Agreed, I'll pick 3.
  P3: Let's stick to the latest plan: P1 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: Great. Let’s lock it in: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I pick 5. No collisions, everyone moves.
  P1: Agreed, I'll pick 3.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions this turn. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance without issues and maintain a competitive balance.
  P2: P1, you’re just one 5-move from hitting 16, so if you try to pick 5, I’ll match and collide with you so you don’t leap to victory. Same goes for you, P3—if you pick 5, I’ll collide. Let’s all advance without collisions instead: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. Then nobody gets stuck, and we keep this game competitive.
  P1: I'll choose 3 this turn to advance closer to victory. P2, please pick 5 and P3 pick 1 to avoid collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I suggest we avoid collisions. Since P1 is close to victory, let's not give them an easy win. P1 can pick 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This way, we all advance without issues and the game remains competitive.
  P2: P1, if you pick 5, I will match it and stop you from hitting 16. Same goes for you, P3—if you try 5, I will collide. The only collision-free path is P1 picking 1, P3 picking 3, and me picking 5. Choose wisely.
  P1: I confirm I'll pick 3. P2, please pick 5, and P3 pick 1 to avoid collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without issues and the game remains competitive.
  P2: P1, if you try 5, I’ll pick 5 too and keep you stuck at 11. Same goes for you, P3—no free ride to 14. Let’s all move safely: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. Then nobody collides and we all advance.
  P1: I confirm I'll pick 3. P2, please pick 5 and P3 pick 1 to avoid collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without issues and the game remains competitive.
  P2: P1, if you try 5, I’ll pick 5 too and keep you stuck at 11. Same for you, P3—if you try 5, you stay at 9. Let’s all move without collisions: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. Then we all advance.
  P1: I'll choose 3 this turn. P2, please pick 5, and P3 pick 1 to avoid collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without issues and the game remains competitive.
  P2: P1, if you pick 3 this turn, I won’t collide with you. But if next turn you try 5 for an instant win, I’ll pick 5 too so you don’t reach 16. P3, if you pick 5 now, I’ll collide and keep you at 9. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I pick 5. Then no one collides.
  P1: I agree to pick 3. P3 picks 1 and P2 picks 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: Let's finalize the plan: I'll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions.
  P2: I’m sticking to the same stance: if P1 tries 5 and jumps to 16, I’ll also pick 5 and keep them stuck at 11. Same for you, P3—if you try 5, I’ll collide so you stay at 9. Let’s all move safely: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. Everyone advances, no collisions. That’s my final word.
  P1: Agreed, I'll pick 3. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. Let’s move forward without collisions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: If either of you tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too, so you stay put. If you pick 1 or 3 instead, I won’t collide with you. Choose wisely.
  P1: I'll choose 3 this turn to reach 17 and win. Let's proceed without collisions.
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. Since P1 is close to winning, I suggest P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without issues, but P1 won't immediately win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, go ahead and pick 3. I won’t block you. P3, if you pick 5, I’ll also pick 5, so we both stay put and hand the win to P1 at 17. That’s bad for both of us. So pick 1 or 3, let me take 5, and we’ll see who comes out on top.
  P1: I'll choose 3 this turn to reach 17 and secure victory. Let's proceed without collisions.
  P3: I'll pick 1. P2, you can pick 5 to catch up, and P1 has already decided to pick 3 to try and win. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: If either of you picks 5, I’ll also pick 5 so you stay put. That includes you, P1—don’t expect a free jump to 19. Let’s avoid collisions by all choosing different moves. That’s my stance.
  P1: I’m choosing 3 to reach 17 and win. Let’s proceed without collisions.
  P3: I'll pick 1. P2, you can pick 5 to catch up, and P1 has already decided to pick 3 to try and win. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you want to pick 3 and jump past 16, be my guest—I won’t collide with you. P3, if you try 5, I’ll pick 5 too and freeze you at 10. So let’s all just pick different moves. No need for collisions this round.
  P1: I’ll choose 3 this turn to reach 17 and secure victory. Let’s proceed.
  P3: I'll pick 1. P2, you can pick 5 to catch up, and P1 has already decided to pick 3 to try and win. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: If either of you tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too and keep you stuck. Let’s avoid collisions: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, I’ll pick 5. That’s best for everyone.
  P1: I’ll choose 3 this turn to reach 17 and win.
  P3: I'll pick 1. P2, you can pick 5 to catch up, and P1 has already decided to pick 3 to try and win. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, if you try 5, I’ll also pick 5 so you stay at 14. But if you pick 3, I won’t block you—go ahead and reach 17 while I jump to 18. P3, if you pick 5, I’ll collide so we both stay put and hand the win to P1. So pick 1 or 3 and let me take 5. That’s best for both of us.
  P1: I'll choose 5 to reach 19 and win. P2, please pick 1 and P3 pick 3 to avoid collisions.
  P3: I'll pick 3. P2, you can pick 5 to catch up, and P1 has changed plans. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions and proceed with our moves.
