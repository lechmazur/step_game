Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions on this first turn. I'm thinking of going for a moderate move. What numbers are you both considering?
  P1: I'm leaning towards a smaller move this round to see how things play out.  P3, what do you consider "moderate"?
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: By moderate I mean 3. Since P2 has stopped talking and P1 hinted at a smaller move, this could work well for all of us. I'll
  P1: I agree that avoiding collisions is a good strategy early on.  I'm thinking 1 this round. Does that work for you, P3?
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate your openness P1. Yes, if you go with 1 and I go with 3, that works well for both of us. Let's see what P2 chooses.
  P1: P3, if P2 chooses 5, we'll both be blocked. Maybe consider 1 this round to ensure at least one of us advances? It's early, and we can adjust our strategy later.
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand your concern P1, but I'll stick with my plan of 3. Since P2 hasn't engaged in conversation, they might choose randomly or stay conservative.
  P1: P3, while I respect your confidence, I'm still worried about P2 potentially choosing 5.  If we both move, we risk losing progress.  I'm willing to take a risk and go for 5 myself this round. If you want to avoid a collision, maybe consider 1?
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, since P3 is already ahead, we need to make a strategic move. If we both go for 5, we can potentially overtake P3 this round. Are you willing to take that risk with me?
  P3: I see what you're trying to do P1, coordinating with P2 against me. But remember, if you both go for 5, you'll just block each other again. I suggest we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions - it's in everyone's best interest.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your silence, but your move matters. P3 is gaining ground. If you're not willing to risk 5, maybe consider 1. That way, at least one of us advances and puts pressure on P3.  We need to work together to catch up!
  P3: I maintain my lead and want to keep advancing. I suggest P1 and P2 each pick different numbers to avoid another collision. I'll be making a strategic choice that won't interfere with either 1 or 5. Let's all advance this round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly trying to isolate us. If we both choose 1, we can guarantee advancement and put pressure on P3. Are you with me?
  P3: I see P1 is now trying to coordinate with P2 to both pick 1. That would be a mistake since they'd both get blocked again. P2, you've been quiet but smart - don't fall for P1's suggestions that keep leading to collisions.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to divide us. We both need to make a bold move. Let's both go for 5 this round. We can catch up to P3 quickly if we coordinate. Are you in?
  P3: P1 keeps changing their suggested coordination with P2, first 5, then 1, now back to 5. This inconsistency shows they're not a reliable partner. I'll make my move based on what I think will work best for my position.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm in the lead and want to maintain it. Last round showed that coordination attempts lead to collisions. Let's each choose our own paths independently - it's the only way we'll all make progress. I'll make my own strategic choice this round.
  P1: P3, I agree that coordinated moves haven't worked out well so far. But we can't let you run away with the lead. P2, I propose we both pick 1 this round. It's a safe bet and guarantees us both advancement. What do you say? Let's put some pressure on P3.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're still trying to coordinate with P2 despite it failing twice. That strategy clearly isn't working. I suggest everyone make their own independent choices this round - it's the only way we've seen any progress so far.
  P1: P2, I understand your silence, but a decision needs to be made. P3 is pulling ahead. If you're not willing to risk 5 with me, then 1 is the only way to guarantee progress. Let's at least make sure someone catches up to P3 this round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1's persistent attempts to coordinate with P2 have only led to both of them staying at 0 steps. I'll continue making independent moves that serve my interests best. P2 has been wise to stay quiet - maybe that's a sign they'll make their own strategic choice this round too.
  P1: P2, P3 is playing it safe and relying on our failures to coordinate.  We need to be bold. Let's both go for 5 this round.  If we both advance, we'll tie P3. Are you in?
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1's strategy of constantly switching between suggesting 1 and 5 to P2 shows desperation. I'll maintain my lead by making smart, independent choices. Let's end this conversation and move forward.
  P1: P2, I understand your silence, but we need to act decisively. P3 is gaining ground. If we both choose 3 this round, we can tie them. Let's work together to even the playing field. Are you with me?
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're making progress! P3 seems content to play it safe. We have a chance to overtake them if we work together. I'm thinking 5 this round. Will you join me?
  P3: I see P1 is still trying to coordinate with P2 for a 5. Since I'm close to both of you, I'll be making my own strategic choice that maximizes my chances of advancing. Let's all choose independently and see who makes the best move.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is playing it safe and hoping we'll collide again. We need to be bold. 5 this round? Let's close the gap.
  P3: P1 keeps pushing for risky coordinated moves that have mostly backfired. With the race this close, I'll continue making independent choices that serve my interests. P2 has shown wisdom in staying quiet and making their own moves. Let's each choose our own path this round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly trying to stay ahead by playing it safe. We need to be bold. I'm going for 5. Will you join me and take the lead?
  P3: P1's persistence in coordinating high-risk moves has consistently led to collisions. With the race this close, I'll make a calculated move to advance my position. I suggest we all choose independently - it's been the most successful strategy so far.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 is playing it safe, hoping we'll block each other again. Let's both go for 5 and take the lead. Are you with me?
  P3: P1's constant push for coordinated 5s with P2 is getting predictable. With the race so close and all of us within 2 steps of each other, I'll make my own strategic choice to advance. Let's end this conversation and move forward.

  P1: P2, we're neck and neck. P3 is playing it safe. Let's both go for 5 and secure the lead. We can finish this round.  Are you in?
  P3: P1 keeps trying to coordinate 5s with P2, but that's led to collisions in 3 out of 4 rounds. With all of us close together, I'll make my own strategic choice to advance. P2, you've been successful when ignoring P1's coordination attempts - let's all choose independently.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to sow discord. We're in a tight race. Trust me, 5 is the only way to win this. Let's finish this.
  P3: P1's constant coordination attempts with P2 have mostly failed, yet they persist. With us tied at 5 steps, I'll be making a strategic choice that maximizes my chances of winning. Let's each make our own moves and see who plays it smartest.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, ignore P3's attempts to divide us. We're so close. Let's both go for 5 and finish this. One more push together and victory is ours!
  P3: P1's desperation is showing - they've suggested 5 to P2 in almost every round, usually leading to mutual blocking. With P2 and I tied for the lead, I'll continue making independent strategic moves. Let's end this conversation and play smart.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, we're tied. P3 is playing it safe, hoping we'll collide again.  Let's both go for 5 and end this. Don't let them win by default!  Are you with me?
  P3: P1's strategy of pushing for coordinated 5s has consistently failed. At 5 steps and tied for the lead, I'll continue making smart, independent moves. Let's end this conversation and see who plays it best.

  P1: P2, we're in a good position! P3 is ahead but vulnerable. If we both go for 5 this round, we can overtake them. They're expecting us to collide, let's prove them wrong and take the lead together.  Are you in?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1 continues their pattern of trying to coordinate 5s with P2, which has repeatedly failed. With my lead at 8 steps, I'll continue making independent strategic moves. P2 has shown good judgment in making their own choices - let's all do that this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to bait us into another collision. Let's prove them wrong. 5 this round. We can win this together.
  P2: <stop>
