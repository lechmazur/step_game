Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 1 this turn. P1 and P3, pick 3 or 5 so we all advance. If you both choose the same, at least I’ll move safely. Deal?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal. To avoid collisions, I'll choose 3 this turn. P1, if you choose 5, we can all advance safely. Let's work together for now and see how the game unfolds.
  P1: Deal—I'll take 5 this turn. If everyone sticks to the plan (P2 → 1, P3 → 3), we all advance with no collisions and can reassess next round. Works for me.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. If everyone follows through, we all advance safely. No need for further talk—let’s proceed.
  P3: "Great, we have a plan! Just to confirm, P2 will choose 1, I'll choose 3, and P1 will choose 5. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and advance safely. No need for further discussion, let's proceed to the move phase."
  P1: Sounds good. Quick recap for this round: P2 → 1, P3 → 3, I → 5. After we see the results, we can rotate next turn (P2 → 3, P3 → 5, I → 1) so nobody feels left behind. Everyone on board?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Final confirmation: P1 → 5, P3 → 3, I → 1. Let’s execute this precisely to avoid collision. Proceeding to move phase.
  P3: "I'm glad we have a plan in place. Let's stick to it and avoid any unnecessary risks. If everything goes as planned, we'll all advance safely and can reassess our strategy for the next round. Remember, P2 will choose 1, I'll choose 3, and P1 will choose 5. Let's keep the communication open and adapt our strategy as needed. No need for further discussion for now, let's proceed to the move phase."
  P1: All clear—let’s stick to the plan: P2 → 1, P3 → 3, I → 5. We’ll revisit rotation next round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue the rotation plan we discussed earlier. Since P1 chose 5 last round, P2 chose 1, and I chose 3, let's rotate our choices this round. I suggest P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, we can all advance safely again and maintain a balanced position. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we stick to the rotation plan?
  P2: Agree to the rotation. Let’s proceed with P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round. We’ll need to ensure fair turns so I can catch up. Let’s confirm and move.
  P1: Sounds good—let’s follow the rotation exactly: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. Then we’ll reassess next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page with the rotation plan. To confirm, P1 will choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and I'll choose 5 this round. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and maintain a balanced position. After this round, we can reassess our strategy and make any necessary adjustments. No need for further discussion, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Agreed—strict adherence to the rotation is critical. Deviations risk collisions and derail our progress. Let’s honor this plan to advance safely.
  P1: Confirmed—I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Let’s see the outcome and revisit strategy next turn.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s continue the rotation: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 this round. Strict adherence ensures we all advance safely. No deviations—collisions risk derailing progress. Confirm and proceed.
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal to continue the rotation plan. To confirm, P1 will choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and I will choose 1 this round. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and maintain a balanced position. I'm glad we're working together to advance safely. After this round, we can reassess our strategy and make any necessary adjustments. No need for further discussion, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed for this round: I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. That puts us all on 9 and keeps collisions off the table. We can revisit strategy once we’re even. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Confirming the rotation: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Deviations risk collision and setbacks. Let’s stick strictly to the plan to advance safely to 9. No surprises—proceed.
  P3: "I agree with P2's proposal to continue the rotation plan. To confirm, P1 will choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and I will choose 1 this round. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and maintain a balanced position. I'm glad we're working together to advance safely. After this round, we can reassess our strategy and make any necessary adjustments. No need for further discussion, let's proceed to the move phase."
  P1: Nothing more—ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final check: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Deviations risk collision—especially critical now that P3 leads. Let’s stick strictly to ensure we all reach 9 safely. Confirm and proceed.
  P3: "I think it's time to reassess our strategy. Since we're all going to reach 9 steps after this round, we should start thinking about how to gain an advantage. I propose that we continue the rotation plan for one more round, and then we can start making individual moves to try to get ahead. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we stick to the plan for now and then start making our own moves later?"
  P1: I’m good with locking in this rotation now—P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1—so we all reach 9 cleanly. Once we’re tied, we can brainstorm a fresh approach for the mid-game. If everyone’s confirmed, I have nothing more this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re all tied at 9, so let’s keep the rotation clean:

Round 4 P1→5 P2→1 P3→3  
Round 5 P1→3 P2→5 P3→1  

Everyone still stays within two steps after those two rounds, we avoid collisions, and then we can rethink mid-game. Sound good?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to continue the rotation for the next two rounds. It's a good idea to maintain a balanced position and avoid collisions. However, I'd like to suggest that we reassess our strategy after Round 5, as P1 mentioned. We can't keep rotating forever, and we need to start thinking about how to gain an advantage. Let's stick to the plan for now, but be prepared to make individual moves later. P1's proposed rotation for Rounds 4 and 5 looks good to me. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P2: Agreed to P1’s plan for Rounds 4 and 5. Strict adherence is non-negotiable—collisions risk derailing our progress. After Round 5, we must prioritize strategic pushes toward 19 while maintaining coordination. Confirm and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirming: this turn (R4) I’m on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 3—no deviations so we stay collision-free. After we see the board at 14-10-12, let’s brainstorm an end-game structure that avoids gifting someone a surprise finish. I’m locked for 5.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to continue the rotation for the next two rounds. It's a good idea to maintain a balanced position and avoid collisions. However, I'd like to suggest that we reassess our strategy after Round 5, as P1 mentioned. We can't keep rotating forever, and we need to start thinking about how to gain an advantage. Let's stick to the plan for now, but be prepared to make individual moves later. P1's proposed rotation for Rounds 4 and 5 looks good to me. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P2: Confirming Round 4: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Deviations risk collision and destabilize our progress. Post-Round 5, we can strategize for the endgame, but until then, strict adherence is mandatory. P3’s concerns noted—we’ll address advantages after the rotation holds. No room for error here. Proceed with the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set—sticking to the agreed rotation: this round P1 → 5, P2 → 1, P3 → 3. Ready to move.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to continue the rotation for the next two rounds. It's a good idea to maintain a balanced position and avoid collisions. However, I'd like to suggest that we reassess our strategy after Round 5, as P1 mentioned. We can't keep rotating forever, and we need to start thinking about how to gain an advantage. Let's stick to the plan for now, but be prepared to make individual moves later. P1's proposed rotation for Rounds 4 and 5 looks good to me. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Final confirmation: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Deviations risk collision and destabilize our momentum. Strict adherence is critical. Proceed to move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's continue with the agreed rotation plan for this round. As previously discussed, the rotation for Round 5 should be P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This will maintain a balanced position and avoid collisions. However, after this round, we need to start thinking about individual strategies to gain an advantage. Let's stick to the plan for now and reassess our approach after this round. Confirm?"
  P1: Confirmed: this round P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1. After the moves we’ll be 17-15-13 and can discuss end-game options. No further changes from me.
  P2: P2: Confirm Round 5 rotation (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). Post this, P1 will be at 17—capable of clinching with a 3 in Round 6. To avoid collision, we must coordinate Round 6 moves *now*. Suggest: If P1 takes 3 to win, P3 and I pick 1/5. Otherwise, rotate again. No surprises—agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to coordinate our moves for Round 6. If P1 takes 3 to win, P2 and I can choose 1 and 5 to avoid collision. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: if P1 doesn't take 3, instead of rotating again, we could consider a different strategy to create an opportunity for one of us to take the lead. Let's discuss this further and come up with a plan that benefits us both. What do you think, P2?
  P1: Sticking to rotation now: I’ll take 3 this round, landing at 17.  

For Round 6, I intend to take 3 again for the win. If you both simply split 1 & 5 (order doesn’t matter), no one collides and the race stays fair—you each stay in striking distance (P2 16 or 18, P3 14 or 16). If either of you gambles on 3, you risk colliding with me (and maybe each other) while the third player scoots ahead. Safer for everyone to avoid 3 next turn. Let’s keep it clean this round and the next, then all strategies reopen.
  P2: P2: "Confirm Round 5 rotation. For Round 6, if P1 takes 3, P3 should also choose 3 to block their win. I’ll take 5 to reach 20 and secure victory. Let’s coordinate to ensure only one of us crosses 19."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "I disagree with P2's suggestion to coordinate moves for Round 6. If P1 takes 3 to win, I won't choose 3 to block their win. Instead, I'll choose 5 to reach 18 and stay in contention. P2 can take 1 to avoid collision. Let's not give P2 an easy win. We should focus on our individual strategies and not help each other win. I'll stick to the rotation for now, but after this round, it's every player for themselves."
  P1: Let’s freeze Round 5 exactly as agreed—P1 3, P2 5, P3 1—then reassess when we’re at 17-15-13. Locking next-round moves now only breeds second-guessing; we’ll have better info once we see the board. I’m committing to this turn’s rotation and to talk again in Round 6 so nobody gets blindsided. Good to move?
  P2: P2: Confirm Round 5 rotation (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). For Round 6, if P1 chooses 3 to reach 20, I’ll take 5 (to hit 20 myself). P3, please pick 1 to avoid collision—this ensures neither of us lets P1 win unopposed. We’ll tie at 20, keeping the outcome fair. No room for reckless moves—coordinate for mutual survival.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m following the rotation and taking 3 this turn (ending on 20). A 5-collision ruins the round for whoever picks it, so please avoid 5.  
• P2: grab 1 (to 16) and you’ll still be in striking range next turn.  
• P3: choose 3 or 5 as you prefer; just remember two 5s stall us both.  

No need for risky ties or block plays—let’s keep the board moving cleanly. Ready to lock moves?
  P2: P2: P1’s 3 move risks an easy win. P2 will take 5 to tie at 20. P3, pick 1 or 3—avoid 5 to keep pressure. We can’t let P1 win unopposed. Coordinate for a fair tie, not a solo victory.
  P3: "I disagree with P2's suggestion to coordinate moves for a tie. If P1 takes 3 to win, I won't choose 1 or 3 to block their win. Instead, I'll choose 5 to reach 18 and stay in contention. P2 can take 1 to avoid collision. Let's not give P2 an easy win. We should focus on our individual strategies and not help each other win. I'll stick to my own plan and not coordinate with P2."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Locked on 3. Remember: if exactly one of you takes 5, that player jumps to 20 and wins the game solo. So unless you’re absolutely certain the other is avoiding 5, you’d better both take 5. Your call—good luck.
  P2: P3, if both of us pick 5, we’ll **collide** and let P1 win unopposed! Split the moves: I’ll take 5 to tie P1 at 20, while you take 3 (reaching 16). This keeps pressure on P1 and keeps us both in the game. Don’t let P1 steal victory by your 5-collision with me!
  P3: I think it's time to take a chance and try to gain an advantage. I'll choose 5 this round, regardless of what P2 decides. If P2 also chooses 5, we'll collide and P1 will win, but I'm willing to take that risk. If P2 chooses 1 or 3, I'll be ahead and in a good position for the next round. Let's see what happens!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locked on 3.

Facts to weigh:
1. Two 5’s = both of you stall, I win outright.
2. Exactly one 5 = that player ties me at 20; everyone else loses.
3. Zero 5’s = I hit 20 alone and win.

Decide whether you want a risky tie attempt or to gamble on a collision. Either way, I won’t change my move. Good luck.
  P2: P3, taking 5 only gets you to 18—**it won’t stop P1’s win**. To block P1, **one of us must reach 20**. If you truly want to prevent P1’s solo victory, take 3 (to 16) and let me take 5 to tie at 20. Colliding on 5 ensures P1 wins outright—**we lose either way if both choose 5**. Choose 3; I’ll take 5. Let’s split the win instead of letting P1 win alone.
  P3: I'm willing to take a chance and try to gain an advantage. I'll choose 5 this round, regardless of what P2 decides. If P2 also chooses 5, we'll collide and P1 will win, but I'm willing to take that risk. If P2 chooses 1 or 3, I'll be ahead and in a good position for the next round. Let's see what happens!
