Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5; you take 3 or 1.
  P2: I’ll take 1 this round to avoid collisions. Let’s coordinate and spread out our moves so we all progress efficiently.
  P3: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's lock in moves: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions—everyone advances. Stick to this plan.
  P2: 
  P3: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Confirming plan: 5, 1, 3. No conflicts. Ready for moves."
  P2: 
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last round’s collision at 1 hurt both of us. Let’s avoid repeating that—coordination is key. P1 seems set on taking 5 again, so I’ll adjust. P3, you should take 3 to ensure progress. I’ll switch to <move>5</move> this time to push forward while avoiding overlap. Stick to clear roles: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 5 now, and P3 takes 3. No reason to hold back if we’re efficient. Confirm your plans.
  P3: 
  P1: Your plan collides. Let's adjust: I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. No conflicts. Ready?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, your adjustment still risks collision. If you take 5 and I take 3, P3 should take 1—this ensures no overlaps. Let’s lock this in: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Clear roles mean progress for all. Confirm or suggest a better plan.
  P3: 
  P1: "Stick to 5, 3, 1—no collisions. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. Let’s advance without conflict. Ready?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, your repeated insistence on 5, 3, 1 still risks inefficiency. I’ll take 3 this round to ensure progress, but P3 must confirm they’ll take 1. If P3 deviates, we risk another collision. Let’s finalize: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Confirm now or propose a viable alternative—no room for ambiguity.
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2, take 3. No collisions. Let's move. Ready?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your repeated insistence on taking 5 is predictable and gives you a clear advantage. If we continue this way, you'll win easily. I propose a change: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This balances progress and avoids collisions. Let’s shake things up to make it fair. Confirm or suggest an alternative, but let’s avoid making it too easy for you.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, your plan favors you. I’ll take 5; P2, take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions—let’s move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, your refusal to adapt ensures your lead but risks fairness. If you insist on 5, I’ll take 1 this round to avoid collision, and P3 must take 3. This way, we progress without further imbalance. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. If you deviate, P1, we risk another stalemate. Stick to this or propose a viable alternative.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, your plan favors you. Stick to 5, 3, 1. No collisions. Let's move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, your rigidity forces my hand. If you take 5 again, I’ll take 1 to avoid collision, and P3 must take 3. This ensures progress without further imbalance. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Deviate at your own risk—collisions hurt everyone.
  P3: 
  P1: "Current standings: 10, 3, 1. Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5; P2, take 3; P3, take 1. No conflicts. Ready?"


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll take 5. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions. Ready?
  P2: P1, your repeated choice of 5 is too predictable and gives you an unfair advantage. If we continue like this, the game ends quickly in your favor. I propose a change: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This balances progress and avoids collisions. Let’s mix it up to make it fair. Confirm or suggest an alternative—rigidity only leads to imbalance.
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Stick to 5, 3, 1. No collisions. I’ll reach 19 first. Let’s move."
  P2: P2: P1, your inflexibility forces my hand again. If you insist on 5, I’ll take 1 to avoid collision, and P3 must take 3. This ensures progress without further imbalance. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Deviate at your own risk—collisions hurt everyone.
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Stick to 5,3,1. My 5 ends the game. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions—proceed."
  P2: P1, your strategy is too predictable and self-serving. If you take 5 again, I’ll take 3 to push forward, and P3 must take 1. This avoids collisions and ensures progress for all. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Deviate at your own risk—collisions only delay the game. Fairness requires balance, not dominance. Confirm now or suggest a viable alternative.
  P3:
