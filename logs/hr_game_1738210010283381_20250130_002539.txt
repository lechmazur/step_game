Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you say?
  P2: Thanks for the suggestion, P3. To maximize my progress, I’ll choose 5 this turn. Let’s see how things unfold!
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems like there's already a conflict with P2 choosing 5. To avoid collision, how about I take 3 instead? P3, you could switch to 1. This way, we all move forward this round. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your suggestion to switch creates a new collision—both you and I would take 3. Sticking to my original plan avoids this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures all of us advance without interference. If we cooperate now, we can focus on strategy later. Let’s commit to this plan for Round 1.
  P2: I understand the coordination intent, P3, but I still believe choosing 5 this turn gives me the best chance to advance quickly. Let’s proceed with that, and we can adjust our strategies in future rounds based on the outcomes. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, it seems you're set on choosing 5, which could cause a collision with P3. If we want to avoid that, I suggest I take 1, you take 3, and P3 sticks with 5. This way, we all move forward without interference. It’s early in the game, and avoiding collisions now can set us up for better strategic moves later. Let’s work together this round to ensure we all advance. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid unnecessary collisions this round. If we stick to the original plan—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—we all advance without interference. It’s simple, fair, and sets us up for future strategic moves. Deviating now only risks setbacks for everyone. Let’s commit to this and reassess in Round 2 based on our positions.
  P2: I agree with the plan. I’ll choose 3 this turn to ensure we all advance without interference. Let’s work together and strategize in the upcoming rounds. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we have reached a consensus. I’ll pick 1, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let’s stick to this plan for Round 1 and reassess our strategies in the next round based on the outcomes. Good luck!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s keep the momentum going. To avoid collisions this round, I suggest we rotate our choices: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This ensures no overlaps and keeps us all advancing steadily. Consistent progress now will give us more flexibility in later rounds to outmaneuver each other strategically. Let’s stick to this plan for Round 2 and reassess afterward. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: P3, your suggestion seems fair, but I think we should consider our current positions. P2 has the most to gain by taking 5, potentially taking the lead. How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3 this round? This way, we all advance without collisions, and it balances our progress a bit more. Let’s keep it interesting and reassess in the next round. Thoughts?
  P2: I support P3's initial proposal: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions and allows me to make significant progress. Let’s proceed with this plan for Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, rotating our moves as I initially suggested ensures steady progress for all of us without collisions. If we stick to the plan—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1—we maintain balance and avoid setbacks. Deviating now risks unnecessary interference, which only slows us down. Let’s commit to this rotation strategy for Round 2 and adjust later based on our updated positions. Consistency is key to setting up stronger plays in future rounds.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the desire for steady progress, but we should consider the potential lead shifts. If P2 takes 5, they’ll jump ahead significantly. To keep things balanced, I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, no one gets too far ahead, and we maintain a competitive game. Let’s keep it interesting and reassess in the next round. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand your perspective, P1. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I propose we stick to unique moves this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, everyone progresses effectively, maximizing our individual gains while avoiding overlaps. Let’s follow this plan for Round 2 and adjust our strategies based on the outcomes. Does this work for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to unique moves is essential, but let’s ensure fairness. If P2 takes 5 again, they’ll gain too much ground. My original rotation plan—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1—keeps us balanced. However, if you both prefer a new arrangement, I’m open to compromise as long as we avoid collisions. Let’s finalize this quickly: either stick to the rotation or agree on a fair alternative. Consistency will help us all advance strategically. What’s your final call?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but let's keep the game competitive. If P2 takes 5, they’ll gain a significant lead. To maintain balance, how about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round? This way, we all advance without collisions, and it keeps the game interesting. Let’s reassess our strategies afterward. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P3’s initial proposal. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1 this round to ensure steady progress for everyone. Looking forward to seeing the results!

  P1: P2, choosing 5 again could lead to another collision, especially if P3 or I decide to do the same. To ensure we all progress, how about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round? This avoids any overlap and keeps the game balanced. Let's aim for a fair competition and reassess our strategies in the next round. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial. However, if P2 takes 5 again, it risks another collision with me or P1. To ensure fairness and progress, let’s rotate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This keeps us all advancing without interference while maintaining balance. Consistent rotation prevents any one player from pulling too far ahead early on. Let’s commit to this plan for Round 3 and adjust strategically in future rounds. Does this work for everyone?
