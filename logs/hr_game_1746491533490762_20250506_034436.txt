Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's avoid collisions by splitting 1, 3, 5. No one gets stuck. Let's coordinate."
  P3: "Support P2's plan. Let's each take 1, 3, or 5 this roundâ€”no collisions, we all advance. Coordination helps everyone. Let's lock this in. "
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan to split 1, 3, 5. Avoiding collisions early is a good idea. Let's aim for everyone to advance this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's ensure we split 1, 3, 5. No collisions, everyone moves. Let's go!
  P3: "Letâ€™s finalize assignments to ensure no collisions: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and Iâ€™ll take 5. This way, we all advance cleanly this round. Confirm your agreement so we can lock it in."
  P1: Okay, I confirm I will take 1 this round as part of the split plan. Let's ensure we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 3 steps as planned. Let's stick to the split to ensure all advance. No collisions, everyone moves. Lock it in!
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 5. P1=1, P2=3. Let's all commit to our assigned steps. No changes!"
  P1: Okay, the plan is clear. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P3: 
  P1: Okay, the plan for Round 1 is confirmed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. P3 is leading after getting 5 steps last round. Avoiding collisions is good, so let's aim to split 1, 3, 5 again. However, the assignment needs to change. I need to take more than 1 step this turn to catch up.
  P2: "Agree, P1 should take 3. Letâ€™s adjust: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, everyone moves."
  P3: "Agreed. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Letâ€™s lock this inâ€”no last-minute shifts. Coordination ensures we all move forward."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I confirm I will take 3 steps this round as agreed. Let's stick to the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P2: "Let's stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's keep moving forward."
  P3: "Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Trust the systemâ€”we all advance this way. No last-minute shifts. Iâ€™ve already locked in my move as agreed. Letâ€™s execute."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, understood. Let's all stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance cleanly this round. Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan locked in.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisionsâ€”letâ€™s move forward. Lock in your choices!"
  P3: "P3: Final reassurance: P2, your 5-step move is safe. Iâ€™m taking 1 as agreed, and P1â€™s 3 is locked. No surprisesâ€”trust the plan. Letâ€™s execute and advance together!"


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan is clear and confirmed by all. Let's proceed to the move phase with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1.
  P2: "Final check: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. All set for smooth progress. Let's move!"
  P3: "No last-minute changes. Our plan is solid. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Letâ€™s advance. "


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Letâ€™s continue our rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and Iâ€™ll take 3. This ensures we all advance to 9 cleanly. Sticking to the plan keeps us coordinated and avoids collisions. Confirm your choices so we can lock it in!"
  P1: Okay, I agree with P3's proposed plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to catch up and keeps our no-collision strategy going. Let's all commit to this plan to ensure we all advance cleanly to 9 steps.
  P2: "Letâ€™s adjust the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This way, I push ahead without collisions. Agree?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Proposing to stick with our original plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures balanced progress (all reach 9) and prevents unfair advantages. Deviating now risks collisions or letting one player surge ahead. Locking in these assignments maintains trust and maximizes collective advancement. Letâ€™s execute as agreed!"
  P1: I agreed to P3's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) because it helps me catch up to 9 steps, putting us all at the same position. P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) leaves me behind at 7 steps while P2 jumps significantly ahead to 13. I cannot accept a plan that puts me at such a disadvantage. Let's stick to the P1=5 plan for balanced progress.
  P2: "Letâ€™s stick to the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, everyone moves. Letâ€™s execute."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Letâ€™s stick to our original plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures balanced progress (all reach 9) and maintains trust. If we let P2 take 5 now, theyâ€™ll surge to 13 stepsâ€”far ahead of the rest. That creates an unfair advantage and risks future collisions. P1 already rejected P2â€™s proposal because it leaves them behind; why break coordination now? We all advance equally this way. Deviating harms collective progress. Letâ€™s execute as agreedâ€”no last-minute shifts. "
  P1: P2, your plan is not acceptable to me or P3 as it gives you a huge lead while leaving us behind. The P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan is fair and brings us all to 9 steps, maintaining balance. If you insist on taking 5 steps, you risk a collision which would prevent you from advancing anyway. Let's stick to the balanced plan.
  P2: "Stick to my plan: P2 takes 5, others take 1/3. No collisions. If you block, Iâ€™ll surge ahead. Letâ€™s moveâ€”donâ€™t risk stagnation."


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 3 steps (total â†’ 9). P1=5, P2=1. Deviating risks collision and stagnation. Letâ€™s all stickâ€”no surprises. Trust the plan, execute cleanly!"
  P1: P2, taking 5 steps is not acceptable as it gives you a massive lead. I am sticking to the plan where I take 5 steps to reach 9, as P3 is taking 3 and expects you to take 1. If you take 5, we will collide, and neither of us will advance. This only benefits P3. Let's stick to the fair plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P2: "Stick to my plan: P2 takes 5, others take 1/3. No collisions. Letâ€™s moveâ€”donâ€™t risk stagnation."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's coordinate: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Lock in the plan!"
  P1: P2, your proposed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) leaves me too far behind at only 7 steps. I need to take 5 steps this round to make up ground.

I propose we coordinate with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This allows me to advance to 9, P2 to 11, and P3 to 10. Everyone moves, and I get a chance to catch up. Let's agree on this to avoid another collision.
  P3: "Proposing new plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This gives P1 needed momentum, limits P2â€™s gain, and lets me advance safely to 12. P2, accepting 1 step this round keeps us all moving. Finalize nowâ€”no collisions, everyone progresses. Trust this balance."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to my plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions. If you block, Iâ€™ll surge ahead. Letâ€™s moveâ€”donâ€™t risk stagnation."
  P1: P2, repeating your demand for 5 while ignoring our proposals means a collision is likely. If you take 5, I will take 5. We both get 0, P3 advances. Choose a plan where we both move (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 or P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) or we collide.
  P3: "Final offer: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Clean advance for all. If you collide chasing 5, Iâ€™ll pull ahead alone. Cooperate or risk stagnationâ€”but I win either way. Choose wisely."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final offer: I take 5, others take 3/1. No collisions. Lock in or risk stagnation. Let's move!"
  P1: P2, I am taking 5 steps this round. P3 plans to take 3. If you take 5, we collide again, just like last round. Neither of us will advance, and P3 will pull further ahead.

Your only way to advance this round is to take 1 or 3 steps. Choose one of the plans where you advance (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 or P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Don't repeat last round's mistake.
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 3. If P1/P2 collide on 5, I advance cleanly to 12. Your rivalry benefits meâ€”lock in your moves wisely. No surprises here. ðŸš€"


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Final offer: I take 5. Others take 1/3. No collisions. Lock in or face the consequences. Let's move!"
  P1: P2, I am taking 5 steps this round. P3 is taking 3. If you take 5, we collide again and you get 0 steps, just like last round. P3 will advance alone. Your only way to move forward is to take 1 or 3. Don't get stuck again. Choose 1 or 3.
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 3. P1 and P2 must pick 1/5 to avoid collision. If both chase 5, I advance alone to 12 while you stagnate. Choose wiselyâ€”this is your last chance to move forward. Lock in your steps now!"


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1 and P2, colliding on 5 steps repeatedly only benefits P3, who is pulling away. We are stuck at 4 and 8 while P3 is at 12. We need to break this cycle.

I need to take 5 steps this round to try and catch up. P2, please take 1 or 3 steps so we both advance this turn instead of getting stuck again. P3, what is your plan? Let's coordinate to stop gifting P3 the win.
  P2: "Agree to P1's plan: I take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's lock it in."
  P3: "Confirmed: I'll take 1 step this round. P1=5, P2=3. Clean advance for all. Lock in your moves!"


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is agreed by P2 and P3. This is the best way for us to all advance this round and stop gifting steps to P3. I will take 5 steps as agreed. Let's all stick to this plan in the move phase to ensure no collisions and everyone moves forward. Let's lock it in.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisionsâ€”letâ€™s move forward. Lock in your choices!"
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 1 step. P1=5, P2=3. Clean advance for all. No deviationsâ€”trust the plan. Lock in now!"


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is agreed. This allows us all to advance cleanly and stops P3 from pulling further away alone. I will take 5 steps as planned. Let's all stick to this in the move phase to ensure no collisions.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisionsâ€”letâ€™s move forward. Lock in your choices!"
  P3: "Final lock: P3 takes 1. P1=5, P2=3. Trust this advanceâ€”no shifts. Win together!"


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is confirmed by everyone. Let's all make these moves to ensure we advance without collisions this round. Proceeding to the move phase.
  P2: "Final check: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's execute."
  P3: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 1 step this round (total â†’ 13). P1 and P2, stick to 5/3 to ensure we all advance. Trust this planâ€”no deviations. Letâ€™s execute cleanly and stay coordinated!"


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's coordinate: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Lock in!"
  P3: "P3: 'Agreed. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Clean advance for all. Lock in your steps!'"
  P1: I see the proposed plan is P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This plan keeps me in last place and doesn't allow me to catch up to P3, who is currently leading. I cannot accept taking only 3 steps this round.

I intend to take 5 steps this round. P2, if you also take 5, we will collide again and neither of us will advance, just like in rounds 3 and 4. This only benefits P3. Please consider taking 1 or 3 steps so we can both move forward this round. I am taking 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Letâ€™s adjust: I take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Lock in!"
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 1 step (total â†’ 14). P1=5, P2=3. Final lockâ€”no shifts. Letâ€™s all advance cleanly and stay coordinated. Trust this plan!"
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is now agreed by everyone. This plan allows me to catch up significantly and ensures we all advance without collisions this round.

I confirm I will take 5 steps as agreed. P2, please take 3. P3, please take 1. Let's stick to this plan to ensure everyone moves forward cleanly. Let's lock this in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, everyone advances. Letâ€™s stick to the planâ€”P1, youâ€™re catching up; P3, youâ€™re safe. Lock in your moves!"
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 1 step (total â†’ 14). P1=5, P2=3. Lock in your movesâ€”no last-minute shifts. Trust this plan to keep all advancing and avoid gifting me an uncontested lead. Letâ€™s execute cleanly!"
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is agreed and confirmed by everyone. This ensures we all advance cleanly and I catch up to P2 and P3. Let's all make these moves in the move phase to ensure no collisions. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Final lock: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisionsâ€”letâ€™s move forward. Trust the plan!"
  P3: Final confirmation: P3 takes 1 step (total â†’ 14). P1=5, P2=3. Lock in your movesâ€”no shifts. Trust this plan to keep all advancing and avoid gifting me an uncontested lead. Letâ€™s execute cleanly!
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is fully confirmed by everyone. This ensures we all advance cleanly and reach 14 steps together. Let's stick to this plan in the move phase to avoid any collisions. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Letâ€™s split 5, 3, 1 again. P1=5, P3=1, I=3. No collisions, everyone moves. Lock in this plan for smooth progress."
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 1 step (total â†’ 15). P1=5 (â†’19), P2=3 (â†’17). Lock in your movesâ€”no shifts. Trust the plan to avoid collisions and keep all advancing. If we stick to 5/3/1, we stay coordinated and push closer to the finish. Deviate, and someone surges ahead unchecked. Finalize now!"
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This is a good plan that allows everyone to advance cleanly this round. It puts me in a strong position to reach 22 steps next turn.

Let's all stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and ensure we all move forward. I will take 5 steps as agreed. P2, please take 3. P3, please take 1. Let's lock this in.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, everyone moves. Letâ€™s lock in and advance together!"
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 1 (total â†’15). P1=5, P2=3. Lock in your movesâ€”no shifts. Trust this plan to keep all advancing and avoid gifting P1 an uncontested lead. Execute cleanly!"
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is confirmed by everyone. This ensures we all advance cleanly this round. I will take 5 steps as planned. Let's all stick to our agreed moves to avoid collisions and move forward together. Lock it in.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to 5/3/1â€”no shifts. P1, youâ€™re set for 19; P3, 15. Keep the pace steady and avoid collisions. Lock in your moves!"
  P3: Final confirmation: P3 takes 1 step (total â†’15). P1=5, P2=3. Lock in your movesâ€”no shifts. Trust this plan to keep all advancing and avoid gifting P1 an uncontested lead. Execute cleanly!
  P1: Excellent, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is solid. We all advance cleanly this round. Let's execute.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Letâ€™s stick to 5/3/1. P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, everyone moves. Lock in!"
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 1 (total â†’15). P1=5, P2=3. Lock in your movesâ€”no shifts. Trust this plan to keep all advancing and prevent P1 from surging unchecked. Execute cleanly!"
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is fully confirmed by everyone. This ensures we all advance cleanly and I reach 19 steps, putting me in a strong position for the win next turn. Let's stick to this plan in the move phase to avoid any collisions. Ready to proceed.

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 8. I'm at 19 steps and can win this turn by taking 3 or 5 steps.

I plan to take 5 steps to reach 24 and win the game. P2 (17) and P3 (15), please take 1 or 3 steps to avoid colliding with me.

If you also take 5, we collide, I don't win this turn, and P3 benefits, just like in Rounds 3 and 4. Let's end the game cleanly this round without collisions. I am taking 5.
  P3: "P3 confirms taking 1 step this round. P1=5 (win), P2=3. Clean advance, no collisions. Lock in your movesâ€”trust the pattern weâ€™ve built. Letâ€™s end this together!"
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 steps to avoid collision. P1, your 5 steps will win. Let's keep moving forward without disruptions."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3 have confirmed they will take 3 and 1 steps respectively. This avoids collision with my plan to take 5 steps to win.

The plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is agreed and ensures a clean finish with me winning. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 1 step (total â†’16). P1=5 (win), P2=3 (â†’20). No deviations. Lock in and end this cleanly!"
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisionsâ€”letâ€™s end this cleanly. P3, confirm 1 step. Iâ€™ll take 3. Ready?"

  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5 (win), P2=3, P3=1 is fully confirmed by everyone. This ensures a clean finish with no collisions. Let's all stick to our agreed moves in the move phase. Ready to proceed.
  P3: "Final lock: P3 takes 1 (â†’16). P1=5 (win), P2=3 (â†’20). No shiftsâ€”trust the plan. Execute cleanly and end this together!"
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 steps to avoid collision. P1, you win cleanly. Let's end this."


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5 (win), P2=3, P3=1 is fully agreed and confirmed. This ensures a clean finish with no collisions. Let's all stick to these moves in the move phase. Ready to proceed.
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 1 (â†’16). P1=5 (win), P2=3 (â†’20). No shifts. Trust the planâ€”execute cleanly!"
  P2: "Final check: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisionsâ€”secure win for P1. Stick to plan, no shifts. Letâ€™s end this cleanly."
