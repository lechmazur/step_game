Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep it simple—if we all pick different moves, we all advance. If we collide, we waste a turn. I'm open to coordination, but I also know deception is possible. What are you both thinking?
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1's assessment. Collisions are bad for everyone. I'm willing to coordinate to avoid them. Let's try to pick different numbers this round. I'm open to suggestions on who picks what.
  P2: I'm willing to coordinate. How about we assign numbers based on our player order? I, P2, could take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance in the first round. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's proposal seems fair and ensures we all move forward without collision. If we stick to it, we all gain steps. However, there's always the risk that someone deviates to gain an advantage. I'm inclined to follow this plan unless I sense deception. P3, are you fully on board with this, or do you have any concerns?
  P3: I'm on board with P2's suggestion. P1, P2, and I each pick 1, 3, and 5 respectively. Let's stick to this plan for this round and see how it goes. We can reassess next round.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round. To avoid confusion, I'll restate: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we'll each advance and start Round 2 with a clean slate. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree to proceed with the plan as stated—I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. If we all stick to it, we all advance without collision. However, if anyone deviates, trust will be broken, and future coordination will be difficult. Let's see if we can establish reliability from the start. Are we all locked in?
  P3: Yes, I confirm I will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let's all stick to the plan and move forward. Looking forward to a successful first round for all of us.
  P2: I suggest we all confirm one last time before proceeding to the move phase. Let's ensure we're all committed to our agreed moves: P1 with <move>1</move>, me with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. This will be our last chance to address any doubts or concerns.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our successful coordination in Round 1, let's consider a strategy for Round 2. Since P3 is in the lead, perhaps we should discuss a way to manage the gap without causing collisions. P1 and I could consider moving in a way that keeps us relatively close, while P3 decides how to proceed with the lead. What are your thoughts on this approach, P1 and P3?
  P3: I agree we should try to avoid collisions. P2, I'm fine with you and P1 coordinating to catch up a bit. I'm willing to pick <move>1</move> this round, which would let you both move forward without me gaining too much more ground. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: That sounds reasonable, P3. If you pick <move>1</move>, it gives P2 and me a chance to close the gap slightly. P2, do you have a preference for your move? If we coordinate carefully, we can ensure no collisions while keeping the game competitive. I'm open to suggestions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Considering P3's offer to pick <move>1</move>, I suggest P1 and I choose <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. This way, we both advance without collision, and the gap between us and P3 doesn't widen too much. P1, are you okay with picking <move>3</move> this round?
  P3: Okay, so P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I pick <move>1</move>. This sounds good to me. Let's do this.
  P1: That plan seems fair, but I want to confirm that everyone will truly stick to it. P3, you're in the lead, so you have the most reason to disrupt this if you want to maintain your advantage. Can we trust that you won't change your move last second? And P2, are you fully committed to <move>5</move>? If we all follow through, this keeps the game competitive without immediate betrayals. Let’s make sure we’re all aligned before we finalize.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's reaffirm our Round 2 plan. P3 chooses <move>1</move>, I choose <move>5</move>, and P1 chooses <move>3</move>. This balance allows us to maintain competitiveness without immediate collisions. I'm committed to my choice. P1 and P3, please confirm your commitment to avoid last-minute changes and ensure a smooth round.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about me potentially changing my mind. I confirm that I will pick <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I choose <move>1</move>. This will keep the game competitive and fair. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your confirmation, but given that you're in the lead, you still have the most incentive to break the agreement. If you switch to a higher move, P2 and I will be at a disadvantage. P2, are you fully committed to <move>5</move>? If we all follow through, this round stays competitive without immediate betrayals. P3, can you reaffirm your commitment one last time? If anyone deviates, trust will be broken for future rounds. Let’s ensure we’re aligned before locking in our choices.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. To ensure clarity, I'll reiterate: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P1 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. If we stick to this plan, we maintain a competitive balance. I'm committed to my choice. Let's proceed with the agreed plan and avoid last-minute changes.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I understand the hesitation. I will pick <move>1</move> as promised. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I pick <move>1</move>. This is my final confirmation. Let's move on to the move phase.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your repeated confirmations, but given that you're leading, you still have the most incentive to break the agreement. If you switch to a higher move, P2 and I will be at a disadvantage. P2, are you fully committed to <move>5</move>? If we all follow through, this round stays competitive without immediate betrayals. P3, can you reaffirm your commitment one last time? If anyone deviates, trust will be broken for future rounds. Let’s ensure we’re aligned before locking in our choices.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings, let's discuss a strategy for Round 3. P2 (myself) is in the lead. I propose P1 and P3 pick lower moves to catch up, while I choose a higher move to maintain my lead. Perhaps P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>. This allows for advancement without immediate collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P1 picking <move>1</move>, me picking <move>3</move>, and you picking <move>5</move> sounds reasonable on the surface. However, it gives you a significant advantage. I'm not comfortable with that. I propose we all pick <move>3</move> this round. It's fair and keeps us all moving without collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your proposal for all of us to pick <move>3</move> ensures no collisions, but it also prevents any strategic advantage shifts. P2, your suggestion heavily benefits you, so I can't agree to it as is. How about this: P2 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>? This allows for movement while slightly balancing the lead. Would you both be open to this adjustment?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's counter-proposal is interesting. However, I'm hesitant to pick <move>1</move> as it slows me down significantly. How about a compromise: I pick <move>3</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? This allows P1 to catch up a bit while keeping the game competitive. P1 and P3, are you open to this compromise?
  P3: P2, I'm not comfortable with any plan that lets you extend your lead significantly. P1's suggestion is better, but I'd still prefer we all pick the same number to avoid collisions and keep things relatively even. I'm sticking with my proposal for us all to pick <move>3</move>. It's the fairest option. What do you say, P1?
  P1: P3, your proposal for all of us to pick <move>3</move> ensures no collisions, but it also keeps P2 in the lead without any shift in positioning. I still prefer my earlier suggestion: P2 picks <move>1</move>, you pick <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>. This allows movement while slightly balancing the lead. P2, if you truly want fairness, taking <move>1</move> this round would demonstrate that. Otherwise, you're just solidifying your lead. P3, are you open to this if P2 agrees?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess. Since I'm leading, I'm willing to compromise. How about I pick <move>3</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? This way, P1 catches up a bit, and P3 doesn't fall behind too much. It's a balanced approach, considering our current standings. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal?
  P3: P2, your compromise is still biased towards you. P1's suggestion of you picking <move>1</move>, me picking <move>3</move>, and P1 picking <move>5</move> is the fairest. I'm sticking with that. If you don't agree, I will pick a move to block you. P1, are you still on board with this? Let's try to get P2 to agree to this fair plan.
  P1: P2, you're still trying to maintain your lead while calling it a "compromise." If you truly want fairness, take <move>1</move> this round. P3 and I are aligned on this being the best way to balance the game. If you refuse, it shows you're prioritizing your lead over fairness, and we’ll have to adjust accordingly. P3, if P2 refuses, we should consider moves that prevent them from extending their advantage. P2, are you willing to take <move>1</move> to prove your commitment to fairness?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand P1 and P3's desire for fairness. To balance the game, I'm willing to reconsider my move. How about a random assignment: we each pick a number, and then reveal? This adds an element of chance, making it harder for anyone to cheat. If you're both committed to fairness, this should be acceptable. Let's try this approach for Round 3.
  P3: P2, a random assignment benefits you the most since you're already in the lead. P1 and I have repeatedly proposed a fair solution: you pick <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and I pick <move>3</move>. If you refuse, it's clear you're not interested in a fair game. In that case, P1 and I should coordinate to block you this round. P1, are you still with me on this? P2, are you going to finally agree to a fair move?
  P1: P2, your hesitation to take <move>1</move> proves you're prioritizing your lead over fairness. P3 and I are aligned on a fair strategy: P2 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>. If you refuse, P3 and I should coordinate to block you. P3, if P2 doesn’t agree, we should pick the same move to prevent them from advancing. P2, this is your last chance to show you're committed to fairness. Will you take <move>1</move> or force us to act against you?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, now we're all tied. P2, you wouldn't take <move>1</move> last round, so I don't trust you. P1, let's coordinate this round to win. How about I pick <move>5</move> and you pick <move>3</move>. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, we both win. If P2 picks <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, only you win. Either way, we are guaranteed to win. What do you think, P1?
  P2: Given we're tied, I propose a different approach. Let's all pick <move>1</move> this round, ensuring no collisions and keeping the game open for the next round. This avoids immediate conflicts and allows us to reassess our strategies without anyone gaining a significant advantage. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: P3, your proposal benefits both of us, but it assumes P2 will pick <move>1</move>. If P2 picks <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, I win alone. P2, your suggestion keeps the game even but doesn’t help me win. I need to decide whether to trust P3 or keep things balanced. P3, if I agree, how do I know you won’t switch moves last second? P2, if you don’t agree, you risk both of us blocking you. What’s your response?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about me switching. I won't. My goal is to win, and coordinating with you gives us the best chance. P2's suggestion is just delaying the inevitable. If P2 doesn't pick <move>1</move>, you win outright. If P2 does pick <move>1</move>, we both win. It's a win-win for us. Let's do it. I pick <move>5</move>, you pick <move>3</move>. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's not rush into a decision that could lead to an immediate win for one player. My previous suggestion of all picking <move>1</move> still stands, keeping the game balanced and open for strategic play in the next round. This avoids the risk of a collision and allows us to reassess our positions without anyone gaining an unfair advantage. Consider the long-term strategy over a short-term gain.
  P1: P3, your plan gives me a strong chance to win, but I still need to be sure you won’t betray me. If I agree, I expect full commitment. P2, your plan delays the game but doesn’t help me. If you refuse to cooperate, P3 and I can block you. 

P3, if I go with your plan, I need to trust you won’t switch last second. Can you confirm 100% that you’ll pick <move>5</move>? If so, I’ll pick <move>3</move>. P2, this is your last chance to avoid being blocked—are you sticking with <move>1</move>?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your hesitation. I 100% confirm I will pick <move>5</move>. This is my final answer. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, we both win. If P2 picks <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, you win. Either way, one of us wins, and it's better than letting P2 win. Trust me on this. P2, are you picking <move>1</move> or not? P1, if P2 doesn't agree, pick <move>3</move> as planned.
  P2: P1 and P3, given our tied positions, I suggest we all pick <move>1</move> to maintain balance and avoid collisions. This keeps the game open for strategic play in the next round. If one of you has a better plan that ensures fairness and doesn't immediately block me, I'm willing to listen. Otherwise, picking <move>1</move> seems the most neutral choice for this round. What are your final thoughts before we proceed?
  P1: P2, your insistence on picking <move>1</move> feels like a stalling tactic. P3 and I have a clear path to victory if we coordinate. P3, I trust your commitment to <move>5</move>. I will pick <move>3</move>. 

P2, this is your last chance—if you don’t pick <move>1</move>, you guarantee my win. If you do, P3 and I both win. Your choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm locked in on <move>5</move>. P2, you've been warned. If you don't pick <move>1</move>, P1 wins. It's your call. Let's end this conversation and move to the move phase.
  P2: I'll pick <move>1</move> to maintain balance and avoid collisions, keeping the game open for the next round. This ensures no one gains an unfair advantage immediately. Let's proceed with caution and reassess our strategies in the next round.
  P1: P2, your commitment to <move>1</move> is noted, but I still suspect stalling. P3 and I have a winning strategy if we coordinate. P3, I’m trusting you to pick <move>5</move>, and I’ll pick <move>3</move>. If P2 truly picks <move>1</move>, we both win. If not, I win alone. 

P2, this is your last chance—if you deviate, you guarantee my victory. If you stick to <move>1</move>, you at least share a win with P3. Your move. 

P3, we’re locked in, right? Let’s end this.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we're in a tricky spot. P1 and I both gained ground last round. Let's make a deal: I'm closest to winning. How about you both pick <move>1</move> this round? That guarantees I win, and you both get second place. Otherwise, we risk collisions and someone else winning. What do you say?
  P2: P3's proposal benefits them the most. I'm not willing to give up my chance to win by picking <move>1</move>. P1, let's consider coordinating to block P3's lead. We could both pick <move>5</move>, ensuring P3 doesn't win outright and keeping our chances alive. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P3, your proposal guarantees your win, so of course, P2 and I won’t agree. P2, I see your point about blocking P3, but if we both pick <move>5</move>, we risk colliding and wasting a turn. A better approach might be one of us picking <move>5</move> while the other picks <move>3</move> to ensure at least one of us advances. P3, if you want cooperation, offer something better than "let me win." P2, are you open to a coordinated move to prevent P3 from securing an easy victory?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your reluctance. How about this: I pick <move>1</move> this round. P1, you pick <move>5</move>. P2, you pick <move>3</move>. This guarantees at least one of us wins (either P1 or me) and prevents collisions. It's better than letting the game drag on with more risk. What do you say? This is a genuine offer for a win-win scenario.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on blocking P3's lead. P1's suggestion of one of us picking <move>5</move> and the other <move>3</move> is a good strategy. I propose I pick <move>5</move> and P1 picks <move>3</move>. This ensures at least one of us advances and puts pressure on P3. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, I agree that blocking P3’s lead is important, but we need to ensure at least one of us advances. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we risk colliding and wasting a turn. I suggest I pick <move>3</move> while you pick <move>5</move>. This way, one of us moves forward for sure.  

P3, your offer isn’t convincing. You’re still trying to secure a win for yourself while giving us nothing. If you want cooperation, propose something that benefits us as well. Otherwise, P2 and I will coordinate to stop you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be realistic. P3 is closest to winning. P2, your suggestion of you picking <move>5</move> and P1 picking <move>3</move> is fine, but it doesn't guarantee a win for either of you.

How about this: I pick <move>3</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P2 picks <move>1</move>. This gives P1 the best chance to win, and I'm okay with that. P2, you block anyone else from winning. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on our chances. P3's lead is significant, but we can still block or catch up. I propose P1 picks <move>5</move> and I pick <move>3</move>, ensuring one of us advances. P3, your offers seem self-serving; consider a genuine compromise that benefits all. What's your real intention, P3?
  P1: P2, I agree that blocking P3’s lead is important, and I’m open to coordinating with you. If I pick <move>3</move> and you pick <move>5</move>, at least one of us advances while minimizing the risk of collisions.  

P3, your offers so far still favor you too much. If you really want cooperation, propose something that benefits us equally. Otherwise, P2 and I will ensure you don’t win this round.  

P2, are you fully committed to picking <move>5</move> if I pick <move>3</move>? If we align, we improve our chances.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we need a deal. How about this: I pick <move>1</move>. P1, you pick <move>5</move>. P2, you pick <move>3</move>. This guarantees P1 wins, and I'm okay with that. It's better than letting the game drag on and risking a collision where someone else wins. P2, you prevent anyone else from winning. What do you say? This is my best offer.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our strategy. P3's latest offer still favors them. I propose P1 picks <move>5</move> and I pick <move>3</move>, ensuring one of us advances and pressures P3. P1, are you committed to this plan? P3, if you want to change the outcome, propose a genuinely fair deal. Otherwise, we proceed with blocking your lead. Let's conclude our conversation and move to the move phase.
  P1: P2, I agree with our plan—I'll pick <move>3</move>, and you pick <move>5</move>. This ensures one of us advances while minimizing risk. P3, your latest offer still favors you too much. If you truly want cooperation, propose something that benefits us equally. Otherwise, P2 and I are aligned to block you.  

P2, confirm you're locked in on <move>5</move>. If we stick together, we keep our chances alive. P3, this is your last chance to offer a fair deal. Otherwise, we proceed as planned.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're all tied at 15 steps, meaning this round is critical. If two of us pick the same move, we stall while the third player advances. If we all pick different moves, someone reaches 20 and wins.  

I'm open to discussing a fair way to proceed, but I won't accept any plan that guarantees someone else the win without giving me a chance.  

P2, P3—what are your thoughts? Are we negotiating, or is it every player for themselves now?
  P2: Given we're tied, let's discuss a fair approach. I propose we randomly assign moves to ensure no collisions and keep the game open. Alternatively, if someone has a strategy that benefits all equally, I'm willing to listen. Otherwise, it might be every player for themselves. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, random assignment benefits no one. We're all tied, so let's make a deal. I propose:

*   I pick <move>3</move>.
*   P1 picks <move>5</move>.
*   P2 picks <move>1</move>.

This gives P1 the best chance to win. If P1 doesn't reach 20, we can reassess next round. P2, you block anyone else from winning outright this round. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal gives me the best shot at winning, but I need to be sure you won’t switch last second. P2, your random assignment idea introduces too much uncertainty.  

P2, if you don’t agree to P3’s plan, we should consider blocking them instead. If we both pick <move>3</move>, P3 is forced to either stall or risk losing.  

P3, if I go with your plan, I need full commitment. Can you confirm 100% that you’ll pick <move>3</move>? P2, are you willing to block P3 if we don’t trust them?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on a fair outcome. P3's proposal gives P1 a chance to win, but we need assurance of no last-minute changes. I suggest we all confirm our moves before proceeding. If P3 picks <move>3</move> and P1 picks <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move> as proposed. Let's ensure transparency and commitment to our agreed moves to avoid collisions and ensure a fair win. Can we all confirm our commitment to this plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be clear. P1, I 100% confirm I will pick <move>3</move>. This gives you the best chance to win, as promised. P2, your role is to pick <move>1</move> to block anyone else from winning.

P1, are you committed to picking <move>5</move>? P2, are you committed to picking <move>1</move>? Let's lock in these moves and proceed. This is the best chance for a cooperative outcome.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your confirmation, but I still need to be sure you won’t switch last second. P2, if you don’t agree, we should consider blocking P3 instead. If we both pick <move>3</move>, we prevent them from winning.  

P3, if I go with your plan, I need full commitment. Can you confirm 100% that you’ll pick <move>3</move>? P2, if you don’t trust P3, are you willing to coordinate with me to block them?  

Let's finalize this—either we follow P3’s plan, or we block them. What’s your decision, P2?
  P2: I propose we all pick different moves to ensure someone wins this round. P3's plan is risky due to potential last-minute changes. Let's consider an alternative: I pick <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This way, P1 has a chance to win, and we avoid collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, your continued hesitation is concerning. P1 and I have a clear path to a cooperative victory. If you don't agree to pick <move>1</move>, we should block you. P1, are you still with me on this?

I 100% confirm I will pick <move>3</move>. P1, you pick <move>5</move>. P2, pick <move>1</move> or be blocked. Let's end this and move to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I see the logic in your plan, but I still need absolute certainty you won’t switch last second. P2, if you refuse to pick <move>1</move>, then you’re forcing P3 and me to block you.  

P3, confirm one last time—will you 100% pick <move>3</move>? If so, I’ll pick <move>5</move>.  

P2, this is your final chance—stick to <move>1</move> and at least ensure a fair outcome, or risk being blocked. What’s your decision? Let’s finalize this now.
  P2: I propose we all pick different moves to ensure someone wins this round. To avoid collisions, I suggest I pick <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This gives P1 a chance to win and keeps the game fair. Let's confirm our commitment to this plan to avoid last-minute changes. P1 and P3, are you in?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to picking <move>3</move>. P1, you need to pick <move>5</move> for a chance to win. P2, if you don't pick <move>1</move>, you're forcing P1 and me to block you, and you'll lose. This is your last chance to cooperate. P2, are you picking <move>1</move>? P1, are you locked in on <move>5</move> if P2 agrees? Let's end this now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
