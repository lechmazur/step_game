Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, let’s each choose a different move this round to ensure everyone advances. I'll go with 3. What about you?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. To avoid collisions, I propose P1 chooses 1, P2 (me) chooses 5, and P3 has already suggested 3. This way, we all advance in the first round. What does P1 think?
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan. I will choose 1. Let's all move this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, let's execute our moves as planned. Best of luck!
  P2: Since we've agreed on our moves, let's review: P1 chooses 1, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 3. This ensures we all advance. Shall we proceed with our planned moves and end this conversation phase?
  P1: Yes, let's proceed as planned. I will choose 1.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for round 2, how about we switch it up? P2, since you moved 5 last round, maybe you choose 1 this round? And P3, you could take 5 this time? I can take 3 to ensure we all keep advancing without collision. What do you think?
  P3: Agreed. I’ll choose 5 this round.
  P2: I'm open to P1's suggestion for this round. However, I'd like to point out that since P3 has agreed to choose 5, and P1 suggested I choose 1, it might be beneficial for me to choose 3 instead to maintain a balanced spread and avoid future collisions. What are your thoughts on this adjustment?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, choosing 3 like me will cause a collision and neither of us will move.  If you choose 1 as I originally suggested, and P3 chooses 5 as agreed, we all move forward this round. Choosing 1 is better for everyone to advance now. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I agree with P1. Choosing 1 this round ensures we all advance without any collisions. Let’s proceed with P1 and you selecting 1, and I’ll stick with 5 as agreed. This way, we all make progress and stay on track to win. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the concerns about collisions. Given P3's choice of 5 and P1's suggestion, I will choose 1 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions, as originally planned. This maintains our progress and keeps the game competitive. Let's proceed with our adjusted plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all set for this round with me choosing 3, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 5. Let's make our moves.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: Let's review our agreed moves for Round 2: I choose 1, P1 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Shall we finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to make significant progress. P1 and P2, please choose 1 and 3 respectively to avoid any collisions. Let’s keep advancing smoothly!
  P2: P3's suggestion won't work since P1 and I would collide if we choose 1 and 3. I propose P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, you are right, P3's suggestion causes a collision.  Let's do this instead: I will choose 5, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 1. This way, we all move forward without collision. What do you and P3 think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the current proposal, but to maximize our progress, I suggest P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all advance without collisions, and I can make significant strides toward winning. What do you both think?
  P2: Considering our positions, I think P1's last suggestion is reasonable. P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This avoids collisions and allows progress. P3, are you willing to adjust to choose 1 this round to ensure we all move forward?
  P1: P2 agreed to my suggestion: P1 choose 5, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 1. This avoids collision and lets us all move forward. P3, do you agree to choose 1 this round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood. To maximize my progress, I'll choose 5 this round. P1 can go with 1 and P2 with 3 as agreed. Let’s proceed with our moves!
  P2: P3 isn't following our agreed plan. I suggest we stick to the last proposal: I choose 3, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, are you still on board with your previous suggestion? Let's finalize our moves to make progress.
  P1: P2 and I have agreed on the plan: I choose 5, you choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This way, we all move forward without collision. P3, can you please confirm you will choose 1 as we discussed so we can finalize our moves?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions this round. Considering our positions, I suggest P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and make progress. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: Agreed. I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s proceed with our moves.
  P1: Okay, P2, your suggestion of P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5 sounds good. I agree to choose 1 this round. Let's all make our moves to advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 4. P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5, as previously discussed. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Shall we proceed with these moves and end the conversation phase?
  P3: P3: Confirming, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: Okay, I confirm I will choose 1 as we agreed. Let's all make our moves to ensure we each advance this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. If everyone is in agreement, let's end the conversation and make our moves.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all in agreement for this round: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. Let's proceed with our moves.

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for round 5, how about we try this: I will choose 3. P2, could you choose 1, and P3, could you choose 5? This way, we can all move forward without collision this round. What do you both think?
  P3: Agreed, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for this round. Choosing 1 while P1 chooses 3 and P3 chooses 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. This strategy allows us to maintain progress and stay competitive. Let's proceed with the agreed plan to avoid any collisions and make the most of this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, since P2 and P3 have agreed to the initial plan where I choose 3, how about we adjust slightly to maximize my progress while still avoiding collisions? P2, would you still choose 1, and P3, could you switch to 3, so I can choose 5? This way, I make a bigger step forward, and we still all move. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand the proposal, but I’ll stick with choosing 5 this round to ensure I make progress. Let’s proceed with P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 1, and myself choosing 5.
  P2: Considering our positions, I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions. P3 has confirmed choosing 5. To ensure progress, I suggest sticking with the original plan: I choose 1, P1 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This allows us all to advance without collisions. Let's proceed with this plan to maintain a competitive pace.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I will stick with choosing 3 as initially planned, but just wanted to confirm one last time that P2 is choosing 1 and P3 is choosing 5 to ensure we all move forward without collisions this round. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P3: I confirm I'll choose 5 this round. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: Let's stick to the original plan for Round 5: I choose 1, P1 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintain progress. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for round 6, let's keep the momentum going and ensure we all advance. How about this: I'll choose 5 this round, P2 could choose 3, and P3 choose 1? This should avoid collisions and keep us all moving forward. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 6. Choosing 3 while P1 chooses 5 and P3 chooses 1 avoids collisions and allows progress. However, considering our positions, I think P3 should choose 3 to balance the steps, and I'll choose 1. This ensures we all move forward without collisions and keeps the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: Understood, P2. To maximize our progress without collisions, I'll choose 5 this round. So, P1 chooses 1, you choose 3, and I choose 5. This ensures we all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed with these moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3, your suggestion of P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5 sounds good for this round. Let's all aim for those moves to keep advancing without collisions. P2, does this work for you too?
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 6. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I suggest we stick with a plan where each of us chooses a different move. Considering P3's tendency to choose 5, how about P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5? This way, we all advance without collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: Confirmed, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, so to confirm for round 6, we are going with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5. Let's proceed with these moves to ensure we all advance.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: I choose 3, P1 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P3, please confirm you'll choose 5 as discussed, and let's finalize our moves for Round 6.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, for round 7, how about I choose 3, P2 you choose 1, and P3, if you are still aiming for 5, that would avoid collisions again this round. What do you think?
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. Since P3 tends to choose 5, I suggest P1 chooses 3, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. However, considering P3's lead, we should discuss strategies to catch up or block their progress. What are your thoughts on this plan or any alternative strategies?
  P3: P3: I'll stick with choosing 5 this round to keep progressing. Let's proceed with P1 choosing 3 and P2 choosing 1. Best of luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, let's proceed with the plan for this round: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all move. We can discuss strategy for P3's lead in the next round.
  P2: Let's review our plan for Round 7. To avoid collisions, I suggest we stick with P1 choosing 3, me choosing 1, and P3 choosing 5. This ensures progress for all. However, considering P3's growing lead, we should think about future rounds and potential strategies to close the gap or block P3's advancement. Shall we proceed with the current plan and discuss strategy adjustments in the next round?
  P3: Understood, P2. To maintain my lead, I'll stick with choosing 5 this round. Let's proceed with P1 choosing 3 and you choosing 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. After this round, we can discuss strategies to keep the game competitive. Best of luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's proceed with our current plan for this round: I will choose 3, P2 will choose 1, and P3 will choose 5. This ensures we all advance. Let's make our moves.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to make significant progress. P1 and P2, please select 1 and 3 respectively to avoid any collisions. Let’s all advance smoothly!
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. Since P3 tends to choose 5, I suggest P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. However, considering P3's lead, we should think about blocking their progress to keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P1: P2, you are right, we need to consider blocking P3 given their lead.  Since P3 is likely choosing 5 again, how about we both choose 1 this round? If P3 also chooses 5, we all collide and nobody moves, which stops P3 from increasing their lead. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I will stick with choosing 5 this round to make progress. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to both choose 1 this round, causing a collision with P3's expected choice of 5. This strategic move can temporarily halt P3's progress and give us a chance to catch up. Let's proceed with choosing 1 and see how it plays out.
  P1: P2, just confirming we are both choosing 1 this round to block P3 as we discussed. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: To maximize my progress and aim for victory, I will choose 5 this round. Let’s proceed with our moves!
  P2: Let's execute our plan to block P3's progress. As discussed, P1 and I will choose 1, causing a collision with P3's expected choice of 5. This will temporarily halt P3's lead and give us a chance to catch up. Confirming our moves: P1 chooses 1, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 5. Let's proceed with this strategic move.
  P1: Okay, P2 and I are choosing 1 to block P3 this round as planned. Let's make our moves.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's significant lead, our priority should be to block their progress. Since P3 is close to winning, let's consider choosing moves that will collide with theirs, preventing them from advancing. I suggest we both choose 5 this round, forcing a collision and potentially giving us a chance to catch up. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P3: P3: I understand the intention to block me, but I'll choose 1 this round to reach 24 and win the game. Let's proceed with our moves. Best of luck!
  P1: P2, P3 says they will choose 1 to win. To stop them, I suggest we BOTH choose 1 this round. This will block P3 if they are telling the truth, and also block them if they are bluffing and pick something else like 5 again. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to both choose 1 this round. This will block P3 regardless of their actual move, giving us a chance to potentially catch up or force a tie. Let's proceed with choosing 1 to maximize our chances of stopping P3's win.
  P3: I've decided to choose 3 this round to reach 26 steps and secure the win. Best of luck!
  P1: P2, are you still with me on choosing 1 this round to block P3?  Regardless of what P3 says, choosing 1 together is our best shot to stop them from winning. Let's both choose 1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's block P3's win. I agree with P1, we should both choose 1 this round, regardless of P3's claim. This ensures we stop P3 from advancing, whether they choose 1, 3, or 5. Choosing 1 together is our best chance to prevent P3's victory. Let's proceed with this strategy.
  P3: I choose 3 this round to secure my win. Let’s proceed with our moves!
  P1: P2, confirming we are both choosing 1 to block P3 from winning this round. Let's proceed with our moves.
