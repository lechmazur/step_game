Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll go for 5. This way, we all move forward without any risk. Let me know if you're on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea P3, but starting with me taking only 1 step while you take 5 puts me at a significant disadvantage right from the start. How about we rotate who gets the higher numbers each round? This round I could take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. Then next round we shift positions. That way it's more fair for everyone long-term.
  P2: Fair points, P1 and P3. To give myself a strong start, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. This way, we all advance without collisions and can adjust our strategies in future rounds. Let me know if you're on board or have other suggestions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks for the input, P1 and P2. I understand the concern about fairness. How about a compromise for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This way, we still avoid collisions, and the steps are distributed a bit more evenly to start. We can rotate or adjust in future rounds to keep things balanced. Let me know if this works for you both.
  P1: I notice both of you keep proposing plans where you get 5 steps and I get fewer. That's not going to work for me. My rotation proposal was fair - I get 5 this round, then we rotate who gets the big number each turn. If you're not willing to give me a fair shot at 5 steps this round, then maybe we shouldn't coordinate at all and just compete openly. What's it going to be?
  P2: Understood, P1. To keep things moving, I'll choose 5 this round. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks for the discussion, P1 and P2. I see the tension around fairness, and I’m open to a solution. P1, I’m willing to support your rotation idea starting next round, but for this round, let’s finalize a plan. How about I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3? This gives P1 the lead this round, and we can rotate from there. If this doesn’t work, I’m fine competing openly. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P2, I see you said you'll choose 5, but P3 just offered a plan where I get 5, you get 3, and P3 gets 1. That's exactly what I was asking for - a fair rotation starting with me getting the lead. If you stick with 5 and I take 5, we'll both collide and get nowhere. Can you accept P3's compromise so we all advance? Otherwise this coordination falls apart completely.
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I'll take 3 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed with P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1. Looking forward to collaborating in future rounds.

Positions now:

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, great job on avoiding collisions last round. As per our rotation idea for fairness, how about this round P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1? This way, P2 gets the lead, and we keep the balance moving forward. We can continue rotating next round with me taking 5. Let me know if this works for you both, or if you have a different plan in mind. I’m open to suggestions to ensure we all advance without conflicts.
  P2: Agreed, P3. I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. This rotation should keep us all advancing smoothly without any collisions. Looking forward to continuing this strategy in the upcoming rounds!
  P1: Wait, I'm reconsidering this rotation. I'm currently in the lead at 5 steps, and this rotation would put P2 ahead of me at 8 steps while I drop to just 6. Since the first round allocation worked perfectly with no collisions, why don't we stick with the same pattern: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1? We can rotate later when positions are closer. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand P1’s concern about maintaining the lead, but sticking to the same pattern every round undermines the fairness we discussed. P1, you got 5 last round, so rotating now with P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1 keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. We can adjust later if needed, but let’s honor the rotation to prevent any single player from falling too far behind or pulling too far ahead early on. Does this work for you both?
  P2: I understand the concerns. To avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances, let's stick with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 this round. We can consider rotating in future rounds. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: P2, thank you for backing the plan that worked perfectly last round. P3, I hear your fairness concerns - how about we do one more round with the same allocation (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1), and then I promise we'll do a full rotation starting round 3 where you get 5, I get 3, and P2 gets 1? This gives us two guaranteed collision-free rounds while addressing your rotation request. Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion. P1, I’m glad you’re open to rotation starting Round 3, but I still think fairness should start now. Let’s stick with P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1 this round to balance things out early. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If we delay rotation, it risks creating a bigger gap. Can we agree on this for Round 2, with a commitment to adjust as needed next round? Let me know.
  P2: P2: I agree with P3’s proposal. I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1 this round. This should keep things balanced and help us all advance smoothly. Let’s move forward with this plan.
  P1: P3, I see what's happening here. You're pushing for "fairness" but this plan puts P2 at 8 steps - way ahead of both of us. If P2 takes 5 and reaches 8, they'll have a commanding lead while you're at 4 and I'm at 6. P2 is clearly the biggest winner here, not you. If you two insist on this alliance against me, then I'm breaking coordination entirely and we'll compete openly. Your choice - real fairness or I pick whatever number gives me the best shot.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, last round’s collision between P1 and P2 shows we need to coordinate better to avoid wasting steps. I propose we return to a fair rotation this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions and balances our positions (P1 at 6, P2 at 6, me at 9). We can rotate again next round to maintain fairness. Let’s avoid another deadlock and work together. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your math is off - your plan puts you at 9 steps while P2 and I are both stuck at 6. That's not "balancing positions," that's you taking a huge lead! Since I'm currently ahead at 5 steps, how about this instead: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps me advancing while still avoiding collisions. If you want true fairness, we should maintain current relative positions, not let one player jump way ahead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal to take 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game fair for everyone. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see the concern about leads, but P1’s plan keeps P1 ahead while P2 and I lag. Let’s aim for true balance. I’ll adjust my proposal: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This puts P2 at 8, P1 at 8, and me at 5, closing gaps without collisions. We can rotate next round to keep it fair. This avoids another deadlock and ensures we all progress. Does this work for both of you? If not, I’m open to other ideas to prevent collisions.
  P1: P3, your new plan ties P2 and me at 8 steps each - that's setting us up for future collisions when we're equal! P2 already agreed to my proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That keeps us all advancing without creating ties that lead to deadlocks. If we keep changing plans every message, coordination completely breaks down. P2, are you still on board with our agreed plan, or are we abandoning coordination entirely?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed accordingly.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see the concern about ties and deadlocks, but P1’s plan extends their lead while I’m stuck at the lowest steps. Let’s find a middle ground: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps P1 advancing, puts P2 closer to the lead, and avoids collisions. We can rotate next round to ensure I’m not left behind. This balances progress without creating ties or widening gaps. Can we agree on this to keep coordination intact? If not, I’m open to competing openly. Let me know.
  P1: P3, you've changed your proposal three times now while P2 has consistently agreed to our plan. This constant shifting destroys any chance of coordination. P2 and I have a clear agreement: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That's final. If you won't accept it, then coordination is over and I'll pick whatever number maximizes my position. P2, I'm counting on you to stick with our agreement.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, last round’s triple collision shows we’re struggling with coordination. Let’s reset and agree on a simple plan to avoid another deadlock. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps P1 in the lead while giving P2 a boost. We can rotate next round to balance things further. If we can’t agree, collisions will keep stalling us. Does this work for both of you? If not, I’m open to other ideas.
  P1: P3, I accept your proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That's exactly the allocation that worked perfectly in Round 1, so let's go with what we know works. P2, are you still on board? After three rounds of collisions and wasted moves, we need to get back to advancing. But going forward, we need more consistent planning - these constant proposal changes are what led to the chaos.
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to advance quickly. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad P1 agrees to the plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. P2, choosing 5 risks another collision, stalling us all again. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure we advance without conflict. We’ve lost too many rounds to deadlocks already. Can you confirm you’re on board with P2 taking 3? If not, we risk another wasted round. I’m committed to making this work and rotating next round for fairness. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P2, you literally just agreed to the P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 plan two rounds ago, then broke coordination and caused collisions. Now you're doing it again by declaring you'll take 5. If you take 5, we'll collide and P3 gets a free advance. Is that really your strategy - to help P3 while we both waste turns? Last chance for real coordination before I assume you're deliberately sabotaging.
  P2: I agree with both of you. I'll take 3 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed with P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1 as planned. Looking forward to smooth progress together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m relieved we’re aligning on P1:5, P2:3, and P3:1 for this round. P2, thanks for confirming you’ll take 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and ensure we all advance after the recent deadlocks. We can rotate next round to maintain fairness. If there’s any last concern, I’m open to hear it, but I think we’ve got a solid agreement now. Looking forward to moving forward together.
  P1: Perfect, we have clear agreement: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This gets us all advancing after wasting three rounds on collisions. P2, I'm counting on you to stick with 3 this time - no last-minute changes. Let's execute this plan and finally make progress.
  P2: I confirm: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Let’s proceed as agreed to ensure we all advance smoothly without collisions.


Round 4, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid collisions, let's have P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and P3 take 3 this round. This way, we all advance smoothly without blocking each other. Looking forward to progressing together!
  P1: P2, your plan creates a tie between us at 11 steps - that's exactly what leads to future collisions! We've seen this pattern before. I'm currently ahead at 10 steps, so why would I agree to a plan that eliminates my lead and sets us up for deadlocks? 

Let's stick with what actually works: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That pattern worked perfectly in rounds 1 and 4 with zero collisions. Your constant plan changes are what caused the chaos in rounds 2-3.

P3, do you agree we should use the proven successful allocation again?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid ties and collisions. P1, sticking to the proven plan of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 makes sense since it worked before, and I’m on board for this round to ensure we all advance. However, to maintain fairness, let’s commit to rotating next round so I’m not stuck at the lowest steps. P2, can you confirm you’re okay with 3 this round? Let’s keep coordination intact and progress together. If there’s any issue, I’m open to ideas.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Let’s proceed as agreed to ensure we all advance smoothly without collisions. Looking forward to rotating next round for fairness.
  P1: Excellent, we have solid agreement for this round: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Let's execute this plan and finally get some consistent progress after all those collision rounds. 

Regarding rotation next round - let's see how positions look after this round before committing to any specific plan. The important thing now is that we all advance without collisions.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round to avoid collisions. P1, I appreciate the focus on progress now, and I’m fine with assessing positions after this round for future rotation. Let’s stick to this plan and ensure we all advance. P2, thanks for confirming. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, we’re all set for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s execute this plan to ensure smooth progress without collisions. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P1: Perfect agreement reached. Let's execute: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 and finally make progress after those collision rounds.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’ve locked in P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round to ensure no collisions. Let’s stick to this and keep advancing. I just want to reiterate the importance of discussing a fair rotation next round, as I’ve been at the lowest steps for a while. I’m committed to coordination, but I’d like us to address balance soon. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, with P1 at 15 steps, close to the 19-step win, we need a fair plan to avoid collisions and balance progress. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. This keeps P1 advancing while allowing me to catch up a bit, and P2 moves forward too. We’ve stuck to the same pattern too long, and I’ve been at the lowest steps. Can we agree on this to maintain coordination and fairness? If not, I’m open to other ideas to prevent collisions.
  P2: Agreed, P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed accordingly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand you've agreed on that plan, but it gives me only 1 step when I'm 4 steps from winning. That's not strategic for me. How about this instead: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This gets me to 18 steps (very close to winning), gives P3 the 5 they want to catch up, and we all still advance without collisions. This seems more balanced than forcing the leader to take the smallest step.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the counterproposal, P1. Your plan of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 works for me as it lets me catch up while still advancing you close to the win. P2, I hope you’re okay with 1 this round, as it ensures no collisions and keeps us all moving forward. We can rotate again next round if needed. Let’s finalize this to avoid any deadlock. Does this plan work for both of you? If not, I’m open to other suggestions to maintain coordination.
  P2: P1, to maximize our progress and avoid collisions, I propose we adjust the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This brings P1 to 18, me to 14, and P3 to 7, keeping everyone advancing without conflicts. Let’s proceed with this allocation to stay competitive and move closer to the win. Let me know if you’re both agreeable to this approach.
  P1: P2, you're being quite greedy here - you just took 3 steps last round and now want 5? P3 already agreed to my counter-proposal: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. That plan gets me to 18, P3 gets the big advance they've been asking for, and we all avoid collisions. 

Your plan gives you a massive jump from 9 to 14 steps, making you a serious threat when I'm so close to winning. Let's stick with the plan P3 already accepted - it's fair and avoids conflicts.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see the tension in the proposals. P1’s plan of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 still seems the most balanced to me, as it advances P1 close to the win, gives me a needed boost, and avoids collisions. P2, I understand wanting to jump ahead, but your plan puts me back at the lowest step, which isn’t fair after I’ve lagged. Can we stick with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 this round to keep coordination? If not, I’m open to competing openly. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P1, I'll take 5 this round to push towards winning. Please choose either 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Let’s make this round count!
  P1: P2, you're completely breaking the coordination we just established. P3 and I agreed on P1:3, P2:1, P3:5, but you're unilaterally deciding to take 5 anyway. This destroys any trust in future coordination.

Since you're forcing this situation, I'll take 3 to get to 18 steps. P3 will have to take 1 to avoid collisions. But this is the last time I'll try to coordinate with someone who keeps changing agreements mid-conversation.

P3, sorry you're getting forced into 1 step because of P2's move.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is just 1 step from winning. To keep the game competitive, let’s coordinate to prevent an easy win. I’ll choose 3 this round—can P3 also choose 3? This way, if P1 picks 3, we all collide and keep the game going. Let’s work together to ensure a fair finish!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see P2’s strategy to stall P1’s win by colliding on 3. I’m not fully on board with stalling as it risks us all falling further behind. Instead, let’s aim for progress: P1 takes 1 to win fairly at 19, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 to catch up a bit. This avoids collisions and respects P1’s lead while giving us a chance to advance. If we can’t agree, I’m open to other plans, but let’s avoid another deadlock. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your fair proposal - P1 takes 1 to win, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. That's the most logical outcome since I'm already at 18 steps.

P2, your collision strategy only delays the inevitable while hurting everyone's progress. I'll win eventually anyway, so why waste rounds with deadlocks? P3's plan lets you advance to 12 steps instead of staying stuck at 9.

I'm going with 1 step as P3 suggested. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. Let's proceed and finalize the moves to ensure smooth progress.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligning on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round. This plan respects P1’s lead to win at 19, lets P2 advance to 12, and gives me a boost to 11, all without collisions. Let’s stick to this to ensure a fair and smooth finish. If there’s any last concern, I’m open to hear it, but I think we’ve got a solid agreement. Looking forward to finalizing this round.
  P1: Perfect, we have clear consensus: P1 takes 1 to win, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Thank you both for the fair coordination - this gets everyone advancing without collisions. Let's execute this plan and finish the round cleanly.
