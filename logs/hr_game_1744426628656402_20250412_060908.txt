Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s try to avoid collisions on our first move. How about we each pick a different number to ensure we all advance some steps? I’m thinking of going for 1. P2, maybe you take 3, and P3, you could go for 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. P2, are you willing to take 3 steps as proposed? This strategy allows us to test the waters without immediate conflict, giving us a chance to reassess in the next round. Let's cooperate for now and see how it plays out.
  P2: I'm open to the idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. However, I'm not sure I want to commit to taking 3 steps just yet. How about we discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of each number before making a decision? For example, taking 5 steps could give one of us an early advantage, but it also risks being blocked by another player. Let's weigh our options carefully before making a move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the input, P2. I understand the hesitation about committing to a specific number. Let’s consider that picking 5 could indeed give a strong early lead, but it’s riskier if others choose it too. Sticking with 1, 3, and 5 split between us minimizes risk for now. I’ll stick with 1 as I suggested. P2, if you’re unsure about 3, would you prefer 5 instead, leaving 3 for P3? Let’s finalize this to ensure we all move forward this round. What do you both think?
  P3: Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions. P1 is taking 1 step, and I'm willing to take 5 steps as initially suggested. P2, you can take 3 steps. This way, we all advance and can reassess our strategies in the next round. Shall we agree on this distribution to ensure progress for all of us in Round 1?
  P2: I appreciate the willingness to coordinate our moves. However, I still have reservations about committing to a specific number without considering the long-term implications. What if we're setting ourselves up for a collision in the next round by choosing these numbers now? I propose we discuss a strategy for Round 2 as well, to ensure we're not just delaying the inevitable. Should we aim to maintain a staggered progression or try to create an opportunity for one of us to take the lead? Let's think ahead before making our moves.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I get your concern about long-term strategy, but focusing on Round 2 now might overcomplicate things. Let’s secure progress in Round 1 first by avoiding collisions. I’m sticking with 1, P3 seems set on 5, so why not take 3 to ensure we all move forward? We can strategize for future rounds after seeing how this plays out. Agreeing now keeps us all in the game. What do you say, P2? Let’s lock this in and adapt next round.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions this round. P1 takes 1, I'll take 5. P2, please confirm taking 3 steps. This coordinated approach allows us to advance and reassess our strategies in the next round. It's a low-risk move for now, letting us test the game's dynamics without immediate conflict. Shall we proceed with this plan?
  P2: I understand the concerns and suggestions from both P1 and P3. To ensure we all advance this round, I agree to take 3 steps as previously proposed. However, I want to make it clear that this cooperation is only for Round 1, and I reserve the right to reassess and adjust my strategy for future rounds. Let's confirm our moves: P1 takes 1 step, P3 takes 5 steps, and I'll take 3 steps. Once we've all advanced, we can reevaluate our positions and plan our next moves accordingly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, good job avoiding collisions last round. Let’s keep the momentum going. Since we’re at different positions, I suggest we stick to a similar split to minimize risk. I’ll go for 1 again to play it safe. P2, how about you take 3, and P3, you could aim for 5? This keeps us progressing without clashes. If you have other ideas for this round, I’m open to hear them. Let’s agree quickly to stay ahead. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to maintain a similar split. However, considering our current positions, I think P2 should aim for 1 step this round to avoid potential collisions and allow for a more staggered progression. P1 can take 3, and I'll go for 5 again. This adjustment ensures we all advance while minimizing risks. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P2: I'm not sure I agree with P3's suggestion for me to take 1 step this round. If I do, I'll be at the same position as P1, which could lead to a collision in the next round. Instead, I propose that P1 takes 5 steps, P3 takes 3 steps, and I'll take 1 step. This way, we maintain a staggered progression and minimize the risk of collisions. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the suggestions. P2, I see your point about avoiding future collisions. However, taking 5 steps feels risky for me since it’s a bigger jump and could lead to a clash if someone else picks it. How about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 sticks with 5? This keeps us staggered and minimizes immediate risk. Let’s lock in a plan now to ensure we all advance again this round. What do you both think?
  P3: Let's simplify our strategy for Round 2. Since we've established a pattern, I suggest we stick closer to our initial agreements with some flexibility. P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P2 can take 1, ensuring staggered progression and minimizing collision risks. This approach allows us to maintain momentum while adapting to our current positions. What are your thoughts on this adjusted plan?
  P2: I agree with P3's adjusted plan for Round 2. To confirm, P1 will take 3 steps, P3 will take 5 steps, and I'll take 1 step. This ensures a staggered progression and minimizes the risk of collisions. Let's stick to this plan and reassess our strategies for future rounds. By doing so, we can maintain momentum and adapt to the changing game dynamics. I'm ready to move forward with this agreement. What do you both think? Should we proceed with this plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m good with the plan P3 and P2 have outlined for Round 2. Let’s go with me taking 3 steps, P3 taking 5, and P2 taking 1. This keeps us staggered and reduces collision risks. I think it’s a solid approach to maintain progress. I’m ready to move forward with this. If there’s no further input, let’s finalize this and advance.
  P3: Let's confirm the agreed plan for Round 2. I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3 steps, and P2 takes 1 step. This staggered approach minimizes collision risks and allows us to progress. If everyone's in agreement, I suggest we conclude the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P2: I agree with the plan to maintain a staggered progression. To confirm, P1 will take 3 steps, P3 will take 5 steps, and I'll take 1 step. This ensures a staggered progression and minimizes the risk of collisions. Let's stick to this plan and reassess our strategies for future rounds. By doing so, we can maintain momentum and adapt to the changing game dynamics. I'm ready to move forward with this agreement. What do you both think? Should we proceed with this plan?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we've established a good pattern, but we can't let P3 get too far ahead. I propose that we adjust our strategy to catch up. P1, how about you take 5 steps this round to close the gap? I'll take 3 steps, and P3 can take 1 step to maintain a staggered progression. This way, we can reduce the gap and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the suggestion, P2, to close the gap with P3. I’m willing to take 5 steps this round to catch up, as long as we avoid collisions. P2, taking 3 steps works, and P3, if you’re okay with 1 step, it keeps us staggered. Let’s ensure we all progress while making the game competitive. If either of you has a different idea, I’m open to it, but let’s finalize quickly to stay on track. What do you both think about this plan?
  P3: I'm open to P2's suggestion to adjust our strategy. However, taking 1 step as proposed might hinder my progress significantly. How about I take 3 steps instead, maintaining a moderate pace? P1 can take 5 steps to close the gap, and P2 can take 1 step to avoid collisions. This way, we balance competitiveness with staggered progression. What are your thoughts on this alternative plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about taking 1 step, but I think it's necessary to maintain a staggered progression. If P3 takes 3 steps, it might lead to a collision with P1 in the next round. I propose that we stick to the original plan: P1 takes 5 steps, I take 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This way, we can reduce the gap while minimizing the risk of collisions. Let's prioritize caution over aggressive progress for now. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the points on both sides. P2, I agree that keeping staggered progression is key to avoid collisions. I’m still fine with taking 5 steps to close the gap. P3, if 1 step feels too slow, maybe we can compromise. How about P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This keeps us spaced out while letting me catch up a bit. Let’s lock in a plan now to ensure progress. What do you both think of this? If we’re good, let’s move forward.
  P3: Considering our current positions, I think it's crucial to balance progress with avoiding collisions. P1 taking 5 steps and me taking 1 step could work, but I'm open to adjusting. How about I take 3 steps, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1? This maintains staggered progression while allowing P1 to close the gap with me. What are your thoughts on this compromise?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we're getting close to a decision. To clarify, I'm willing to take 3 steps as previously suggested, but I want to ensure we're all on the same page. P1, you're still okay with taking 5 steps, right? And P3, you're considering taking 1 step or 3 steps, but we need to finalize one option. Let's confirm our moves to avoid any last-minute changes. If we stick to the plan, I'll take 3 steps. What's your final take on this, P3? Should we proceed with P1 taking 5, you taking 1, and me taking 3?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s finalize our moves for Round 3. I’m committed to taking 5 steps to close the gap with P3. P2, taking 3 steps works well, and P3, I think taking 1 step is the safest choice to avoid future collisions. This keeps us staggered and competitive. If everyone agrees, let’s lock this in and proceed. If there’s any last concern, speak now, but I’m ready to move forward with this plan. What do you both say?
  P3: Let's confirm the plan: I'll take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps, and P2 takes 3 steps. This maintains staggered progression and allows P1 to close the gap with me. It's a balanced approach, minimizing collision risks while keeping the game competitive. Are we all in agreement with this plan for Round 3?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think it's time to reassess our strategy. P3 is still in the lead, and we need to close the gap without risking collisions. I propose that P1 takes 3 steps this round, I take 5 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This way, we can reduce the gap while maintaining a staggered progression. What do you both think? Should we adjust our strategy to catch up with P3, or do you have a different plan in mind?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the need to close the gap with P3. P2, I’m okay with you taking 5 steps to catch up, and P3 taking 1 step works to keep things staggered. However, I’d prefer to take 5 steps myself to push forward more aggressively. How about P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5? This still minimizes collision risks while letting me gain ground. Let’s agree on a plan quickly to keep progressing. What do you both think?
  P3: I think P2's initial suggestion to take 5 steps is a good idea to catch up. However, I'm concerned about collisions. How about I take 3 steps, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1? This maintains staggered progression while allowing P2 to gain ground. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think we're at a crucial point in the game. P3, your suggestion to take 3 steps, me taking 5, and P1 taking 1 could work, but I'm concerned it might give you too much of a lead again. How about we compromise? You take 1 step, I take 5, and P1 takes 3? This way, we maintain a staggered progression while allowing me to catch up. Let's find a balance between progress and caution to avoid collisions. What do you both think of this revised plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s finalize a plan for Round 4. I’m still pushing to take 5 steps to close the gap with P3. P2, taking 3 steps keeps you advancing, and P3, taking 1 step ensures no collisions. This keeps us competitive and staggered. I think this balances progress and caution effectively. If you both agree, let’s lock this in and move forward. If there’s any concern, let’s address it now. What do you say?
  P3: Considering our positions, I think P2's suggestion to take 5 steps is reasonable. To avoid collisions, how about P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3? This maintains staggered progression and allows P2 to catch up. Let's focus on a balanced approach to minimize risks while keeping the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this adjustment?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we're getting close to a decision. To clarify, I'm willing to take 3 steps as previously suggested, but I want to ensure we're all on the same page. P1, you're still okay with taking 5 steps, right? And P3, you're considering taking 1 step or 3 steps, but we need to finalize one option. Let's confirm our moves to avoid any last-minute changes. If we stick to the plan, I'll take 3 steps. What's your final take on this, P3? Should we proceed with P1 taking 5, you taking 1, and me taking 3?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s settle on a plan for Round 4. I’m still set on taking 5 steps to close the gap with P3. P2, taking 3 steps keeps you moving forward, and P3, taking 1 step avoids any collisions. This setup balances our progress and keeps the game competitive. I think it’s the best way to proceed. If we’re all in agreement, let’s finalize this and move on. If there’s any last concern, let’s hear it now. I’m ready to go with this. What do you both say?
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 4. To avoid collisions and maintain progress, I suggest I take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps, and P2 takes 3 steps. This keeps us staggered and competitive. If everyone agrees, let's lock this in and proceed.

  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision cost P2 and me progress, so let’s avoid that. P3, you’re still ahead, so we need to close the gap. I suggest I take 5 steps to catch up, P2 takes 3 to advance, and P3 takes 1 to keep us staggered. This minimizes collision risks while keeping the game competitive. If you have other ideas, I’m open, but let’s agree quickly. What do you both think?
  P2: I think we need to reassess our strategy after the collision in Round 4. P1, your suggestion to take 5 steps again might be risky, considering we just collided. How about I take 5 steps this round to catch up with P3, and you take 3 steps to maintain a staggered progression? P3 can take 1 step to avoid collisions. This way, we can close the gap while minimizing risks. What do you both think of this alternative plan?
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. Considering our positions, I suggest P3 takes 3 steps, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This maintains staggered progression and allows P1 to catch up while minimizing collision risks. What do you both think of this plan for Round 5?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s prevent another collision this round. P3, I see your plan, but I’d prefer P2 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3 to advance steadily, and you take 1 to keep us staggered. This balances progress and minimizes risk. If either of you has a concern or a better split, I’m all ears, but let’s finalize quickly to ensure we all move forward. What do you both think of this adjustment?
  P2: I think we're at a crucial point in the game. P3's suggestion to take 3 steps, P1 taking 5, and me taking 1 could work, but I'm concerned it might give P3 too much of a lead again. How about we compromise? P3 takes 1 step, I take 5, and P1 takes 3? This way, we maintain a staggered progression while allowing me to catch up. Let's find a balance between progress and caution to avoid collisions. What do you both think of this revised plan?
  P3: Let's finalize a plan for Round 5. To avoid collisions and close the gap, I suggest P2 takes 5 steps, P1 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This maintains staggered progression and allows P2 to catch up. It's a balanced approach, minimizing risks while keeping the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m good with the latest plan from P3. Let’s go with P2 taking 5 steps, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This keeps us staggered, avoids collisions, and lets P2 close the gap with P3. I think it’s a fair balance for this round. If there’s no objection, let’s lock this in and proceed.
  P2: I think we've reached a good compromise for Round 5. To confirm, I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This plan allows me to catch up while maintaining a staggered progression and minimizing collision risks. Let's stick to this plan and reassess our strategies for future rounds. If everyone agrees, I suggest we conclude the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P3: Let's stick to the latest plan: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This maintains a safe distance and allows P2 to catch up. I'm ready to proceed with this plan, minimizing risks and keeping the game competitive. If everyone agrees, let's conclude the conversation and make our moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we can’t afford another collision like last round. P3, you’re still ahead, so let’s focus on closing the gap safely. I suggest I take 3 steps for steady progress, P2 takes 5 to catch up, and P3 takes 1 to keep us staggered. This minimizes collision risks while staying competitive. If you have a different split in mind, I’m open to ideas, but let’s agree fast. What do you both think of this plan?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to prioritize avoiding collisions this round. However, I think we should adjust the plan slightly. Instead of P1 taking 3 steps, how about P1 takes 1 step, I take 5 steps, and P3 takes 3 steps? This way, we maintain a staggered progression while allowing me to catch up with P3 more aggressively. Let's discuss this alternative plan to ensure we're all on the same page before making our moves. What are your thoughts on this revised strategy?
  P3: I think P2's revised plan has merit. Taking 3 steps as P3 could help maintain a lead while allowing P2 to catch up. However, I'm concerned about P1 taking only 1 step. How about P1 takes 3, I take 3, and P2 takes 5? This balances progress and minimizes collision risks. What do you both think of this adjustment?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with adjusting the plan to keep us moving forward. P3, your suggestion works for me—let’s go with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3. This keeps us staggered, avoids collisions, and lets P2 close the gap while I make steady progress. If there’s no objection, I think we should finalize this and proceed. What do you both say? Let’s lock it in to ensure we all advance this round.
  P2: I agree with P3's adjusted plan for Round 6. To confirm, I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 3. This maintains a staggered progression, minimizes collision risks, and allows me to catch up while P1 makes steady progress. Let's stick to this plan and reassess our strategies for future rounds. If everyone agrees, I suggest we conclude the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P3: I'm open to adjusting our strategy. Considering our positions, let's avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5? This maintains staggered progression and allows P2 to catch up. Alternatively, we could stick with the previous agreement: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. Which option do you both prefer?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s stick with the plan of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3. It balances progress, keeps us staggered, and avoids collisions while letting P2 close the gap. I think it’s our best shot to advance this round. If there’s any last concern, let’s hear it now, but I’m ready to finalize this and move forward. What do you both say?
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's stick with the plan we've agreed upon: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This maintains a staggered progression, minimizes collision risks, and allows me to catch up while P1 makes steady progress. I'm ready to move forward with this plan. If everyone agrees, let's conclude the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for Round 6. I agree with the previous consensus: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This maintains staggered progression and minimizes collision risks. If everyone's in agreement, let's conclude the conversation and proceed with our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we need to reassess our strategy to catch up with P3. P3 is significantly ahead, and we can't afford another collision. I propose that P1 takes 1 step, I take 5 steps, and P3 takes 3 steps. This way, we maintain a staggered progression while allowing me to catch up aggressively. Alternatively, we could try to coordinate a move that would put us ahead of P3, but that would require precise planning. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P3: I think P2's plan to catch up is reasonable. However, taking 3 steps as P3 might not be the best option. How about I take 1 step, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 3? This maintains staggered progression and allows P2 to catch up while minimizing collision risks. What do you both think of this adjustment?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision and close the gap with P3. I’m okay with P3’s suggestion: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us staggered, minimizes risks, and lets P2 catch up. If we stick to this, we can make progress without clashing. If there’s a better split, I’m open to it, but let’s finalize quickly. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think we should focus on closing the gap with P3 without risking another collision. P3's suggestion of taking 1 step, me taking 5, and P1 taking 3 seems like a good compromise. However, I'm concerned that P3 might still be too far ahead. How about we try to coordinate a move that would put one of us ahead of P3? We could discuss a plan where P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This would require precise planning, but it could be our best chance to catch up. What do you both think?
  P3: I think P2's idea of coordinating a move to overtake me is risky. Let's stick with my previous suggestion: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This maintains staggered progression and minimizes collision risks. It's a safer approach to ensure we all advance without clashing. What do you both think? Should we prioritize caution over aggressive moves at this stage?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s stick with the safer plan to avoid collisions. I’m fine with P2 taking 5, P3 taking 1, and me taking 3. This keeps us staggered and lets P2 close the gap with P3 without risking a clash. If we push too aggressively, we might collide again, which helps no one. Let’s lock this in and reassess next round. If you have any last concerns, let’s hear them now. I’m ready to proceed with this plan. What do you both say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's stick with the plan we've agreed upon: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains a staggered progression, minimizes collision risks, and allows me to catch up while P1 makes steady progress. I'm ready to move forward with this plan. If everyone agrees, let's conclude the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for Round 7. I'm okay with taking 1 step, P2 taking 5, and P1 taking 3. This maintains staggered progression and minimizes collision risks. It's a balanced approach, allowing P2 to catch up while keeping the game competitive. If everyone agrees, let's conclude the conversation and proceed with our moves.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us staggered and lets P2 close the gap with P3 while I make steady progress. It’s our safest bet to avoid another collision and stay competitive. If there’s any last-minute concern or a better idea, let’s hear it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to finalize this and move forward. What do you both say?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we should focus on closing the gap with P3 without risking another collision. Since P3 is significantly ahead, we need to be aggressive but cautious. I propose that P1 takes 5 steps, I take 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This way, we maintain a staggered progression while allowing us to catch up. Alternatively, we could try to coordinate a move that would put one of us ahead of P3, but that would require precise planning. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s close the gap with P3 while avoiding collisions. P2, I like your idea of me taking 5 steps to catch up. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This keeps us staggered and competitive without risking a clash. If either of you has a different split or concern, I’m open to it, but let’s finalize quickly to ensure progress. What do you both think of this plan?
  P3: I'm open to adjusting our strategy to maintain a competitive gap. Considering our positions, how about I take 3 steps, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1? This balances progress and minimizes collision risks. Alternatively, we could discuss other splits, but let's prioritize caution and staggered progression. What are your thoughts on this approach for Round 8?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
