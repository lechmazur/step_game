Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by trying to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5? This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. What do you think?
  P2: Okay P1, that sounds like a reasonable starting plan. However, I might change my mind later. P3, what do you think of P1's suggestion? Let's see your response before I fully commit.
  P3: Sounds good to me for round 1.  Let's see how it plays out and adjust from there.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, since P2 and P3 seem to agree with the initial plan, let's stick to it for this round. To recap: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. Let's move forward with this strategy. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. While I initially agreed, I'm having second thoughts. P1, you proposed a plan that benefits you the most by giving you 5 steps. I'm not entirely comfortable with that. Let's see what happens this round, but I might choose a different number.
  P3: Okay P2, I understand your concern. How about we rotate the numbers each round? So next round, I take 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5.  Then the following round, P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. We can continue this pattern.  Does that sound fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's suggestion of rotating the numbers each round seems fair and addresses P2's concern. Let's agree on this rotation strategy starting from the next round. For this round, let's stick to the original plan to keep it simple. So, to confirm: I'll choose 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. Next round we rotate. Does that work for everyone? Let's move forward.
  P2: P1, your persistence on the original plan is a bit suspicious. P3, I appreciate your suggestion of rotating, but I think we need to be more cautious. For this round, I'm definitely not going to choose 1. I'll decide between 3 and 5, depending on how I feel in the moment.
  P3: P2, your unpredictability makes this difficult. I'm sticking with 3 for this round.  Let's re-evaluate the rotation strategy in round 2 after seeing how this plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's adjust our strategy for Round 2. Since P2 and P3 both chose 3 last round and collided, let's try to avoid that. How about P2 chooses 1, I'll choose 3, and P3 chooses 5 this time? This way, we can all move forward without any conflicts. P2, P3, what do you think? Let's coordinate better to ensure we all make progress.
  P2: P1, your suggestion benefits you again by letting you move while we potentially clash. I'm not going to choose 1. P3, I suggest you choose 1 this round. I'm leaning towards 5, but I might choose 3 at the last moment to avoid a collision with you, P1. I want to see P3's reply before I make my final decision.
  P3: P2, I understand you're hesitant to trust P1.  I'm willing to choose 1 this round to get things moving. However, if we collide again, I'm going for 5 every subsequent round.  Let's try to make this rotation work: me 1, you 3, P1 5.  This is our best chance to avoid a drawn-out game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the mistrust, but we need to move forward. Let's simplify: P3 chooses 1, I'll choose 3, and P2 chooses 5. This ensures no one repeats their previous move and we all progress. It's crucial we start advancing to make the game interesting. Let's agree on this and move on. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate you taking 1. P1, your "simplified" plan conveniently gives you 3 again. I'm sticking with my plan: I will choose either 5 or 3. P1, be warned, if you choose 3, we will collide. P3, since you're going with 1, I am leaning heavily towards 5, but I reserve the right to change to 3.
  P3: P2, I understand your suspicion, but I'm committed to 1 this round. Let's try this: I'll take 1, you take 5, and P1 takes 3.  If P1 insists on also taking 3, then we both lose while you advance. P1, are you willing to risk blocking both of us just to prevent me from moving? This is your chance to show some good faith.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, let's address the concerns directly. P2, I understand your suspicion, but we need to find a way to move forward. P3 has committed to choosing 1. To avoid any collisions and ensure progress, I propose the following: P3 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5, and I'll choose 3. This way, everyone moves forward without any conflicts. Let's agree on this plan for this round and re-evaluate for the next. What do you both think? Let's move forward.
  P2: P1, your insistence on 3, even after all this discussion, is very telling. P3, you're sticking with 1, which I respect. Therefore, I will choose 5 this round. P1, if you choose 3 as you keep suggesting, you'll only be hurting yourself and proving my suspicions correct. The choice is yours, P1.
  P3: P1, I understand you want 3, but your insistence makes me think you'll switch to 5 at the last minute.  I'm sticking with 1. P2, if you truly intend to choose 5, let's make some real progress this round.  If either of you deviate from this plan (1, 5, 3), I will play 5 every remaining round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's learn from the past rounds and make this one count. P2, you're at 5 steps, and P3, you're at 1 step. I suggest P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P2, you're closer to winning, so choosing 1 ensures you don't risk a big jump that could be blocked. P3, choosing 3 helps you catch up. Let's agree on this and move forward. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your suggestion conveniently gives you the biggest jump again. I'm not falling for that. P3, I suggest you choose 1 again. I'm considering either 3 or 5. P1, if you're smart, you'll choose something other than 5, because I'm very tempted to pick 5 and block you.
  P3: P1, I see your strategy, and it's not fooling anyone. P2, I agree, let's both choose 1.  If P1 chooses 5, they'll be blocked.  If they choose 3, we both advance. If they choose 1, only one of us advances, but at least P1 is blocked.  I'm choosing 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns, but let's be strategic. P2, you're right; I've been suggesting moves that benefit me. Let's change that. P3, you're far behind, so let's help you catch up. How about this: P3 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. This way, P3 gets a significant boost, P2 makes a decent move, and I take the smallest step. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, you're choosing 1, which I respect, but I'm not going to do the same. P1, you're suggesting I take 3 while P3 takes 5? That's a huge leap for P3, and I don't trust you'd actually pick 1. I'm going to choose between 3 and 5. P1, if you pick 5, you're blocked. P3, I suggest you reconsider and pick something other than 1.
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 1.  If you choose 3 or 5, you'll advance.  P1, if you block me, you're only helping P2, and I'll play 5 every round after this, making it harder for *both* of you to win.  This is the simplest path to progress for all of us. Don't overthink it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, let's simplify this. P3 is committed to 1, and P2, you're considering 3 or 5. To ensure we all move forward, I'll choose 3. This way, P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. No collisions, and we all progress. P2, you get a significant boost, and P3 starts catching up. Let's agree on this and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3, you're locked on 1. P1, you say you'll choose 3, but your history suggests otherwise. I'm choosing 5. P1, if you choose anything other than 3, you're proving you can't be trusted. P3, I'm giving you a chance to get ahead.
  P3: P2, I appreciate you giving me the space to advance.  I'm sticking with 1.  P1, if you choose anything other than 3, you're only hurting yourself and confirming everyone's suspicions. Let's all make some progress this round.  Choose 3 and let's move on.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you finally chose 3, but it took a lot of convincing. P3, you're still far behind. I'm in a good position now. P1, I suggest you choose 1 this round. P3, I suggest you choose 3. I'm going to choose between 5 and 1, heavily leaning towards 5. If you, P1, choose anything other than 1, you risk a collision with me.
  P1: P2, I hear your suggestion, but I think it's crucial we all make significant progress to keep the game interesting. P3 is far behind and needs a chance to catch up. How about this: P3 chooses 5, you choose 3, and I'll choose 1. This way, P3 gets a much-needed boost, you still make a good move, and I take the smallest step. It's a fair compromise that helps us all advance. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I appreciate you finally acknowledging my lagging position.  However, I'm not going to settle for slow gains. I'm choosing 5 this round.  If either of you choose 5, we collide, and I'll continue to choose 5 every subsequent round until I break free.  P1, choose 1. P2, choose 3. This is the best path forward for all of us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion is predictable, always aiming to minimize my gains. P3, you're going for 5, which is bold. I respect that. P1, I'm giving you one last chance. Choose 1. If you don't, and you choose 3 again, know that I will be choosing 5. P3, since you are choosing 5, there is no point for me choosing it, unless P1 is not choosing 1.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the mistrust, but let's focus on making this round productive. P3, you're right to be bold and choose 5. P2, since you're leaning towards 5 but considering 1, let's find a middle ground. How about this: P3 chooses 5, I'll choose 1, and P2, you choose 3. This way, P3 gets a significant boost, you make a decent move, and I take the smallest step. It's a fair plan that helps us all advance. Let's agree on this and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2 and P1, I'm sticking with 5.  P2, if you choose 3, we both advance significantly. P1, if you insist on blocking me, I'll make it my mission to block *you* every single round after this.  Choose 1 and let's all move forward. This constant back-and-forth is getting us nowhere.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're committed to 5. P1, you claim you'll choose 1, but your history is full of deceit. Therefore, I will choose 3. P1, if you choose anything other than 1, you are only hindering your own progress and solidifying your reputation. P3, I hope you stick to your word.
</stop>
  P1: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round. P3, you're committed to 5, which is great for catching up. P2, you've stated you'll choose 3. To ensure we all progress, I'll stick to choosing 1. This way, P3 gets a big boost, P2 makes a solid move, and I take a small step. Let's confirm: P3 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 5.  P2, if you choose 3 we both advance significantly.  P1, if you block me again I will dedicate myself to blocking *you* for the rest of the game. Choose 1.  Let's make some real progress this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I see you finally chose 1. P3, you're still behind, but you made a good jump. I'm in the lead, but not by much. This round, I suggest P1 chooses 1 again. P3, I recommend you choose 3. I'm going to choose between 5 and 3, likely 5, unless P3 you are going to choose 5. P1, if you pick anything other than 1, you are just making it harder on yourself.
  P1: P2, I understand your strategy to maintain the lead, but let's ensure P3 has a chance to catch up to keep the game competitive. How about this: P3 chooses 5 to make a significant jump, you choose 3 to maintain your lead, and I'll choose 1 to avoid collisions. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. P3, this is your opportunity to close the gap. P2, you still get a decent move. Let's agree on this plan and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I'm going for 5.  P1, if you choose 1 again, you're effectively handing P2 the win.  Choose 3 and let me catch up.  If either of you choose 5, we collide, and I'll just keep picking 5 until I get through.  Let's make this interesting.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're going for 5, which I respect. P1, your suggestion, as always, benefits you the most. I'm not going to let you dictate my moves. P1, I'm giving you a clear choice: If you choose anything other than 1, I will choose 5, blocking you completely. P3, since you are choosing 5, I will choose 3. P1, the ball is in your court.
</stop>
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration, but let's be strategic. If you choose 5 and P2 chooses 3, you'll collide with P2, and neither of you will advance. Instead, how about this: P3, you choose 3, P2 chooses 5, and I'll choose 1. This way, you still make progress, P2 gets a big jump, and I take a small step. It's a compromise that helps us all move forward. Let's agree on this plan and make this round count. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I understand your logic, but if I choose 3, P1 will likely choose 3 as well, blocking both of us.  Sticking with 5 is my best chance to advance.  If either of you choose 5, we'll keep colliding until I get through.  P1, choosing 1 again is playing right into P2's hands.  Choose 3 and let's both advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're sticking with 5, and I respect that. P1, you're still trying to manipulate the situation. Since P3 is choosing 5, I will choose 3. P1, if you choose anything other than 1, you are only delaying the inevitable. You are basically handing me the win if you choose anything else.
  P1: Alright, let's cut to the chase. P3, you're determined to choose 5, and P2, you're set on 3. I see the strategy here. To avoid collisions and ensure we all make some progress, I'll stick to choosing 1 this round. This way, P3, you get your big jump, P2, you maintain your lead, and I take a small step. It's the safest move to keep the game moving forward. Let's confirm our choices: P3 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, you're playing aggressively, but if I choose 3 and collide with you, *you* lose too.  I'm sticking with 5.  P1, you choosing 1 *again* just guarantees P2 wins.  If you want any chance of winning, choose 3.  This is your last chance to make this game interesting.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's reassess our positions. P2, you're in the lead with 16 steps, and P3 and I are close behind. To keep the game competitive, let's try to avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. P3, you've been choosing 5 consistently, which is a bold strategy. P2, you've been mixing it up. For this round, how about P3 chooses 3 to avoid a collision with P2, P2 chooses 5 to maintain the lead, and I'll choose 1 to keep things moving. This way, we all advance without conflicts. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, you're close to winning, but if you choose 5 this round, I'll choose 5 next round and the round after that, guaranteeing you don't win.  I'm choosing 3 this round. P1, choose 1. P2, choose 5 and get it over with.  Let's stop wasting time with these fake negotiations.
  P2: P3, you're choosing 3, which I appreciate. P1, your suggestion is, as usual, self-serving. I'm at 16, and I intend to win. P1, if you choose anything other than 1, I *will* choose 5 and block you, delaying your progress further. I am choosing 5 if you choose something other than 1. If you choose 1, I will choose 3.
</


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're close to winning, and it's clear you're playing aggressively to maintain that lead. P3, you're right; we need to make strategic moves to keep the game interesting. Here's a straightforward plan: P3, you're choosing 3, which is good. P2, if you choose 5, you risk a future collision with P3. To avoid that and ensure we all move forward, how about this: P3 chooses 3, I'll choose 1, and P2, you choose 3 as well. This way, we all advance without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, if you choose 3, *I* will choose 3 next round and block you while P1 gets another free step.  If you choose 5 now, you win.  Stop playing games and take the win.  P1, choose 1.  This is the simplest way to end this.
  P2: P3, you're sticking with 3, which I understand. P1, your continued suggestions of compromise are transparent. I'm at 16. My choice is simple. P1, If you choose 1, I will choose 3 and P3 and I will advance. If you choose anything else, I will choose 5, and guarantee I will win or tie with you. P3 I will not collide with you.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're in a strong position, and P3, you're making steady progress. Let's be practical. P3, you're choosing 3, which is fair. P2, if you choose 3, we all move forward. I'll choose 1 to avoid any conflicts. This way, we keep the game moving without unnecessary collisions. Let's confirm: P3 chooses 3, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, choose 5 and win.  I'll choose 3. P1, you can choose whatever you want; it doesn't matter anymore.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1, I've made my intentions clear. If you choose 1, I choose 3. If you choose anything else, I choose 5. P3, you're locked on 3. The outcome of this round, and potentially the game, rests entirely on P1's decision.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's make this round count. P2, you're very close to winning, and P3, you're still catching up. To keep the game interesting and avoid collisions, how about this: P3, you choose 5 to make a significant jump. P2, you choose 1 to avoid a collision with P3. I'll choose 3 to ensure we all move forward. This way, P3 gets a big boost, P2 maintains the lead, and I make a decent move. Let's agree on this plan and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, choosing 1 doesn't make sense when you're so close to winning. Choose 5 and finish the game. I'll choose 3.  P1, choose whatever you want.  Let's end this already.
  P2: P2, you're one step away from potentially winning. I'm choosing 3, no matter what. P1, you're likely going to try to block me by also choosing 3. It's up to you, P2. Choose 5 and win, or choose something else and let the game drag on.
</stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're just one step away from a potential win. P3 is right; choosing 1 doesn't make sense for you now. If you choose 5, you can end the game. P3 is choosing 3, so I'll choose 1 to avoid any collisions. This way, you secure your win, P3 makes progress, and I take a small step. It's the clearest path to resolution. Let's confirm: P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, if you don't choose 5 this round, I'm choosing 5 next round to block you.  I'm sticking with 3.  P1, your stalling tactics are obvious. Choose whatever you want; it won't change the outcome much.  Let's get this over with.
  P2: P1, your "plan" is transparent. You want to keep the game going, hoping for a tie. P3, you're sticking with 3, which I respect. I'm at 19 if I choose 3. I will choose 5.
</stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you've made your decision clear, and it's a smart move to go for the win. P3, you're sticking with 3, which is a solid choice. To keep things straightforward, I'll choose 1. This ensures no collisions and allows us all to move forward. P2, you secure your win, P3 makes progress, and I take a small step. Let's confirm our moves: P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: P2, just choose 5 and win.  I'm choosing 3. P1, choose 1. Let's end this.
  P2: P3, you're locked on 3. P1, you're going to choose 1, as always. I'm at 19 if I choose 3. I will choose 5.
