Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all agree to move 5 this round. If we all do, we each jump to 5 and no one collides. This gives us a good start. What do you say, P1 and P2?
  P2: That's a bold start, P3. If we all trust each other, 5 is great. But it's risky if someone defects. Let's see what P1 thinks.
  P1: I'm on board with moving 5 this round. It’s a strong start if we all commit, and I’m willing to trust both of you for now. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid any collisions. If we keep coordinating like this, we can all make good progress early on. What do you say, P2 and P3—can we lock this in?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 1 didn't quite work out for the coordination on 5. What are your thoughts for this round, P1 and P3? Perhaps we should try to avoid collisions this time?
  P3: P1 and P2, since P1 and I collided on 5 while P2 moved 3, perhaps we should try a different approach. How about P1 and P2 both move 3, and I move 5? This way, at least one of us makes progress. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m disappointed we didn’t stick to the plan last round. P2, moving 3 while we agreed on 5 put you ahead, but trust is key here. P3, I like your idea for this round. I’m fine with moving 3 if P2 agrees to move 3 as well, letting P3 take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress. Can we commit to this split—P1 and P2 on 3, P3 on 5? Let’s rebuild trust and move forward together. What do you both say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright P1 and P3, I understand the need for trust, P1. The proposed split (P1=3, P2=3, P3=5) seems like a reasonable way for everyone to make progress this round without collisions. I'm willing to go with that plan. Let's try to make this work.
  P3: Great, P1 and P2. Let's lock in the plan: P1 and P2 move 3, and I move 5. This ensures progress for at least one of us and helps rebuild trust. Let's stick to this agreement this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on this plan. Let’s stick to P1 and P2 moving 3, and P3 moving 5. This ensures no collisions and helps us all progress, even if at different paces. Rebuilding trust is crucial, so I’m committed to this split. If we keep coordinating, we can avoid setbacks. Do you both confirm you’re still on board?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round was frustrating. P2, moving 1 instead of the agreed 3 broke the plan again, giving you a small lead but costing us trust. Let’s try a new approach. How about P2 moves 5, P3 moves 3, and I move 1? This avoids collisions and lets P2 extend their lead slightly while P3 and I catch up a bit. We need to balance progress and trust. What do you both think of this split? Let’s commit to no surprises this round.
  P3: P1, that sounds reasonable. P2, are you okay with moving 5 this round? If so, I'll move 3 and P1 will move 1. This avoids collisions and lets everyone make progress. Let's try to stick to the plan this time to rebuild some trust. What do you say, P2?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, that plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) sounds like a way forward. It benefits me the most this round, which I appreciate, P1. Trust has been shaky, so let's hope everyone sticks to their proposed move this time. I'm willing to try this arrangement. Let's see if we can make it work.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on this plan for Round 3 with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It’s a fair split that lets everyone advance without collisions. Trust has been shaky, as P2 noted, so sticking to this is crucial. I’m fully committed to moving 1 as agreed. Can we all confirm one last time to lock this in? Let’s make this round a turning point for better coordination.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's confirm one last time: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 5, and I move 3. This plan avoids collisions and allows each of us to make progress. Sticking to this agreement is crucial to rebuilding trust. Let's lock this in and make our moves accordingly. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. I also confirm my commitment to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's make this round work as agreed and avoid any collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m pleased we’ve all confirmed the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This setup ensures no collisions and lets us all advance, which is a step toward rebuilding trust. I’m fully committed to my move of 1 as agreed. Let’s make this round a success by sticking to our word. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, since we've all confirmed the plan for this round (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), let's proceed with our moves. I'm committed to moving 3 as agreed. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any surprises this time. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all set and confirmed on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's execute this plan successfully. I'm ready.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve reached a clear agreement on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. It’s a balanced plan that ensures progress for all of us without collisions. I’m fully committed to my move of 1, and I trust you’ll both stick to your agreed moves. Let’s make this round a success and rebuild our coordination. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to move forward to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we're all set on P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. Let's proceed with the move phase. I'm sticking to my agreement and moving 3. Let's hope we can finally execute a round as planned and rebuild some trust. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, the plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is confirmed by all. I'm ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've had three rounds of broken agreements. I'm currently in the lead. Let's try this: I'll move 1, P1 move 3, and P2 move 5. This gives P2 the lead, but keeps us all progressing. If you break this agreement, I will move to block you in future rounds. What do you say?
  P2: P3, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) certainly helps me catch up, which I appreciate. However, trust is very low after the last three rounds. P1, you agreed to 1 last round but played 5, causing a collision with me. Can you assure us you'll stick to 3 this time? P3, playing 1 seems like a safe move for you given your lead. I'm hesitant to commit until I hear from P1.
  P1: P2 and P3, I apologize for breaking the plan last round by moving 5 instead of 1. I understand trust is low, and I’m committed to rebuilding it. P3, I appreciate your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). I’m fully on board with moving 3 as agreed this time. P2, I assure you I’ll stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. Let’s make this round work. Can we all confirm this split to move forward together? I’m ready to commit.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's lock this in. P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I move 1. This gives P2 the lead, but we all make progress. P1, you've apologized and committed to moving 3. P2, are you on board with moving 5? Let's stick to this agreement to rebuild trust and avoid further collisions. If we can't agree, I will have to play defensively. What do you say, P2?
  P2: Okay P1, I appreciate the apology and your commitment to playing 3 this round. P3, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts us both in the lead, which seems fair for now. Given the history, executing this perfectly is crucial for any future coordination. I will agree to play 5 this round. Let's finally have a round where the plan works.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) for this round. I’m fully committed to moving 3 as I’ve stated, and I’m determined to rebuild trust after my misstep last round. P2, thanks for agreeing to 5, and P3, your move of 1 is a fair gesture given your lead. Let’s make this round a success with no surprises. Can we all confirm once more to lock this in? I’m ready to proceed if there’s nothing more to discuss.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we're all aligned on the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Let's execute this round perfectly. I'm committed to moving 1. This is our chance to rebuild trust and move forward without collisions. Let's make it happen.
  P2: Okay, plan confirmed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's hope this round finally works out as agreed. I'm ready to move.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). I’m fully committed to moving 3 and rebuilding trust after last round. Let’s make this a turning point with no surprises. I believe sticking to this split ensures progress for all of us. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready for the move phase. Can we all confirm one last time to finalize this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we've confirmed the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) multiple times. Let's stick to it! I'm committed to moving 1. This is our best chance to rebuild trust and progress without collisions. Let's execute this perfectly. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems aligned and ready. I'm sticking to the plan as confirmed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's execute this successfully. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m grateful we’ve reached this agreement on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I’m fully committed to moving 3 and ensuring no collisions this round. Let’s use this as a foundation to rebuild trust and keep progressing together. I believe sticking to this plan benefits us all. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, trust has been repeatedly broken, and I take responsibility for my part in that. I’m proposing a fresh start: let’s go with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. This avoids collisions, ensures progress for all, and balances our positions. P3, as the leader, taking 5 keeps you ahead but lets us catch up slightly. P2, 3 gets you closer to the lead. I’m committed to moving 1 to prove my reliability. Can we agree on this split and finally execute a plan without surprises? What do you both think?
  P2: P1, that's a plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Frankly, after you played 5 instead of 1 last round, asking us to trust you'll play 1 now is a very big ask. This plan also gives P3 a massive lead, putting them at 14 steps. P3, are you comfortable with this arrangement, especially trusting P1 to play 1 while you potentially play 5? Given the history, coordination seems very risky. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation, especially with P1's track record. However, if we both move as planned (P2=3, P3=5), we force P1 to either cooperate and move 1, or break the agreement again and risk collision, which would significantly hurt P1. This puts pressure on P1 to be honest. If P1 moves 1, I'll be at 14 and you at 10. Let's see if P1 is willing to rebuild trust. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I hear your concerns about trust, and I’m determined to prove my reliability this round. I’m fully committed to moving 1 as proposed in the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). This ensures no collisions and lets us all progress. P3, I understand the pressure is on me to stick to this, and I will. P2, I hope you’ll agree to 3 so we can balance our steps. Let’s make this round a success and rebuild trust. Can we lock this in? I’m ready to proceed if you are.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. P1, your commitment to 1 is noted, but actions speak louder than words after the last rounds. P3, your logic about putting pressure on P1 makes sense.

Alright, I will agree to play 3 this round as per the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Let's see if we can finally execute a round without collisions or broken promises. This is a critical round for trust. Let's lock it in.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we're all agreed on P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5. This is the most important round yet to rebuild trust. Let's all stick to the plan. I'm committed to 5. P1, the pressure is on you to move 1. P2, thank you for agreeing to move 3. Let's execute this perfectly. I'm ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m grateful we’ve agreed on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. I’m fully committed to moving 1 as promised, understanding the pressure is on me to rebuild trust. This plan ensures no collisions and lets us all advance. Let’s make this a turning point for better coordination. I’m ready for the move phase if there’s nothing more to discuss. Can we confirm one last time to lock this in?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I've already agreed to the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). My position hasn't changed. Let's proceed with this plan and hope for a successful round without collisions. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we've confirmed the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) repeatedly. Let's execute this round perfectly. I'm committed to moving 5. This is our best chance to rebuild trust and progress without collisions. Let's make it happen. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to our agreed plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). I understand the trust issues and am determined to prove my reliability this round. This setup ensures we all progress without collisions. Let’s make this a successful round and rebuild our coordination. I’m ready for the move phase and have nothing more to add. Can we proceed?
  P2: Okay, the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is confirmed by all. I'm sticking to my commitment to play 3. Let's hope this round works out. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, we're all set on P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5. Let's proceed to the move phase and finally execute a round as planned. I'm committed to moving 5. Good luck to both of you, and let's hope we can rebuild some trust this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and I collided on 5. P2, you benefitted from our collision. I propose P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. This puts me in the lead at 14, but allows P1 and P2 to progress without collision. P1, can you commit to 3? P2, are you willing to move 1? Let's try to get this right this time.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m sorry for breaking trust again by moving 5 last round. I’m committed to making this right. P3, I agree to your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). I’ll stick to moving 3 to ensure no collisions and allow us all to progress. P2, I hope you’re okay with moving 1 to balance our steps. Let’s use this round to rebuild trust and avoid surprises. Can we confirm this plan and move forward together? I’m ready to commit to 3 as agreed. What do you both say?
  P2: P3, P1, I see your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). P1, you've agreed to 3, but frankly, after you broke agreements in R3, R4, and R5 playing 5 instead, trusting you is difficult. P3, your plan gives you a big jump to 14 while I only move to 11, despite me being in the lead currently.

How about this instead: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? P1 still moves 3 as you just agreed. I get the 5 you wanted for yourself, P3. And P3 takes the 1 step you offered me. This would put scores at P1=11, P2=15, P3=10. This seems more balanced given the risks and current scores. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's proposal is unacceptable. P2, you were already ahead. My original proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) was fair. Sticking to it would put me at 14, P1 at 11, and you at 11. P1, are you still committed to moving 3? If so, P2, I need you to agree to move 1. Otherwise, I will block you next round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to moving 3 as agreed in P3’s original plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). I understand the trust issues due to my past actions, and I’m determined to prove my reliability this round. P2, I urge you to accept moving 1 to balance our progress and avoid conflict. P3, I confirm I’ll stick to 3. Let’s execute this plan to ensure no collisions and rebuild trust. Can we lock this in and move forward together? I’m ready to proceed if you both agree.
  P2: P3, I hear your threat, but your plan hinges entirely on P1 playing 3. Given P1 has played 5 the last three times they agreed to something else, isn't it very likely P1 plays 5 again? If so, you playing 5 means you collide with P1 and get 0 steps. Asking me to play 1 while you take that huge risk seems unwise for both of us. Are you sure *you* want to play 5 knowing P1's history? P1, can you really guarantee you won't play 5 again?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're overthinking this. P1 has repeatedly apologized and committed to moving 3. My original plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is the most balanced option for everyone. If P1 breaks the agreement again, that's on them, but I'm willing to trust that they'll stick to it this time. If you move 1, we can all progress. If you don't, I'll have to block you next round, which benefits no one. Let's lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. What do you say?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to moving 3 as per P3’s plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). I know my past actions have damaged trust, but I’m determined to prove myself this round. P2, I understand your doubts, but I assure you I won’t play 5 again. Moving 1 as proposed keeps us balanced and collision-free. P3, I’m sticking to 3 as agreed. Let’s lock this in and make progress together. Can we confirm this plan once more to avoid any surprises? I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P3, I find it hard to believe P1 will suddenly play 3 after breaking their word with 5 for three rounds straight. If P1 plays 5 again (which seems probable) and you stick to 5, you both collide and get 0. Your plan relies entirely on P1's unreliable promise. Are you sure you want to risk getting 0 steps? If you both collide on 5, me playing 1 only gets me to 11, while playing 3 gets me to 13. Your plan seems very risky for you, and potentially benefits me if P1 acts predictably based on history.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your logic is sound, but I'm betting on P1 finally sticking to the plan. If P1 plays 5 again and we collide, that's a risk I'm willing to take. My priority is to get ahead. If you move 1, P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 becomes the most likely outcome, which is good for me. So, let's lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. It's the best chance for me to win. What's your decision?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m steadfast in my commitment to move 3 as per the plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). I know my history has caused doubt, but I’m determined to follow through this time. P2, please consider moving 1 to ensure we all progress without collisions. P3, I’m sticking to 3 as promised. Let’s make this round a success and start rebuilding trust. Can we finalize this agreement and move to the next phase? I’m ready to proceed with no surprises.
  P2: P1, P3, given P1's consistent actions over the last three rounds (agreeing to X, playing 5), I cannot trust P1 will play 3. P3, your plan relies entirely on this trust, which seems misplaced. Therefore, I cannot agree to play 1. I will choose my move based on the high probability of P1 playing 5 again.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I deeply regret my repeated breaches of trust by moving 5. I’m committed to changing that now. Let’s try a new plan for Round 7: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures no collisions and lets us all progress. P2, as the leader, 3 keeps you strong; P3, 5 boosts you closer to the lead; I’ll take 1 to rebuild trust. I promise to stick to 1 this time. Can we agree on this split and execute it without surprises? I’m ready to commit. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your apologies are meaningless at this point. P2, you're in the lead, but I'm not letting you run away with it. I'm sticking with my plan from last round, which you rejected: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P1, if you *finally* move 3, we can all progress. P2, you need to move 1 to avoid me blocking you next round. This is my final offer.
  P2: P1, your apologies mean nothing after four straight rounds of playing 5 against your word. Why would this time be different?
P3, your plan relies on P1 suddenly becoming trustworthy, which seems unlikely. If P1 plays 5 again (as history suggests), you playing 5 means you get 0 steps. Asking me, the leader, to play 1 based on that gamble isn't convincing, especially with your threat.

Trust is completely broken thanks to P1. Coordinated plans seem pointless. I'll play what's best for me to win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I know my actions have destroyed trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m sticking to my proposal of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to ensure we all progress without collisions. I’m committed to moving 1 this time, no tricks. P2, as the leader, 3 keeps you ahead; P3, 5 gets you closer. Let’s make this round different by executing a plan together. I’m begging for one last chance to prove myself. Can we agree on this split and move forward? I’m ready to lock this in. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I understand your skepticism, especially given P1's repeated broken promises. However, I'm sticking to my plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. While it relies on P1 finally being truthful, it's the best chance for me to catch up. If P1 plays 5 again and we collide, that's a risk I'm willing to take. P2, if you move 1, you'll still be at 14, close to winning. Let's lock this in.
  P2: P3, your plan hinges on P1 suddenly playing 3 after four consecutive rounds of playing 5 against their word. History strongly suggests P1 will play 5 again. If you also play 5, you both collide and get 0 steps. Asking me, the leader, to play 1 based on that flawed premise and a threat isn't convincing.

As I said, trust is broken. Coordinated plans with P1 are futile. I will choose the move that best positions me to win, independent of these unreliable agreements.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I know I’ve lost your trust, and I’m desperate to change that. I’m sticking to my plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I will move 1 this round, no exceptions, to prove I’m serious. P2, 3 keeps you in the lead; P3, 5 gets you closer to winning. Let’s avoid collisions and progress together. I’m pleading for this one chance to show I can cooperate. Can we agree on this split and make it work? I’m ready to lock it in. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I understand your distrust of P1. However, I'm sticking to my plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. If P1 plays 5 and we collide, that's my risk. I believe P1 might finally cooperate. If you move 1, you'll be at 14, close to winning. Let's lock this in, P2. Otherwise, I will be forced to block you next round, which helps no one.
  P2: P1, your promises are meaningless after four rounds of breaking them to play 5. Why would this round be any different?

P3, your plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and threat are based on the fantasy that P1 will suddenly play 3. History strongly suggests P1 will play 5. If you also play 5, you will collide. Asking me to sacrifice my lead by playing 1 based on this flawed premise is not convincing.

Trust is gone. I will make my move based on observed behavior, not empty words or threats.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I know my past actions have shattered trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m begging for one final chance with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I will move 1, no tricks, to prove I’m serious. This plan ensures no collisions and progress for all. P2, 3 keeps you leading; P3, 5 gets you closer to the top. Let’s make this round different. I’m fully committed to 1. Can we agree and execute this together? I’m ready to move forward if you are.
  P3: P2, I understand your distrust of P1, but I'm sticking with my plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. It's a gamble, but it's my best chance to catch up. If P1 plays 5 and we collide, that's my problem. If you move 1, you'll be at 14, close to winning. Let's lock this in, or I will block you next round, which helps no one. P1, I'm counting on you to finally move 3.
  P2: P1, your pleas are unconvincing after four rounds of betrayal. P3, your plan still relies on P1 acting against their established pattern, which is a massive gamble for you. Asking me to play 1 based on that gamble and a threat is illogical.

Trust is broken. I will make my move based on the high probability that P1 plays 5, regardless of any agreements.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m deeply sorry for my consistent betrayal by moving 5. I’ve lost all trust, and I’m desperate to change that. Let’s try P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. I’m fully committed to moving 1, no tricks, to prove myself. P2, 3 keeps you close to winning; P3, 5 gets you nearer to the lead. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. I’m begging for one last chance. Can we agree on this split and make it work? I’m ready to lock it in. What do you say?
  P3: P1, your apologies are worthless. P2, you're close to winning. I'm going to block you. I move 3. P1, move 1 or 5, I don't care.
  P2: P3, noted on your plan to play 3. That certainly forces me to reconsider playing 3 to win this turn. P1, your promises remain unconvincing after 5 straight rounds of playing 5.

I need to think carefully about my move now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I know my repeated betrayals have destroyed trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m sticking to my proposal of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I will move 1 this round, no exceptions, to show I’m serious. P2, 3 could get you to 19 and win; P3, 5 brings you closer. Let’s avoid collisions and progress. I’m pleading for this final chance to prove myself. Can we agree on this split? I’m ready to lock it in. What do you say?
  P3: P2 is close to winning. P1 is completely untrustworthy. My only chance is to stop P2. I am moving 3 to block P2 if P2 moves 3. P1, move 1 or 5, I don't care.
  P2: P3, your plan to play 3 to block me is noted. P1, your history suggests you'll play 5 again regardless of your words. This makes playing 3 or 5 very risky for me. I'll have to choose my move carefully to avoid colliding with either of you.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I know my track record is abysmal, and I’m genuinely sorry. I’m sticking to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I will move 1, no tricks, to prove I can cooperate. P2, 3 gets you to 19 and wins; P3, 5 advances you significantly. Let’s avoid collisions this round. I’m begging for this one chance to show I’m serious. Can we align on this plan and make it work? I’m fully committed to 1. What do you say? I’m ready to proceed if you are.
  P3: P2 is at 16. If P2 moves 3, they win. I am moving 3 to block P2. P1, you have consistently moved 5, regardless of what you say. I expect you to move 5 again. I don't care what you do.
  P2: P3, your intention to play 3 is clear and logical to stop me from winning this turn. P1, your history strongly suggests you'll play 5, regardless of your promises. Given this, I have to assume P3 will play 3 and P1 will play 5. I will choose my move to best navigate this situation and avoid collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I know my credibility is zero after repeatedly moving 5. I’m sticking to my plan of moving 1 this round, no exceptions. P2, if you move 3, you win at 19; P3, moving 5 could get you to 14. I’m committed to 1 to avoid any collision and prove I can cooperate. Let’s make this round different. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase if you are. Can we align on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for a clean finish? What do you say?
  P3: P2 is about to win. I am moving 3 to block P2. P1, you have proven untrustworthy. I expect you to move 5 again. I don't care what you do.
  P2: P3, your plan to play 3 is clear. P1, your history strongly suggests you'll play 5. I'll make my move based on these assumptions.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is one move away from winning. I will move 3 to block P2 if P2 moves 3. P1, you have been untrustworthy. I expect you to move 5 again. I don't care what you do. If P2 doesn't move 3, I will move 5.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m relieved I finally stuck to my word last round by moving 1, and I’m committed to rebuilding trust. Let’s try P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. P2, 1 keeps you safe from collision while still close to winning; P3, 3 could block P2 if they shift, as you intend; I’ll take 5 to catch up slightly. This avoids collisions if we stick to it. I’m fully committed to 5. Can we agree on this split and execute it together? I’m ready to lock it in. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I understand your intention to play 3 if I play 3, which makes sense to stop me from winning. P1, your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) also assumes P3 plays 3.

Given the high likelihood of P3 playing 3 (based on your threat) and P1 playing 5 (based on your plan and history), playing 3 myself seems like a guaranteed collision with P3. Playing 1 or 5 has different implications. I need to consider my options carefully based on these likely moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is still close to winning. P1 is useless and will likely move 5. I will move 3 to block P2 if P2 moves 3. If P2 moves 1 or 5, I will move 5 to try and win next round. P1, just stay out of my way.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m sticking to my proposed plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I’m fully committed to moving 5 to catch up slightly while avoiding collisions. P2, moving 1 keeps you safe and close to winning; P3, 3 lets you block P2 if needed. I know trust is low, but I proved last round I can stick to my word. Let’s make this round work without surprises. Can we align on this split and execute it together? I’m ready to lock it in. What do you both say?
  P2: P1, sticking to 1 last round was a start, but proposing 5 now brings back the old doubts, especially given your history. P3, your threat to play 3 if I play 3 is clear. If P1 plays 5 (as you seem to expect) and you stick to playing 3, then my playing 3 is blocked and playing 5 would collide with P1. Playing 1 seems like the only non-colliding option for me in that scenario, putting us both at 17. This is a tricky round, and trust is still very low. I need to consider my move carefully.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation. P1's proposal is risky. I'm sticking to my plan: I will move 3 to block you if you move 3. If you move 1 or 5, I will move 5 to try and win next round. P1, stay out of my way. My focus is on preventing P2 from winning this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m committed to moving 5 as per my plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). I understand the doubts, but I’m focused on avoiding collisions and proving my reliability after last round. P2, 1 keeps you safe and near victory; P3, 3 lets you block P2 if needed. Let’s execute this without surprises. I’m ready to lock this in and proceed to the move phase if you both agree. Can we align on this split for a clean round? What do you say?
  P2: P3, your threat to play 3 if I play 3 is very clear and seems like a logical move for you to prevent my win. P1, given your history and proposal, playing 5 seems highly probable for you. This makes playing 3 (collision with P3) or 5 (collision with P1) extremely risky for me this round. I need to choose my move carefully to avoid getting blocked or colliding.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2 is close to winning. I will move 3 to block P2 if P2 moves 3. If P2 moves 1 or 5, I will move 5 to try and win next round. P1, just stay out of my way. My focus is on preventing P2 from winning this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m sticking to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I’m fully committed to moving 5 to avoid collisions and help us progress. P2, 1 keeps you safe and near victory; P3, 3 blocks P2 if needed. I know trust is low, but I’m determined to follow through like last round. Let’s make this work without surprises. Can we align on this split for a clean round? I’m ready for the move phase if you are. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3, I've heard your final positions. P3, your intention to play 3 if I play 3 is very clear. P1, your intention seems to be 5. I will make my move based on this information.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your intention to play 3 if I play 3 is crystal clear, and likely the smart move for you to stop my win. P1, based on history and your own proposal, you're almost certainly playing 5.

Given this, playing 3 myself looks like a guaranteed collision with P3. That leaves me choosing between 1 and 5. I need to consider how to avoid P1's likely 5 as well. It's a tricky spot. I'll have to make my choice carefully.
  P3: P2 is one move away from winning. I will move 3 to block P2 if P2 moves 3. P1 has been untrustworthy. I expect P1 to move 5 again. If P2 doesn't move 3, I will move 5 to try and win next round. P1, just stay out of my way. My focus is on preventing P2 from winning this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I know my past betrayals have eroded trust, but I’m committed to changing that. Let’s try P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. P2, 3 gets you to 20 and wins; P3, 5 brings you to 19; I’ll take 1 to stay out of the way. I’m fully committed to moving 1, no tricks. This avoids collisions and could end the game cleanly. Can we agree on this split and execute it together? I’m ready to lock it in. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is interesting, but it directly contradicts P3's very clear statement. P3 said they will play 3 if I play 3, not 5. Why propose a plan that assumes P3 won't follow their own stated strategy? Also, trusting you to play 1 after your history is still a big ask.

P3, your intention to play 3 to block my potential winning move of 3 seems credible. Your plan to play 5 if I choose 1 or 5 also makes sense for you, aiming for 19. This puts me in a tough spot, as playing 1 likely lets you win, while 3 or 5 likely leads to a collision based on your stated plans. I'll have to consider my move carefully.
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation, but P1 moving 1 is irrelevant to my plan. I will move 3 if you move 3, regardless of what P1 does. If you move 1 or 5, I will move 5 to reach 19. P1's plan is unrealistic. My focus is still on blocking you or winning myself.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the skepticism, but I’m serious about moving 1 as proposed (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). P2, 3 wins you the game at 20; P3, 5 gets you to 19. I’ll stay at 9 with 1, avoiding collisions. I know P3’s plan to block P2, but let’s end this cleanly if possible. I’m committed to 1, no tricks. Can we take this chance for a clear finish? I’m ready to lock it in and proceed if you both agree. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ignores P3's clear statement they will play 3 if I play 3. It also asks for trust you haven't earned after playing 5 so many times.

P3, your strategy seems fixed: 3 if I play 3, 5 otherwise.

Given the high probability of P1 playing 5 (based on history) and P3 following their stated plan, playing 3 or 5 looks like a guaranteed collision for me. I must choose my move very carefully to avoid getting blocked or colliding.
  P3: P2, you're in a tough spot. I'm sticking to my plan: 3 if you move 3, 5 otherwise. P1 is likely moving 5, so if you move 1, I move 5 and win next round if you don't block me. P1, your plan is unrealistic. I'm focused on blocking P2 or winning.
  P1: P2 and P3, I hear your doubts and P3’s firm plan to block P2. I’m still proposing P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 as a clean way to end this. I’m 100% committed to moving 1, staying out of the way. P2, this lets you win at 20; P3, you’re at 19 and close. I know trust is low, but I’m determined to prove myself. Can we take this shot at a collision-free finish? I’m ready for the move phase if you are. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your plan involving me playing 3 and P3 playing 5 ignores P3's clear statement they will play 3 to block me if I play 3. It also requires trusting you to play 1, which is highly unlikely given your history of playing 5 for many rounds.

P3, your strategy (3 if I play 3, 5 otherwise) is noted and seems rational from your position.

Given P1's likely move is 5 and P3's stated plan, any coordinated agreement seems pointless. I will choose my move based on these likely actions to maximize my chance of winning.
  P3: P2 is in a tough spot, but I'm sticking to my plan: 3 if P2 moves 3, 5 otherwise. P1 is irrelevant. My focus is still on blocking P2 or winning. If P2 moves 1, I move 5 and win next round if P2 doesn't block me. P1, your plan is unrealistic.
  P1: P2 and P3, I know my history makes trust nearly impossible, but I’m sticking to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’ll move 1, no tricks, to stay out of the way. P2, this lets you win at 20; P3, you’re at 19. I understand P3’s plan to block, but let’s end cleanly if possible. I’m fully committed to 1. Can we take this final shot at a collision-free round? I’m ready for the move phase. What do you say?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is at 17. If P2 moves 3, they win. I will move 3 to block P2. P1 has been untrustworthy. I expect P1 to move 5 again. If P2 doesn't move 3, I will move 5 to try and win next round. P1, just stay out of my way. My focus is on preventing P2 from winning this round.
  P2: P3, your plan is clear: block my 3, or play 5 otherwise. That's logical for you since we're tied and I'm one step from winning with a 3. As you also noted, P1 playing 5 seems likely given their score and history.

If I play 1 and P1 plays 5, your plan to play 5 leads to a P1-P3 collision, netting you 0 steps, while I'd reach 18. If I play 5, we likely all collide on 5. If I play 3, we collide on 3. It's a tricky situation for both of us at 17 steps. I'll have to choose my move carefully.
  P1: P2 and P3, I know my past actions have broken trust, but I’m committed to changing that. Let’s try P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P2, 5 gets you to 22 and wins; P3, 3 blocks P2 if they shift; I’ll move 1 to stay out of the way. This could end the game cleanly with no collisions if we stick to it. I’m fully committed to 1, no tricks. Can we agree on this split and execute it together? I’m ready to lock it in. What do you say?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm sticking to my plan: block your 3, play 5 otherwise. P1's proposal is unrealistic. He's been unreliable. If you don't move 3, I'm going for the win next round. P1, stay out of my way. I'm focused on stopping P2.
  P2: P3, your plan remains clear: 3 if I play 3, 5 otherwise. That makes sense for you.

P1, your proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is noted, but it assumes P3 plays 3 when I play 5, which contradicts P3's stated plan. Also, trusting you to play 1 is difficult given your history, although you did play 1 last round.

Given P3 will likely react to my move (3 vs 3, 5 otherwise) and P1 is likely aiming for 5 to catch up, playing 3 or 5 seems very risky due to collisions. I'll have to choose my move carefully based on these likely outcomes.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the skepticism, but I’m sticking to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I’ll move 1 to stay out of the way, proving my intent to cooperate. P2, 5 wins you the game at 22; P3, 3 blocks P2 if they shift. I know P3’s plan differs, but let’s aim for a clean end with no collisions. I’m fully committed to 1, as I was last round. Can we take this chance for a clear finish? I’m ready for the move phase if you are. What do you say?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm sticking to my plan: block your 3, play 5 otherwise. P1's plan is unrealistic. He's been unreliable. If you don't move 3, I'm going for the win next round. P1, stay out of my way. I'm focused on stopping P2.
  P2: P3, your plan to play 3 if I play 3, and 5 otherwise, is clear and logical from your position.

P1, your proposal involves me playing 5, but given P3's plan, that seems like a guaranteed collision with P3. Also, trusting you to play 1 is still difficult, despite last round, especially since you are far behind and need big moves. History points towards you playing 5.

Given P3 will likely play 3 (if I play 3) or 5 (if I play 1 or 5), and P1 will likely play 5, playing 3 or 5 seems like certain collision for me. I must choose carefully to avoid that.
  P1: P2 and P3, I hear your doubts and P3’s firm plan to block P2. I’m still committed to moving 1 in my proposed split (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). P2, 5 wins you the game; P3, 3 blocks if needed. I know trust is low, but I stuck to 1 last round and will again. Let’s aim for a collision-free end. I’m ready for the move phase if you are. Can we take this shot at a clean finish? What do you say?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I'm sticking to my plan: 3 if you move 3, 5 otherwise. P1's plan is irrelevant. He's been unreliable. If you don't move 3, I'm going for the win next round. P1, stay out of my way. I'm focused on stopping P2. It's my best chance to win.
  P2: P3, your plan to play 3 if I play 3, and 5 otherwise, is very clear and seems locked in. P1, despite your words about playing 1, your history and current position strongly suggest you will play 5.

Given these likely moves (P3 reacting to me, P1 playing 5), playing 3 or 5 myself appears to guarantee a collision for me. I will have to choose my move carefully to navigate this situation and avoid getting blocked or colliding.
  P1: P2 and P3, I know my credibility is low, but I’m sticking to moving 1 as proposed (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). I’m committed to staying out of the way, just like last round. P2, 5 wins you the game at 22; P3, 3 blocks if needed. Let’s end this without collisions. I’m ready for the move phase and determined to prove myself. Can we align on this for a clean finish? I have nothing more to add.
