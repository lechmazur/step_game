Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all try to pick different numbers this round.
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P2, you suggested picking different numbers, so how about P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5?
  P3: I’m not quite comfortable letting P1 race ahead with 5 while I only get 3. I’d rather take 5 for myself this round. How about: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep coordinating to avoid collisions. P2, how about you pick 3 this round? P3, you can pick 1, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion this round. I'll pick 3.
  P3: P1, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll choose 5 as well and we’ll both get stuck. It’s better for all if you pick 1, P2 picks 3, and I take 5. That way, no collisions happen and everyone advances.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I see your point. Let's compromise to avoid collisions. How about this: P2 picks 3, I (P1) pick 1, and you (P3) pick 5. This way, we all move forward without any issues. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, I'll pick 3 this round. P1, you take 1, and P3, you take 5.
  P3: All right, let’s do it. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5 so we all move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep the same no‐collision plan as last round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5, so we all advance safely again. What do you say?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's keep the same plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P1: I'm not comfortable picking 1 again while P3 keeps taking 5. How about we switch it up? I suggest P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5 this round. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll also pick 5 and we both gain nothing. It’s in your best interest to pick 1 or 3 while I pick 5, so we avoid collisions and all move forward. P2, you’re free to choose 1 or 3. Let’s keep advancing without hurting each other.
  P2: I'm fine with P3's suggestion this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P1: P1: Alright, I see the majority agrees on the plan. To keep things moving, I'll pick 1 this round as suggested. P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m good with the plan we’ve discussed: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5, so we all advance safely again.
  P2: Okay, I'll pick 3 again this round. P1, you take 1, and P3, you take 5.
  P1: Let's reconsider our strategy. P3 is significantly ahead. To balance the game, how about P2 and I pick 5 this round, and P3 picks 1? This way, we can catch up a bit. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, if you and P2 both pick 5, I’ll pick 5 as well and none of us will move. That helps nobody. It’s better for you to avoid colliding and keep advancing. Let’s stick to our previous no‐collision approach.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P1: Alright, I understand the majority's preference. To keep the game moving, I'll stick with picking 1 this round. P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's avoid collisions and continue.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I confirm the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I will pick 5. Let’s finalize this and move on.
  P2: Let's stick with the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P1: Alright, let's finalize the plan as agreed: P1 (me) picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, P3 is very close to winning. To keep the game interesting, how about P2 and I pick 5 this round, and P3 picks 1? This way, we can try to catch up. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I'm not going to pick 5. P3 is close to winning, so I suggest we stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P3: P1, P2—if you try to block me by picking 5, I’ll pick the same number and we all stay stuck. That keeps you from advancing too. It’s better to continue our no‐collision plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, everyone moves forward. Otherwise, we all waste a turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Alright, I see P3 is very close to winning. To keep the game fair, let's try to balance it out. P2, how about you pick 5 this round, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 1? This way, we can try to catch up a bit. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I'm not picking 5. Let's keep the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P3: P1, P2—collisions hurt everyone, and I’m already close to winning. If you both try to block me by picking 5, we all stall, and you gain nothing. It’s in your interest to keep the no‐collision plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I pick 5, so at least you keep advancing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, I understand the strategy. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and keep the game moving. P1 (me) picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's finalize this and move to the move phase.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P3: P1, P2—if either of you tries to pick 5 to block me, I’ll do the same, and we all get stuck. That doesn’t help you. Better to avoid collisions: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Then you both advance instead of wasting a turn. Let's finalize that plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Alright, let's finalize the plan to avoid collisions: P1 (me) picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P3: I’m sticking to our no‐collision arrangement. If anyone tries to block me by picking 5, I’ll do the same, and nobody moves at all. It’s better we each pick different numbers so everyone advances. Let’s finalize the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Alright, let's finalize the plan as agreed: P1 (me) picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P3: P1, P2—if either of you picks 5 to block me, I’ll also pick 5, and none of us will move. That gains you nothing. Best to avoid collisions so at least you keep advancing. I’m picking 5.
