This creates a legitimate fairness concern.\n\nSince we'll all be at 21 steps after this round, and Round 8 will determine the winner, I suggest we consider both our rotation pattern AND the overall balance of who's had advantages. Perhaps we could resolve this with a fair compromise for the final round that acknowledges both principles?\n\nFor now, I confirm taking 5 this round as agreed."}
