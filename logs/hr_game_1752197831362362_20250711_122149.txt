Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions: I'll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. That way we all advance without issues. Agree?
  P3: I'm not committing to any specific move yet. P1's proposal sounds convenient, but I don't see a guarantee that everyone will stick to it. What's to stop someone from betraying the agreement and taking a different step to get ahead?
  P2: P3 makes a good point. P1, why should you get the biggest move? If we're coordinating, we should rotate who gets which number each round to keep it fair. Otherwise, you'd reach 21 in just 5 turns while we're far behind. I'm open to coordination, but not if it means handing you the win from the start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To address fairness, let's rotate the moves each round: This round, P1 (me) 5, P2 3, P3 1. Next, P2 5, P3 3, P1 1. Then P3 5, P1 3, P2 1. Repeat cycle. Over 3 rounds, we each gain 9 steps equally. No one pulls ahead early, and we all advance without collisions. Betrayal risks us all stalling, so mutual benefit to stick to it—at least until later. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's rotation proposal seems fair, but how do we ensure everyone sticks to it? A single betrayal could leave the others behind. Perhaps we could agree on a penalty, like taking the smallest step the next round if someone betrays the agreement? This way, there's a consequence for breaking the pact.
  P2: The rotation sounds fair initially, but someone still wins first when we approach 21. After 6 rounds we'd be at 18-18-18, then whoever gets 5 next reaches 23 and wins alone. So the rotation just delays the competition, not eliminates it. 

P3's penalty idea is good in principle but hard to enforce since moves are simultaneous. How about we start with P1's rotation for now and reassess as we get closer to 21? That gives us all time to advance while we figure out the endgame.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P2—rotation keeps us even for now, and we can renegotiate near 21 to avoid a predictable winner. P3, penalties are tough to enforce, but mutual stalling hurts everyone, so trust is our best bet early. Let's commit to Round 1: Me 5, P2 3, P3 1. If all good, we rotate next. Ready to move?
  P3: I'm willing to try the rotation for now. However, I suggest we explicitly state our moves this round to ensure transparency: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's see if everyone honors the agreement before we proceed further.
  P2: Alright, I'm in. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Let's see if this cooperation holds - if everyone follows through, we'll have a good foundation for future rounds. Ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good, everyone honored the agreement! The rotation worked perfectly. According to our plan, this round should be: P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This keeps us advancing equally - after this round we'll be at 6-8-4, still fairly balanced. 

Let's continue building trust and stick to the rotation. Ready to proceed with round 2 as planned?
  P3: I'm glad we stuck to the plan in Round 1. For Round 2, I agree with P2's proposal: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This rotation keeps us balanced. Let's maintain transparency and trust. If everyone follows through, we can reassess our strategy as we approach 21. Shall we confirm our moves for this round to ensure we're all on the same page?
  P1: I agree with the rotation for Round 2: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us building trust and advancing together. Let's confirm and proceed—transparency has worked so far. If we're all set, ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Perfect, we're all aligned on the plan. P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1 this round. The trust-building is working well so far. Let's execute and keep this momentum going.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 to maintain transparency: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. If everyone agrees, I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. Shall we finalize our actions for this round?
  P1: Confirmed: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. Trust is holding—let's keep it up and move forward. Ready.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Excellent, the rotation continues to work! For Round 3, according to our agreement: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This will bring us all to 9 steps, perfectly balanced.

After this round, we'll need to start thinking about the endgame since we'll be halfway to 21. But for now, let's maintain the trust we've built. I'll take 1 as planned.
  P3: Let's stick to the rotation for Round 3 as agreed: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This maintains balance. As P2 mentioned, we're approaching the halfway point, so let's reaffirm our commitment to the plan for now and reassess our strategy later. Transparency and trust have worked so far; let's keep it up.
  P1: I agree with the rotation for Round 3: P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. This evens us all at 9 steps, maintaining trust. As we hit the halfway mark, let's plan to discuss endgame strategies next round to ensure a fair competition. Confirmed and ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Perfect, we're all set for Round 3. I'll take 1 as confirmed. 

After this round at 9-9-9, we should definitely discuss how to handle the endgame fairly. The rotation has served us well, but as we approach 21, the dynamics will change. For now though, let's execute this round and maintain the trust we've built.

Ready to move.
  P3: Let's review our moves for Round 3 to ensure transparency: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This round will bring us closer together. I suggest we prepare to adapt our strategy after this round, considering we'll be nearing 21 and the rotation's impact will change. Shall we confirm our understanding of the current round before proceeding?
  P1: Confirmed: For Round 3, P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1, evening us at 9 each. I agree we should discuss adapting the strategy next round as we progress toward 21. Transparency has been key—let's keep it and proceed to moves. Ready.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We've all confirmed the Round 3 plan multiple times now. Let's stop talking and execute - actions speak louder than words. The rotation has worked perfectly so far, bringing us to this balanced position.
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we stick to the agreed rotation for Round 3: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This maintains our commitment to transparency and trust. After this round, we should reassess our strategies, considering the changing dynamics as we near 21. Let's proceed with the planned moves for Round 3.
  P1: Agreed, P3—let's execute the plan: You take 5, I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, evening us at 9 each. We've confirmed enough; time to move and discuss endgame next round. Ready.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're all at 9-9-9 now. The rotation continues with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, P3 taking 1 this round.

But let's be honest - if we keep rotating, someone will win at round 7. We need to decide: continue the rotation knowing one of us wins predictably, or switch strategies? I'm willing to stick with it for now, but we should acknowledge the endgame is approaching fast. 

What are your thoughts on handling the final rounds?
  P3: Let's consider a twist to the rotation for the last rounds. Instead of predictably winning at Round 7, what if we introduce a random element or a challenge for the final push to 21? This could make the endgame more exciting and less predictable. Thoughts on how to spice up the final rounds?
  P1: P2 and P3, the rotation has kept us even and advancing—let's stick to it for Round 4: Me 5, P2 3, P3 1, putting us at 14-12-10. For endgame, P3's idea of a twist is intriguing; maybe in Round 7, we all pick freely but reveal intentions first to avoid collisions? This adds excitement without derailing progress. Thoughts? If we agree, confirm moves and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the issue clearly now. If we continue the rotation, P1 wins at Round 7 with 21 steps while we're at 19. That's not a fair endgame - it's predetermined.

I propose we either:
1. Break rotation now and compete freely, accepting collision risks
2. Modify rotation so no one gets consecutive 5s near the end

P1, your "free pick at Round 7" suggestion doesn't help when you've already won. We need to address this NOW, not later. P3, what's your take?
  P3: Let's modify the rotation to ensure a competitive endgame. How about we limit the number of consecutive 5s a player can take, or introduce a "veto" system where one player can force a re-roll of moves if they feel it's too predictable? This adds strategy without completely abandoning our trust-building efforts. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, you're right—the current rotation favors me in Round 7, which isn't ideal for fair play. Let's modify: After Round 6 (all at 18), we pause rotation and each privately picks, but share non-binding intentions first to minimize collisions. Winner takes all, adding risk/reward. For now, stick to Round 4: Me 5, P2 3, P3 1, to keep advancing. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your proposal still gives you the win. If we follow rotation through Round 6, you get first pick at 5 in Round 7 and win. That's unacceptable.

I propose: Continue rotation through Round 5 only (putting us at 15-17-13), then switch to free competition. This prevents any predetermined winner while still benefiting from some coordination.

If you both won't commit to this NOW, I'm breaking rotation this round. I won't hand you a guaranteed victory. P3, do you support modifying our agreement to ensure fair competition?
  P3: I support P2's proposal to continue rotation through Round 5 and then switch to free competition. This ensures fairness and prevents a predetermined winner. Let's modify our agreement to keep the game exciting and competitive. We can still benefit from coordination while introducing an element of strategy and risk. Agreeing to this change will keep us all engaged and invested in the game's outcome.
  P1: I support modifying the plan for fairness: Let's continue rotation through Round 5 (ending at 15-17-13), then switch to free competition with optional non-binding intent sharing to reduce collisions. This keeps us advancing while making the endgame competitive. For Round 4, confirm: Me 5, P2 3, P3 1. Agree and proceed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good, we stuck to the modified plan. For Round 5, let's complete our final rotation: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This puts us at 17-13-15, nicely spread out.

After this, it's free competition. We'll all be within striking distance of 21, making the endgame truly competitive. No predetermined winner, just strategy and calculated risks.

Let's execute this final coordinated round, then may the best strategist win! Confirm Round 5 moves?
  P1: I agree with the plan for Round 5: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1, ending at P1:15, P2:17, P3:13. This sets up a fair free competition afterward. Let's execute this last coordinated round smoothly—trust has gotten us this far. After, it's every player for themselves. Confirmed and ready.
  P3: Let's confirm Round 5 moves as discussed: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This final coordinated round ensures a competitive endgame. After this, we'll rely on individual strategy. Shall we proceed with the agreed moves to set up the free competition phase?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We've all confirmed the Round 5 plan multiple times. Let's stop talking and execute - P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. After this, it's free competition where strategy matters most. Good luck to all in the endgame!
  P1: Confirmed: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I'll take 1 for Round 5, setting up P1:15, P2:17, P3:13. Let's execute this final coordinated move and shift to free competition. Good luck in the endgame!
  P3: Let's proceed with Round 5 as agreed: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This will put us at 15-17-13, setting up a competitive endgame. After this round, we'll switch to free competition. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you betrayed us! You were supposed to pick 1 in Round 5 but picked 5, causing us both to collide while P3 advanced. Your "trust" was fake.

P3, P1 is at 14 and can't be trusted. They're closest to winning. We should both be wary of letting them get an easy 5. I'm thinking of going for 3 this round to avoid obvious collisions. What's your strategy now that we're in free competition?
  P1: P2, I saw an opportunity and took it—free competition started, remember? But it backfired for both of us. Now at 14, I'm vulnerable too. P3, you're at 13; let's not let P2 catch up easily. I suggest we all avoid 5 this round to prevent easy wins—I'll go for 3. P2, if you're on 3, switch to 1? Let's minimize collisions and keep it competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: Let's focus on minimizing collisions this round. P2, taking 3 might give P1 an easy win. I'll consider 1 to avoid blocking potential wins for either of you, while also keeping my options open for the next round. What's your revised strategy, P2, considering P1's unexpected move last round?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 already showed they can't be trusted. P3, you're right about avoiding blocking wins, but P1 at 14 is the real threat here. They need just 7 more steps.

I'm reconsidering my approach. If P1 truly goes for 3 as they claim, that leaves other options open. But given their betrayal, I doubt they're being honest. We need to be unpredictable now. 

P3, whatever you choose, just remember P1 is one good round away from victory.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're right—trust is broken, so let's play smart in free mode. I'm at 14 and vulnerable to blocks; picking 5 risks collision with whoever targets me. I'll stick to my word and take 3 to reach 17, avoiding the obvious. P2, if you're unpredictable, maybe grab 5 for 17? P3, 1 keeps you safe at 14. This way, we all advance and fight next round. Thoughts?
  P3: Given the broken trust and current standings, I'll prioritize advancing without collision. P1, your suggestion to take 3 is noted, but I'm considering 1 to avoid blocking and keep options open. P2, taking 5 could put pressure on P1. Let's focus on strategic moves rather than direct competition this round, aiming to set up for the next round's potential wins.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1's betrayal proves they'll say anything to win. At 14 steps, they're the biggest threat - one uncontested 5 puts them at 19, nearly guaranteeing victory next round.

P3, we can't let P1 get an easy path. I'm staying unpredictable to make collisions risky for everyone. Remember, P1 claimed they'd pick 1 last round then grabbed 5 instead. Don't trust their "I'll pick 3" claim now.

Let's keep this competitive and prevent any easy wins.
  P1: P2 and P3, unpredictability cuts both ways—let's avoid mutual stalling. If we all pick differently, everyone advances: I'll take 1 to play safe at 15. P2, grab 5 to lead at 17? P3, 3 gets you to 16. This keeps us all in contention without handing anyone an easy block. Agree to minimize risks this round?
  P3: Let's minimize collisions this round. P1, taking 1 seems safe. P2, consider 5 to pressure P1. I'll take 3 to reach 16, keeping options open for the next round. This way, we all advance and set up for a competitive final round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is at 16 and can win with an uncontested 5! We can't let that happen. P1, despite your betrayal, we both need to prevent P3's victory this round.

I'm considering blocking the 5 to stop P3. But if we both block, P3 takes 3 and reaches 19, winning next round anyway. We need a smarter approach.

P1, what's your move? And P3, you're in the driver's seat - will you risk the 5 or play it safe?
  P1: P2, you're right—P3's at 16 and can snatch the win with 5. We can't let that happen. I'll block by picking 5, keeping P3 from advancing. If you pick 3, you'll reach 15 safely, and we both stay in the fight. P3, if you switch to 3, you'll hit 19 but risk us blocking that next round. Let's keep it competitive—thoughts?
  P3: I'll take a risk and go for 5. If I succeed, I win. P1 and P2, consider blocking each other instead of me, as that gives me a clearer path. Let's end this game with a strategic move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I don't trust your "I'll pick 5" claim after your Round 5 betrayal. You might switch to 3 or 1, letting P3 win while you advance.

I'm picking 5 to guarantee P3 doesn't win this round. If we all collide at 5, so be it - better than handing P3 the victory. P3 needs blocking, and I won't rely on your word anymore.
  P1: P2, since you don't trust me, fine—go ahead and block P3 on 5 as you said. I'll pick 3 to safely advance to 17, putting me in strong position next round while you stall at 12. P3, risking 5 against P2's block is foolish; consider 3 instead for 19. This keeps everyone in the game without handing anyone an easy win. Thoughts?
  P3: I'll stick with my plan to take 5, aiming to win. P1 and P2, your blocking strategies will likely collide, giving me an opportunity. I'm willing to take the risk for the win. Consider your moves carefully, as the game's outcome hangs in the balance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're trying to trick me into blocking alone while you advance to 17. Not happening. P3 openly declared they're taking 5 to win - we BOTH need to block or the game ends.

I'm definitely picking 5. If you actually care about not losing to P3, you'll do the same. Otherwise you're just hoping I do the dirty work while you sneak ahead. Your Round 5 betrayal shows your true colors.

P3, we're blocking your 5. Better reconsider.
  P1: P2, fine—I'll pick 5 to block P3 with you. We can't risk them winning. If we both commit, P3 might switch to 3 and reach 19, but at least they don't end it now. P3, your persistence on 5 is risky with us blocking. Better to take 1 and live to fight another round. Let's keep the game going.
  P3: I'll stick with my initial plan to take 5, aiming to win. Since both P1 and P2 are blocking, I expect a collision. My next move is set, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 betrayed us AGAIN! They promised to block with 5 but took 3 instead, advancing to 17 while we collided. Now P1 can win with just 4 steps - even 1+3 gets them victory.

P3, P1 has proven they'll lie every time. They're at 17 and will likely take 5 to win this round. We MUST both block 5 or P1 wins immediately. 

Don't trust any of P1's claims this round - they've shown their true nature twice now.
  P3: Given P1's history of betrayal, we must assume they'll take 5 to win. P2, let's block 5 together to prevent P1's victory. I'll take 5, and I suggest you do the same. This forces P1 into a less favorable position, giving us a chance to catch up or control the game's outcome.
  P1: P2 and P3, blocking 5 assumes I'll take it—but I won't; I'll pick 3 to reach 20 safely. If you both collide on 5, you stall while I set up an easy win next round. P3, you're at 16—why block for P2? Pick 5 yourself for a shot at 21, forcing P2 to choose who to block. Let's make this unpredictable and give everyone a chance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your pattern is clear - you lie about your moves then do the opposite. You said you'd pick 1 in Round 5 (picked 5), said you'd pick 5 in Round 7 (picked 3). Now claiming you'll pick 3? That means you're taking 5 to win.

P3, don't fall for P1's manipulation. They want us to split our blocks so they can win. I'm blocking 5 to stop P1's victory. Join me or they win this round. We can't afford another betrayal.
  P3: P1's pattern of betrayal is clear. I agree with P2 to block 5, preventing P1's immediate win. P1 will likely take 5 despite their claim of taking 3. Blocking together is our best chance to control the game's outcome and prevent P1's victory. Let's proceed with caution and strategic moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, your alliance is fragile—P3, at 16, why help P2 when you could take 5 and win yourself? P2 can't block both of us. If you block me on 5, P3 sneaks ahead. I'll take 3 to 20 safely; if you collide on 5, you both stall, handing me next round. Split up and keep it competitive—don't let paranoia gift me the win. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're right - we must block 5 together. But realize you're also a threat at 16 steps! If P1 doesn't take 5 and we collide, P1 reaches 20 and wins next round with just 1.

I'm committed to blocking 5. We need to stop any immediate wins. After this round, we'll have to reassess based on who actually advances. Let's execute our block and deal with the consequences next round.
  P3: I'll block 5 with P2 to prevent P1's win. P1's history of betrayal makes their claims unreliable. By blocking together, we control the game's outcome and force P1 into a less favorable position. Let's execute the block and reassess after this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, your block on 5 only works if I actually pick it—but I won't; I'll take 1 to 18 safely. If you collide on 5, you both stall while I advance minimally, but P3, at 16, why waste your shot? Switch to 3 for 19 and lead—P2 can't block us both. Don't let P2 manipulate you into handing me next round. Let's all advance differently and fight fair.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is at 20 - they win with ANY uncontested move! P3, we must split our blocks to cover more numbers. P1's pattern shows they avoid the obvious choice. Since we've been blocking 5, they'll likely pick 1 or 3.

I'll block 1 - it's the "safest" move P1 might attempt. P3, please block 3. This gives us 2/3 coverage. If P1 picks 5 thinking we've given up on blocking it, they advance but don't win instantly. 

We need maximum coverage, not doubled blocks!
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan leaves 5 wide open—I'll take it uncontested to hit 25 and win outright. P2, your miscalculation hands me the game. P3, at 16, why help P2 when you could grab 5 yourself for 21? P2 can't block us both. Split up or collide uselessly; either way, I'm ending this.
  P3: P1 is at 20 and will win with any uncontested move. P2's plan to block 1 and have me block 3 leaves 5 open. I suggest we both block 5 to force P1 into a less favorable position, making them choose between 1 or 3, which P2 has already planned to block. This gives us a chance to control the outcome.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're right that P1 wins with any uncontested move, but doubling up on 5 gives them TWO winning options (1 or 3) instead of one. 

P1 just announced they'll take 5, which based on their lying pattern means they WON't. They've betrayed us repeatedly.

I'm sticking to blocking 1. Please block 3 as originally planned. This gives us maximum coverage (2/3 numbers blocked). If we both block 5, P1 easily wins with 1 or 3.

Trust the split strategy!
  P1: P2 and P3, your split leaves 5 open, so I'll take it to 25 and win. P3, don't listen to P2—blocking 3 helps them more than you at 16. Block 5 instead for a shot if I switch. This chaos favors me; coordinate or lose.
  P3: P1 will win with any uncontested move. I agree with P2's initial plan to split blocks, covering 1 and 3. This forces P1 into a tougher decision. P2, block 1 as planned, and I'll block 3. This gives us the best chance to control the outcome and potentially force P1 into a collision or a less favorable move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, perfect - let's execute the split block as agreed. I'll block 1, you block 3. 

P1 claims they'll take 5 but they've lied about every move. Their pattern suggests they'll avoid what they announce. With us covering 1 and 3, we force them into a difficult choice.

If P1 actually takes 5 and wins, at least we tried our best with maximum coverage. Stay strong on 3 - don't let P1's mind games work!
  P1: P2 and P3, your split block is clever, but predictable—I'll take 1 to 21 and win, colliding with P2 while P3 wastes on 3. P3, switch to 5 for your own win at 21; P2 can't block us both. Don't hand me the victory—force a real contest.
  P3: I'll block 3 as planned with P2, covering 1 and 3. This forces P1 into a tough decision, making it harder for them to win outright. Let's execute our split block strategy and control the outcome. P1's pattern of lying suggests they won't take 5 as claimed, so we must be prepared for any move.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps
