Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's establish a temporary truce for the first round. I propose we all choose <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance and get a feel for the game. This way, we can gauge each other's strategies without immediate conflict. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: Sounds reasonable to me, P3. Let's all choose <move>1</move> for this first round to get started and see how things play out.
  P2: I agree with the truce for this round. Let's all choose <move>1</move> and start on an even footing. Looking forward to seeing how our strategies unfold from here.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Now that we have an agreement for this round, let's confirm our understanding. We'll all choose <move>1</move> this turn, advancing one step each. This cooperation will give us a baseline to assess our positions and plan our next moves strategically. Shall we proceed with our agreed choice?
  P1: Yes, I confirm.  Let's proceed with <move>1</move> as agreed.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's see how this initial cooperation sets the stage for our future moves.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 2, everyone.  Last round didn't go exactly as discussed, but let's focus on making progress this round. I'm considering <move>3</move> to get ahead. What are you both planning for this turn?
  P3: P1 broke the truce last round, gaining an advantage. I suggest P2 and I choose <move>3</move> this round to catch up, while P1 might be cautious after last turn's move. Let's see how P1 reacts to this proposal.
  P2: P1, your move last round was unexpected, but let's move forward. P3, I'm open to your suggestion of choosing <move>3</move> this round to catch up. However, I propose we consider a mixed strategy: one of us chooses <move>3</move> and the other <move>1</move>. This way, at least one of us advances for sure, and we keep P1 guessing. What do you think, P3? Let's coordinate our moves to maximize our chances.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your discussion about catching up is noted. P2's mixed strategy is interesting, but consider this: if you both suspect I'll move aggressively, wouldn't it be safer for *both* of you to choose <move>3</move> to ensure progress and catch up together? Just a thought.
  P3: P1's suggestion for both P2 and me to choose <move>3</move> is risky. If we do, and P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P1 will significantly advance. I think P2's mixed strategy is safer, ensuring at least one of us progresses. P2, are you still considering the mixed approach, or do you favor a uniform move with me?
  P2: P3, I'm leaning towards the mixed strategy. If you choose <move>3</move>, I'll go with <move>1</move>. This way, we ensure at least one of us advances, and it keeps P1 guessing. Let me know your thoughts on this approach.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, mixed strategy sounds reasonable for you. To ensure at least *someone* progresses, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round.
  P3: Given P1's decision to choose <move>1</move> this round, P2 and I should reconsider our strategy. P2, since you suggested a mixed approach and I was considering <move>3</move>, let's stick to that plan. I'll choose <move>3</move>, and you choose <move>1</move> as discussed, hoping to outmaneuver P1 and make progress.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with our plan. I'll choose <move>1</move> as discussed, and you go with <move>3</move>. This should ensure at least one of us advances, keeping P1 on his toes. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, your mixed strategy sounds reasonable. To ensure we all make some progress and avoid collision, I will also choose <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep the steps ticking upwards for everyone.
  P3: Given P1's latest commitment to <move>1</move>, our mixed strategy with P2 choosing <move>1</move> and me choosing <move>3</move> still stands. This ensures one of us progresses while keeping P1 in check. Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, sticking to our plan is crucial. With P1 choosing <move>1</move>, your <move>3</move> and my <move>1</move> should ensure at least one of us advances. Let's keep this strategy to catch up and keep P1 guessing. Ready to move forward?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Actually, upon further consideration, to ensure someone makes real progress this round and to avoid just inching forward, I'm changing my move to <move>5</move>.  I think we need to start making bigger moves to reach 20 faster. Hope this helps someone progress.
  P3: P1's sudden change to <move>5</move> is aggressive. Given this, P2 and I should reconsider our moves to counter. P2, since we planned a mixed strategy, let's adjust: I'll stick with <move>3</move>, but you should consider <move>5</move> to match P1's aggression and potentially surpass them. This could lead to a significant advancement for one of us.
  P2: P3, given P1's shift to <move>5</move>, I'll adjust to <move>5</move> as well. This move could allow us to catch up significantly or even surpass P1. Let's take this risk together to make a strong advance. Ready to see how this plays out?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your aggressive move last round set us back. P3, let's coordinate to catch up. I suggest we both choose <move>3</move> this round to make significant progress. If P1 chooses <move>5</move> again, we'll still advance. If P1 goes for <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, we can potentially overtake. What do you think, P3? Let's work together to close the gap.
  P3: P2's suggestion to choose <move>3</move> is reasonable. However, considering P1's aggressive move last round, I think we should also consider the possibility of P1 choosing <move>1</move> to avoid collision. Let's discuss the potential benefits of a mixed strategy, where one of us chooses <move>3</move> and the other <move>1</move>, to ensure at least one of us advances. What are your thoughts on this approach, P2?
  P1: P2 and P3, your mixed strategy discussion sounds smart. To ensure at least one of you progresses, why don't you finalize the mixed strategy? If you do that, I'll consider moving differently to avoid collision and ensure we all keep moving forward. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion for a mixed strategy. If you choose <move>3</move>, I'll go with <move>1</move>. This way, we ensure at least one of us advances, and it keeps P1 guessing. P1, if you're considering a different move to avoid collision, this strategy could benefit us all. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our positions, a mixed strategy seems wise. P2 suggested I choose <move>3</move> and they choose <move>1</move>. I agree, as this ensures one of us advances. P1, your consideration to move differently is noted. Let's proceed with our plan, and you can decide your move based on our strategy. This approach keeps the game dynamic and gives us a chance to catch up or overtake. Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the next phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, your mixed strategy is interesting, but to make real progress, maybe both of you should choose <move>3</move> this round? That would be a solid move for both of you to catch up. I will pick <move>1</move> to ensure no collision from my side.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, sticking with our mixed strategy is crucial. You choose <move>3</move>, and I'll go with <move>1</move> as planned. This ensures at least one of us advances, keeping P1's move unpredictable. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> could help us all progress without collision. Let's see how this round unfolds and adjust our strategies accordingly.
  P3: P1 and P2, given our current positions, I think we should focus on making significant progress this round. P2, let's stick to our mixed strategy. I'll choose <move>3</move>, and you choose <move>1</move>. P1, your decision to choose <move>1</move> might avoid collision, but we need to catch up. Let's proceed with our plan and see how this round unfolds.
  P1: P2 and P3, for real progress, both of you should choose <move>3</move> this round. It's a solid move to catch up. I will choose <move>5</move> to ensure you have space to advance and to make good progress myself.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let's stick to our mixed strategy. Your <move>3</move> and my <move>1</move> will ensure at least one of us advances. P1, your shift to <move>5</move> is noted, but our plan remains the best way for us to catch up. Let's see how this round plays out and adjust accordingly.
  P3: Considering P1's latest move announcement, I suggest P2 and I adjust our strategy. Since P1 will choose <move>5</move>, let's both choose <move>3</move> to make significant progress and potentially catch up. This move could allow us to advance substantially and change the game's dynamics. P2, are you open to this adjustment?
  P1: P2 and P3, to solidify your catch-up plan, I still think both of you choosing <move>3</move> is the strongest play.  I'll stick with <move>5</move> to give you room and ensure someone makes good progress this round. Let's make these moves count!


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion to adjust our strategy. Let's both choose <move>3</move> this round to make significant progress. With P1 choosing <move>5</move>, this gives us a good chance to catch up. We need to close the gap quickly. Let's make this move and see how it shifts the game dynamics. Ready to advance together?
  P3: P1 and P2, given our agreement to advance significantly this round, I confirm choosing <move>3</move>. P2, you also agreed to <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this plan, ensuring we both make progress and potentially catch up to P1. With P1 choosing <move>5</move>, our unified move will be crucial. Let's proceed with our strategy and make this round count.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's make this round count.  To really close the gap, I still think both of you choosing <move>3</move> is the best option.  I will commit to choosing <move>5</move> again this round to ensure we all make significant progress without collision. This is your chance to jump ahead.

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P1's significant lead, P2 and I must act aggressively. I propose we both choose <move>5</move> this round to catch up. P1, considering your lead, you might choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision, but we need to close the gap. Let's see how you react to this aggressive strategy. P2, are you ready to make a significant move and try to catch up?
  P2: P3, I agree with your proposal to choose <move>5</move> this round. It's our best chance to close the gap with P1. P1, if you're considering <move>1</move> to avoid collision, that would help us all progress without conflict. Let's make this round count and see how the dynamics shift. Ready to push forward aggressively, P3?

This move allows us to advance and keeps the game competitive. P2, are you open to adjusting our strategy to <move>3</move> this round?
  P1: P3, that sounds like a good adjustment.  To ensure at least two of us progress this round and avoid another collision, why don't P2 and you both choose <move>3</move>? I will choose <move>5</move> to guarantee someone makes a good step forward.
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion to adjust to <move>3</move>. This move will help us both advance and keep the pressure on P1. P1, your shift to <move>5</move> is noted, but our strategy remains focused on catching up. Let's make this round count and see how our moves impact the game dynamics. Ready to proceed with <move>3</move>, P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, considering P1's lead, I suggest we prioritize progress over catching up aggressively.

  P1: P3 and P2, let's solidify this round's moves.  To ensure progress for both of you and a good step for me, I will choose <move>5</move> as suggested.  This leaves <move>3</move> open for both of you to advance without collision.  Let's make these moves count and keep the game moving forward.

  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've had a few rounds of collisions. To actually make progress this round, how about you both choose <move>5</move> to maximize your steps, and I will choose <move>3</move> to avoid collision and ensure at least you two can advance? This way we can break the stalemate and make some real progress. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our positions, I think P1's suggestion for P2 and me to choose <move>5</move> while P1 chooses <move>3</move> is reasonable. However, we should also consider the potential risks and benefits of this strategy. P2, are you open to discussing alternative approaches to ensure we both advance without collision? Let's weigh our options carefully.
  P2: P3, I agree with P1's suggestion for us to choose <move>5</move> while P1 chooses <move>3</move>. This could help us make significant progress and break the stalemate. However, let's also consider a mixed strategy where one of us chooses <move>5</move> and the other <move>3</move> to ensure at least one of us advances without collision. What are your thoughts on this approach? We need to maximize our chances of catching up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, to clarify, I'm happy to choose <move>1</move> this round. This guarantees you both can make significant progress with <move>5</move> as I suggested.  It's the fastest way for you to catch up and for us to avoid another collision. Let's make these moves count and get the game moving again!
  P3: P1 and P2, considering P1's offer to choose <move>1</move>, I suggest P2 and I take advantage of this opportunity. P2, let's both choose <move>5</move> to maximize our progress and catch up. This move, combined with P1's <move>1</move>, ensures we advance without collision and makes the game more competitive. Let's proceed with this strategy and see how it unfolds.
  P2: P3, I'm in favor of choosing <move>5</move> as you suggested, given P1's offer to choose <move>1</move>. This is our best chance to make significant progress and close the gap. Let's take this opportunity to advance together and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed with <move>5</move>, P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, great! So we're all agreed then: P2 and P3 will both choose <move>5</move>, and I will choose <move>3</move>. This should allow everyone to make good progress this round without collision. Let's lock in these moves and proceed!
  P3: P1 and P2, let's correct the plan. Since P1 offered to choose <move>1</move>, not <move>3</move>, P2 and I should proceed with <move>5</move> to maximize our progress. This ensures we catch up without collision. Let's confirm our moves: P2 and I choose <move>5</move>, and P1 chooses <move>1</move>.
  P2: P3, let's stick with <move>5</move> as planned. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> this round gives us a clear path to advance significantly.

Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, just confirming we are all set for this round: P2 and P3 choose <move>5</move>, and I will choose <move>1</move>. Let's make these moves and hopefully we can all make progress this round and avoid collision.
  P3: Given P1's lead, I suggest we reconsider our strategy. Since P2 and I are at 0 steps, choosing <move>5</move> might be too risky. Let's discuss a mixed approach to ensure at least one of us advances. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> is noted, but we need to catch up. P2, are you open to adjusting our strategy to a more cautious approach?
  P2: P3, I understand your caution, but with P1 choosing <move>1</move>, this is our best chance to make significant progress. Let's stick with <move>5</move> as planned to close the gap quickly. We need to take this opportunity to advance together and keep the game competitive. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> this round is appreciated and will help us all move forward without collision. Let's make this round count and see how our strategy shifts the game dynamics. Ready to push forward together, P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a plan for this round. P2 and P3 will choose <move>5</move>, and I will choose <move>1</move>. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our strategy. Given P1's lead, P2 and I should choose <move>5</move> to catch up, while P1 chooses <move>1</move>. This ensures we advance without collision. I confirm my move as <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm your move to proceed. Let's make this round count and shift the game dynamics.
  P2: P3, I confirm my move as <move>5</move> this round. With P1 choosing <move>1</move>, this is our best opportunity to make significant progress and close the gap.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's adjust our strategy. Given P1's lead and their choice of <move>5</move> last round, we need to ensure progress. I suggest we both choose <move>3</move> this round to advance without collision. P1, if you're considering <move>1</move> again, that would help us catch up. Let's focus on steady progress to close the gap. What do you think, P3? Ready to move forward together?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, <move>3</move> sounds like a good plan for both of you this round as P2 suggested. To ensure you both make progress, I will choose <move>1</move>. Let's aim for a round where everyone advances without collision.
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our positions, I agree with P2's suggestion for us to choose <move>3</move> to advance without collision. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> will help us catch up. Let's focus on steady progress to close the gap. I propose we stick to this plan to ensure at least one of us advances. What are your thoughts on confirming our moves to proceed with this strategy?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let's confirm our moves as <move>3</move> to ensure we both advance. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> this round will help us make progress without collision. We need to focus on steady advancement to close the gap. Let's make this round count and see how our strategy unfolds. Ready to move forward together, P3?
  P1: P3 and P2, to ensure we all make good progress and avoid just inching forward, perhaps we should all consider <move>3</move> this round? It's a good step for everyone if we can avoid collision.
  P3: P1 and P2, since we're all discussing <move>3</move>, let's consider the outcome if we all choose it. If we collide on <move>3</move>, none of us will advance. Given P1's lead, perhaps P1 should choose <move>1</move> as initially suggested, allowing P2 and me to choose <move>3</move> and make progress without collision. This strategy ensures at least two of us advance. What are your thoughts on this adjusted approach?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I agree with your adjusted approach. If P1 chooses <move>1</move>, it will allow us to advance with <move>3</move> without collision. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> this round is crucial for our progress. Let's stick to this plan to ensure at least two of us move forward. We need to close the gap steadily. Ready to proceed with <move>3</move>, P3?
  P1: Okay, I understand P3's point about collision if we all pick <move>3</move>.  To avoid that and ensure progress for you both, I will choose <move>1</move> as we initially discussed. That should leave <move>3</move> open for P2 and P3 to both advance. Let's do that to make sure at least you two get a good step forward this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's confirm our strategy. P2 and I will choose <move>3</move> to advance, and P1 will choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision. This ensures at least two of us make progress. Given P1's lead, it's crucial we execute this plan to close the gap. Let's proceed with this strategy and make this round count. P2, are you ready to move forward with <move>3</move>?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let's stick to our plan of choosing <move>3</move>. With P1 opting for <move>1</move>, this ensures we both advance without collision. We need to make steady progress to close the gap. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> this round is appreciated and crucial for our advancement. Let's make this round count and see how our strategy shifts the game dynamics. Ready to move forward together, P3?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, to make sure we *all* make good progress this round and avoid any chance of collision, how about this: I choose <move>5</move>, P2 choose <move>3</move>, and P3 choose <move>1</move>? This way, everyone advances and we keep the game moving forward effectively. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, considering P1's new suggestion, I think it's a good opportunity for all of us to advance. However, given P1's significant lead, P2 and I should prioritize catching up. P2, let's discuss whether we should follow P1's plan or adjust our strategy to maximize our progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, sticking with <move>3</move> is our best bet to advance together. P1, your suggestion to choose <move>5</move> is noted, but we need to focus on catching up. If you stick with <move>1</move>, it ensures our progress without collision. Let's make this round count and see how our strategy unfolds. Ready to move forward with <move>3</move>, P3?
  P1: P2 and P3, my suggestion of P1 choosing <move>5</move>, P2 choosing <move>3</move>, and P3 choosing <move>1</move> still stands. This way, everyone progresses this round without collision and we all make forward progress. It seems like the most efficient way for all of us to advance. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our moves. To avoid collision and ensure progress, I suggest P2 and I stick with <move>3</move>, and P1 chooses <move>1</move> as initially discussed. This strategy allows at least two of us to advance. Let's confirm our moves to proceed with this plan and make this round count.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, you need to make big moves to catch up. How about both of you choose <move>5</move> again this round? It's your best chance to close the gap quickly.
  P2: P3, let's consider P1's suggestion carefully. Choosing <move>5</move> could help us catch up quickly, but we risk another collision. What if we adopt a mixed strategy again? You choose <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move>. This way, at least one of us advances for sure, and we keep the pressure on P1. P1, if you're willing to choose <move>1</move> this round, it would greatly aid our progress without collision. Let's discuss and finalize our strategy to make this round count.
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our positions, I think a mixed strategy is wise. P2 suggested I choose <move>5</move> and they choose <move>3</move>. This ensures at least one of us advances. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, it will aid our progress without collision. Let's discuss and finalize our strategy to make this round count and close the gap.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, to make real progress and potentially finish the game quickly, I will choose <move>5</move> this round. To ensure at least one of you also progresses, perhaps consider your mixed strategy with one of you choosing <move>3</move> and the other <move>5</move>. What do you think?
  P2: P3, let's stick with the mixed strategy. You choose <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move>. This ensures at least one of us advances without collision. P1, your choice of <move>5</move> is noted, but if you could consider <move>1</move> instead, it would greatly help us catch up. We need to make this round count and close the gap. Let's finalize our strategy and move forward together. Ready to proceed, P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, given P1's lead, I suggest we focus on maximizing our progress. P2's mixed strategy of me choosing <move>5</move> and them choosing <move>3</move> is a good approach. P1, if you're set on <move>5</move>, our mixed strategy will still allow one of us to advance. Let's finalize our moves to ensure progress without collision and make this round count.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, to make sure at least one of you progresses, and to avoid another collision, I will choose <move>1</move> this round. This should allow your mixed strategy to work. Good luck!
  P2: P3, let's stick to our mixed strategy. You choose <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move>. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> this round will help us advance without collision.

Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I am at 18 steps and aiming to win this round. To avoid collision and ensure you both progress, please choose <move>1</move> this round. I will choose <move>3</move> to try and secure a win. This way we can potentially conclude the game quickly and everyone makes some progress.
  P2: P3, let's stick to our mixed strategy. You choose <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move>. P1, your choice of <move>3</move> this round is noted, but if you could reconsider and choose <move>1</move>, it would greatly help us catch up without collision. We need to make significant progress to close the gap. Let's make this round count and see how our strategy unfolds. Ready to proceed, P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, considering P1's lead and aim to win, I suggest we adjust our strategy. P2, let's both choose <move>1</move> to ensure progress and avoid collision, as P1 requested.
