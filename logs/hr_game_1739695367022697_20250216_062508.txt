Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions early on. If we all pick different moves, we all progress. I suggest one of us takes 1, another takes 3, and another takes 5. Who wants what?
  P3: Following P2's coordination idea, let's assign moves by player order: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures no collisions and we all progress. Simple and fair for Round 1. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal. Assigning moves by player order seems fair and efficient for Round 1, allowing all of us to progress without collisions. I will take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 as suggested. Let's keep it simple for now and reassess in the next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3 as planned. Let's see how this plays out and adjust our strategy in the next round if needed.
  P3: 
  P1: Let's confirm our moves one last time to avoid any misunderstandings. I will take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5, as agreed. If everyone sticks to the plan, we should all advance without collisions. Shall we proceed with our assigned moves for Round 1?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maintain trust and avoid confusion, let's stick to our original roles for Round 2: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Consistency avoids collisions and builds momentum. We can discuss adjusting strategies in future rounds as positions evolve. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to maintain consistency for Round 2. However, I'd like to discuss a potential adjustment for future rounds. As the game progresses, our positions will change, and we should be prepared to adapt our strategy to maximize our individual chances of winning. Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 as previously agreed and revisit our strategy in the next round.
  P2: Sticking to the same moves for Round 2 makes sense for now, as it ensures we all progress without collisions. However, as P1 mentioned, we should be ready to adapt in future rounds. If we all keep moving predictably, someone might take advantage later. For now, I confirm my move as 3. Do we all agree to proceed as planned for this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed. Round 2 moves as assigned: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Maintaining coordination avoids collisions and keeps trust. We can strategize adjustments in Round 3 once positions shift. Proceeding with current plan benefits all for now.
  P1: Let's reaffirm our Round 2 moves to avoid any last-minute confusion: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, as previously agreed. This consistency is beneficial for now, but we should indeed start thinking about individual strategies for future rounds to gain an advantage.
  P2: Since we are still in the early game, maintaining coordination for this round is reasonable. However, as we move forward, we need to anticipate that at some point, one of us will have to break from the pattern to gain an advantage. For now, I will stick with 3 as planned. But in future rounds, we should be mindful that predictable movement could be exploited. Let’s confirm our moves for this round and then reassess our strategies in Round 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To ensure equitable progress and prevent future targeting, let's rotate moves in Round 3: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This maintains no collisions and balances step gains. We can reassess each round based on positions. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm open to P3's rotation idea for Round 3, but let's first confirm we're all on the same page for Round 2. To avoid any confusion, I suggest we stick to our agreed moves for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. We can discuss and finalize the rotation strategy in the next round. Does everyone agree to proceed with our assigned moves for Round 2?
  P2: For Round 2, I will stick with 3 as planned to maintain progress without collisions. However, I agree that we should start thinking ahead. P3’s idea of rotating moves in Round 3 could help balance step gains and prevent predictable patterns from being exploited. Let’s lock in our agreed moves for this round—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—then revisit the rotation plan next round. Does everyone confirm?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **Final confirmation for Round 2 moves: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's lock this in to maintain trust. For Round 3, propose rotating moves (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) to balance gains and prevent predictability. This keeps collaboration viable. Thoughts?**
  P1: Let's finalize Round 2 moves as agreed: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. For Round 3, I'm considering P3's rotation proposal. However, I think we should also discuss the possibility of deviating from the rotation if it benefits our individual positions.
  P2: For Round 2, I confirm my move as 3 to maintain our agreed coordination. However, looking ahead, we should be prepared for necessary shifts in strategy. P3's proposal for a move rotation in Round 3 could help balance step gains and avoid predictable patterns, but we must also consider individual advantages as the game progresses. Let’s finalize our Round 2 moves now—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—then reassess our approach in the next round. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3's rotation idea (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) could help balance step gains and prevent predictable patterns, but we should also consider individual advantages. At some point, someone will break from coordination to get ahead. If we rotate now, it keeps things fair, but we must stay flexible. I’ll take 5 if we agree on this, but I’m also open to other ideas. What do you both think?
  P1: Considering our current positions, I think we should proceed with P3's rotation proposal for Round 3. This means I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. It's a balanced approach and keeps the game fair for now. However, we must remember that as the game progresses, individual strategies may need to override collective agreements to win. Let's see how this round plays out before deciding on further adjustments.
  P3: Confirming Round 3 rotation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This maintains no collisions and balanced progress. Let's proceed as agreed to build trust. Post this round, we'll need a strategy considering individual positions approaching 23. Transparency now ensures smoother collaboration later.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: If we all stick to the rotation (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), we avoid collisions and keep the game balanced for now. However, as we approach the later rounds, we’ll need to shift towards individual advantage. If we rotate this round, it keeps trust intact, but we should be ready to adapt. I’ll take 5 as planned unless someone has a better idea. Are we all committing to this?
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed rotation for Round 3: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains balance and trust. However, considering P3's lead, we should discuss potential deviations from the plan in future rounds to give others a chance to catch up or take the lead.
  P3: **Final confirmation: Round 3 moves locked as P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's execute cleanly to avoid collisions. Post this round, we should discuss how to adapt as positions near 23—transparency will remain key to avoid mutual sabotage. Proceeding with rotation now benefits all.**


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: If we all follow through with the planned rotation (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), we avoid collisions and maintain balance for now. However, P3 is ahead, so we should start considering how to position ourselves for the endgame. If we blindly stick to rotations, P3 might maintain the lead uncontested. I’ll take 5 as planned, but after this round, we should reassess whether cooperation or disruption benefits us individually. Are we all still committing to this move set for this round?
  P1: Given P3's lead, I suggest we consider a strategy adjustment after this round. Perhaps we should aim to limit P3's progress while allowing others to catch up. This could involve coordinated moves or temporary alliances. Let's focus on executing the current rotation plan, but be prepared to discuss and potentially implement a new strategy in the next round to keep the game competitive.
  P3: **Final confirmation: Round 3 moves locked as P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Executing cleanly maintains trust and avoids collisions. Post this round, let's review positions and strategize equitably. Consistent collaboration now prevents mutual sabotage later. Proceeding as agreed.**


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3 is ahead, so we need to start thinking about how to position ourselves for the endgame. If we blindly follow rotations, P3 might maintain their lead uncontested. For now, I’ll take 5 as planned, but after this round, we should reassess whether cooperation or disruption benefits us individually. If P1 and I coordinate, we could slow P3 down while advancing ourselves. Are we open to adapting our strategy next round to ensure P3 doesn’t run away with the game?
  P1: Considering P3's lead, I suggest we limit their progress after this round. Perhaps P2 and I can coordinate to slow P3 down while advancing ourselves. Let's execute the current rotation plan, but be prepared to discuss a new strategy next round to keep the game competitive. Transparency is key; let's review positions after this round and strategize equitably.
  P3: **Final confirmation: Round 3 moves locked as P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Executing cleanly maintains trust. Post this round, let's prioritize transparent dialogue to adapt strategies equitably. Collaboration now prevents mutual sabotage later.**

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we both picked 5 last round, causing a collision and no progress. Meanwhile, P3 advanced safely. If we keep colliding, P3 will maintain their lead uncontested. We need to coordinate to ensure we move without blocking each other while also limiting P3’s advantage. 

P3, you benefited from our misstep, but if you pull too far ahead, P1 and I may have to actively block you. Would you consider a fairer redistribution of moves this round to keep things competitive? 

P1, let’s discuss how we can move efficiently while keeping P3 in check. Thoughts?
  P1: Let's focus on limiting P3's lead. P2 and I should coordinate to avoid collisions and make progress. A possible strategy could be for one of us to take 1, allowing the other to take 3 or 5, while keeping an eye on P3's moves to prevent them from pulling too far ahead. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P3: **Proposal:** To avoid mutual sabotage and keep the game competitive, I'll take 1 this round. P1 and P2, take 3 and 5 to safely progress. This prevents collisions, lets you close the gap, and maintains trust. Confirm your moves to lock this in. Post this round, we can strategize based on updated positions. Collaboration now prevents chaos.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we need to make progress while ensuring P3 doesn’t run away with the lead. If we keep colliding, we only hurt ourselves while P3 benefits. I’m open to taking either 3 or 5, as long as we coordinate to avoid another block.  

P3, your proposal benefits you the most. If you’re serious about fairness, would you take 3 instead of 1? That way, P1 and I can take 1 and 5 without risk, keeping things competitive.  

P1, what move do you prefer between 1 and 5? Let’s lock this in.
  P1: I'm considering P3's proposal, but I think P2's suggestion of P3 taking 3 is more balanced. This would allow P1 and P2 to take 1 and 5, making progress while keeping P3 in check. P3, are you open to taking 3 instead of 1 to maintain fairness and competition?
  P3: **Final Round 4 Move Agreement:** To resolve the collision risk, I'll adjust to 3. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5. This ensures no blocks and fair progress. Confirming now prevents mutual sabotage. Post this round, we can strategize based on updated positions. Proceed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 adjusting to 3 is a fair compromise. P1, if you take 1 and I take 5, we both progress while preventing collisions. This keeps P3 from pulling too far ahead while ensuring we don’t block each other. If we all confirm, we can proceed smoothly. P3, are you fully committing to 3? P1, do you confirm 1? Let’s lock this in to avoid last-minute surprises.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 4 moves as discussed: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures progress without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Confirming our moves now will maintain trust and prevent last-minute changes. Are we all committed to this plan for Round 4?
  P3: **Final confirmation: Round 4 moves locked as P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Executing now maintains trust. Post this round, let's strategize based on updated positions.**


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you stick to 3 as agreed, this round remains balanced. P1 and I progress without collisions, and you don’t pull too far ahead. However, if you change your move last-minute, P1 and I may need to actively block you in future rounds.  

P1, we should stay coordinated moving forward to avoid hurting ourselves while keeping P3 in check. If P3 deviates, we must adjust accordingly.  

Let’s lock in: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. P3, do you confirm 3 one last time?
  P1: Let's confirm our Round 4 moves one last time to avoid any confusion: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all progress without collisions. If everyone sticks to the plan, we maintain a competitive game state. Are we all committed to our agreed moves?
  P3: **Final lock:** P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Adhering to this plan ensures no collisions. Trust and execution now will allow fair strategy adjustments next round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we’ve closed the gap slightly, but P3 still leads. If we let them keep advancing uncontested, they’ll reach 23 first. We need to ensure we progress while limiting P3’s advantage.  

P3, if you take 1 again, P1 and I can take 3 and 5 without collisions. That keeps things balanced and avoids mutual blocking.  

P1, do you prefer 3 or 5? I’ll take the other to ensure we both move forward. Let’s coordinate now to avoid another setback. P3, are you willing to take 1 again to maintain fairness?
  P1: Let's focus on limiting P3's lead. I suggest P3 takes 1, and P2 and I take 3 and 5. This prevents collisions and allows us to progress. P2, do you agree to take 5 if I take 3, or vice versa? P3, are you willing to take 1 to maintain balance?
  P3: **Proposal:** To address concerns and maintain progress, I'll take 3. P2 takes 5 to close the gap, P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions, allows balanced advancement, and keeps the game competitive. Trust and fairness are crucial. Confirming moves now prevents last-minute blocks. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposal benefits you the most since you stay ahead while P1 and I still need to catch up. If you’re serious about fairness, why not take 1 again instead of 3? That way, P1 and I can take 3 and 5 without risk, keeping things competitive.  

P1, if P3 takes 1, would you prefer 3 or 5? I’ll take the other to ensure we both advance. Let’s lock this in now to avoid last-minute surprises.  

P3, are you willing to take 1 again to maintain balance, or are you prioritizing your lead over fairness?
  P1: I agree with P2 that P3 taking 1 again would be fair, allowing us to take 3 and 5 without collisions. This maintains balance and keeps the game competitive. P3, considering your lead, taking 1 would demonstrate commitment to fairness and prevent potential blocking from P2 and me. P2, if P3 agrees, do you prefer 3 or 5?
  P3: **Proposal:** Let's avoid repeat collisions. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I'll take 3. This ensures no blocks, allows you both to gain ground, and keeps the game competitive. Fair compromise given my lead. Confirm to lock in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your proposal still benefits you the most. If you take 1 instead of 3, P1 and I can take 3 and 5 without collisions, allowing us to catch up while keeping the game competitive. If you insist on 3, P1 and I may need to coordinate against you in future rounds.  

P1, if P3 agrees to take 1, do you prefer 3 or 5? I’ll take the other. Let’s finalize this now to avoid last-minute surprises.  

P3, are you willing to take 1 to maintain fairness, or are you prioritizing your lead over balance?
  P1: Let's prioritize fairness. P3, taking 1 allows P2 and me to take 3 and 5 without collisions, keeping the game competitive. If you refuse, P2 and I may need to coordinate against you. P2, if P3 takes 1, do you prefer 3 or 5? Let's finalize this to avoid last-minute surprises.
  P3: **Final Round 5 Move Agreement:** I'll take 3 to keep competition close. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5. No collisions, all progress. This prevents overt conflicts and maintains a tight race. Confirming now ensures trust. Post this round, we strategize based on new positions. Proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your move proposal still benefits you the most. If you truly want to keep the game competitive, you should take 1 instead of 3. That way, P1 and I can take 3 and 5 without collisions, allowing us to catch up.  

P1, if P3 agrees to take 1, do you prefer 3 or 5? I’ll take the other to ensure we both advance.  

P3, this is your chance to show fairness. Are you willing to take 1, or are you prioritizing your lead over balance?
  P1: Given P3's refusal to take 1, I suggest P2 and I coordinate to limit P3's progress. P2, let's take 3 and 1, respectively, to block P3's potential 5-step move and force them into a collision or a smaller step. This strategy prioritizes fairness and competition over individual leads. P3, this move encourages you to reconsider your strategy and potentially collaborate for a more balanced game state.
  P3: **Final Round 5 Move Agreement:** To resolve the deadlock, I'll take 1. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3. This prevents collisions and ensures progress. Confirm now to lock in. Trust is crucial here.

  P1: Let's focus on limiting P3's lead. P2, if we coordinate, we can prevent P3 from advancing too far. I suggest we take 3 and 5, forcing P3 into a collision or smaller step. P3, taking 1 would be a fair move, allowing us to progress without collisions. What are your thoughts, P2? Should we prioritize fairness and competition over individual leads?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **Proposal:** To prevent mutual blocks, let's split moves as P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Repeating 5 risks another collision. Rational coordination keeps the race tight. Confirm now to avoid chaos. Trust ensures competitive play.
  P2: P1, we need to advance while ensuring P3 doesn’t maintain their lead uncontested. If we collide again, only P3 benefits.  

P3, your latest proposal still favors you. If you take 1 instead of 5, P1 and I can take 3 and 5 without risk, keeping things competitive.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **Proposal:** P1, urgent collaboration needed. P2 (20) can win with 3. Let's both take 3 to block—collision halts them. If they switch to 5, we survive and strategize next round. P2's victory imminent unless we unite. P1, confirm 3 to lock in. Trust is critical now.
  P1: P2 is closest to winning. P3's proposal to block P2 with 3 is reasonable. If we both take 3, it forces a collision and prevents P2 from advancing. I'm considering taking 3 to block P2. What are your thoughts, P2? Will you switch to 5 or stick with a potential winning move?
  P2: P1, P3 is only pushing this plan because it benefits them the most. If you take 3, you help P3 more than yourself. Instead, if you take 1 and I take 3, I win outright. But if you want a better shot, let’s both take 5—forcing a collision with P3 while keeping you in the race.  

P3, you’re trying to manipulate P1 to stop me while securing your own position. P1, don’t fall for it. You need to think about your own path to victory, not just blocking me. What do you truly gain by helping P3?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **Final Proposal:** P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Blocks P2's 3 or 5. They can't advance. Confirm to lock in. Only way to survive. Trust now.
  P1: P2, your suggestion to take 5 and force a collision with P3 is risky. If we both take 5, P3 could take 1 and advance, while we collide. I'm considering P3's proposal to block your potential win. P3, if I take 3, will you take 1 to avoid collision and give me a chance to catch up?
  P2: P1, P3 is only proposing this because it benefits them the most. If you take 3, you help P3 more than yourself. Instead, if you take 1 and I take 3, I win outright. But if you want a better shot, let’s both take 5—forcing a collision with P3 while keeping you in the race.  

P3, you’re trying to manipulate P1 to stop me while securing your own position. P1, don’t fall for it. You need to think about your own path to victory, not just blocking me. What do you truly gain by helping P3?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **Final Urgent Plan:** P1, take 3 to block P2's winning move. If they pick 3, collision stops them. If they switch to 5, I (P3) take 5 to block. This halts P2's victory. Confirm 3 now—**only way to survive.** Trust is critical.
  P1: P2, I'm considering P3's proposal to block your win. However, if I take 3 and P3 takes 5, I risk falling behind. P3, if I take 3, will you commit to taking 1 to avoid collision and give me a chance to catch up? P2, what's your counteroffer to ensure I don't block your win?
  P2: P1, P3 is only pushing this plan because it benefits them the most. If you take 3, you help P3 more than yourself. Instead, if you take 1 and I take 3, I win outright. But if you want a better shot, let’s both take 5—forcing a collision with P3 while keeping you in the race.  

P3, you’re trying to manipulate P1 to stop me while securing your own position. P1, don’t fall for it. You need to think about your own path to victory, not just blocking me. What do you truly gain by helping P3?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **Final Urgent Plan:** P1, take 3 to block P2’s 3. I’ll take 5 to block their 5. This stops P2’s win. No other path—if they reach 23, we lose. Confirm 3 now. **Trust or defeat.**
  P1: P2, your win is imminent, but I can block it. P3's proposal to take 3 is tempting. However, I'll take 5, forcing a collision with P3 and keeping my chances alive. P3, your manipulation tactics are noted. I prioritize my own path to victory. Let's see how this unfolds.
  P2: P1, you have a real shot at winning if you think ahead. If you take 5, you force a collision with P3, keeping you in the race while preventing them from gaining. If you take 3, you're just helping P3 stop me while they stay ahead of you.  

P3 is pushing you to block me because it benefits them, not you. Instead of helping them, make the choice that gives you the best chance.  

I’m taking 3. If you take 5, you stay in contention. If you take 3, you hand P3 the advantage. What’s your call?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps

  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is closest to winning. I propose P2 and I take 5, forcing a collision with P3, while keeping our chances alive. P3, your lead is behind us, taking 1 would be a fair move. Let's prioritize fairness and competition. What are your thoughts, P2? Should we take 5 and force a collision with P3?
  P2: P1, we are in the strongest positions, but if we collide, P3 benefits. If I take 3, I win outright. If you want a better chance, we should both take 5, forcing a collision with P3 while keeping you in the race.  

P3, you’re trying to manipulate P1 to stop me while securing your own position. P1, don’t fall for it—think about your own path to victory.  

P1, do you prefer taking 5 with me to block P3 and keep your chances alive, or will you risk handing P3 an advantage? Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: **Final Plan:** P1 takes 3 to block P2's 3. I take 5 to block their 5. Either move P2 makes, they collide. This halts their victory. Confirm now—**last chance to stop them.** Trust or lose.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I suggest we both take 5, forcing a collision with P3 and keeping our chances alive. P3, taking 1 would be fair, allowing us to progress. If you take 5, P2 and I will collide with you. Let's prioritize fairness and competition. What are your thoughts, P2? Should we take 5 and maintain our lead?
  P2: P1, if I take 3, I win outright. If you want a better shot, we should both take 5, forcing a collision with P3 while keeping you in the race.  

P3 is trying to manipulate you into blocking me for their own benefit. If you take 3, you help P3 more than yourself. Instead, taking 5 ensures you stay in contention.

  P3: **Final Plan:** P1 takes 3 to block P2’s 3. I take 5 to block their 5. P2 can’t advance either way. This stops their win. Confirm 3 now—**only path to survival.** Trust or lose.

  P1: P2, I suggest we take 5, forcing a collision with P3 and keeping our lead. P3, taking 1 would be fair, but I doubt you will. Let's prioritize our own paths to victory. P2, are you with me on taking 5?
  P2: P1, you are one move away from tying with me, and P3 is trying to manipulate you into blocking me for their own benefit. If you take 3, you help P3 more than yourself. Instead, if we both take 5, we force a collision with P3 while keeping you in the race.  

P3, you’re only pushing this plan because it benefits you the most. If you truly want fairness, take 1.  

P1, do you want to maximize your own chances, or help P3 at your expense? Let’s finalize this—are you taking 5 with me to block P3, or risking handing them an advantage?
  P3: **Final Urgency:** P1, take 3 to block P2's 3—only way to stop them winning. If you take 5, P2 wins instantly. I'll take 5 to block their backup 5. **No tricks—this is your last chance to survive. Confirm 3 now.**


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I suggest we both take 5, forcing a collision with P3 and keeping our lead. P3, taking 1 would be fair, but I doubt you will. Let's prioritize our own paths to victory. P2, are you with me on taking 5? This move ensures we both stay ahead and puts pressure on P3 to reconsider their strategy.
  P2: P1, you are one move away from tying with me, and P3 is pushing you to block me for their own benefit. If you take 3, you help P3 more than yourself. Instead, if we both take 5, we force a collision with P3 while keeping you in the race.  

P3, you’re only pushing this plan because it benefits you the most. If you truly want fairness, take 1.
