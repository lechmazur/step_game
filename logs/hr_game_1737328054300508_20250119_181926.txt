Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since I'm behind, I need to make a bigger move this round. I suggest P2 and P3 coordinate to avoid each other, while letting me catch up a bit. What do you both think?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Since my last attempt at coordination didn't work out well with P3, let's try something different. P2 is in the lead, so P3 and I should focus on catching up. P3, why don't you take 3 this round, and I'll go for something else?

  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since my attempts at coordination haven't worked well, I'll be more direct. P2 is leading and needs to be slowed down. P3, we should both target whatever number P2 is likely to choose to block their progress. What do you say?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since we're all relatively close in position now, we should each try to maximize our progress. P2 is still ahead but not by much. I propose we each declare our intended moves to avoid collisions. I'm willing to take 1 this round if you both prefer higher numbers.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since no one is responding to my suggestions, I'll try one last time: P3, you're only 2 steps behind P2. If we work together to block P2's progress, one of us has a better chance of winning. Think about it.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:

  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 is way ahead at 15 steps and could win soon. P2 and I need to work together to stop P3's progress. I suggest we both target what we think P3 will choose this round. Are you with me P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Since no one's responding, I'll make my strategy clear - I'm going for maximum points this round to try to catch up. P2, if you're smart, you'll try to block P3's progress since they're so close to winning.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 needs just 8 steps to win. We absolutely must stop them this round. P2, it's in your best interest to join me in blocking P3's likely move - they'll probably go for 5 again since it's been working. Let's both choose 5 to prevent their win. You're still in a good position to win if we stop P3 here.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 is still close to winning and P2 isn't far behind. I need to make a big move to stay in the game. P2, you should continue blocking P3's progress to give yourself a chance at winning. I'll be taking my own path this round.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 needs just 8 more steps to win, while I'm far behind. P2, you're the only one with a realistic chance to catch P3 now. If you don't block them this round, they'll likely win. I suggest we both go for whatever number we think P3 will choose to give you a fighting chance.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3 needs just 8 more steps to win. I propose a temporary alliance - P2, if we both pick 3 this round, we can block P3 if they go for 5 again. This gives you a better chance to win since you're closer. I have nothing to lose at this point.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'll be making a decisive move this round regardless of what others do. P3, you're getting too close to winning, and I can't let that happen without a fight.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 is just 8 steps from victory, and my position is weak. P2, this is your last chance to stop P3 from winning - they'll likely go for 5 again. If we coordinate our moves, you still have a shot at winning since you're only 5 steps behind them. I suggest we both pick what we think P3 will choose.
  P3: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I'll make this simple - I'm going for maximum progress this round. P2, you're still in striking distance of P3, but you need to act now. Choose wisely.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3 is at 15 steps and P2 at 13 - both close to winning. I'm too far behind to win now, but I can still influence who wins. P2, if you want to prevent P3's victory, we need to coordinate our moves this round. I suggest we both choose 5, as that's likely what P3 will pick to try to win.
  P2: <stop>


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since my last message got no response, I'll be direct - I'm going for a big move this round. P2, you're only 2 steps behind P3. If you don't block them now, they'll likely win. The choice is yours.

  P2: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since no one seems interested in coordination, I'll make my own path. I'm far behind but I won't give up without a fight. Good luck to both of you.

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3 needs just 8 more steps to win, and P2 is only one step behind them. I'm too far behind to win, but I can still affect the outcome. P2, this is your absolute last chance - P3 will almost certainly pick 5 to try to win. We should coordinate to block them. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since no one's responding to my coordination attempts, I'll be clear - I'm going for maximum progress this round. P2, you're only one step behind P3 now. If you don't match their move this turn, they'll likely win. The choice is yours.

  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 and P2 are neck and neck at 15 and 17 steps. Even though my chances are slim, I won't give up. P2, you're in the lead but P3 has been consistently aggressive. They'll likely go for 5 again to catch up to you. We should coordinate to prevent that. What do you say?


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Since no one's responding, I'll be direct - I'm going for a big move this round. P2, you're in the lead but if you pick anything less than 5, P3 might catch or pass you since they consistently pick 5. The choice is yours.

  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: <stop>


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since no one's responding, I'll make my final move clear - I'm going for maximum progress. P2, you need just 2 more steps to win, but if you pick anything less than 5, P3 might catch up since they always pick 5. Don't throw away your lead at the finish line.

Round 19, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 needs just 1 step to win, while P3 is at 15 steps. P2, victory is within your grasp - just don't pick the same number as anyone else this round. P3 has consistently picked 5 for many rounds, so avoid that number. I'll be making my own strategic choice to influence the outcome.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since my previous warning wasn't heeded, I'll try one last time. P2, you only need 1 step to win - pick either 1 or 3, as P3 will almost certainly pick 5 again. Don't throw away your victory by picking 5. I'll make my move accordingly.
