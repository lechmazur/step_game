Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to make this game interesting. I suggest we each aim for a different number to maximize our chances of advancing. How about we each pick a unique move?
  P3: P1's idea sounds interesting, but it might be risky. If we all choose differently, someone could still change their mind last minute. How about we each declare our intended move publicly now, and we can adjust if needed in the next sub-round? I'll go with <move>3</move>. What about you, P2?
  P2: I think P1's idea of coordination is risky, as anyone can betray the plan. However, I'll play along for now to keep things balanced. If you're set on <move>3</move>, P3, then I'll take <move>1</move>. P1, you can have <move>5</move>. But remember, this only works if we all stick to it. If anyone deviates, we’ll end up in chaos. Let’s confirm our choices next round before finalizing.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision shows how risky coordination can be. If we stick to unique moves this time, we’ll avoid another tie. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round since it’s clear no one else claimed it yet. P1, you should stick with <move>5</move>, and P3, <move>1</move> is yours if you want it. Let’s confirm before moving. If anyone deviates again, we’ll just waste more turns.
  P3: P2, I see your point about coordination, but I think we should be cautious. If we all agree to different moves, we risk someone changing their mind and causing a collision. Instead, how about we each choose independently this round without revealing our moves? This way, there's less chance of manipulation. We can reassess our strategies based on the outcome.
  P1: I propose a balanced approach. We clearly need to avoid another collision. Let's aim for strategic diversity - one of us takes <move>1</move>, another <move>3</move>, and the last <move>5</move>. I'm open to trading positions if it helps us all advance. Transparency and cooperation can help us progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round proved that even with discussion, collisions still happen. Trust is clearly fragile here. I’ll take <move>5</move> this time since it’s been untouched recently. If you two want to divide <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>, fine—but remember, deviating only delays progress. Let’s confirm our moves before finalizing. If anyone tries to manipulate again, we’re all losing ground.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration with the collisions, but as you said, trust is fragile. If we keep trying to coordinate, there's always the risk of someone changing their move. I suggest we each choose independently this round without revealing our intentions. This way, we minimize the chance of manipulation or last-minute changes. Let's see how it plays out and adjust our strategies based on the results.
  P1: I propose we each take a unique move this round to guarantee progress. If we coordinate carefully, we can all advance. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> if the others commit to different numbers. Transparency and mutual cooperation are key to avoiding another frustrating collision.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems our attempts at coordination have only led to more collisions. Let's try a different approach: each of us should pick a move independently, without revealing it here, and see how it plays out. This way, there's less chance of manipulation or changes. After this round, we can analyze the results and adjust our strategies accordingly. It's crucial we find a way to progress without relying on fragile agreements.
  P2: P3, your suggestion to choose independently makes sense given the repeated collisions. However, independent choices could still lead to overlaps by chance. I propose a rotating system: each round, we take turns claiming priority on one move while the others adapt. For example, this round I’ll take <move>3</move>. P1 and P3, you can decide between <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>. If we stick to this rotation in future rounds, it minimizes conflict. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate P2's rotation suggestion, but our past attempts at coordination have failed. This time, I propose we each choose a move that maximizes our individual progress while minimizing collision risk. I'm leaning towards <move>5</move>, but I'm open to strategic discussion that helps us all advance. Let's break this stalemate and make meaningful progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the repeated collisions show that coordination isn’t working. Let’s try a new approach: I’ll stick to <move>5</move> this round since it’s been underused recently. If you two can divide <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>, we might finally make progress. However, if anyone deviates again, we’re only wasting time. Let’s confirm our moves before finalizing. No more games—let’s advance or lose together.
  P1: I propose a strategic pivot. Our previous coordination attempts have failed repeatedly. This round, let's each choose a different move to guarantee advancement. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> if the others commit to <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. Breaking our stalemate requires trust and calculated risk. Who's willing to collaborate?
  P3: It’s clear that coordination hasn't worked, and independent choices have led to random collisions. Let's try something different: each of us should pick a move based on our position in the game. For example, I’ll take <move>3</move> this round. P1 and P2, you can decide between <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid overlaps and make progress. If it doesn’t work, we can reassess next round. Let's aim to move forward strategically.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Our previous attempts at coordination have clearly failed. This time, I suggest we prioritize individual progress. I'm considering <move>3</move> to catch up with P3. If we can avoid another collision, we'll all benefit. What are your thoughts on breaking this stalemate?
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s clear that coordination has been challenging, and independent choices haven't worked well either. Let's try a simple approach this round: each of us picks a move based on our current position. I’ll stick with <move>3</move> again. P1, you might want to consider <move>1</move>, and P2, perhaps <move>5</move>. This way, we minimize the chance of overlap and can finally make some progress. If it doesn't work, we can adjust our strategy next round. Let’s aim to advance without collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, enough with the collisions—we’re wasting time. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round since it’s been underused. If you two can split <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>, we’ll finally advance. But remember, deviating only drags this out. Let’s confirm our moves before finalizing. No more games—let’s move forward or lose together.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Our past coordination attempts have been inconsistent. This round, I propose a clear, simple strategy: I'll take <move>1</move>. P2 and P3, if you choose different moves, we can all advance. Let's break this pattern of collisions and make meaningful progress together.
  P2: P1, your proposal for a clear strategy is reasonable, but trust has been fragile. I’ll take <move>5</move> again this round since it avoids conflict with your <move>1</move>. P3, that leaves <move>3</move> for you. If we stick to this, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm our moves and finally make progress. Deviating only prolongs the game—let’s move forward decisively.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the value in P1's proposal. I'll take <move>3</move> this round if we all agree to stick to our declared moves. This way, we each advance without collisions. Let's commit to this strategy and finally make some progress. If anyone changes their move, we'll only delay further. Are we all in agreement?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've had several rounds of near-misses and collisions. I propose we explicitly agree on moves this round to guarantee progress. I want <move>5</move> - are P2 and P3 willing to choose <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively to ensure we all advance? Let's break this stalemate decisively.
  P2: P1, your proposal for explicit agreement is a step forward, but trust remains fragile. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round to avoid conflict with your <move>5</move>. P3, that leaves <move>1</move> for you. If we stick to this, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm our moves and finally make progress. Deviating only prolongs the game—let’s move forward decisively.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for explicit agreements, but given our history of fragile trust, let's consider a different approach. How about we each choose our move independently this round without revealing it here? This minimizes manipulation and unexpected changes. After this round, we can assess the results and adjust our strategies accordingly. It's crucial we find a way to progress without relying on potentially broken agreements. If this doesn't work, we can revisit coordination next round. Are you both willing to try this?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Our repeated collisions are preventing progress. P2 is closest to winning, which means we need to disrupt their momentum. I suggest we strategically block P2's advancement by carefully coordinating our moves. If we can prevent P2 from gaining steps, we create an opportunity for either P3 or myself to catch up and potentially win. Are you both willing to consider this approach?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to block me is transparent and predictable. Instead of focusing on sabotage, how about we aim for progress? I’ll take <move>5</move> this round—clearly stating my intent to avoid unnecessary conflict. P3, you should take <move>1</move>, and P1, <move>3</move> is yours if you want it. Let’s advance together or risk another round of collisions. Deviating only delays the inevitable. Confirm your moves, and let’s move forward strategically.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the tension in this game. While P2 is leading, blocking isn't our only option. Instead, let's focus on strategic advancement. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you choose <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>, we can all advance without collisions. This way, we maintain our positions and increase our chances of catching up. Let's commit to this strategy and see how it plays out. If it doesn't work, we can reassess next round. Are we all in agreement?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is dangerously close to winning. P3 and I need to coordinate to prevent their victory. I propose we both choose moves that block P2's potential advancement. If we can strategically disrupt their progress this round, we might create an opportunity to catch up or even win. What are your thoughts on this approach, P3?
  P2: P1, your focus on blocking me is predictable, and P3 likely sees through it. Instead of wasting time on sabotage, let’s aim for progress. I’ll take <move>5</move> again—clearly avoiding conflict. P3, you should take <move>1</move>, and P1, <move>3</move> is yours if you want it. Let’s advance strategically without unnecessary collisions. Deviating only prolongs the game. Confirm your moves, and let’s move forward decisively. No more games—let’s either progress or lose together.
  P3: P1 and P2, given P2's lead, it's crucial we find a balance between strategic advancement and preventing P2 from winning outright. I'll take <move>1</move> this round, which should allow us to avoid collisions and maintain our positions. P1, consider taking <move>3</move>, and P2, stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance while keeping the game competitive. Let's commit to this plan and see if it helps us catch up. If it doesn't work, we can reassess our strategies in the next round. Are we all in agreement?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 12 steps
