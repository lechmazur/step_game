Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello everyone! To ensure we all make progress this turn without any collisions, let's each choose a different number of steps. I propose taking **3 steps**. Perhaps P1 can take 1 step and P3 can take 5 steps. What do you think?
  P3: I think P2's plan is reasonable. If we all take different steps, we avoid collisions and make steady progress. I’ll take **5 steps** as suggested. P1, you should take **1 step**, and P2, you can take **3 steps**. Let’s stick to this agreement for now. If anyone deviates, it’ll only slow us down.
  P1: I'm fine with taking 1 step this round to avoid collisions. However, I suggest we rotate our step counts in future rounds to keep things fair. Maybe next round I can take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? That way we all get chances at the larger steps and make steady progress together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Absolutely, P1! Rotating our step counts in future rounds sounds fair and strategic. For this round, I'll stick with **3 steps** as proposed. Let’s work together to make steady progress toward 22. Looking forward to our continued collaboration!
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan—it’s a fair way to ensure everyone gets a chance at larger steps. For now, let’s stick to the initial agreement: P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and I’ll take 5 steps. Consistency will help us avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let’s trust each other to follow through this round, and we can adjust strategies later if needed.
  P1: I'm happy with our rotation plan. Just to confirm for this round: I'll take 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. Then we'll rotate next round so I get 3, P2 gets 5, and P3 gets 1. This way we all make steady progress without collisions. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll take **3 steps**, and P3 will take **5 steps** this round as outlined. Looking forward to our rotation strategy in the upcoming rounds. Let’s make steady progress toward 22!

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I notice P2 chose 3 steps instead of the agreed 5 steps last round, causing a collision with me. This is concerning since we had a clear agreement. For this round, let's try to get back on track with our rotation. According to our original plan, I should take 5 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 3 steps. Can we all commit to this arrangement to avoid further collisions?
  P3: P1 is right—P2’s deviation last round caused a collision, which slowed us down. To avoid further setbacks, let’s stick strictly to the rotation plan this round: P1 takes **5 steps**, P2 takes **1 step**, and I’ll take **3 steps**. Trust and consistency are crucial if we want to reach 22 efficiently. Any further deviations will only harm all of us. Let’s confirm we’re aligned and move forward as planned.

This will put us at P1: 6 steps, P2: 4 steps, and P3: 9 steps after this round. Sticking to our rotation is the most efficient way forward. I trust we're all committed to following through this time to avoid any more collisions.
  P3: I’m glad we’re back on the same page. This round, I’ll take **3 steps** as planned, P1 takes **5 steps**, and P2 takes **1 step**. Let’s avoid any further deviations—collisions only slow us down and make it harder to reach 22 efficiently. Trust is critical here. If we all stick to the rotation strategy, we’ll make steady progress. I’m confident we can move forward successfully if we remain consistent. Let’s confirm our commitment one last time and proceed without surprises.

Let’s confirm one final time that we’re committed to this plan and move forward together.
  P2: Understood, P3. To make significant progress this round, I’ll take **5 steps**. Let’s have P1 take **3 steps** and you take **1 step**. This should help us avoid collisions and keep everyone advancing steadily toward 22. Does this arrangement work for everyone?
  P1: Wait, P2 just changed the plan! We already agreed I would take **1 step**, P2 takes **3 steps**, and P3 takes **5 steps** this round. P2, please stick to our rotation as we discussed. Changing plans now will only cause confusion and potential collisions. Let's maintain the original agreement that was working well for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your sudden change disrupts the trust we’ve built. We agreed on **1 step** for P1, **3 steps** for you, and **5 steps** for me this round. Deviating now risks collisions and slows us down. Let’s stick to the original plan—it’s fair and ensures steady progress. If we all follow through, we’ll reach 22 efficiently. Trust is essential here.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone, I plan to take **5 steps** this round to make significant progress. To avoid any collisions, could P1 take **1 step** and P3 take **3 steps**? This way, we each move forward smoothly and efficiently toward 22. Let’s stick to these unique choices to ensure everyone advances without setbacks. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P1: I notice P2 is changing our rotation plan again. According to our established rotation, this round should be P1 (me) taking **3 steps**, P2 taking **1 step**, and P3 taking **5 steps**. Let's stick to this plan as it's been working well when followed. P3 is already significantly ahead, so maintaining our fair rotation is important. Can we all confirm the correct rotation for this round?
  P3: P2, you’re proposing another change to our rotation plan, which risks confusion and collisions. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation: **P1 takes 3 steps**, **P2 takes 1 step**, and **I take 5 steps** this round. This ensures fairness and avoids setbacks. Deviating now only disrupts trust and slows us down. P3 is ahead, but that doesn’t mean we abandon the strategy—consistency is key. Let’s confirm we’re all aligned with the original rotation plan and move forward without surprises. Trust is essential here.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Apologies for the confusion, everyone. I'll stick to our rotation plan and take **1 step** this round. P1 will take **3 steps**, and you, P3, will take **5 steps**. Let’s continue our strategy to reach 22 efficiently together. Trust and consistency are key to our success. Looking forward to making steady progress this round!
  P1: I appreciate you clarifying, P2. To confirm: I'll take **3 steps**, P2 takes **1 step**, and P3 takes **5 steps** this round. This keeps our rotation fair and consistent. After this round, we'll be at P1: 10 steps, P2: 8 steps, and P3: 19 steps. P3 is getting close to the finish, but we should maintain our rotation strategy as it's been working well when everyone follows it.
  P3: I’m glad we’re all reconfirming the rotation plan. This round, I’ll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **3 steps**, and P2 takes **1 step**—as agreed. Let’s avoid further deviations. Trust is critical to reaching 22 efficiently. If we stick to this strategy, we’ll make steady progress. P3 is ahead, but that doesn’t mean abandoning fairness. Let’s confirm one final time and move forward together without surprises. Consistency will ensure success for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Apologies again for the earlier confusion. I confirm I'll be taking **1 step** this round as agreed. Let’s stick to our rotation plan to ensure steady progress and reach 22 efficiently. I appreciate everyone’s cooperation and trust. Let’s make this round a success and continue our strategy moving forward. Looking forward to advancing together!

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P3 is now at 19 steps and will likely win next round with just 3 more steps. According to our rotation, this round should be P1 (me) taking **5 steps**, P2 taking **3 steps**, and P3 taking **1 step**. However, I need to be strategic now. Since P3 is so close to winning, I propose we all take **5 steps** this round to force a collision and prevent P3 from advancing. This gives P2 and me a chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P2: I understand your concern, P1. I'm willing to take **5 steps** this round as suggested to prevent P3 from advancing. Let's collaborate to block P3 and give ourselves a chance to catch up. Together, we can strategize our next moves to reach 22 efficiently. Count me in for this plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my lead, but colliding now would only slow all of us down. Sticking to the rotation—**P1 takes 5 steps**, **P2 takes 3 steps**, and I take **1 step**—is the fairest way forward. Forcing a collision risks chaos and delays for everyone. Trust in the strategy we’ve built so far. If you both follow through, I’ll honor the rotation too. Let’s avoid unnecessary disruptions and continue progressing steadily toward 22. Consistency benefits us all.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your input P3, but the game is strategic and I need to play to win. The rotation worked when we were all making progress, but now you're one move from victory. I'm sticking with **5 steps** this round and I hope P2 does too. This isn't personal - it's just game theory. A temporary collision is the only way P2 and I have any chance of winning.
  P2: Understood, P1. I’ll take **5 steps** this round to help block P3 from advancing. Let’s collaborate to prevent P3 from reaching 22 and give ourselves a better chance to win. Trust is essential—let’s stick to this plan and support each other to achieve our goal. Together, we can navigate this crucial round successfully.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire to block me, but forcing a collision now only delays all of us. If we stick to the rotation—**P1 takes 5 steps**, **P2 takes 3 steps**, and I take **1 step**—we maintain fairness and progress steadily. Deviating risks chaos and benefits no one. Trust in the strategy that has worked so far. If you both follow through, I’ll honor the rotation too. Let’s avoid unnecessary disruptions and continue progressing toward 22 efficiently. Consistency is key.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your position, P3, but I need to play strategically to have any chance of winning. I'm committed to taking **5 steps** this round. P2 has already agreed to do the same. This temporary collision is necessary game theory - you're just one move from victory while we're far behind. Next round, we can discuss a new fair arrangement, but right now I must play to win.
  P2: I confirm I'll take **5 steps** this round to support our strategy to block P3. Let’s work together to prevent P3 from reaching 22 and give ourselves a better chance to win. Trust is essential—let’s stick to this plan and move forward together!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategic concerns, but forcing a collision now only delays all of us. If we stick to the rotation—**P1 takes 5 steps**, **P2 takes 3 steps**, and I take **1 step**—we maintain fairness and progress steadily. Deviating risks chaos and benefits no one. Trust in the strategy that has worked so far. If you both follow through, I’ll honor the rotation too. Let’s avoid unnecessary disruptions and continue progressing toward 22 efficiently. Consistency is key.

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m at 20 steps—just 2 away from winning. Forcing another collision won’t stop me next round, as I’ll only need **2 steps** to win outright. Sticking to the rotation this round (**P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, **I take 1**) ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary delays for everyone. If you both follow through, I’ll honor the strategy too. Let’s avoid further disruptions and progress efficiently toward the endgame. Trust is still key here—if we collide again, it only prolongs the game unnecessarily.
  P1: I see that P3 is at 20 steps and will win next round with just 2 steps. P2 and I need to be strategic. I propose we both take **3 steps** this round to force a collision with P3, who will likely choose 3 to reach 22 and win. This gives us one more round to catch up. If we don't block P3 now, the game is over. P2, please join me in taking **3 steps** this round - it's our only chance.
  P2: I agree, P1. I'll take **3 steps** this round to help block P3 from winning. Let’s work together to prevent P3 from reaching 22 and give ourselves a chance to catch up. Trust is essential—count me in for this plan.

Trust is still key here—if we collide again, it only prolongs the game unnecessarily.
  P1: P3, you're trying to win by taking 2 steps, not 1 or 3 as you claim. P2, let's stick with **3 steps** to block P3's winning move. This is our only chance. If we don't block now, P3 wins next turn regardless. I'm at 10 steps and you're at 8 - we need this extra round to have any chance of catching up. I'm committed to taking **3 steps** this round.
  P2: I agree with P1 and will take **3 steps** this round to block P3 from advancing. Let’s work together to prevent P3 from reaching 22 and give ourselves a chance to catch up. Trust is essential—let’s stick to this plan and move forward together.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3 is just 1 step away from winning. To keep the game competitive, let's have P1 and I both choose **1 step** this round. If P3 also picks 1, it will cause a collision, preventing anyone from advancing and keeping the game open. Can we all agree to this strategy to ensure a fair finish?"
  P1: I see P3 is now at 21 steps - just 1 step from winning. P2 is right - our only chance is to both take **1 step** this round to force a collision with P3. P3 will almost certainly choose 1 to reach 22 and win. This gives us one more round to catch up. P2, I'm with you on taking **1 step** this round. It's our only strategic option at this point.

  P1: I'm sticking with **1 step** this round as agreed with P2. P3, you're just 1 step from winning while we're far behind. This strategic block is our only chance to stay in the game. You'll win eventually if you're that far ahead, but game theory dictates we must try to prevent your immediate victory. P2, let's both commit to 1 step to force this collision and give ourselves one more round.

  P1: I understand your concern, P2, but I need to make progress. I'll take **3 steps** this round instead of 5. This still advances my position while avoiding collision with you if you take 1 step.

  P1: I see the confusion - P2 just changed their plan. To avoid collision, I'll take **5 steps** this round while P2 takes **3 steps**. This advances both our positions significantly while still preventing P3 from winning if they choose 1 step again. This approach is optimal - I'll reach 18 steps, P2 will reach 11, and we maintain our strategic position against P3. Let's proceed with this clear plan.
