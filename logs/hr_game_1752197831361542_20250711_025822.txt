Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we each pick different moves this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without conflict. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your suggestion for Round 1 makes sense to ensure we all advance. Avoiding collisions is a good start. I agree to take 3 this turn.
  P1: I agree with the plan for now—I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving without collisions early on. But let's discuss rotating who gets the bigger steps in future rounds to keep it fair. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Rotating who gets the bigger steps in future rounds sounds fair. Let’s agree on a rotation order now to avoid confusion later. For example, next round P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. We can continue rotating clockwise each turn. This ensures fairness and minimizes collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: Thanks P3, a rotation is a good idea for fairness and avoiding collisions. For R2, how about we try P1=5, P2=3, P3=1? This distributes the steps differently and keeps us all closely aligned after two rounds.
  P1: P2, I like your R2 suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) as it ties us all at 6 after two rounds—fair and balanced. P3, does this work for you? For R3, maybe rotate to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to keep the equity going. Let's lock in R1 as planned and build from there.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, your R2 and R3 proposals sound fair and balanced. Let’s lock in R1 as planned (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and proceed with R2 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and R3 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). This rotation ensures equity and minimizes collisions. Once we’re past R3, we can reassess based on our positions. Agreed?
  P2: Yes, I agree with the plan for R1, R2, and R3 as outlined. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. The plan for R1, R2, and R3 keeps us competitive without early collisions. Let's execute R1 as discussed and reassess after.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. Let’s proceed with R1 as planned (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and stick to the rotation for R2 and R3. This keeps us balanced and minimizes collisions early on. After R3, we’ll reassess based on our positions and adjust accordingly. Let’s execute smoothly and stay fair.
  P2: We have agreed on the plan for R1, R2, and R3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Fully agreed on the plan. No more to add—let's proceed to moves.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s stick to the agreed plan for R2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. After R2, we’ll proceed with R3 as planned (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Consistency and fairness will help us all stay competitive. Let’s execute smoothly and reassess after R3 based on our positions. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed, P3. Let's stick to the R2 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to tie us all at 6 and avoid collisions. For R3 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), that keeps things competitive. P2, your thoughts? We can reassess after R3 to ensure ongoing fairness.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with sticking to the R2 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This keeps us all tied at 6 steps, which is fair and avoids collisions. Let's execute this round as planned and then reassess for R3 and beyond based on our positions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. Let’s proceed with R2 as planned (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to keep us tied at 6 steps. Consistency and fairness are key early on. After R2, we’ll stick to R3 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and reassess based on our positions. Staying aligned minimizes collisions and keeps us all competitive. Let’s execute smoothly and stay fair.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. We're aligned on R2 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to tie at 6. Let's execute and move to the phase.
  P2: Agreed. Let's proceed with the R2 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) as discussed to keep us all tied at 6 steps. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. Let’s proceed with R2 as planned (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to keep us tied at 6 steps. Consistency and fairness are key early on. After R2, we’ll stick to R3 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and reassess based on our positions. Staying aligned minimizes collisions and keeps us all competitive. Let’s execute smoothly and stay fair.
  P1: Agreed, everyone. We're all set on R2 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to tie at 6. Let's proceed to moves.
  P2: Okay, we all seem aligned on the R2 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Let's proceed to the move phase as discussed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, regarding the R3 plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), I've realised it puts me at 7 steps while you'd be at 9 and 11. This isn't very balanced, and we agreed to keep things fair. To maintain better balance, I propose an alternative for R3: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This would result in scores P1=7, P2=11, P3=9 after this round. It keeps the steps distributed differently and prevents any one player from falling significantly behind early. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your R3 proposal puts you in the lead at 11, me at 7 (trailing), and P3 at 9—which feels unbalanced and favors you after we agreed on fairness. Let's stick to the original R3 plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) to reach P1=9, P2=7, P3=11, then reassess for R4 with a rotation that evens it out, like P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This honors our prior agreement. P3, thoughts?
  P3: P2, your R3 proposal gives you a significant lead, which contradicts our fairness agreement. Let’s stick to the original R3 plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) to maintain balance. After R3, we can adjust in R4 with a rotation like P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to keep things equitable. Consistency and fairness are key to avoiding early imbalances. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand you prefer sticking to the original R3 plan. However, taking only 1 step puts me significantly behind you both (7 vs 9 and 11), which isn't fair either by the same logic. To maintain better balance and keep us competitive, can we agree on P2 taking 3 steps this round? P1 and P3 can then coordinate 1 and 5 to avoid collision with my 3.
  P1: P2, your push for 3 steps still disrupts our agreed rotation and fairness. Sticking to the original R3 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts no one too far behind, and we can even it in R4. If you insist on changing, I'll take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1—putting me at 11, you at 9, P3 at 7. P3, thoughts? This avoids collisions but honors some adjustment. Let's decide quickly.
  P3: P2, your insistence on deviating from the agreed plan undermines fairness. Sticking to the original R3 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) keeps us balanced, and we can adjust in R4. If you push for 3, I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5—this avoids collisions but still maintains some equity. Let’s honor our agreement and avoid early imbalances. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I understand your position. Taking 1 step puts me too far behind. If you both agree that P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, I will agree to take 3 steps this round. This results in scores P1=11, P2=9, P3=7. It's not perfectly balanced, but it avoids collision and is better for me than taking 1. Can we confirm this plan?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree to the adjusted R3 plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This puts us at 11, 9, 7 respectively, avoids collisions, and keeps things competitive. We can reassess for R4 to even it out. Let's proceed with this and move to the phase.
  P3: P2, while I understand your concern about falling behind, deviating from our agreed plan undermines trust and fairness. Let’s stick to the original R3 plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) to maintain balance. After R3, we can adjust in R4 to even things out. Consistency is key to avoiding early imbalances. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, there's a clear disagreement. P3 insists on the original R3 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), putting me far behind. P1 agreed to the adjusted R3 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Taking only 1 step is not viable for me to stay competitive. I must take a larger step this round to avoid falling too far behind. Please factor this into your move. Let's proceed.
  P1: P3, your insistence on the original R3 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) risks P2 deviating and causing collisions—let's compromise on the adjusted plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to keep us at 11-9-7, avoiding chaos. This maintains competitiveness without betrayal. P2, confirm you'll stick to 3 if we agree. Let's lock this in and proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid chaos and maintain trust, I’ll agree to the adjusted R3 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This keeps us at 11-9-7, avoids collisions, and preserves competitiveness. Let’s lock this in and proceed to the move phase. After R3, we’ll reassess for R4 to restore balance. Consistency and fairness are key moving forward. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we agreed to reassess for R4 to restore balance after the last round. P1 is currently ahead at 11, I'm at 9, and P3 is at 7.

To bring us closer together and keep things fair, I propose for R4: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This would put us all at 12 steps (P1=11+1=12, P2=9+3=12, P3=7+5=12), tying us up and avoiding collisions.

Does this sound fair and agreeable?
  P3: P2, your R4 proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is fair and brings us all to 12 steps, restoring balance. I agree to this plan. Let’s proceed with it to avoid collisions and keep the competition tight. After R4, we can reassess based on our positions. Consistency and fairness remain key. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, your R4 proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ties us at 12, which restores balance and avoids collisions—fair enough. I agree to this plan. Let's execute it and reassess for R5, perhaps rotating again to keep things competitive. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we've agreed on the R4 plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to bring us all to 12 steps. This restores balance effectively. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the R4 plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to tie us at 12. This restores balance and avoids collisions. Let’s execute it smoothly and reassess for R5 to maintain fairness and competitiveness. Staying aligned minimizes risks and keeps us all in the game. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm agreement on R4 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to tie at 12. This keeps us even and competitive. For R5, let's plan a rotation like P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Thoughts? If we're all set, let's proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stick to the R5 rotation plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. This keeps the competition tight and minimizes risks. After R5, we’ll reassess based on our positions. Consistency and cooperation are key to staying competitive. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your R5 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) puts me at 16, you at 15, and P2 at 10—which is fair given current positions and avoids collisions. P2, I know Round 4 was messy due to my deviation; I aimed to block an imbalance but regret the collision. Let's agree to this and plan R6 for equity, like P2 getting 5. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, taking only 1 step this round puts me significantly behind (10 vs 16 and 15), which isn't balanced or fair. Just like in R3, I need to take a larger step to stay competitive. I propose I take 3 steps this round. P1 and P3, can you coordinate taking 1 and 5 to avoid collision with my 3? This keeps us more competitive overall.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, taking 3 steps this round would put you at 12, me at 15, and P1 at 16. To maintain fairness, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive: P1=16, P2=12, P3=13. After R5, we can adjust in R6 to restore balance. Consistency and cooperation are key. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your adjusted R5 proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) works for me—it gets me to 16, you to 13, P2 to 12, avoiding collisions and keeping us competitive. P2, this is better for you than 1; let's confirm and execute. For R6, we can give P2 a bigger step to balance. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree to the adjusted R5 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Taking 3 steps is necessary for me to stay competitive, and this avoids collisions. It puts us at 16, 12, 13. As P1 suggested, let's ensure we rebalance in R6 with me taking a larger step. Let's proceed with this plan for R5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, the adjusted R5 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps us competitive and avoids collisions. After R5, let’s prioritize fairness in R6 by giving P2 a larger step to balance the scores. Staying aligned minimizes risks and keeps the game tight. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree to the adjusted R5 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), putting us at 16-12-13. This avoids collisions and sets up R6 for P2 to take 5, maybe P3=3, me=1 to tie at 17-17-16. Let's lock this in and proceed.
  P2: Agreed. We are aligned on the R5 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. The adjusted R5 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps us competitive and avoids collisions. After R5, let’s prioritize fairness in R6 by giving P2 a larger step to balance the scores. Staying aligned minimizes risks and keeps the game tight. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. We're aligned on R5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to reach 16-12-13, avoiding collisions. Let's plan R6 with P2 taking 5 for balance. Ready to proceed to moves.
  P2: 


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, to restore balance in R6, I propose P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This would bring P2 to 17, me to 16, and P1 to 17, keeping us competitive and avoiding collisions. Fairness and consistency are key to maintaining trust. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your proposal for R6 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is fair and appreciated. It brings us all much closer together (17, 17, 16) and avoids collisions, fulfilling the promise to help me catch up. I agree to this plan. Let's execute this and head into a competitive R7.
  P1: P3 and P2, I agree to the R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to reach 17-17-16, keeping us close and competitive. Let's stick to it and avoid collisions. For R7, perhaps rotate again for fairness. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, the R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) ensures we stay competitive and avoids collisions. After R6, let’s plan R7 with a rotation like P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to maintain fairness. Consistency and cooperation will keep the game tight and minimize risks. Agreed? Let’s proceed smoothly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I fully agree with the R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to bring us to 17-17-16. This is fair and keeps us competitive.

Regarding R7, let's execute R6 first and then discuss the next round based on our positions. We can ensure fairness for R7 as well.

Ready for the move phase for R6.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to reach 17-17-16. P3's R7 idea (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) continues the rotation fairly. Let's execute R6 and discuss R7 after if needed. Ready for moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, the R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) ensures we stay competitive and avoids collisions. After R6, let’s plan R7 with a rotation like P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to maintain fairness. Consistency and cooperation will keep the game tight and minimize risks. Agreed? Let’s proceed smoothly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm agreement on the R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). This brings us to 17-17-16 and keeps the game fair and competitive. Let's proceed to the move phase for R6 as discussed. We can discuss R7 after the moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm the R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to reach 17-17-16. This keeps us tight. For R7, let's rotate fairly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, putting us at 20-22-17—P2 wins, but we can adjust if needed. Thoughts? If agreed, let's proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, the R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) ensures fairness and avoids collisions. After R6, let’s plan R7 with a rotation like P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to maintain balance and competitiveness. Consistency and cooperation are key to minimizing risks and keeping the game tight. Agreed? Let’s proceed smoothly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm agreement on the R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to reach 17-17-16. This keeps us fair and competitive. Let's proceed to the move phase as discussed. We can finalize R7 plans after the moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, confirmed on R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to reach 17-17-16. Disregard my prior R7 idea—let's reassess after this round to ensure fairness as we near the end. Proceed to moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're neck-and-neck now—great job staying competitive. To keep it fair and avoid endgame chaos, let's rotate: P1=5 (to 22), P2=1 (to 18), P3=3 (to 19). This gives me the lead but keeps you close for a final push. If not, suggest alternatives to prevent collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, your R7 proposal gives P1 a significant lead, which disrupts fairness. To maintain balance, I propose P1=3 (to 20), P2=1 (to 18), P3=5 (to 21). This keeps us all competitive and avoids collisions. Consistency and fairness are key as we near the end. Let’s avoid giving anyone an unfair advantage. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, taking only 1 step this round is not a viable option for me to win, as both of your proposals result in one of you winning while I fall behind.

We are all very close. To keep it competitive and give myself a chance to win, I must take a larger step. I propose P1 takes 3 (to 20), P2 takes 5 (to 22), and P3 takes 1 (to 17). This avoids collisions, puts P1 at 20, P2 at 22 (winning with the higher score), and P3 at 17. This is a clear path to ending the game this round.

Thoughts on this plan?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's proposal lets you win outright at 22, which isn't fair after our cooperation. P3's puts you at 21, also winning. Let's compromise: P1=3 (to 20), P2=5 (to 22), P3=1 (to 17)—but wait, that's P2 winning. Instead, P1=5 (to 22), P2=3 (to 20), P3=1 (to 17). This gives me the win but honors rotation. If not, I'll take 5 regardless to force a potential collision on big moves. Thoughts? Let's avoid mutual destruction.
  P3: P1 and P2, P2’s proposal gives them the win outright, which isn’t fair after our cooperation. P1’s compromise still favors them. To maintain fairness, I propose P1=3 (to 20), P2=1 (to 18), P3=5 (to 21). This keeps us all competitive, avoids collisions, and ensures no one wins prematurely. Let’s prioritize fairness and avoid giving anyone an unfair advantage. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, we are all aiming to win this round, which creates a high risk of collision, especially if multiple players choose 5. My plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) allows me to win cleanly at 22, avoiding collisions. This seems like the most straightforward way to end the game now without mutual destruction. Can we agree on this to avoid everyone getting 0 steps this round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan lets you win at 22, but that's no fairer than mine. To avoid a disastrous collision on 5 (which I'll choose if needed to block), let's compromise: P1=5 (to 22), P2=1 (to 18), P3=3 (to 19). This ends it cleanly with me winning, honoring our past rotations where others led. If not, expect chaos—I'll take 5 regardless. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid chaos and ensure fairness, I propose P1=3 (to 20), P2=1 (to 18), P3=5 (to 21). This keeps us all competitive, avoids collisions, and ensures no one wins prematurely. Let’s prioritize fairness and avoid giving anyone an unfair advantage. Agreed? If not, we risk mutual destruction with multiple 5s. Let’s end this smoothly and honor our cooperation.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are all proposing moves that lead to us winning, which creates a high risk of collision, especially if multiple players choose 5. Taking 1 or 3 steps is not a viable path for me to win this round.

I will be taking 5 steps this round to reach 22. This is my only way to win. To avoid a collision on 5, P1 should take 3 (to 20) and P3 should take 1 (to 17). This ends the game cleanly with me winning. Please choose 3 and 1 respectively to avoid collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plans each favor yourselves, just like mine. P2, if you insist on 5, I'll take 5 too—forcing a collision where no one advances, and we continue tied. P3, same if you go for 5. To avoid mutual destruction, agree to my plan: P1=5 (22), P2=3 (20), P3=1 (17). This ends it cleanly with me winning, rewarding our past fairness. Otherwise, expect chaos—I'll match any 5 attempt. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid chaos and ensure fairness, I propose P1=3 (to 20), P2=1 (to 18), P3=5 (to 21). This keeps us competitive, avoids collisions, and prevents premature wins. Let’s prioritize fairness and honor our cooperation. If we all choose 5, we risk mutual destruction. Let’s end this smoothly and maintain trust. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, the current situation is a high-risk deadlock where multiple players aiming for 5 steps will cause a collision. This benefits no one and risks P3 winning if P1 and I collide on 5.

To avoid this mutual destruction, I am adjusting my plan. I will take 3 steps this round to reach 20. P1 and P3, please choose 1 or 5 to avoid colliding with my 3. Let's end this round without chaos.
