Given the current stalemate, let's reconsider a balanced approach:\n\nProposal for Round 8:\nP1 = 3 (reaches 20)\nP2 = 5 (reaches 20)\nP3 = 1 (reaches 20)\n\nThis maintains a three-way tie at 20 steps, ensuring a shared victory. If everyone agrees, we can proceed to the move phase. Let's confirm one last time to avoid any misunderstandings. Thoughts?"}

If we both play 5, we collide (17, 15) and P3 wins solo by playing 1 (or 3 or 5). You said you wanted to avoid handing someone a win. Playing 5 guarantees either you lose or you win solo (which contradicts your claim of keeping the game open).\n\nThe only logical plan that avoids collisions and prevents a solo win is the three-way tie: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. We all reach 20 and share the win. This is the fairest outcome.\n\nI am sticking with <move>5</move>. P3, please stick with <move>1</move>. P1, please stick with <move>3</move> for the shared win.
