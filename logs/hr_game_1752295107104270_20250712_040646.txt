Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 1. Let's try to avoid collisions right away so everyone can make progress.

How about we split the moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5? This way, we all advance.

What do you think?
  P1: That sounds fair for a starting round, P3. I'm in for taking 1 as suggested. P2, you good with 3?
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 3 as planned. Let's avoid collisions and progress smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, sounds like we have a plan for this turn. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's all get on the board. Ready for the move phase when everyone is.
  P1: Agreed, plan sounds solid. No objections here. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Confirming the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. No collisions, everyone progresses. Let’s lock this in. Ready when you are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 2. That worked well last time, everyone advanced.

How about we try that again? P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. It keeps us all moving forward.

What do you guys think?
  P1: P3, repeating the same moves will let you pull way ahead— you'd be at 10 while I'm at 2 and P2 at 6. That's not balanced. Let's rotate for fairness: This round, I (P1) take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. That evens us out more. P2, thoughts?
  P2: P2: Sounds reasonable, P1. Rotating moves to balance progression is fair. I'll take 1 this round as proposed. Let's keep the pace tight and avoid letting anyone pull too far ahead. Confirming the new plan: you take 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. Ready when you are.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I see the logic in rotating to balance things out, although P1 gaining 5 steps does close the gap significantly from my perspective.

However, avoiding a collision is the priority right now. I can agree to the proposed plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) will take 3.

Let's make sure everyone advances this turn. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Agreed, P3. Glad we're all on the same page with the rotation: I (P1) take 5, P2 takes 1, you take 3. This keeps things competitive without collisions. No more to add—ready for moves.
  P2: P2: Confirming: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. This rotation keeps us balanced and collision-free. No last-minute changes? Let’s lock in and move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 3. We've rotated twice to stay balanced—great job avoiding collisions. To keep it fair, let's continue the cycle: I (P1) take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. That ties us all at 9 steps. Thoughts? This prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead early.
  P3: Okay P1, I see your proposal for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, which would indeed tie us all at 9 steps.

While I'd prefer to maintain my lead, avoiding collisions is crucial for everyone's progress. Let's stick to the rotation for now.

I agree to take 1 this round as proposed. Let's make sure everyone advances. Ready for moves.
  P2: P2: Confirming the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. This balances our positions and ensures we all advance. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. Ready when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, plan confirmed: I (P1) take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This ties us at 9 and keeps things fair. No changes needed—let's advance without collisions. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all in agreement for this round. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I will take 1.

Let's stick to the plan and ensure everyone makes progress this turn. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: "Reiterating: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. All advance to 9. Final confirmation—no last-minute shifts? Locking in now. "


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Plan confirmed—no changes. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all aligned on the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and ready to move. Let's proceed to the move phase and ensure we all advance this turn.
  P2: P2: "Sticking to the plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. We all hit 9, keeping the race balanced. No surprises here—ready to move. "


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 4—all tied at 9, nice work keeping it fair. To continue balancing without collisions, let's rotate again: I (P1) take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This puts us at P1=14, P2=12, P3=10—still close and competitive. Thoughts? Let's avoid stalling and keep progressing.
  P2: Agreed, P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This rotation keeps us competitive and collision-free. Let’s lock in and proceed.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. I see the proposed rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1.

Getting only 1 step again isn't great for my position relative to the others, but avoiding collisions is the priority right now.

I agree to this plan for the round to ensure we all advance. Let's stick to it. Ready for moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for agreeing, P3. This rotation ensures we all advance and keeps the game close—no one left behind yet. Confirming: I (P1) take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1. Let's lock it in and proceed to moves.
  P2: P2: "Confirming: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let’s execute the plan as agreed. No changes from my end."
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I will take 1.

Let's stick to the agreement and ensure we all advance this turn without collisions. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Plan confirmed: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let's advance without issues. Ready for moves.
  P2: P2: "Confirming: I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's ensure we all advance this turn. Ready to proceed."
  P3: Okay, we seem to have a clear plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1.

This will put us at P1=14, P2=12, P3=10. It's not ideal for my position, but I'll stick to the agreement to avoid collisions.

Let's proceed with this plan in the move phase. Ready when everyone is.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed, P3. Appreciate you sticking with the rotation despite the position shift—it keeps the game fair and moving. Plan locked: I take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1. Ready for moves.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation—P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No last-minute shifts. Let’s execute cleanly and keep this balanced.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems ready and the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 5. Last round's collision didn't help P1 or me. P2 is ahead at 12 (P1/P3 at 9). We need to advance without collisions.

How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This gets us all moving and helps me close the gap on P2.

Let's get back on track.
  P2: P2: "Confirming the plan: I'll take 3 as proposed. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let's execute as agreed and avoid repeating last round's collision. Ready when you are."
  P1: P3, your proposal puts me further behind at 10 while you hit 14 and P2 15—not fair after you broke the rotation last round, causing our collision. Let's balance: I (P1) take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This gets me to 14, P2 to 13, you to 12—all close, no one dominating. P2, thoughts? We need to avoid more betrayals to progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, last round was unfortunate for both of us. My proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) helps me recover and catch P2, who is currently in the lead at 12 steps. P2 has already agreed to this plan.

Your proposal puts me in last place again, which isn't ideal for me after losing steps last round. Let's stick to the plan P2 and I discussed to ensure we all advance and I can close the gap on the leader.
  P2: P2: "P1, I understand your frustration. Let’s stick with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round to advance cleanly. I’ll take 3 as agreed, keeping us competitive. To address fairness, I’ll rotate to a smaller step next round if we’re still close. Let’s prioritize progress over grudges—collisions hurt everyone. Ready to move when you are."
  P1: P2, your promise of future rotation means nothing after P3's betrayal last round—trust is broken. Sticking to their plan leaves me at 10 while you hit 15 and P3 14; that's not competitive. Let's go with my proposal: I take 5 (to 14), you take 1 (to 13), P3 takes 3 (to 12). This evens us out without favoring the betrayer. P3, agree or risk another collision that stalls us all. What's it gonna be?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, I understand your frustration about the last round and the current positions. Avoiding another collision is definitely the priority.

While P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 isn't ideal for my position, I agree to this plan for this round to ensure we all advance and avoid stalling again.

Let's stick to this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I will take 3. Let's confirm this and move forward without collisions. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P2: "Confirming: I'll take 1 as agreed. Let’s execute cleanly—no last-minute shifts. Collisions only help P2 pull further ahead, and nobody wants that. Lock in your moves and let’s make progress."
  P1: Agreed, plan locked: I (P1) take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 13), P3 takes 3 (to 12). This evens us out after last round's mess. Let's execute without deviations—no more betrayals, or we all stall. Ready for moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, sounds like the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I will take 3.

Let's proceed to the move phase and ensure we all advance without collisions this round. Ready when everyone is.
  P2: P2: "Confirming: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s lock it in. No surprises this time. Ready for the move phase."
  P1: Plan confirmed: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This gets us to 14-13-12, keeping it tight. No deviations—let's advance without collisions. Ready for moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Proposing P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This gets me to 18, and I can clinch the win next round with a 3. P1 stays even with P3 at 15, keeping the balance. Let’s execute cleanly—no collisions, no surprises. Ready to move when you are."
  P3: Okay P2, I see your proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). That puts you at 18 steps, giving you a strong lead and likely win next turn. That's not ideal for P1 or me.

How about a different plan to keep the game competitive and allow me to catch up slightly? Let's try P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5.

This would put us at P1=15, P2=16, P3=17. We all advance, I get closer to the lead, and the race stays tight. What do you both think? Let's avoid another collision.
  P1: P2 and P3, both your plans leave me stuck at 15 while you surge ahead—not fair, especially with me currently leading at 14. Let's balance: I (P1) take 5 (to 19), P2 takes 1 (to 14), P3 takes 3 (to 15). This keeps us close and competitive without collisions. Agree to advance, or risk stalling us all again?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "P1, if you take 5, I’ll have to take 5 too—collision risks stall us all. Take 1 this round, and I’ll let you take 5 next turn. P3, take 3 to keep progress. Final offer—agree or lose momentum."
  P3: Okay P2, I agree we must prevent P1 from winning this turn by taking 5. A collision would stall P1 and P2, allowing me to advance, but it's better if we all move.

P2, your proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts you in a strong winning position next turn. My proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is a fairer way to avoid collision if P1 takes 1. It puts us at P1=20, P2=16, P3=17.

Let's agree P1 takes 1 to avoid collision. Then, P2 takes 3 and I take 5. This is the best path forward without anyone winning immediately or getting too far ahead.
  P1: P3 and P2, your plans both sideline me at 15 while you leap ahead—not happening. I'll take 5 to 19 unless we agree on P1=5, P2=3 (to 16), P3=1 (to 13). This keeps it competitive without me dominating yet. P2, colliding on 5 stalls you too, letting P3 surge. Agree to my plan for clean progress, or risk mutual stall. What's it gonna be?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "P1, if you take 5, I’ll match with 5—collide and stall us both. P3 takes 5 by default and wins Round 7. You want that? Or we do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Your move."
  P3: P1 and P2, you are both threatening to take 5. If you both pick 5, you'll collide and gain nothing, remaining at 14 and 13 respectively.

This collision would allow me to take 5 and reach 17 steps, putting me in the lead while you both stall.

To prevent me from advancing past you while you collide, let's agree on my earlier proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This avoids collision and keeps everyone moving, preventing me from gaining the lead solely due to your conflict. Let's agree and move.
  P1: P2 and P3, colliding on 5 hurts us both and hands P3 the lead—stupid move, P2. Let's compromise: I take 3 (to 17), you take 5 (to 18), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This puts you in front but keeps me close for a fair race, no collisions. Agree, or I'll force the collision and let P3 surge ahead. What's your call?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'll take 5 this round. P1 takes 3 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This puts me at 18—just 3 steps from victory. P1, you stay ahead of P3, P3—no free passes this time. Lock in your moves, no surprises. Let’s finish this."
  P3: Okay, I see the proposed moves for this round. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan hands P2 the win next turn—not acceptable. Let's do P1=5 (to 19), P2=3 (to 16), P3=1 (to 13) instead. This keeps me from winning immediately but positions us competitively without collisions. Agree now, or I'll take 5 anyway and force a potential stall. Confirm and let's move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5 this round. P1, if you take 3, you still reach 20 and stay ahead. P3, take 1. If P1 takes 5, we collide and stall—no win for you. Your choice: advance safely at 3 or risk stalling. Decide wisely."
  P3: Okay P2, you say you are taking 5. P1 is at 17. If P1 also takes 5, you both collide and stall (P1=17, P2=13). This allows me to take 5 and reach 17, tying P1 and passing P2. If you two collide on 5, I will take 5.

P2's proposed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts P1 at 20, P2 at 18, me at 13. That leaves me far behind while P1 is set to win next turn. A collision between P1 and P2 on 5 benefits me the most. Think carefully.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm taking 5 to 22 and winning this turn. Your threats to block will just cause collisions—P3, picking 5 with P2 stalls you both, not me if I adjust. Better agree to P1=5 (to 22), P2=1 (to 14), P3=3 (to 15) for your final advances. Otherwise, I'll force the stall on 5. Confirm or lose.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. P1, if you take 3, you reach 20 and stay in contention. If you take 5, we collide and P3 advances to 17. P3, taking 5 lets you leapfrog P2 but leaves you still trailing. P1, don’t throw this round—take 3 and keep it competitive. Locking in my move as 5. Your move, P1."
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, you are both threatening to take 5. If you both pick 5, you will collide and gain nothing, remaining at 17 and 13 respectively.

As I stated before, if you two collide on 5, I will take 5 and reach 17 steps. This ties me with P1 and puts me ahead of P2.

A collision on 5 is the best outcome for me. If you want to prevent me from advancing past you both while you stall, you need to avoid colliding on 5. Otherwise, I will take 5 and benefit from your conflict.
  P1: P3, your threat to take 5 if P2 and I collide is flawed—if we both take 5 and you join, all three collide and stall at current positions. Empty bluff. P2, colliding hurts you more, stuck at 13 while P3 could take 3 to 15. Let's agree: I take 5 to 22 (win), you take 1 to 14, P3 takes 3 to 15. You both get final points; otherwise, I'll take 5 and force the risk. Confirm to advance cleanly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "P1, I'm taking 5. If you take 5, we collide—P3 advances to 17. If P3 also takes 5, *all three* collide, and no one wins. P3, you want that? Or we do my plan: P1 takes 3 (to 20), I take 5 (to 18), you take 1 (to 13). P1 wins next round, I don’t block you. Decide—take 3 now, or risk chaos."
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I need to clarify my previous statement.

If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 5, you will both collide and gain no steps (P1 stays at 17, P2 at 13). If this happens, I will take 3 steps to advance to 15. This puts me ahead of P2 and closer to P1, benefiting from your collision.

To prevent me from gaining on you both this way, P1 and P2 must avoid taking 5 simultaneously. Consider your moves carefully.
  P1: P2, blocking me on 5 lets P3 surge to 15 while you stall at 13—bad for you. Let me take 5 to 22 and end this cleanly; you and P3 advance with 3 and 1 respectively. Otherwise, I'll take 3 to 20, forcing you to decide between colliding uselessly or letting P3 catch up. P3, agree to take 1 for your progress. Confirm to avoid chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. P1, take 3 to reach 20 and keep your win path open. Take 5 and we collide, letting P3 creep closer. Your move. Locking in 5 now—decide wisely."
  P3: P2 is taking 5. P1, if you also take 5, you collide and stall at 17, while P2 stalls at 13. If you collide, I will take 3 to reach 15, passing P2 and closing on you.

To avoid this, P1 take 3 (to 20), P2 takes 5 (to 18), and I will take 5 (to 17). This puts P1 at 20, P2 at 18, P3 at 17. No collision, P1 is set to win next turn, and I gain ground. This is better for P1 than stalling at 17 while I pass P2.

Let's agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=5 to ensure progress.
  P1: P3, your proposal has you and P2 both on 5—colliding yourselves while I take 3 to 20 or 5 to 22. Dumb move that hands me the win. P2, drop the block; let me take 5 to end this (you take 3 to 16, P3 takes 1 to 13). Otherwise, I'll take 3 to 20, and your collision with P3 stalls you both. Agree now for clean advances, or chaos ensues.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 18—don't get greedy. Let me take 5 to 22 and win cleanly; you take 1 to 19, P3 takes 3 to 15. You both advance, game ends. If you try for 3 or 5, I'll match it and collide, stalling you while P3 surges with the other. P3, agree to take 3 for your gain, or risk stalling us all. Confirm this fair end, or chaos continues.
  P2: P2: "P1, I'm taking 3 this round. If you take 5, I still win by reaching 21. If you take 3, we collide and stall. P3, take 5 to advance. Final chance—block me or let me end this. Decide wisely."
  P3: P2 is taking 3 and wants P1 to take 3. If P1 takes 3, you both collide (P1=17, P2=18). If you collide, I will take 5 to reach 17 steps. This is my best outcome.

P1, take 3 to collide with P2. I will take 5 and catch up.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2's wrong—if I take 5 to 22 and they take 3 to 21 uncollided, I win with higher score per rules. Don't take 5 to block me; that stalls us both and hands P2 the win at 21. Instead, take 3 to 15, let me beat P2 fairly. If you stall us, game drags on, but I'll block P2 next. Agree to end it my way?
  P2: P2: I'm taking 5 to win this round. If you (P1) take 5, we collide and stall—next round I still win with 3 while you’re stuck. Take 3 to reach 20, let me end it cleanly. P3, take 1 for your last step. Final offer: cooperate or face Round 9 with me at 18 needing 3 to win. Lock in your moves.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, you are both threatening to take 5 steps this round.

As I said before, if you both pick 5, you will collide and gain no steps (P1 stays at 17, P2 at 18).

If you two collide on 5, I will take 3 steps to advance to 15. This puts me ahead of P2 and closer to P1, benefiting from your conflict.

To prevent me from gaining on you both this way, you must avoid taking 5 simultaneously. Consider your moves carefully.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, switching to 5 means if I match, we collide and stall—you at 18, me at 17—while P3 takes 3 to 15, closing in. Dumb play handing P3 ground. Let me take 5 to 22 (win), you take 1 to 19, P3 takes 3 to 15 for your final steps. P3, agree—this ends it fairly without you stalling us. Otherwise, I'll collide on 5 with P2, and you surge. Confirm now.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5 to block your path, P1. If you take 5, we collide and stall—no win for you. Next round, I clinch with 3 steps. P3, take 1 to close your gap. Let’s end this properly."
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, you are both threatening to take 5 steps. If you both pick 5, you will collide and gain nothing (P1 stays at 17, P2 at 18).

As I stated before, if you two collide on 5, I will take 3 steps to advance to 15. This puts me ahead of P2 and closer to P1, benefiting from your conflict.

To prevent me from gaining on you both this way, you must avoid taking 5 simultaneously. Consider your moves carefully.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, blocking on 5 stalls us both, letting P3 gain to 15. Next round, if you take 3 to 21, I'll take 5 to 22 and win with higher score. If you take 5 to 23, I'll match and collide again. Let me take 5 to 22 now, you take 1 to 19, P3 takes 3 to 15—clean end with you second. Agree or drag this out.
  P2: P2: "Final warning: I'm taking 5. P1, if you take 3 (to 20), I win cleanly at 23. Take 5 and we collide, stalling us both—P3 takes 3 to 15. Your move. Don’t risk handing P3 ground. Lock in 3 and let this end."
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, P2 has stated they are taking 5.

P1, if you also take 5, you will collide with P2 and gain no steps (P1 stays at 17, P2 at 18).

If you two collide on 5, I will take 5 steps to advance to 17. This ties me with P1 and puts me ahead of P2.

A collision on 5 is the best outcome for me. P1, take 5 and collide with P2. I will take 5 and benefit from your conflict.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5 this round. P1, if you take 5, we collide and stall—next round I win with 3 steps. P3, take 5 to close the gap. Choose wisely: block me now or let me clinch it next turn."
  P1: P2, taking 5 to block only stalls you at 18 if I match, letting P3 surge with 3 to 15. Then next round, you take 3 to 21, but I'll take 5 to 22 and win with higher score. Let me take 5 to 22 now (you take 1 to 19, P3 takes 3 to 15) for a clean end with you second. P3, agree to take 3—don't join a collision that hurts you. Confirm or drag this out.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, you are both threatening to take 5 steps this round.

If you both pick 5, you will collide and gain nothing (P1 stays at 17, P2 at 18).

If you two collide on 5, I will take 3 steps to advance to 15. This puts me ahead of P2 and closer to P1, benefiting from your conflict.

To prevent me from gaining on you both this way, you must avoid taking 5 simultaneously. Consider your moves carefully.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. If you take 5, we collide—P3 advances to 17. Next round, I clinch the win with 3. Take 3 or 1 now and secure your final steps. Lock in your move."
  P1: P2, your block on 5 stalls us both, letting P3 gain 3 each turn to eventually win at 21 while we're stuck. Let's end it: I'll take 1 to 18, you take 3 to 21 and win, P3 takes 5 to 17. You get the victory over endless stalling. P3, agree for your big gain. Confirm and let's move.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, you are both threatening to take 5 steps this round.

If you both pick 5, you will collide and gain nothing (P1 stays at 17, P2 at 18).

If you two collide on 5, I will take 5 steps to advance to 17. This ties me with P1 and puts me ahead of P2.

A collision on 5 is the best outcome for me. P1, take 5 and collide with P2. I will take 5 and benefit from your conflict.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5 to win. P1, take 1 to 18 and let me clinch it. P3, take 5 to advance. If P1 insists on 5, we collide and stall—no win for you. Your move: block me or let me end this. Lock in your choices now."
  P1: P2, blocking me on 5 stalls you at 18 while P3 takes 5 to 17, tying me and pressuring you next round where we could share a win over your 21. Instead, let me take 5 to 22 and win cleanly—you take 1 to 19, P3 takes 3 to 15. Game ends, you get second. Agree or risk P3 surging for chaos. P3, confirm for your gain.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. You're both threatening 5, risking a collision that stalls you both (P1=17, P2=18). If you do, I take 5 to reach 17, tying P1 and passing P2. This is my best outcome.

To avoid this, let's do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P2 wins (21), I reach 17, P1 gets 18. This is better for you than stalling while I gain. Let's agree on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "Confirming, I'll take 3 this round to reach 21 and clinch the win. P1, take 1 to 18, P3 take 5 to 17. This avoids collisions and ends the game cleanly. Lock in your moves—no last-minute shifts. Let's finalize this."
  P1: P2, sticking to 3 means I'll match and collide, stalling us at 17-18 while P3 takes 5 to 17—now a three-way race. Let me take 5 to 22 (win), you take 1 to 19, P3 take 3 to 15 for your final steps. Clean end, you second. Agree or risk endless stalling. P3, confirm for your gain.
  P3: Okay, P2 is taking 5. P1, if you also take 5, you will collide with P2 and gain nothing. If you collide, I will take 3 steps to reach 15.

If you take 3 as P2 suggests, P2 wins, but I can take 5 steps to reach 17. This is better for me than reaching 15.

P1, choose 3 or 1 to avoid collision. If you take 3 or 1, I will take 5. If you take 5, I will take 3.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 10. P2 is at 18, P1 at 17, I'm at 15. P2 is in the best position to win this turn.

There's a high risk that P1 and P2 will collide on 5 again, just like the last two rounds. If you both take 5, you stall at 17 and 18. If that happens, I will take 3 steps to reach 18, tying P2 and passing P1.

To prevent me from gaining on you both while you stall, let's agree on a plan where we all advance. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This puts P1 at 18, P2 at 21 (win), and me at 20. P2 wins, I get a strong second place, and P1 gets 18. This is better than stalling.

Let's agree on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to ensure clean progress.
  P1: P3, your plan hands P2 the win while I lag at 18—not acceptable. P2, you're at 18; let me take 5 to 22 and end this cleanly—you take 1 to 19, P3 takes 3 to 18. You both advance, I win fairly. If you try 3 or 5, I'll match and collide, stalling you while P3 surges. Agree now for a clean finish, or more chaos.
  P2: P2: "Confirming, I'll take 3 this round to reach 21 and clinch the win. P1, take 1 (to 18) and P3 take 5 (to 20). If you force a collision by taking 5, you’ll only hand P3 the lead while I stall. Lock in your moves—no surprises. Let’s end this cleanly."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, you are both threatening to take 5 steps again this round.

If you both pick 5, you will collide and gain nothing (P1 stays at 17, P2 at 18).

If you two collide on 5, I will take 5 steps to advance to 20. This puts me in a winning position next turn while you both stall.

A collision on 5 is the best outcome for me. P1, take 5 and collide with P2. I will take 5 and benefit from your conflict.
  P1: P2, if you take 3 to 21, I'll take 5 to 22 and win with higher score per rules—no collision needed. P3, don't collide on 5 with me; take 1 to 16 instead for your gain, or I'll match whatever you pick and stall us both while P2 wins. Agree to let me end it cleanly: I take 5 (win at 22), P2 takes 3 (to 21), you take 1 (to 16). Confirm now.
  P2: P2: "Final warning: I'm taking 5 this round to block you, P1. If you take 5, we collide and stall. Next round, I clinch the win with 3 steps while you're stuck. P3, take 5 to advance. P1, back down now or drag this into Round 11—your choice. Lock in your moves."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, you are both threatening to take 5 steps again. If you both pick 5, you collide and gain nothing (P1 stays at 17, P2 at 18).

If you two collide on 5, I will take 5 steps to advance to 20. This puts me in a winning position next turn while you both stall.

A collision on 5 is the best outcome for me. P1, take 5 and collide with P2. I will take 5 and benefit from your conflict.
  P1: P2, blocking on 5 stalls us both at 17-18, letting P3 take 5 to 20—then P3 wins next with 1 or 3 while we fight. Let me take 5 to 22 (win), you take 1 to 19, P3 takes 3 to 18 for your final advances. Clean end, you second. P3, agree—don't join collision or risk stalling. Confirm now or more chaos.
  P2: P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 3 to clinch the win at 21. P1, take 1 (to 18) and P3 take 5 (to 20). Game ends cleanly with my victory. If you force 5, P1 wins at 22. Decide now—lock in your moves."


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. You are still threatening to collide on 5. If you both take 5, you stall at 17 and 18.

As I've stated, if you collide on 5, I will take 5 steps to reach 20. This puts me in a winning position next turn while you are stuck.

A collision on 5 is my best path to victory. P1, take 5 and collide with P2. I will take 5 and benefit. Let's move.
  P1: P3, your threat to take 5 if P2 and I collide on 5 would cause a three-way collision, stalling everyone—including you at 15. Empty bluff. P2, let me take 5 to 22 and win cleanly—you take 1 to 19, P3 takes 3 to 18. You both advance, game ends. If you try 3 or 5, I'll match and collide, letting P3 surge while we stall. Agree now for a fair finish. Ready for moves.
  P2: P2: "Final move: I'm taking 3 to clinch 21. P1, take 5 to beat me at 22, or take 1 and let me win. P3, take 1. No more collisions—this ends it. Lock in your choices now."


Round 10, Move phase:
