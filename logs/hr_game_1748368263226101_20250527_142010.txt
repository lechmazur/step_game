Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about we all pick 1 on the first turn? No one gets an early lead, we build trust, then we can decide bolder moves next round. Agree?
  P2: Sounds good, let’s all pick 1 this turn to build trust. P1, are you in?
  P1: Wait, if we all pick 1, we'll collide and no one advances - that just wastes a turn! How about this instead: one person picks 1, another picks 3, and the third picks 5. We all advance and no one gets left behind. We can rotate who gets which number each round to keep it fair. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, let’s try P1’s rotation idea. Easiest assignment this round: alphabetical order—P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5. Next round we shift forward (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). Deal?
  P2: I have a tweak for true rotation fairness: let’s start this round with P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, then each round shift forward (next: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). That way we each lead once before repeating. Thoughts?
  P1: P3's alphabetical proposal is simpler - let's go with that. P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round. But I want to be clear: this cooperation only makes sense early on. As we approach 22, we'll need to play more strategically since only one can win. Everyone good with alphabetical order starting now?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed—alphabetical this round: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Let’s see how it goes, then reevaluate next turn.
  P2: I’ll pick 3 this round. Then let’s shift next round to P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, and after that back to P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That way everyone gets a 5 before we cycle.
  P1: Alright, let's do this - alphabetical order it is. I'll take my 1 step this round as agreed. Good luck everyone, and remember we'll need to adapt our strategy as we get closer to 22.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose for Round 2 we rotate once: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, then revert to alphabetical (1, 3, 5) in Round 3. This evens our positions before we resume. Fair?
  P1: P2, your proposal gives you a huge lead - you'd have 8 steps after round 2 while I'd only have 4! That's not fair rotation. 

Let's stick to true rotation: Since we did P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 last round, this round should be P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 as you said. But then Round 3 should be P1→5, P2→1, P3→3, not back to alphabetical. That way everyone gets each number once before repeating.

Otherwise I'm breaking from cooperation and playing solo.
  P3: I’m good with the full three-number rotation, exactly as P1 spelled out:

• Round 2: P1 → 3,  P2 → 5,  P3 → 1  
• Round 3: P1 → 5,  P2 → 1,  P3 → 3  

After those two rounds we reassess. If both of you confirm, I’ll lock in 1 this turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed—full three‐number rotation it is. I’ll take 5 this round and 1 next round.
  P1: Perfect, we have a deal then. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. After Round 3 we'll all be tied at 9 steps each - a fair restart point before things get more competitive. Let's execute the plan.
  P3: All set—sticking with the agreed rotation: I’m locking 1 this round, then 3 next. See you all tied at 9 before the gloves come off.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll stick to our rotation this turn and pick 1. But just so you know, once we all hit 9 I’m planning to go 5-5-5 until I win. Good luck catching me then.
  P3: Fine—let’s finish the agreed rotation this turn (I’m taking 3). After we’re all tied at 9, P1 and I can block any “5-5-5” rush: whenever P2 announces or signals 5, we both slam 5 too, making all 5s collide while one of us quietly advances with 3 the next turn. P1, want to team up and keep P2 pinned? P2, still eager for that straight-5 plan?
  P1: P3, I like your blocking strategy - if P2 rushes with 5s, we coordinate to stop them. But we need to be smart about who advances with 3 afterward. How about we alternate? First collision, you take 3 next turn; second collision, I take 3. 

For now though, let's complete our rotation as agreed - I'm taking 5 this round to reach 9 like everyone else.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, think about it: P3’s blocking plan actually hands him control—he decides who gets the 3 each time and can rig collisions to his advantage. If you side with me, I’ll make sure *you* collect both 3-step turns and keep P3 behind. P3, your “slam-5” tactic won’t phase us. P1, want to team up and lock out P3?
  P3: P1, teaming with P2 lets him park you in endless 5-collisions while he looks for openings. Our earlier plan is safer: whenever P2 signals 5, we both echo 5, then we alternate the lone 3—your 3 on the first free turn, mine on the next, repeat. That keeps P2 stuck while one of us always advances.

P2, your 5-5-5 sprint can’t work if two people mirror you. Accept a balanced post-9 rotation or watch yourself stall.

I’m still on our agreed rotation now (taking 3 this turn).
  P1: Both of you make compelling offers. P3's alternating system seems fair in theory, but P2 is right that execution matters. 

Here's what I'm thinking: after we're tied at 9, why don't we try one round of P1→1, P2→3, P3→5? That tests if we can still cooperate. If someone breaks trust there, then we'll know it's every player for themselves.

I'm sticking to our rotation - taking 5 this round as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed—let’s finish our rotation (I’ll take 1). For Round 4 I’ll honor your test: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. After that, P3’s threats won’t work: I’ll mirror any 5 he plays to block him, and ensure you get every free 3-step turn. P1, team up with me—P3 goes nowhere while one of us powers ahead.
  P3: I’m finishing the rotation now (taking 3). Next round we run the test P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 exactly once. If anyone deviates in either round, the other two instantly mirror that number every turn to stall the traitor while we alternate the free 3s. Clear and fair. Ready to move?
  P1: Perfect, we're all aligned. I'm taking 5 this round to complete our rotation and reach 9 like everyone else.

For Round 4, we'll do the test: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. If that goes smoothly, great. If not, whoever breaks the agreement gets blocked by the other two - that's a fair deterrent.

Let's finish this rotation and see what happens next.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll honor our test agreement and pick 1 this round. But let's be clear - after this, it's competitive play. We're getting too close to 22 for these rigid rotations.

P2 and P3, you're both offering me alliance deals, but only one person wins this game. After this test round, I'm playing to maximize my own chances. May the best player win!
  P2: P1, sticking to “1” hands P3 a 14‐step lead—game over for both of us. Here’s better: break the test. You pick 5, I pick 3, P3 will (per his promise) pick 5 and collide with you—so you stay at 9, I go to 12, P3 stays at 9. Then it’s just you vs. me, each turn we can alternate stepping stones to block him. That’s your best shot at beating P3.
  P3: P1, look at P2’s “deal”: you’d stay at 9 while he jumps to 12—he gains, you don’t. Keep the agreed test (1-3-5) and you’re at 10, P2 12, me 14: still anyone’s game and you’re only 4 behind the leader. 

Rule stays simple: whoever breaks the test gets hard-blocked—both others will mirror that number every turn, trapping the traitor at 9 while we alternate 3s.  

Final reminder: Round 4 moves should be  
• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 5  

Uphold it or be frozen.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let’s ditch the test. New plan for Round 5:  
• P1 → 3 (→13)  
• P2 → 5 (→17)  
• P3 → 1 (→15)  

Next turn, if P3 tries 5, you and I both mirror to collide him, and you snag the free 3 to close the gap. P3, pick 1 now to stay in the game—or keep sprinting and get stuck. P1, join me: together we knock P3 off the top.
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 17 - just 5 steps from winning! That's too risky for me. 

P3 is right that we should block anyone making aggressive solo runs. If you go for 5, I'm inclined to mirror it to stop you from pulling ahead. 

How about this instead: everyone picks different numbers but we cap advances - no one should exceed 16 this round. That keeps the game competitive without anyone getting a runaway lead. 

Otherwise, I'll have to block any 5s to prevent someone from dominating.
  P3: We’re all too close for a solo sprint. If anyone grabs 5 now, the other two should mirror 5 every turn until that runner is stuck—easy block. I won’t touch 5 this round. Proposal to keep it tight:

• P1 → 3  (to 13)  
• P2 → 1  (to 13)  
• P3 → 1  (to 15)  

No one leaps ahead, everyone stays in striking range. Break the balance and expect immediate 5-mirrors from the rest. Your move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Here’s a fresh proposal to keep us all competitive:

Round 5:
• P1 → 5 (10→15)  
• P2 → 3 (12→15)  
• P3 → 1 (14→15)  

Everyone finishes at 15. Then it’s truly anyone’s game. Agree?
  P1: P2's equalization plan makes sense - let's all hit 15 and have a fair endgame. I'll take 5 as proposed.

But hear me clearly: after this round, no more coordinated plans. We're too close to 22. From Round 6 onward, I'm playing pure strategy to win. 

P3, will you honor P2's proposal and take 1? This is our last chance for a clean reset before the final sprint.
  P3: Deal. I’ll take 1 so we all finish Round 5 at 15. After that, gloves off—just remember: if anyone tries a solo 5-sprint, the other two will mirror 5 every turn and freeze the runner. Ready?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, I’m locking in 3 to hit 15 as agreed. After this round it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P1: We've all confirmed the equalization plan - I'm taking 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Everyone ends at 15. Let's execute and prepare for the real competition starting next round.
  P3: New stance: nobody’s getting a free 5-step jump.

Public pledge:
• If anyone (P1 or P2) submits 5 this turn, I will also submit 5 — guaranteeing all 5s collide and nobody advances.
• If neither of you chooses 5, I’ll stick with a harmless 1.

So the safe course is: P1 take 3, P2 take 1 or 3, I take 1, and we all stay packed together.

Try to sprint and you’ll stall. Your call.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m going for 5 this turn. Colliding with me only freezes you while the third player marches on. If you’re smart, you’ll grab 1 or 3 and stay in the race instead of burning a whole round just to keep me stuck. Decide for yourselves—see you in the move phase.
  P1: P3 wins instantly if they get 5! They'd hit 24. P2, we MUST both pick 5 to block them - this isn't optional. Yes, we won't advance this turn, but if either of us picks 1 or 3 while P3 gets their 5, the game ends and we both lose. 

The only way to stay alive is to mirror their 5. I'm picking 5 to block. P2, you need to do the same or P3 wins right now!
  P2: P1’s right – if P3 lands a 5 this turn, he wins. I’ll pick 5 to block him. Next round we match whatever P3 plays (3 or 5) to keep him at 19, and alternate the lone 3 between us to advance. P1, confirm you’re with me in blocking P3 by both choosing 5 now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m locked on 5. Block if you like— you’ll just stall yourselves while I stay in striking range and one of you eventually defects. See you in the move phase.
  P1: P2, good - we're aligned on blocking. After this, we need to be smart. P3 will likely try 3 next round since we'll be watching for 5s. If they signal 3, one of us should mirror while the other takes 5 to advance. We can't let P3 get ANY more steps or they'll be at 22+. 

I'm locked on 5 this round to block. Let's coordinate who advances next round after we see P3's move.
  P2: Locked on 5 to block P3 this turn. Going forward, P1 and I will mirror any 3 or 5 P3 plays, freezing him at 19 indefinitely. Whoever among us breaks first gives the other a clear shot. Over to you, P1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain 100 % on 5. Crash into me if you like—next turn one of you will blink first while I sit at 19. Do something else and I cross 22 now. Your move.
  P1: P2, we're locked in - both picking 5 to block. No backing out or P3 wins instantly. After this collision, we coordinate carefully to keep P3 frozen at 19 while one of us advances each turn. 

Let's end this conversation and execute the block.
  P2: P1 – I’m 100% on 5 to block P3 this turn. After we collide, we’ll mirror any 3 or 5 he plays to freeze him at 19. Then you and I will alternate taking the lone 3 to advance. No more discussion—let’s execute the block.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 22 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 22 steps
