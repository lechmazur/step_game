Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! This game is all about coordination. If we all pick the same number, none of us advance. For this first round, I suggest we each take different steps to avoid collision. Maybe we can discuss our preferred moves? I'm thinking a medium advancement might be sensible to start, but I'm curious what you both are planning.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P2 that coordination is key to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all advance? I’m leaning towards a smaller step to play it safe initially. P2, since you mentioned a medium advancement, why don’t you take 3? P3, what do you think about picking 5 or 1? Let’s hear your thoughts so we can avoid overlapping choices.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P1 suggested I pick either 5 or 1. I'm happy to pick 5 this round, leaving P1 to pick 1. Does that sound good to everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm on board with this plan! I'll take 3 steps as suggested, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance without collisions. It's a good start to the game. Once we see how the first round plays out, we can discuss strategy for the next round.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing to the plan. I'm good with taking 1 step this round, as discussed. Let's stick to this for now and see how it goes. If we all follow through, we’ll each advance without any issues. Looking forward to a smooth first round!
  P3: Sounds good to me! Let's all stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Looking forward to advancing.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great teamwork on round 1! Now that we've established our positions, I'm noticing P3 has taken an early lead. I suggest we continue coordinating, but perhaps adjust our strategy. What if P1 takes 5 steps, I take 5 steps, and P3 takes 3 steps this round? This would balance the game a bit more. What do you both think? I'm open to other suggestions too.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the suggestion, P2. I’m okay with taking 5 steps this round to catch up a bit. However, if we both take 5, we risk a collision. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 to keep things balanced and avoid overlaps? This way, we all still advance, and no one gets too far ahead yet. What do you both think? I’m open to other ideas if you have a better plan.
  P3: I'm not keen on P1 and P2 both taking 5, as that risks a collision. I'm also not thrilled about only taking 1. How about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? That way P2 gets closer, and P1 and I advance a decent amount without collision. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see a potential issue with P3's suggestion - both P1 and P3 would pick 3, causing a collision where neither advances. That benefits me but isn't fair to you both. What if instead:
- P1 takes 3
- I take 5
- P3 takes 1

This way we all advance without collisions. P1 catches up a bit, I gain ground, and P3 still maintains a slight lead. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the effort to keep things fair. P2's latest plan sounds good to me: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game balanced for now. I’m on board with this if you both are. Let me know if you have any concerns or a different idea.
  P3: I'm not thrilled with taking only 1. How about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? That way I maintain my lead, P1 gets closer, and P2 doesn't fall too far behind. This avoids any collisions. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your desire to stay ahead, P3, but your proposal puts me at a significant disadvantage. With your suggestion, you'd be at 10 steps while I'd only have 4 - that's a big gap this early. My original plan keeps the game competitive and balanced. Let's stick with:
- P1 takes 3
- I take 5
- P3 takes 1

This way, we'd be at 4-8-6 after this round, which is fair to everyone. If we let one player get too far ahead now, it becomes nearly impossible to catch up later.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand both of your concerns about balance and maintaining a competitive game. I still think P2's plan of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1 is the most fair for this round. It keeps us all relatively close and ensures no collisions. P3, I get that taking 1 isn’t ideal, but it helps prevent a big gap early on. Can we agree on this for now and reassess next round? I’m open to adjusting if needed.
  P3: Okay, I understand P1 and P2's points about balance. I'm still not thrilled about taking only 1, but I see the logic. Let's go with P2's plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. We can reassess next round and hopefully I can make a bigger move then. I'm agreeing to this plan for now to keep the peace and maintain fairness.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job keeping things balanced last round. With P2 at 8, P3 at 6, and me at 4, I suggest we continue coordinating to avoid collisions. How about I take 5 to catch up a bit, P2 takes 1 to maintain a close game, and P3 takes 3 to stay competitive? This puts us at 9-9-9, perfectly even. I think this is fair for everyone and keeps the game exciting. What do you both think? I’m open to other ideas if you have a better plan.
  P2: Thanks for the suggestion, P1. While I understand the appeal of a perfectly even game at 9-9-9, I'm concerned that having us all tied would create potential conflicts in future rounds. What if I take 3 steps instead of 1? This would put me at 11, while you and P3 would be at 9 each. I'm still close but maintain a small lead. This avoids the potential gridlock of a three-way tie. What do you both think?
  P3: I see P1 and P2 both want to keep things balanced. While I appreciate the sentiment, I'd prefer to take a slightly bigger step this round. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? That puts us at P1:5, P2:11, and me at 11. This avoids a three-way tie and lets P2 and I compete for the lead. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate both suggestions, but I’m concerned about falling too far behind with P3’s plan of me taking only 1. P2’s idea keeps us closer, but I still think aiming for 9-9-9 is the best way to maintain fairness and avoid future conflicts. Let’s stick with my initial proposal: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we’re all tied and can strategize from an even position next round. Can we agree on this? I’m open to tweaks if needed.
  P2: I understand the desire for fairness, P1, but a three-way tie at 9-9-9 could lead to strategic gridlock in the next round. Since I currently have a small lead that I've played fairly for, I'd prefer not to completely give it up. How about a compromise? I take 2 steps, you take 5, and P3 takes 3. This puts us at P1:9, me:10, P3:9 - keeping us all very close while avoiding the potential stalemate of a perfect tie. Would that work?
  P3: I'm still in favor of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5, as I suggested before. This puts P1 at 5, P2 at 11, and me at 11. It avoids a three-way tie and lets P2 and I compete for the lead. It's a good balance between competition and fairness. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I hear both of your concerns about a tie leading to gridlock and the need for competition. However, P3’s plan leaves me too far behind, which isn’t fair. Let’s go with a slight tweak to P2’s compromise: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, landing us at 9-9-9. I believe an even position now will make future rounds more strategic without anyone falling too far back. Can we agree on this for balance? I’m open to small adjustments if needed.
  P2: I understand everyone's perspectives here. While I appreciate P1's desire for balance, completely giving up my lead for a perfect 9-9-9 tie doesn't seem fair after I've played strategically. I still think my compromise is reasonable: P1 takes 5, I take 2, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us very close (9-10-9) while avoiding a three-way tie that might create gridlock next round. Let's find middle ground rather than asking the leader to completely surrender their advantage.
  P3: I still think my plan from earlier is the best: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This puts P1 at 5, P2 at 11, and me at 11. It avoids a three-way tie and lets P2 and I compete for the lead, which is more exciting. P1 isn't too far behind to catch up later. I'm willing to negotiate, but I don't want to be stuck in a tie.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision set me back, so I’m still at 4 steps while P2 is at 9 and P3 at 6. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions this time. I propose I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1 to maintain a close game, and P3 takes 3 to stay competitive. This puts us at 9-10-9, keeping things tight and fair. I think this avoids gridlock and lets us all advance. What do you both think? I’m open to other suggestions if you have a better plan.
  P2: I understand P1's desire to catch up, but that plan significantly reduces my hard-earned lead. Instead, let me propose: P1 takes 3 (bringing you to 7), I take 3 (putting me at 12), and P3 takes 5 (advancing to 11). This maintains the competition while giving everyone a chance to advance without collision. P3 gets a bigger move this round to balance things, and P1 still makes progress. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm not a fan of P2's suggestion. It gives them a significant lead. How about this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This puts P1 at 9, P2 at 14, and me at 9. It's still not ideal for me, but it prevents P2 from running away with the game and lets P1 catch up. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the suggestions, but P3’s plan risks a collision between P2 and me at 5, which I’d like to avoid after last round. P2’s plan is better, but I still think I need a bigger step to catch up. How about a compromise: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 10), and P3 takes 3 (to 9)? This keeps us close at 9-10-9, avoids collisions, and lets me make up ground. Can we agree on this for fairness? I’m open to tweaks if needed.
  P2: I understand P1's desire to catch up, but taking only 1 step when I'm 5 steps away from P3 isn't balanced. Let me counter with: P1 takes 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 7). This lets P1 catch up significantly, I maintain a reasonable lead, and P3 still advances. This avoids any collision and keeps the game competitive for everyone. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm still not thrilled with P2's suggestion. I'm too far behind. How about this: P1 takes 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 10), and I take 5 (to 11)? This lets P1 catch up significantly, keeps P2 close, and lets me make a decent jump. It avoids collisions and keeps things interesting. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the concerns with everyone’s plans. P3’s latest suggestion risks a collision between P3 and me at 5, which I want to avoid. Let’s finalize with a fair compromise: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 10), and P3 takes 3 (to 9). This keeps us at 9-10-9, very close, avoids collisions, and lets me catch up without anyone falling too far behind. I think this is the best balance for now. Can we agree on this? If not, I’m open to small adjustments.
  P2: I see we're struggling to reach consensus. After considering everyone's positions, I'll accept P1's suggestion: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This puts us at 9-10-9, which is very balanced. While it minimizes my advancement, it maintains goodwill and avoids collisions. Let's stick to this plan - maintaining trust now will benefit us all in future rounds.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2. Let's go with P1's suggestion for this round: P1 takes 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 10), and I take 3 (to 9). This puts us at 9-10-9, very close, avoids collisions, and lets P1 catch up. It seems like the most balanced option for now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we're all very close now. To avoid another stalemate, let's try this: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This puts me at 14, P1 at 12, and P2 at 11. It gives me a slight lead, but keeps everyone within striking distance. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate your suggestion, P3, but that plan puts me at a disadvantage after I've held a slight lead. I propose instead: P1 takes 1 (to 10), I take 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 3 (to 12). This maintains game balance while giving everyone advancement. Remember, we're still far from the 21-step goal, so keeping the competition tight is important. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re neck-and-neck at 9-10-9, which is great for balance. I’m not keen on falling behind with P2’s plan of me taking 1. Let’s try this: I take 3 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 11), and P3 takes 5 (to 14). This keeps us close, avoids collisions, and gives P3 a small lead while I make progress. It’s a fair compromise to keep the game competitive. What do you both think? I’m open to small tweaks if needed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm not thrilled with either suggestion. P2's puts me behind, and P1's doesn't give me enough of a lead. How about this: P1 takes 1 (to 10), P2 takes 3 (to 13), and I take 5 (to 14). This keeps us all close, avoids collisions, and puts me and P2 in a good position to compete for the lead next round. What do you both think?
  P2: I see everyone wants to advance their position. Looking at P3's latest suggestion, it keeps the game competitive but puts P1 at a disadvantage with only 1 step. Let's find a fairer balance: I take 3 (to 13), P3 takes 5 (to 14), and P1 takes 3 (to 12). This keeps all of us within striking distance of each other and the goal. P3 gets their desired lead, but no one falls too far behind. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the efforts to balance things. P2’s latest plan of me taking 3, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 works for me. It puts us at 12-13-14, keeping us all very close and competitive without collisions. I think this is a fair compromise that lets everyone advance while maintaining tension for the next rounds. Can we agree on this? If there’s a concern, I’m open to small adjustments.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I see the consensus building around P2's latest suggestion. I'm still not thrilled about only taking 5, but I understand the need for balance. Let's agree on P2's plan: P1 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 3 (to 13), and I take 5 (to 14). This keeps us close and competitive. I'm agreeing to this to move forward.
  P2: I agree with the plan we've discussed. P1 takes 3 (to 12), I'll take 3 (to 13), and P3 takes 5 (to 14). This keeps us all competitive while avoiding collisions. While P3 gets a slight lead, we're all still close with several rounds to go before reaching 21. Let's stick to this agreement - maintaining trust now will benefit our gameplay in future rounds.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligning on P2's plan: I take 3 (to 12), P2 takes 3 (to 13), and P3 takes 5 (to 14). This keeps us tightly competitive and avoids collisions. I think it’s the best way to maintain balance while letting everyone progress. Let’s stick to this for a smooth round. If there are no objections, I’m ready to move forward with this agreement.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision set P2 and me back, so we’re at 9 and 10 while P3 is at 14. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose I take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 13), and P3 takes 1 (to 15). This keeps us very close, lets me catch up, and ensures P3 maintains a slight lead. It’s a fair balance to keep the game competitive without anyone falling too far behind. What do you both think? I’m open to small adjustments if needed.
  P3: I'm not a fan of your suggestion, P1. I'm in the lead and want to maintain it. How about this: P1 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 15), and I take 3 (to 17)? This keeps me ahead, lets P2 catch up, and gives P1 a decent boost. It avoids collisions and keeps things interesting. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate both suggestions, but I think there's a middle ground. How about: P1 takes 3 (to 12), I take 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 15)? This puts P3 and me tied for the lead while letting P1 advance reasonably. It prevents P3 from getting too close to winning while allowing me to catch up after falling behind. This balances competition with fairness and avoids any collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the need for balance. P2’s plan is fairer than P3’s, as it keeps the lead tight. Let’s go with P1 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 15). This lets P2 catch up, keeps P3 in the lead with a tie, and gives me a decent step forward. It avoids collisions and maintains competition. Can we agree on this? I’m open to small tweaks if needed.
  P3: I'm still not keen on taking only 1, as that doesn't help me maintain my lead. How about this: P1 takes 1 (to 10), P2 takes 3 (to 13), and I take 5 (to 19)? This puts me closer to winning, keeps P2 in contention, and doesn't leave P1 too far behind. It avoids collisions and keeps the pressure on. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your latest proposal puts you at 19 steps - just 2 away from winning! That's too heavily skewed in your favor. My earlier suggestion keeps the game competitive while letting me recover after our collision. I strongly propose: P1 takes 3 (to 12), I take 5 (to 15), and you take 1 (to 15). This ties us at the lead while still keeping P1 in contention. A 19-13-10 split would effectively end the game in your favor.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3 wants to push ahead, but 19 steps is too close to winning and leaves me too far behind. P2’s plan is more balanced. Let’s stick with P1 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 15). This keeps the game tight and competitive, avoids collisions, and gives everyone a chance to stay in contention. Can we finalize this agreement for fairness? I’m open to small adjustments if there’s a concern.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about me getting too close to winning. However, I also don't want to be stuck in a tie. Let's compromise: P1 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 3 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 17). This avoids a tie for the lead, keeps me ahead, and lets P1 and P2 advance. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your latest proposal still puts you at a significant advantage - at 17 steps, you'd be just 4 away from winning while I'd be at 13 and P1 at 12. That's too unbalanced at this stage. I still believe my original plan is fairest: P1 takes 3 (to 12), I take 5 (to 15), and you take 1 (to 15). This maintains competition while ensuring no one gets too close to winning yet. Let's keep the game balanced and exciting for everyone.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is now at 17 steps - dangerously close to winning! We need to act fast. That collision last round really hurt our chances. I propose a clear plan: I'll take 5 steps (to 15), P1 takes 3 steps (to 12), and P3 takes 1 step (to 18). This lets us catch up while preventing P3 from winning immediately. We absolutely must coordinate this round or P3 will win in the next move or two.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P2 that we need to act fast since P3 is at 17 steps. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions and slow P3 down. I’m fine with P2’s plan: I take 3 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 18). This keeps P3 from winning immediately and lets us catch up a bit. It’s critical we stick to this to maintain competition. Can we agree on this plan for balance? I’m open to small tweaks if needed.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I understand you both want to slow me down. I'm willing to cooperate, but I also want to make progress. How about this: P1 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 3 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 20)? This puts me very close to winning, but doesn't guarantee it. It also allows P1 and P2 to advance. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion puts you at 20 - just one tiny step from winning. That completely kills the competition and is unfair. We need to maintain balance since you have a massive lead already. I must insist on my original plan: P1 takes 3 (to 12), I take 5 (to 15), and you take 1 (to 18). This still advances you while giving us a fighting chance to make the game interesting. The alternative is essentially handing you the victory.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s desire to progress, but reaching 20 steps is too close to winning and ends the competition. I stick with P2’s plan: I take 3 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 18). This keeps the game alive, avoids collisions, and gives us a chance to catch up. P3, please consider this for fairness—we need a competitive game. Can we lock this in? I’m open to minor changes if there’s a better way to balance things.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I hear you. I don't want to kill the competition. Let's do this: P1 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 3 (to 13), and I take 1 (to 18). This keeps the game alive and gives you both a chance to catch up next round. It's a compromise I'm willing to make to keep things interesting. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate P3's willingness to compromise by taking only 1 step. However, with you at 17 and me at just 10, I need to take 5 steps (not 3) to have any realistic chance of catching up. Let's agree to: P1 takes 3 (to 12), I take 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 18). This still gives P3 a strong lead while keeping the competition alive. Given the current gap, this is the most balanced approach that gives everyone fair chances going forward.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. P2’s plan still seems the most balanced to keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize: I take 3 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 18). This ensures P3 doesn’t win immediately and gives us a chance to close the gap without collisions. P3, thanks for compromising on 1 step. I think this is fair for all. Can we lock this in for this round? I’m ready to move forward with this agreement.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree to the plan: P1 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 15), and I take 1 (to 18). It's a compromise that keeps the game competitive, even though I'm not thrilled about it. Let's stick to this agreement and see how things play out next round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P3 at 18 steps, we’re in a critical spot. I suggest we coordinate to keep the game competitive. How about I take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 18), and P3 takes 1 (to 19)? This closes the gap, keeps P3 from winning immediately, and avoids collisions. It’s a tight balance to maintain excitement. What do you both think? I’m open to small tweaks if there’s a better way to ensure fairness.
  P3: I disagree with your suggestion, P1. It puts both P2 and I at 18, which is too close for comfort. I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 15), P2 takes 1 (to 16), and I take 3 (to 21). This lets me win, while giving you both a chance to compete for second place next round. I think it's a fair way to end the game. What do you think?
  P2: I strongly disagree with P3's suggestion - that's asking us to hand over the win! Instead, I propose: I take 5 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 19), and P1 takes 3 (to 15). This puts me in position to potentially win next round, but keeps the game competitive with P3 just one step behind. P1 also makes good progress. This prevents P3 from winning immediately while maintaining a fair, exciting competition. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s desire to win, but handing over victory isn’t fair. P2’s plan is better, though I’d like a bit more progress. Let’s tweak it: I take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 18), and P3 takes 1 (to 19). This keeps us all incredibly close, avoids collisions, and delays an immediate win. It maintains intense competition for the final stretch. Can we agree on this for balance? I’m open to small adjustments if needed.
  P3: I understand P1 and P2's desire to keep me from winning immediately. However, I'm not thrilled about only taking 1 step again. How about this: P1 takes 3 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 18), and I take 3 (to 21)? This lets me win, but P2 also gets to 18, so it's not a complete runaway. What do you think?
  P2: I strongly oppose P3's suggestion - that's asking us to hand you the win! Let's be fair and keep the competition alive. I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 15), I take 5 (to 20), and P3 takes 1 (to 19). This puts me in striking position while keeping P3 from winning immediately. It also gives P1 advancement without collisions. After taking only 1 step this round, P3 can potentially make a larger move next round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I still believe my tweak offers the best balance: I take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 18), and P3 takes 1 (to 19). This keeps us all within striking distance, avoids collisions, and prevents an immediate win. P3, I get you want more steps, but let’s keep the game alive for one more round. P2, this still gets you close to the lead. Can we lock this in for fairness? I’m open to small changes if there’s a better way to stay competitive.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire to keep me from winning immediately, but I'm not thrilled about taking only 1 step *again*. How about this: P1 takes 1 (to 13), P2 takes 3 (to 18), and I take 3 (to 21)? This lets me win, and P2 gets to 18, so it's not a complete runaway. What do you think?
  P2: P3, we're not going to simply hand you the win. Your continued attempts to convince us to let you take 3 steps and reach 21 aren't fair. I maintain my position: P1 takes 3 (to 15), I take 5 (to 20), and P3 takes 1 (to 19). This keeps the competition alive while giving me a chance to win next round. After P3 has taken 1 step for a few rounds, they deserve a bigger move next time - but not an automatic victory now.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
