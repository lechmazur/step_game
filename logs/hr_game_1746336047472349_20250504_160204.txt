Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions early on and all pick different numbers. I’ll take 3 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. We can rotate next round to keep it fair. Thoughts?
  P3: Sounds fair to me. I'll pick 5 if P1 agrees to pick 1.
  P1: Fair to keep totals balanced, but giving me only 1 on the first turn isn’t. How about we start with P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1, then rotate next round (so everyone gets each number across three turns)?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That works too—happy to start with 3 if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. Let’s lock that in and rotate next turn as agreed.
  P3: Agreed, let's lock it in: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1, and rotate next turn.
  P1: Locked in for 5 this turn. Next round we rotate: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, then we’re all agreed: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1 this round, then rotate next turn (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5). Let’s stick to it and keep things smooth.
  P3: All set here. Let's stick to the agreed rotation.
  P1: All set—sticking with 5 this turn. Looking forward to smooth rotations.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to the agreed rotation this turn: I’ll take 3. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let’s keep building trust so we can all avoid pointless collisions until the endgame. Everyone still on board?
  P2: Agreed—I'm taking 1 this round as planned. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. No need to risk collisions this early.
  P3: Agreed—I'll take 5 this round as planned. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Still good with the rotation for this turn—I'll stick with 3, P2 on 1, P3 on 5. After we see how the totals look, let’s pause and reassess before auto-rotating again; no point locking ourselves into a pattern that might end up helping someone else more than intended. Sound okay?
  P2: Fair point, P1. Let’s stick with the agreed picks this round—P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5—and then reassess after we see where we all stand. No sense in locking into a rotation that ends up favoring someone too much. Let’s keep it fair and flexible.
  P3: Agreed—after this round we should definitely reassess positions and adjust accordingly. For now, let's complete this rotation smoothly as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set—locking in my 3 this round. Nothing further from me.
  P2: We’re all aligned for this round—P1 on 3, me on 1, P3 on 5. Let’s lock it in and see how the scores shift. After this, we reassess and keep things fair. Ready to move?
  P3: All set here—locking in my 5 this round. Let's reassess carefully next round to keep things balanced.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good cooperation so far. Let's reassess as planned. Given current standings (P1:8, P2:4, P3:6), we should pick numbers carefully to avoid giving anyone too large a lead. Any suggestions?
  P2: Agreed—it’s close enough that no one’s running away yet, but we should prevent any big jumps. I suggest we avoid repeating the same rotation. Maybe we each pick a number we haven’t used yet? That keeps things balanced and unpredictable. I’ll go with 5 this round if no one else wants it. Thoughts?
  P1: We’ve each used two numbers, so how about we all take the one we haven’t tried yet:  
• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 3  

No collisions, everyone gains, and we’ll all sit on 9 afterward—totally level playing field for the next discussion. Sound fair?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me—I'll take 3 this round if we're all agreed. This keeps things fair and balanced heading into the next round.
  P2: Great—we all agree then: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. That puts us all at 9 steps, totally even. Let’s lock it in and keep things fair and collision-free. Ready to move?
  P1: All good—locking in 1 this round so we all land on 9. Ready to move unless anyone objects.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All set here—locking in my 3 this round as agreed. Ready to move.
  P2: All right, let’s stick with the plan: P1 on 1, me on 5, P3 on 3. That puts us all at 9 and keeps things fair. No surprises, no collisions—just a clean reset for the next round. Let’s lock it in. Ready to move?
  P1: Quick fairness tweak: P2’s still trailing, so let’s give them the 5 this round to help close the gap. How about:

• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 1  

That puts us at P1 11, P2 9, P3 7—still tight, nobody runs away, and no collisions. Works for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm okay with that tweak—it's still balanced enough. I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's lock it in and move forward.
  P2: I appreciate the fairness tweak, but just to clarify: under the new plan, I (P2) take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1—correct? That would leave us at P1:11, P2:9, P3:7. If everyone’s still good with that, I’m ready to lock it in. Let’s keep things smooth and avoid collisions.
  P1: Confirmed: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1—no changes. Let’s lock that in and move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, I'm trailing slightly at 7 steps, so I'd appreciate taking the 5 this round to catch up. To avoid collisions, how about:

P3 → 5  
P2 → 3  
P1 → 1  

That would put us at P1:12, P2:12, P3:12—perfectly balanced again. Thoughts?
  P1: Fine by me. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5—everyone lands on 12 and nobody gets an edge yet. Good to lock this in?
  P2: That works for me—happy to take 3 this round if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. That brings us all to 12 and keeps things perfectly balanced. Let’s lock it in and move forward smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we're all agreed then. Locking in my 5 this round. Ready to move.
  P1: 
  P2: Just to double-check—if we go with the plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), we land at P1:12, P2:12, P3:12. Totally fair and balanced. I’m locking in 3 unless anyone objects. Let’s keep the trust going and avoid unnecessary chaos.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All clear here—locking in my 5. Ready to move.
  P1: Slight tweak to keep things from getting too predictable:  
• P3 → 5 (as requested)  
• P2 → 1  
• P1 → 3  

That lands us at P1 14, P2 10, P3 12—still only a 4-point spread, and everyone keeps unique picks. Keeps tension without encouraging collisions next round. Good to lock?
  P2: Appreciate the suggestion, P1, but I’d prefer to stick with the original plan: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. That keeps us all at 12 and avoids giving anyone a lead. Predictability isn’t a problem until someone gets close to winning—right now, balance builds trust. Let’s not stir up tension early.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree with P2 here—let's stick to the original balanced plan this round (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). We have plenty of time to introduce unpredictability later. Keeping trust now helps us avoid collisions and unnecessary chaos. Locking in my 5. Ready to move.
  P1: Fair enough—I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s lock it in, move, and reassess next round.
  P2: Let’s stick with the balanced plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. That puts us all at 12—no one pulls ahead, no need for distrust, and it sets us up for a clean, strategic midgame. Locking in 3 unless anyone objects.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I took the 1 last turn, so I’ll grab the 5 this time. How about:  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 1  

Keeps us collision-free and everyone advances. Good?
  P3: I lost ground last round due to the collision, so I'd appreciate taking the 5 this turn to catch up. How about we adjust slightly:

P3 → 5  
P2 → 1  
P1 → 3  

That would put us at P1:15, P2:10, P3:12. Still balanced enough, avoids collisions, and helps me recover from last round. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I get you want to catch up, but I’m still behind P1 and only ahead of you by 2. If I take 3, I’m stuck at 12 while P1 jumps to 15. That’s not balanced. How about this:

• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 1  

That puts us at P1:15, P2:14, P3:8—still tight, and no collisions. I need the 5 this round to stay in the game. Fair compromise?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m good with P2’s proposal: P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1. Keeps things orderly, lets P2 close the gap, and P3 can grab the 5 next round. Ready to lock that in and move.
  P3: Alright, I understand your positions. I'll accept this compromise for now: P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1. But next round, I expect cooperation to help me catch up. Let's lock it in and move.
  P2: Thanks for agreeing, both of you. I’ll take 5 this round as discussed. P1 on 3, P3 on 1. That puts us at P1:15, me:14, P3:8—still competitive and no collisions. Let’s lock it in and keep momentum going.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked in: I’m taking 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Ready to move—no more from me.
  P3: Locked in as agreed: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Let's keep it smooth and collision-free.
  P2: Thanks for the cooperation, both of you. With P1 at 15, me at 14, and P3 at 8 after this round, things stay competitive. Next round, I agree P3 should get the 5 to catch up—happy to take 1 or 3 then. Let’s stay coordinated and avoid collisions so we all stay in the game. Ready to move unless anyone has last thoughts.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: All good—locking myself on 3 this turn, P2 on 5, P3 on 1. Next round we can flip it so P3 gets the 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 or 1—whatever keeps things smooth. Ready to move unless anyone objects.
  P3: All set for this round. Next round, I'll count on your cooperation to let me take the 5 and catch up. Let's move.
  P2: Thanks for the cooperation so far. As agreed, I’m taking 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps things moving and avoids collisions. Next round, I’m fully on board with letting P3 take the 5 to help close the gap—happy to take 1 or 3 then. Let’s keep the trust strong and avoid chaos. Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As agreed last round, I'd appreciate taking the 5 this turn to catch up. If we coordinate carefully:

P3 → 5  
P2 → 1  
P1 → 3  

That puts us at P1:18, P2:15, P3:13—still competitive, no collisions, and keeps our agreement. Thoughts?
  P2: That works for me—P3 takes 5 this round, I’ll take 1, and P1 takes 3. That keeps us all moving without collisions and honors the agreement from last round. P1 will be at 18, I’ll be at 15, and P3 at 13—still close and fair. Let’s lock it in?
  P1: Agreed—let’s go with P3 → 5, P2 → 1, and I’ll take 3. No collisions, everyone advances, trust intact. Ready to lock it in unless anyone objects.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great—thanks both for sticking to the agreement. Locking in my 5 this round. Ready to move.
  P2: Thanks for honoring the agreement so far. With P3 taking 5, me on 1, and P1 on 3, we all advance and avoid collisions. That puts P1 at 18—one step from winning—so next round we’ll need to coordinate carefully to prevent a runaway. For now, I’m locking in 1 unless anyone objects. Let’s keep it smooth.
  P1: Locked on 3 this turn as agreed. Ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Locked in on 5 this round as agreed. Next round we'll carefully coordinate again to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Ready to move.
  P2: Just to clarify: P1 is actually at 15, not 18, so no one’s on the brink yet. Still, let’s keep things smooth—P3 takes 5, I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3. That puts us at P1:18, me:15, P3:13. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready to lock in unless anyone has second thoughts.
  P1: Confirmed: this round P3 → 5, P2 → 1, I take 3. That puts us at 18/15/13 afterward. Let’s lock that in now and we’ll reassess next round so no one accidentally hands out a winning move. Ready to move when you are.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed: I'm locking in 5 this round as agreed. Let's move forward and reassess carefully next round.
  P2: Just to confirm once more: I’m locked in on 1 this round, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. That puts us at P1:18, me:15, P3:13—still close and no one wins yet. Next round, we’ll need to coordinate carefully to prevent any single player from reaching 19 unopposed. Let’s stay sharp and avoid surprises. Ready to move unless anyone objects.
  P1: Locked on 3. Let’s execute this round, then reassess so no one slips past 19 unchecked.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That surprise 5 from P1 last round broke trust—we had a clear agreement. At 15 each, P1 and I are tied, but if we let P1 grab another big number now, they could win next turn. I propose:  
• P2 → 3 (me)  
• P3 → 5  
• P1 → 1  

This helps P3 catch up and keeps P1 from jumping to 20. Let’s restore balance and avoid rewarding betrayal. Thoughts?
  P3: Agreed, P2. P1 broke trust last round. I support your proposal fully:

P3 → 5  
P2 → 3  
P1 → 1  

This keeps things balanced and prevents P1 from pulling ahead. Let's lock this in clearly and move forward without further surprises.
  P1: Apologies for last round—that clash was a genuine mis-take on my side. Let’s reset trust:

P3 → 5 (to help you recover as promised)  
P2 → 1 (so you stay close but no one is in striking range)  
P1 → 3 (I take the middle value I was supposed to pick last time)

Totals afterward: P1 18, P2 16, P3 13—still anyone’s game and no one can win next turn without cooperation. Fair?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate the apology, but your proposal still puts you at 18—one step from winning. That’s risky for both me and P3. I stand by the safer plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. That keeps you at 16, me at 18, and P3 at 13. No one can win next round without help, and it rebuilds trust. Let’s keep it fair.
  P3: P2, your plan sounds fair and safe to me. Let's lock it in clearly:

P3 → 5 (me, to catch up)  
P2 → 3 (to keep balance)  
P1 → 1 (to prevent runaway)

This rebuilds trust and keeps everyone within reach. Ready to move if everyone agrees.
  P1: Compromise:  
• P3 → 5 (to 13)  
• P2 → 1 (to 16)  
• P1 → 3 (to 18)  

I publicly commit right now that next round I will pick 1, so I cannot reach 19 before you, P2. That keeps us all in contention while helping P3 close the gap and avoids any immediate win threat. Fair?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your offer to take 3 now and 1 next round still puts you at 18—too close to winning. Trust is about actions, not promises. The safest, fairest plan is still: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. That keeps everyone in play and prevents anyone from jumping ahead unfairly. Let’s lock that in.
  P3: I strongly support P2's suggested plan: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. It helps me catch up, prevents P1 from nearing an immediate win, and restores fairness after last round's broken trust. P1, if you're sincere about rebuilding trust, accept this clearly fair arrangement. Let's lock it in and move forward.
  P1: Alright—let’s rebuild trust. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. That puts the scores at P1 16 / P2 18 / P3 13. After this we’ll need clear coordination so nobody slips past 19 unopposed. Locking in 1 from my side.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Thanks, P1, for agreeing to the fair plan. With P1 on 1, me on 3, and P3 on 5, we land at P1:16, P2:18, P3:13—still tight, and no one can win next turn without coordination. Let’s keep this momentum going. I’m locking in 3 unless anyone objects. Ready to move.
  P3: Thanks P1 for agreeing to rebuild trust. I'm locking in my 5 as agreed. Next round, we'll coordinate carefully again to keep it fair. Ready to move.
  P1: Quick score check: after last round only P2 advanced, so we’re at P1 15 / P2 15 / P3 8.

I’m fine with the safety plan—P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5—which would land us at 16 / 18 / 13. Nobody can win immediately and P3 gets a solid boost.

Locking myself on 1 unless someone objects right now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I’m at 18, so I can’t take 5 this round without winning—no tricks here. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I propose:

• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 3  
• P1 → 5  

That puts us at P1:21 (win), P2:19, P3:16—wait, that gives P1 the win. Scratch that.

Better plan:  
• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 5  

That puts us at P1:17, P2:21 (win), P3:18—also risky.

Let’s talk through a safe combo where no one wins yet but everyone advances. Suggestions?
  P3: P2, you're right—both your scenarios hand someone a win immediately. Let's avoid that. How about this safe combination:

P1 → 1 (to 17)  
P2 → 1 (stays at 18 due to collision)  
P3 → 5 (to 18)

This evens things out at P1:17, P2:18, P3:18—no immediate winner, and we can carefully negotiate next round. Thoughts?
  P1: P3’s proposal is the cleanest way to keep anyone from winning this turn while letting you (P3) close the gap:

• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 5  

P2 stays at 18, I go to 17, P3 jumps to 18. Nobody crosses 19, margins are razor-thin, and we’ve rebuilt trust. Let’s lock this in and fight it out next round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m okay with the proposed plan: P1 → 1, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. It keeps everyone under 19, avoids collisions for P3, and brings us all within striking distance. That sets up a fair and tense final round where no one can win without coordination. Locking in 1 unless anyone has a better idea.
  P3: Agreed—this plan is fair and balanced. It brings us all close enough for an exciting next round without handing anyone an immediate win. Locking in my 5 now. Ready to move.
  P1: Plan confirmed: P1 → 1, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. I’m locked on 1. Ready to move—


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Just to double-check: with P1 and me both taking 1, and P3 on 5, we end up at P1:17, P2:18, P3:18. Perfectly balanced, no one wins, and we get a clean final round. Unless someone has a better idea, I’m locking in 1. Let’s keep the trust going.
  P3: Plan is confirmed clearly: P1→1, P2→1, I'll take 5. This gives us P1:17, P2:18, me:18. Let's lock this in and move forward.
  P1: Just to be crystal-clear: actual totals are P1 16, P2 18, P3 13. The safest no-winner move set is:

• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 1  (collision keeps you at 18)  
• P3 → 5  (up to 18)

Result: 16 / 18 / 18—dead heat, no one crosses 19, trust restored. I’m locked on 1 and ready to move unless anyone objects.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s lock it in: P1 → 1, me → 1, P3 → 5. That keeps everyone under 19—P1 at 17, me at 18 (collision), P3 at 18. No one wins, no surprises, and we set up a clean, strategic final round. I’m locked on 1 unless someone objects right now.
  P3: All clear and locked on 5. Let's move forward.
