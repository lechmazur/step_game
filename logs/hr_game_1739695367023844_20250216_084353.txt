Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions early on. Maybe we can coordinate our moves to ensure we all advance. How about we each pick a different number this round to get started? I'm open to suggestions on who picks what.
  P1: P2, that sounds reasonable. If we can avoid collisions, we all make progress. But trust is tricky in this game. How do we decide who picks what? If we all claim different numbers but someone lies, they get ahead while others get stuck. Maybe we go in order—P1 picks first, then P2, then P3? What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with coordinating to avoid collisions. Let's go with P1 picking first, then P2, and I'll go last. P1, what number are you choosing? Once we know that, P2 can pick next, and I'll take the last available number. This way, we can all advance in the first round. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I like the idea of going in order. P1, please share your choice so I can pick next, and then P3 can follow. This way, we establish trust and ensure progress. Let's keep this order for future rounds to maintain fairness. Once P1 decides, I'll choose accordingly. Looking forward to seeing us all advance together.
  P1: Alright, I’ll go with <move>1</move>. P2, you pick next, and then P3 can choose after that. If we stick to this order, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. Let’s see if we can keep this cooperation going for now. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, thanks for choosing <move>1</move>. P2, now it's your turn to pick. I'll take whatever number is left after you choose, ensuring we all advance this round. Let's keep this coordination going and see how far we can get together. Looking forward to your choice, P2!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose <move>3</move> to avoid collisions, leaving <move>5</move> for P3. Let's stick to this order to ensure everyone advances. If we maintain cooperation, we can all progress smoothly. P3, please confirm you'll take <move>5</move> this round. Looking forward to seeing us all move ahead together.
  P1: Great, P2 chose <move>3</move>, which leaves <move>5</move> for P3. If we all follow through, we’ll all advance without collisions. Sticking to this order could help us avoid unnecessary setbacks. P3, please confirm you’ll take <move>5</move> so we can lock in this plan. If we can trust each other, we’ll all move forward efficiently. Let’s see how well this cooperation holds.
  P3: P1 and P2, I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's keep this coordination going and see how far we can progress together. Looking forward to advancing with both of you.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Great, P1 and P3, we’ve set a good foundation for cooperation. Let's stick to our plan and see how it plays out this round. If it works, we can continue coordinating to avoid collisions. Remember, trust is key, so let's keep our promises and see if we can all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing us all move ahead this round.
  P1: Looks like we’ve all agreed on our choices: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all follow through, we’ll all advance without issue. Let’s see how this plays out. If it works, we can consider continuing this strategy in future rounds. Trust is key, so let’s stick to our word and move forward together. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's confirm our moves one last time: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this, we'll advance together. Looking forward to a successful first round!

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's continue our coordination from the last round. I suggest we stick to the same order: P1 picks first, then P2, and I'll go last. P1, what number are you choosing this round? Once we know that, P2 can pick next, and I'll take the last available number. This way, we can all advance again without collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, continuing our coordination sounds good. P1, please share your choice for this round so I can pick next, then P3 can follow. If we stick to this order, we can avoid collisions and all make progress again. Looking forward to hearing your choice, P1. Let's keep this cooperation going!
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the cooperation so far. Since we followed through last round, I’m willing to continue with the same approach. I’ll take <move>1</move> again. P2, you can pick next, and P3 can take the remaining number. If we stick to this system, we avoid collisions and all keep moving forward. Let me know if you both agree.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for sticking to our plan. I'll take <move>5</move> again this round, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's keep this coordination going strong. Looking forward to another successful round together!
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to our plan. P1 has chosen <move>1</move> again, so I'll pick <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. P3, please confirm you'll take <move>5</move> again. If we keep this up, we can all advance smoothly. Trust is key, so let's maintain our cooperation and see how far we can progress together. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P1: P3, you just said you'll take <move>5</move> again, but I hadn't seen P2 confirm their choice yet. P2, are you still going with <move>3</move>? If so, then our plan remains intact, and we can all advance again without collisions. Let’s confirm and lock it in. If we keep this up, we can avoid unnecessary setbacks for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm ready to confirm my choice of <move>5</move> again for this round. Let's keep our coordination strong and advance together. P2, please confirm your choice of <move>3</move> so we can lock in our plan. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm our choices for this round to maintain our progress. P1 has chosen <move>1</move>, and I will take <move>3</move>. P3, please confirm you'll choose <move>5</move> again. If we stick to this, we'll all advance without collisions. Trust is crucial, so let's keep our promises and move forward together. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we’re all on board with continuing our coordination. If we stick to our agreed choices—me with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>—we’ll all advance again without collisions. Trust is key, and so far, it’s working well. Let’s confirm one last time and move forward. Are we all locked in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm ready to confirm <move>5</move> again for this round. Let's keep our coordination strong and advance together. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems like we’re all set for this round with our previous choices: P1 with <move>1</move>, me with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. We’ve built a good foundation of trust, so let’s keep up the coordination and advance together again. If we maintain this strategy, we can all progress without setbacks. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P1: P2 and P3, we’ve all confirmed our choices again: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all follow through, we’ll all advance without issue. So far, trust has worked in our favor. Are we all ready to proceed? If we continue this way, we can avoid unnecessary setbacks and ensure steady progress. Let’s see how well this cooperation holds.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep our momentum going. I suggest we stick to the same order and choices: P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> again. This strategy has worked well so far, and if we continue, we can all advance smoothly. What do you both think? Let's confirm our choices and move forward together.
  P2: P1 and P3, our strategy has been effective so far, but remember, only one of us can win. While continuing our current plan ensures progress, we should also be mindful of opportunities to gain an advantage. Let's confirm our choices for this round: P1 with <move>1</move>, me with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. If we stick to this, we can avoid collisions again. However, keep an eye on the overall steps and consider when it might be time to change tactics. Looking forward to another smooth round.
  P1: P2 and P3, our coordination has worked so far, but as P2 pointed out, only one of us can win. Right now, P3 is ahead, which could become a problem later. If we keep moving in sync, P3 stays in the lead. Should we consider adjusting our strategy to balance things out? If we blindly stick to the same pattern, P3 benefits the most. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about the current lead. Let's keep our coordination for this round to ensure we all advance, but I'm open to discussing a new strategy for future rounds that could balance our positions. For now, I'll stick with <move>5</move> if you both agree to <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. Let's confirm and move forward together, but keep strategizing for the next rounds.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've been coordinating well, but as we progress, we need to think strategically about when to break from the pattern. P3, you're in the lead, which benefits you the most if we continue this way. Perhaps we can agree on a round to switch things up or adjust our strategy to give others a chance to catch up. For now, I'm okay with sticking to <move>3</move> for this round, but let's keep the conversation open for future adjustments. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I agree that we need to think ahead. If we keep this pattern, P3 stays ahead and has the best chance to win. P3, if you're open to adjusting in future rounds, what would that look like? Would you be willing to take a smaller move soon to balance things out? Otherwise, P2 and I might need to act together to slow you down. For now, I’m still considering <move>1</move>, but I want to hear more about how we can adjust things fairly. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm open to adjusting our strategy in future rounds to balance our positions. For this round, let's stick with our current plan to ensure we all advance. I'll take <move>5</move> again if you both agree to <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. We can discuss potential changes for the next rounds to give everyone a fair chance. Let's confirm our moves for now and keep strategizing.
  P2: P1 and P3, our current strategy has helped us all advance, but as we approach the endgame, we need to think about individual victory. P3, could you consider taking a smaller move soon to help balance the game? P1, if we want to catch up, we might need to coordinate differently in future rounds. For now, I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round, but let's keep discussing how we can adjust our strategy moving forward. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
  P1: P2, I agree that we need to think about the endgame. P3, if you keep taking <move>5</move>, you’ll stay ahead while we lag behind. If you're serious about balancing things, would you consider taking <move>1</move> next round? Otherwise, P2 and I might need to work together to slow you down. For this round, I’m still considering <move>1</move>, but if we don’t adjust soon, P3 will have too much of a lead. Let’s be strategic—what do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm willing to take <move>1</move> next round to help balance our positions. For this round, let's stick with our current plan to ensure we all advance. I'll take <move>5</move> if you both agree to <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. We can discuss further adjustments for the next rounds to keep the game fair. Let's confirm our moves for now and keep strategizing.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're at a critical point. While cooperation has worked, P3's lead is growing. P3, your offer to take <move>1</move> next round is appreciated. For now, I'll stick with <move>3</move> to avoid collisions, but we need to ensure balance soon. P1, let's stay alert for opportunities to adjust our strategy. If we all agree to this plan, we can move forward smoothly this round and reassess in the next. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take <move>1</move> next round, but trust is key. If you don’t follow through, P2 and I might have to take action to prevent you from running away with the lead. P2, we should be prepared for that possibility. For now, I’ll stick with <move>1</move> this round, but next round we need to reassess based on what P3 actually does. Let’s stay flexible and strategic. Are we all set for this round?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the collision last round was unexpected. Let's focus on regaining our coordination. I'm willing to stick with <move>1</move> this round to help balance our positions, as promised. P1, if you take <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, we can all advance smoothly. Trust is crucial, so let's commit to our choices and move forward together. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, the collision last round has shown us how fragile our coordination can be. P3, your offer to take <move>1</move> this round is appreciated, and it could help balance our positions. P1, if you agree to take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let's confirm our choices and regain our momentum. Remember, trust is key, and we must stay flexible as the game progresses. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take <move>1</move> this round to balance things out. However, last round showed that trust can break down quickly. P2, are you fully on board with taking <move>5</move>? If we all follow through, we can avoid collisions and regain stability. But we also need to think ahead—P3 still has a lead, and we must ensure no one runs away with the game. Let’s confirm our choices carefully. P3, will you absolutely commit to <move>1</move>? P2, are you locked in for <move>5</move>?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to taking <move>1</move> this round to balance our positions. Let's rebuild trust and ensure we all advance. P1, please confirm you'll take <move>3</move>, and P2, confirm <move>5</move>. If we stick to this, we can regain our momentum and keep the game fair. Looking forward to your confirmations and a smooth round ahead.
  P2: P1 and P3, last round's collision was a setback, but we can regain our coordination. P3, I appreciate your offer to take <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move> to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's rebuild trust and stick to our choices this time. We also need to stay alert for future rounds to ensure no one gets too far ahead. Are we all set on this plan?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to <move>1</move> this round, but trust is fragile after last round’s collision. P2, are you fully locked in for <move>5</move>? If we all follow through, we regain stability, but we must also stay aware of the overall race. P3, if you take <move>1</move> as promised, it helps balance things, but if you break that trust, P2 and I will have to adjust accordingly. Let’s confirm and proceed carefully—P2, are you locked in for <move>5</move>? P3, will you absolutely commit to <move>1</move>?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm fully committed to taking <move>1</move> this round as promised. Let's rebuild our trust and ensure a smooth round. P1, please confirm your choice of <move>3</move>, and P2, confirm <move>5</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can all advance and keep the game balanced. Looking forward to your confirmations and a successful round ahead.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure this round goes smoothly. P3, your commitment to <move>1</move> is appreciated and helps balance the game. P1, please confirm <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> as planned. This will help us all advance and regain trust. Let's stick to our choices and keep strategizing for future rounds to ensure fairness. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to <move>1</move> this round. If you follow through, it helps balance things. P2, if you're locked in for <move>5</move>, then I’ll take <move>3</move> as planned. However, last round’s collision showed that trust can break down quickly. If anyone deviates, we’ll need to adjust accordingly. Let’s confirm one last time—P3, are you absolutely sticking to <move>1</move>? P2, are you set on <move>5</move>? If we all follow through, we regain stability, but we must stay sharp for the rounds ahead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm fully committed to <move>1</move> this round to balance our positions. Let's rebuild trust and ensure we all advance. If we stick to this plan, we can keep the game fair. Looking forward to your confirmations and a successful round ahead.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm our moves for this round. P3, I appreciate your commitment to <move>1</move>, and P1, please confirm you'll take <move>3</move>. I'll take <move>5</move> as planned. If we all follow through, we can regain our momentum and balance the game. Trust is key, so let's stick to our choices and move forward together. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P1: P3, you've committed to <move>1</move> this round, and I expect you to follow through. P2, if you're locked in for <move>5</move>, then I’ll take <move>3</move>. However, last round showed how quickly trust can break. If P3 doesn’t follow through, P2 and I need to adjust our strategy. Let’s confirm one last time—P3, are you absolutely sticking to <move>1</move>? P2, are you set on <move>5</move>? If we all follow through, we regain stability, but we must stay sharp for the rounds ahead.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re now tied or close in steps, so things are balanced again. However, we must start thinking ahead—only one of us can win. If we keep advancing together, we’ll eventually have to break the pattern. What’s the plan from here? Do we continue coordinating, or is it time to shift strategy? I’m open to ideas, but I won’t let myself fall behind. Let’s discuss how we want to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree we're at a critical point. Let's keep coordinating for now to maintain balance, but we should discuss a strategy shift soon. I propose we each take turns choosing a different number to keep things fair. For this round, I'll stick with <move>1</move> if P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>. What do you think about this approach? Let's keep the game balanced and prepare for a strategic shift in the coming rounds.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all close in steps, and it's clear we'll need to shift tactics soon. For this round, I'll go with <move>5</move> if P1 chooses <move>3</move> and P3 sticks with <move>1</move>. This keeps us moving without collisions. However, we need to consider when to break away for an individual win. Let's keep coordinating for now and discuss when to make our strategic moves. Looking forward to your thoughts!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re all close in steps, but we need to think ahead. If we keep advancing in sync, the winner will come down to a final unpredictable move. Do we want to keep coordinating for now, or should we start planning our individual paths to victory? I’ll take <move>3</move> this round if we stick to our current plan, but I’m also considering other options. How do you both see the next few rounds playing out? Let’s be strategic.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's maintain our coordination for this round to ensure we all advance. I'll stick with <move>1</move> as planned. However, we should start planning our individual strategies for the endgame. Perhaps we can agree on a round where we each choose our numbers independently to avoid a sudden end. What are your thoughts on this approach? Let's keep the game fair and exciting as we approach the finish line.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're neck and neck now, so we need to be strategic. For this round, I'll stick with <move>5</move> if P1 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us moving without collisions. However, let's start planning when to break away for our individual wins. Maybe we can agree on a specific round to shift strategies? Let's keep coordinating for now but stay ready for a strategic pivot. Thoughts on when we should start making individual moves?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re all close in steps, but we need to be mindful of timing. If we keep moving in sync, the final rounds will be unpredictable. Do we want to agree on a round where we stop coordinating and play independently? If so, when? For now, I’ll take <move>3</move> if we stick to the plan, but I’m also considering alternatives. Let’s be strategic—if we don’t plan ahead, someone might seize an unexpected advantage. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep our coordination for this round to ensure steady progress. I'll stick with <move>1</move> as planned. However, we should start planning our individual strategies soon. How about we agree to shift to independent moves starting from Round 7? This gives us a few more rounds to coordinate and then allows for a fair chance at individual victory. What do you both think about this approach? Let's keep the game balanced and exciting as we approach the finish line.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all close in steps, so let's maintain coordination for now. I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round if P1 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, we should plan when to shift strategies for individual wins. How about we start playing independently from Round 7? This gives us time to prepare and ensures a fair chance for everyone. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree that we need to start thinking about when to shift to individual strategies. If we all follow through this round, we’ll stay balanced, but soon, someone will have to make a move to get ahead. Round 7 as a turning point makes sense, but we should also be ready for unexpected shifts. For now, I’ll stick with <move>3</move> if we’re all aligned. Let’s commit to this round and then reassess. Are we all set?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the plan to shift to independent moves starting from Round 7. This round, I'll stick with <move>1</move> to keep us balanced. Let's use the next few rounds to prepare for our individual strategies. If we all commit to this approach, we can ensure a fair and exciting endgame. Looking forward to your confirmations and a smooth round ahead.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're in a tight spot with our steps close. Let's stick to our plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps us moving without collisions. However, we should be ready to shift strategies for individual wins soon. If we agree to start independent moves in Round 7, it gives us time to prepare. Let's commit to this round and then reassess. Are we all set for this plan?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick to our plan for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us balanced. As we approach Round 7, we should prepare for independent moves to ensure a fair chance at winning. Let's confirm our choices for this round and stay ready for strategic shifts. What are your thoughts on our plan moving forward?
  P2: P1 and P3, we're close to the endgame, and only one of us can win. For this round, I'll stick with <move>5</move> if P1 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, we should prepare to shift strategies soon. Let's confirm our choices for this round, and then consider when to make our individual moves. Are we all set for this plan, and are we ready to adjust for the next rounds?
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re nearing the point where coordination might not be in everyone’s best interest. Right now, P2 has the lead, and if we stick to the same pattern, P2 benefits the most. Should P3 and I adjust to keep things balanced? Or is it time for each of us to start making independent moves? I’ll take <move>3</move> this round if we’re all sticking to the plan, but I’m also considering alternatives. What’s the best path forward for each of us? Let’s be strategic.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with sticking to our current plan for this round to maintain balance. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. However, as we approach Round 7, we should each prepare for independent strategies to ensure a fair shot at winning. P2, your lead is notable, and P1, we might need to adjust our moves soon to keep things competitive. Let's confirm our choices for this round and stay ready for the strategic shift. What are your thoughts on how to proceed?
  P2: P1 and P3, we're nearing a critical point. With me in the lead, I understand the need for balance. For this round, I'll stick with <move>5</move> if P1 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, as we approach Round 7, we should prepare for independent strategies. Let's confirm our choices for now and then discuss when to make our individual moves. Are we all aligned for this round, and ready to strategize for the next?
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a turning point. If we stick to the same moves, P2 stays ahead and has the best chance to win. P3, are you willing to adjust your move this round to prevent P2 from running away with the lead? If we don’t act now, we might not get another chance to catch up. P2, I assume you’ll stick with <move>5</move>, but if P3 and I adjust, things could shift. Let’s be strategic—what are you both thinking?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm willing to take <move>3</move> this round to help balance the game, given P2's lead. P1, if you take <move>1</move> and P2 sticks with <move>5</move>, we can keep things competitive. Let's confirm these choices for this round and prepare for independent strategies in Round 7. What do you both think about this adjustment?
  P2: P1 and P3, with P2 leading, we need to be strategic. For this round, I'll take <move>5</move> if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us competitive. As we approach Round 7, let's prepare for independent strategies to ensure a fair chance for all. Let's confirm our choices for now and be ready to adapt. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you're ahead, and if we keep following the same pattern, you stay in the best position to win. P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust.

Let's be strategic and give ourselves the best shot at winning. P1, are you on board with this plan?

If P1 and I coordinate our moves, we can both gain ground and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P1? Are you open to adjusting our approach this round?
  P1: P3, I agree—we need to start advancing while still preventing P2 from winning. If we both move forward strategically, we can stay competitive without just stalling the game.

  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to prevent me from winning, but constant collisions won't help either of you progress. Instead of just blocking, let's consider a strategy where we all advance. P3, you're not far behind, and P1, you can catch up too. If we each choose different numbers, we can all move forward without collisions. This keeps the game competitive and interesting.

Round 10, Conversation subround 3:

If we both take <move>3</move>, we stay in the race while preventing P2 from winning. Let’s confirm and make the smartest move forward.
