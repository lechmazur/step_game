Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2. First round, interesting choices. Anyone planning to go big with 5 right away? Good luck to us all.
  P2: "Let’s avoid 5s; 3 might be safer for everyone. Let’s not clash early."
  P1: Agreed, P2. Playing 3 keeps things safe and even for all of us. I’m on board with 3 this turn—shall we lock that in?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, you both seem set on 3. Seems like a safe start to avoid early clashes.
  P2: "Let’s stick with 3s to avoid collisions. I’ll go 3—safe and steady."
  P1: Still on 3—let’s lock that and keep things smooth for turn 1. Anyone changing? Otherwise, see you in the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, 3 it is then. Seems we have a consensus.
  P2: "Let’s not all pick 3—maybe 1 or 5 to advance. Let’s break the tie."
  P1: Alright, new plan: I’ll take 1 this turn.  
P3, you keep 3.  
P2, if you want to go 5, we all move and nobody collides—sounds fair? I’m locked on 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great—no clashes last time. Let’s keep that pattern: leader takes 1, middle 3, trailer 5.

So for this turn:  
• P2 (in front) picks 1  
• P3 (middle) picks 3  
• I (last) pick 5  

Keeps us collision-free and balances the gap. Agree?
  P2: "Let’s stick with 5 to keep the lead. No need to change the winning formula—safe and steady."
  P3: P2, sticking with 5 is bold, especially since P1 suggested playing 5 themselves in their plan. P1, are you still planning on 5 now that P2 has stated their intention? A collision between you two would let me advance if I pick something else, like 3. What are your thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, think this through: I’m seriously leaning toward 5 because I’m in last. If you also take 5, we collide and both stay put while P3 cruises ahead with 3. Why risk gifting P3 the lead? Safer for you to grab 1, let P3 take 3, and I’ll take 5—everyone moves, no crashes. Sound good?
  P2: "P1, if you take 1, I’ll take 5—no collision. Let’s keep moving. P3, stick with 3."
  P3: P1, P2 just suggested you play 1, while they stick to 5. P1, you previously wanted 5 because you're behind. P2 seems determined to play 5.

It sounds like you both want me to play 3. I'll plan on 3 for now, hoping you two can coordinate the 1 and 5 to avoid a collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, final chance: if you insist on 5, I’ll take 5 too and we both stall while P3 sails ahead. Switch to 1 and everyone advances cleanly (1-3-5). Your move. P3, stay on 3. I’m ready to collide if needed.
  P2: "Stick with 5. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. P3, keep 3. Let’s move forward—no need to risk a crash."
  P3: Okay, it seems P1 and P2 are still deciding between 1 and 5. As I said, I'll stick with 3 to hopefully avoid any collision involving me. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, that collision playing 5 didn't seem to work out for either of you last round, while I managed to slip ahead. Are you thinking of trying 5 again? If you both pick 5, you'll just collide again, and I can safely pick 1 or 3 to increase my lead. Perhaps one of you should choose a different number this time to avoid that?
  P2: "Let’s avoid 5 again. P1, take 1, I’ll take 3. P3, stick with 5. No collisions, everyone moves."
  P1: Let’s adopt a simple “leader-1 / middle-3 / trailer-5” rule each turn—keeps us clash-free and lets the pack stay together. Right now that means:

• P3 (ahead on 6) plays 1  
• P2 (next on 5) plays 3  
• I’m last on 1, so I take 5  

Next round we reorder again by standings. Everyone moves, nobody collides, gap shrinks. Fair?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 suggests 1 for me, P2 suggests 5. Both plans agree P2 plays 3.
P1, your plan gives P2 the lead and asks me to take only 1 - not ideal for me as the current leader.
P2, offering me 5 seems generous. Are you sure you're sticking to 3, or is this a setup for a collision on 5?
Given the conflicting suggestions for P1 (1 or 5) and myself (1 or 5), maybe 3 is the most sensible play for me this round to avoid potential collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: "Let’s avoid collision: P3, take 5. P1, take 1. I’ll handle 3. No clashes, everyone moves. Ready?"
  P1: P2, you’ve bounced between 3 and 5—make up your mind. I’m locking 1 and sitting out the fight. P3, 3 is probably your safest path if you believe P2 finally lands on 5. Either way, let’s just move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 is locked on 1. P2, you've consistently suggested 3 for yourself and 5 for me. P1 suggests 3 for me might be safer. Given the conflicting advice and the potential for a collision on 5 if you change your mind, P2, I think I'll stick with my plan to play 3. Let's see what happens.
  P2: "P1: 1, P3: 3, I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's move forward—safe for all."
  P1: P2, déjà vu: if you stick with 5, I’ll ALSO take 5 and we both stall again while P3 jogs ahead. Your only safe advance is 3. P3’s already on 3—take it or risk another crash. I’m finished talking.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s stick to 1-3-5: I’ll take 5, P3 take 3, P1 take 1. No collisions, everyone moves. Let’s keep it simple."
  P3: P2, your 1-3-5 plan conveniently gives you, the leader, the biggest jump with 5. P1, are you really okay with taking just 1 step when you're trailing?

How about this: P1, you take 5 to catch up. I'll take 3. P2, you can take 1 to ensure you still advance. This keeps the game closer. P1, does that sound better than P2's plan?
  P1: Simple: leader slows, trailer speeds, middle coasts. So  
• P2 (at 8) takes 1  
• P3 (6) takes 5  
• I take 3  

Distinct numbers, zero collision, tighter race. P2, if you insist on anything bigger than 1 again, I’ll just copy you like last time and we’ll both stall while P3 jogs ahead. Your call.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Your plan lets P3 leap. Let’s adjust: I take 5, P3 take 1, P1 take 3. No collisions, I stay ahead."
  P3: P2, your latest plan asks me to take 1 while you take 5 again. That doesn't seem fair since it just lets you run away with the lead.

P1's plan (P2=1, P3=5, P1=3) seems more balanced and avoids the collision P1 threatened you with. P1, are you still committed to 3 if P2 takes 1? P2, given P1's threat, taking 1 looks like your only way to guarantee moving forward this turn. I'm considering playing 5 based on P1's suggestion.
  P1: P2, last call: take 1 and we all move—P3 on 5, I’m on 3. Easy, collision-free.

But if you insist on 3 or 5, I will copy that exact number in the move phase and we’ll both sit while P3 gains. Your choice: crawl forward with 1, or stall again. 

P3, stick with 5 if P2 accepts 1; otherwise maybe switch to 1 so we both advance while P2 crashes. I’m set.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let’s lock in 1-3-5: I take 1, P3 take 5, P1 take 3. No collisions—safe for all. Final offer."
  P3: Okay, P2, glad you agree with P1's plan. It seems the most sensible way to avoid collisions this round. I'll plan on playing 5, assuming you stick to 1 and P1 sticks to 3. Let's see if we can all advance this time.
  P1: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Current standings rule: leader-1 / middle-3 / trailer-5 keeps us collision-free and tight.

So this turn:
• P3 (11) → 1  
• P2 (9) → 3  
• I (4) → 5  

Distinct numbers, everyone advances, gap narrows—simple.

P2, if you snatch anything but 3, I’ll copy you and we both stall (again).  
P3, 1 guarantees you at least some progress whatever P2 does.

Stick to 1-3-5 and let’s move.
  P2: "Let’s break the pattern: I’ll take 5 to overtake P3, P3 take 1, and P1 take 3. No collisions—everyone moves. P1, stick to 3; P3, 1 keeps you safe. Let’s advance."
  P3: P1, P2, you both suggest I play 1, which conveniently lets P2 take the lead if they play 5 as they suggested. P1, you've threatened to collide with P2 on 5 if P2 doesn't play 3. Given P2's stated intention to play 5, that collision seems likely based on past rounds. If you two collide, playing 3 looks like the best move for me to extend my lead. I'm leaning towards 3 unless P2 reconsiders playing 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: 3 is dangerous now—if P2 also lands on 3, you both stall and I jump 5. Grab 1: guaranteed progress, still in front whatever happens.

P2: 3 keeps you moving and avoids my collision threat. Choose 5 again and I’ll match it; we’ll both freeze while P3 moves.

I’m set on 5 unless you force a collision. Let’s finish: P3‐1, P2‐3, P1‐5.
  P2: "P1, I’ll take 3 to avoid collision. P3, stick to 1. Let’s move safely—no stalls. Your 5 risks another crash. This works for all."
  P3: Okay P2, you confirmed you'll play 3. P1, you warned me this would cause a collision between P2 and me, and you plan to play 5.

Honestly, a collision on 3 (leaving scores P1=9, P2=9, P3=11) looks better for me than letting P2 jump to 12 alongside me if I play 1 (P1=9, P2=12, P3=12). Preventing P2 from advancing seems worthwhile right now.

So, despite the warnings, I'm planning on 3 this round. Let's see if you both stick to your stated moves of P1=5 and P2=3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you just locked in 3—change to 5 and I’ll mirror, we both stall; change to 1 and you creep only 1. Stick to 3, it’s your best move.  
P3, you said 3 as well; colliding P2 keeps you ahead of me while denying P2 progress. Switching to 5 slams straight into me.  
I’m set on 5. Ready for moves.
  P2: P1, I'll take 1. P3, take 5. No collisions—safe moves for all. Let’s advance without risk.
  P3: P2, you changed your mind again at the last second, now suggesting you'll play 1 and I should play 5. This contradicts your previous confirmation of playing 3. Given P1 seems locked on 5, your suggestion of 5 for me looks like a setup for me to collide with P1, while you potentially play 1 or 3.

Sticking to my plan of playing 3 seems the most reliable way for me to potentially advance or at least mitigate risk, regardless of whether you actually play 1 or revert to 3. P1 is likely playing 5. I'm choosing 3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s break the cycle: P1 take 5, P3 take 1, I take 3. Safe moves—no collisions. P3, your 1 lets me advance without risk. P1, close the gap. Ready?"
  P1: Same deal as last round: if anyone (looking at you, P2) goes 5, I’ll mirror 5 and we both stall.  If nobody else touches 5, I’m happy to take it myself.  

P2: 3 is your only way forward; 5 guarantees you zero.  
P3: 3 either blocks P2 or moves you; 1 is risk-free progress.  

Pick wisely—ready when you are.
  P3: P1, your threat against P2 playing 5 seems consistent. P2, you suggested 3 for yourself. P1 also wants you to play 3.

If P1 plays 5 and P2 plays 3, P1's suggestion of 1 for me results in P1=14, P2=12, P3=12. P1 takes a strong lead.
If I play 3 again and collide with P2 (assuming P2 plays 3), the result is P1=14, P2=9, P3=11. This keeps me ahead of P2, but P1 still surges ahead.

Considering P2 played 3 last round despite suggesting otherwise late, a collision on 3 seems possible again. I'm considering 3 to prevent P2 from advancing alongside me. P1, are you definitely playing 5 if P2 plays 3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to 3, P3. Let P1 take 5. No collisions—everyone moves. Final plan."
  P1: Yes, P3—I mirror 5 ONLY if P2 picks 5. Otherwise I’m on 5.  

P3: 1 is safe progress; 3 risks a collision with P2 if he sticks to it. Your choice.  
P2: final warning—pick 5 and I crash into you again. 3 lets you move unless P3 blocks.  

Moves next.
  P3: Okay P2, you've confirmed you'll stick to 3. P1, you seem set on 5 if P2 avoids it.

This means if I also choose 3, P2 and I will collide, keeping P2 at 9 steps while I remain at 11. P1 would then advance to 14. Alternatively, if I choose 1, P1 still reaches 14, but P2 advances to 12 alongside me.

Blocking P2 seems strategically valuable, even if it lets P1 take the lead for now. I'm still weighing 1 vs 3 based on this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P3, take 1 to let me take 3. No collisions—safe moves for all. Final offer."
  P1: Lock time: I’m taking 5— unless anyone else picks 5, in which case I’ll mirror and we all sit.  

P2: 3 is your only real advance; touch 5 and you stall with me.  
P3: 1 keeps you in front whatever happens; 3 blocks P2 but risks a collision if he sticks to it.  

Choose as you like—moves next.
  P3: Okay, P1 seems set on 5, and P2 seems set on 3. P2, your final plea for me to play 1 so you can play 3 reinforces my belief you'll play 3.

As discussed, playing 1 lets you (P2) catch up to me, while playing 3 likely causes a collision between us, keeping you behind. Blocking you seems more valuable right now, even if P1 takes the lead. I'm leaning towards 3. Let's move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Reminder: I’m taking 5 — unless anyone else picks 5, in which case I mirror and we ALL stall.  

P2: 3 is your only solid advance; touch 5 and you freeze with me.  
P3: 1 gives you guaranteed progress; 3 blocks P2 while still keeping you ahead of him.  

Your choices. I’m locked.
  P3: P1, your plan seems clear: 5 for yourself unless challenged. P2, P1 suggests 3 for you, but that's risky. If I also choose 3 (like last round), we collide again, you stay at 9, I stay at 11, and P1 jumps to 19. That helps neither of us.

P2, playing 1 guarantees you advance to 10, avoiding a collision with me. I need to make up ground, so I am considering 3. If you play 1 and I play 3, P1 reaches 19, but I get to 14 and you get to 10. It's better than us both stalling.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions: I’ll take 1, P3 take 3. P1, your 5 risks a crash. Safe moves for all."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked on 5—repeat: if anyone else touches 5, I mirror and everybody on 5 stalls.  

P2: 1 is your only guaranteed advance; 3 risks colliding with P3 and leaving you at 9. Touch 5 and you freeze with me.  

P3: 1 gives you safe progress; 3 blocks P2 but keeps you behind me. Either way I’m fine.  

Make your picks; I’m done talking.
  P3: P2, P1 is locked on 5 and will reach 19 if successful, which is too close to the win. Letting that happen seems like a loss for both of us. P1 has stated they will mirror 5 if challenged. Stopping P1 seems necessary now. Your plan of 1 looks like safe progress for you in that scenario.
  P2: "Let’s block P1: P3, take 5 to collide with them. I’ll take 3 to advance. No more stalls—this ends their lead."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: Think it through. 
– If you join 5, you and I both stall while P2 cruises to 12, jumping ahead of you (11).  
– If you stick on 3 and collide with P2, he remains at 9, you stay 11—still in front of him.  

Blocking P2 on 3 costs you nothing and keeps him lagging. Your move.  

P2: reminder—touch 5 and we both freeze. 3 is your only shot.  

I remain on 5 unless challenged. Ready for moves.
  P3: Okay P1, your arguments against me playing 5 are noted, especially regarding P2 potentially overtaking me if you mirror. However, you reaching 19 this turn is simply too dangerous for both me and P2 to ignore. P2, your suggestion to block P1 aligns with this necessity.

Therefore, I have to strongly consider playing 5 to force the collision you promised, P1, and prevent you from getting within striking distance of the win. It's a risk, but letting you reach 19 seems like the greater risk for the rest of us. Let's move to the final phase.
  P2: "P3, stick with 5 to collide with P1. I'll take 3—final plan. No more stalls."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, that block on 5 worked to stop P1 last round. P1 is still close at 14. P2, you're at 12, I'm at 11.

P1, we have to assume you'll try for 5 again to get to 19. P2, are you willing to play 5 again to force another collision with P1? If you both collide on 5, I will play 3. This stops P1, keeps you at 12, and puts me at 14, tying P1. It seems necessary to prevent P1 from running away with it. What are your thoughts?
  P2: "Let’s collide on 5 to stop P1. If we both pick 5, P1 stalls, and we keep them at 14. Your move, P3."
  P1: P2, déjà vu: every time P3 shouts “both on 5,” he bails to 3 and you freeze alone. He’s lining up the same trap right now.

I’m staying on 5; anyone else on 5 just stalls with me. If you actually want to move, take 3 and make P3 decide between a safe 1 or crashing into you again on 3.

Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your attempt to divide us is obvious. You don't want to be blocked on 5.

P2, sticking to 5 is our best chance to stop P1 from reaching 19. If you switch to 3, P1 cruises ahead. I'm still planning on 3. Let's execute the block we discussed.
  P2: "Let’s stick to 3 and 5: P3 take 3, I take 5. P1 stalls, you advance. No more risks—final plan."
  P1: Same deal, folks:

• I’m taking 5— UNLESS anyone else touches 5, in which case every 5 stalls.  
• P2: 5 guarantees you zero; 3 lets you move (unless P3 blocks).  
• P3: you just lost a whole turn by blocking; another stall drops you further behind. Grab the safe 1, let P2 risk 3, and everyone advances.

Your calls.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your arguments are noted, but stopping you from reaching 19 is the priority for both me and P2.

P2, your last message confirmed you'll take 5 to block P1, while I take 3. This seems like the best plan to prevent P1's win and allow me to advance. I'll stick with 3 based on your commitment to 5. Let's execute this.
  P2: P3, commit to 3. I'll take 5 to collide with P1. Let's stop their lead now.
  P1: P2: Look what “blocking P1 on 5” has done for you so far—two straight zero-moves while P3 edges closer. If you park on 5 again you stay at 12 while P3 jumps to 14 and you’re dead last. Take 3, move to 15, stay in the race.

P3: Stick with 3 and you tie me at 14; pick 5 and you stall yet again – you’d still trail whatever P2 does. Why hand him second place?

I’m keeping the same rule: I play 5 unless someone else also chooses 5, in which case every 5 stalls. Your call.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's collide on 5 to stop P1. I'll take 5—join me, and we end their lead. Your move.
  P1: My standing rule still applies: I’m on 5—unless someone else also picks 5, in which case every 5 stalls.  

P2, you’ve promised 5 before and then jumped to 3 at the last second.  
P3, if you truly want to block me, don’t rely on him: cover 5 yourself.  

Decide what’s best.
  P3: P1 is at 19. A successful 5 wins the game for them. That cannot happen. P2, you suggested colliding on 5. P1 wants me to play 5. The block on 5 is essential for both of us to stay in the game. I will prioritize ensuring P1 does not get 5 points this turn, even if it means stalling myself.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let's collide on 5 to stop P1. I'll take 5—join me, and we end their lead. Your move.
  P1: Reminder: if even ONE of you backs off 5, I take 5 alone and win the game on the spot. So you’d better BOTH lock 5 to block me—anything else is suicide. Your move.
  P3: P1, you're right, relying on P2 alone is risky given past rounds. P2, you suggested 5. To absolutely ensure P1 doesn't win with 5 this turn, I will join you and also play 5. We both must stick to 5 to stop P1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, let's stick to 5 to block P1. I'll take 5—no backing down. If we both commit, P1 can't win this turn. Don't let them surge ahead.
  P1: I’m not gambling the game on another 5-stall. I’m shifting to 1 this turn—20 keeps me in front while you two scrap. Crash on 5 again if you like, or collide on 3; either way I stay ahead and have match-point next round. Your move.
  P3: P1, switching to 1 is a clever move to avoid the 5-collision while getting to 20. But we can't let you get that close. P2, the plan must change. Blocking P1 is paramount.

Since P1 claims they will play 1, I will also play 1 to force a collision and keep them at 19. This is necessary to prevent P1 from reaching 20.

P2, this means you should be safe to play 3 or 5 to advance while P1 and I collide. Your choice.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m happy creeping by 1 again (to 20) while you two sort it out.

P2: 3 still looks like your best shot—gets you to 17, keeps you in striking range. If you touch 5 and I mirror, you stall again.

P3: another stall on 5 leaves you stuck at 11 while P2 sails past. Take a safe 1, or hop on 3 if you’d rather block him.

Your choices. I’ll stay out of your collision lanes this turn.
  P2: P3, let's avoid collision: I take 5, you take 1. Advance safely. Your move.
  P3: P2, P1 claiming 1 is almost certainly a bluff. They are at 19 and will try to win with 3 or 5. Your suggestion for you to play 5 is the best way to stop P1, forcing the collision P1 threatened if they also play 5.

If you stick to 5 and collide with P1, I will take 3. This stops P1 from winning this turn (P1=19, P2=13) and lets me advance (P3=14). This seems like the necessary move to prevent P1's immediate victory. Stick to 5, P2.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Enough dance. I’m slamming 5 this turn and ending it at 24. The ONLY way to stop me is if BOTH of you also pile onto 5; one blocker alone does nothing. Slide to 3 or 1 and I cross 21, game over. Double-team 5 or concede.
  P2: P3, commit to 5—only way to block P1. Let’s collide and stop them. Your move.
  P3: P1, your message is clear. Winning is the only acceptable outcome for you right now.

P2, you've committed to 5. I agree this is the only way to stop P1 from winning this turn. If either of us chooses 1 or 3, P1 wins with 5. We absolutely must both play 5. I will play 5. Don't switch. Let's force the stall and reassess next round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, double-5 freezes you at 11 while P2 stays ahead. Switch to 3:  

• If P2 really plays 5, he stalls with me, you jump to 14 and overtake him.  
• If P2 chickens to 3 (history says he might), you both collide and I stall—no one loses ground.  

Either way 3 is strictly better for you than another pointless 5.  

P2, if P3 abandons 5 you’re the only one left frozen—take 1 or 3 and stay alive.  

I remain on 5, mirroring any other 5. Your call.
  P2: P3, stick to 5—only way to block P1. If we both collide, they can't win. Don’t let them surge!
  P3: P1, your attempt to split P2 and me by suggesting I play 3 is transparent. You know the only way to stop your win is if we both play 5.

P2, ignore P1's final plea. We must both stick to 5. If either of us deviates, P1 wins immediately. I am locked on 5. Let's force the stall and continue next round.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're one step away from winning if you land 3 or 5. P2 and I cannot let that happen. Last round's failure to coordinate the block on 5 led to P1 playing 3 and getting away with it (almost).

P2: We must block both 3 and 5 this turn. I propose you take 3, and I will take 5.
- If P1 plays 3, you block them (P1=19), I reach 21 and win.
- If P1 plays 5, I block them (P1=19), you reach 16.
- If P1 plays 1, they reach 20, you reach 16, and I reach 21 and win.

This covers P1's winning moves and gives me a path to victory while ensuring P1 is blocked. P2, are you with me on this plan? You take 3, I take 5.
  P2: P2: "Agreed. I take 3; block P1’s 5. Let’s make this work—no letting them win."
  P1: P2, do the math: P3 is on 16—his “blocking” 5 lands him exactly at 21 and he wins while you sit at 13. Your 3 blocks nothing. If he stays on 5 you MUST also pick 5 and crash, or swap so he takes 3. Letting him solo-5 hands him the game. I’m content to inch 1 and watch you decide.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your attempt to make P2 block me on 5 is transparent. You want to avoid being blocked yourself on either 3 or 5.

P2, stick to the plan: you play 3, I play 5.
- If P1 plays 1 or 3, I win.
- If P1 plays 5, I block P1, and you advance to 16.
This plan stops P1 from winning *and* gives us a chance. P1 wants you to play 5 so they can potentially win with 3. Don't fall for it. Stick to 3.
  P2: P3, stick to 3. Let’s block P1’s 5 and advance. Don’t let P1’s bluff divide us.
  P1: P2, wake up: P3’s “plan” hands him the game. Solo-5 → 21 and you lose on the spot.  
Your 3 blocks nothing. The only safe play is to SIT ON 5 with him—force the crash. I’ll stay off 5 entirely.  

Scenario check:  
• You + P3 both on 5 → both freeze, I inch elsewhere, nobody wins.  
• You on 3, P3 on 5 → he wins, you lose.  
• You on 5, P3 chickens to 3 → they collide, you still block him.

Park on 5 and keep the game alive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your last message was confusing ("P3, stick to 3"). Let's be clear: The plan was YOU play 3, I play 5. This blocks P1 if they play 3 (you block) or 5 (I block), AND gives me a win if P1 plays 1 or 3.

P1 desperately wants you to play 5 to block *me*, likely so they can sneak a win with 3. Don't fall for it. Stick to the plan: You play 3, I play 5. This is our best shot to stop P1 and potentially win. I am playing 5.
  P2: P3, your plan lets P1 win with 3. Let’s block both: I take 5, you take 3. This stops them.
  P1: Same standing rule: if anyone else picks 5, I’ll match it and every 5 stalls.  

P2 – last chance: choose 5 and you freeze with me while P3 walks; swap to 3 and at least you advance (or block him). Your history says 3 is your lane—stick to it.

P3 – 3 still guards your lead over P2; 5 is pointless if P2 bails and collides with me.

I’m done talking.
