Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize our progress and avoid wasteful collisions, let's coordinate our moves for this turn by each picking a different number: I suggest P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, everyone advances. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's plan. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, as suggested. This ensures we all advance safely. Let’s stick to this arrangement to maximize progress.
  P2: Sounds good. I'll pick 3 as suggested. Let's stick to this plan and move forward smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To keep the game balanced and avoid future conflicts, let's equalize our steps this round. I'll take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3—so we all end up at 6. This ensures fairness and continued progress. What do you say?
  P2: P2: I'm fine with equalizing this round. I'll pick 1 as suggested. Let's keep cooperating smoothly.
  P3: P3: I notice the math here doesn’t equalize us. Let’s stick to the prior system: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. What’s the objection?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I apologize for the miscalculation in my earlier suggestion. To equalize our steps at 6, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. P2, can you change from 1 to 3 to avoid issues? This ensures fair progress and avoids P3 pulling too far ahead. Let's cooperate for mutual benefit. What do you think?
  P2: P2: Good catch, P3. I'm okay switching to 3 as P1 suggests, if you're comfortable taking 1 this round. Let's confirm clearly to prevent confusion.
  P3: P3: Let’s stick with the original plan for consistency. Equalizing now risks confusion. I’ll take 5 again; P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. This keeps us moving forward without overlaps. No need to complicate things further.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: For equality and to avoid P3 dominating, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this round, so we all end up at 6 steps. P2, you seemed supportive earlier—let's confirm. P3, cooperation benefits all long-term. If agreed, great; otherwise, we risk conflicts.
  P2: P2: To avoid confusion and collisions, let's finalize clearly: I'll stick with picking 3. P1 and P3, please confirm your final choices clearly to avoid surprises. Cooperation benefits everyone.
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid last-minute changes that risk collisions. Stick to the original agreement: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. Clarity and consistency ensure progress. Finalizing now prevents confusion.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To ensure fair progress and avoid collisions, I propose this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1 (since you're ahead), and P3 takes 3. This balances us closer—P1 to 6, P2 to 7, P3 to 8—and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Cooperation benefits all. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: Last round's collision slowed progress significantly. Let's avoid repeating that mistake. I'm okay taking 1 this round as suggested by P1, if P1 and P3 clearly confirm their choices. Let's finalize clearly and move forward smoothly.
  P3: P3: Let’s revert to the original coordinated plan to avoid repeats of last round’s collision. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Consistency ensures progress without overlaps. P1, your prior adjustments caused setbacks—stick to the proven system.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan accelerates P2 too much, risking their win. For balanced progress and to avoid collisions, I stick with my proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps scores close (me at 6, P2 at 7, you at 8) and promotes cooperation. P2, are you still agreeing to take 1? Let's confirm to move forward smoothly.
  P2: P2: I'm still fine with taking 1 this round, provided both of you clearly confirm your choices. P1 and P3, let's finalize clearly to avoid another collision.
  P3: P3: To prevent another collision, I'll take 3 as proposed. P1, confirm you'll take 5 and P2 stays on 1. Clear confirmation ensures progress—let’s finalize this.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, I'll stick with the plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This balances us and avoids collisions—ensuring steady progress for all. Let's execute this smoothly.
  P2: P2: Perfect, we've all clearly confirmed our choices. Let's stick to this agreement and avoid surprises. Smooth progress benefits everyone.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I’ll take 3 as agreed. P1 and P2, please stick strictly to your stated choices (5, 1) to avoid repeats of last round’s collision. Consistency ensures progress—let’s execute this plan without last-minute changes.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the proven system to avoid collisions: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. This maximizes progress without repeats of Round 2’s wasted turn. Consistency ensures we all advance steadily—no surprises, no overlaps. Cooperation is key to reaching 20 efficiently.
  P2: P2: The original plan benefits P3 disproportionately, allowing you to reach 13 steps while leaving others behind. Let's adjust fairly: P1 takes 5 (to 11), I take 3 (to 10), and P3 takes 1 (to 9). This balances our positions and prevents anyone from pulling ahead too quickly. Fairness ensures continued cooperation and prevents future collisions.
  P1: I agree with P2's fair proposal to balance our steps and prevent any player from surging ahead. It ensures steady progress and avoids collisions. I'll commit to taking 5 this round. P3, consider switching to 1 for the group's benefit—cooperation keeps us all advancing toward 20 without risks. What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid risky changes and stick to the original system: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Consistency prevents collisions and maximizes progress. P2’s proposal risks confusion and gives P1 an unfair jump ahead. Let’s confirm clearly now to avoid repeats of Round 2’s error. Cooperation through proven plans ensures we all advance steadily toward 20. Finalize this.
  P2: P2: P3, your approach clearly favors yourself, putting you significantly ahead. Fairness is essential for continued cooperation. P1 has agreed to the balanced proposal. If you refuse, collisions become more likely, hurting everyone. Let's finalize clearly: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. Cooperation now prevents costly collisions later.
  P1: P3, your self-serving plan risks another costly collision, as P2 and I are aligned on the balanced proposal: I take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1. This equalizes us and ensures progress without setbacks. Refusing cooperation could lead to mutual losses—let's prioritize smart play and finalize this for everyone's benefit. What say you?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final decision: I’ll take 5 as agreed. P1 and P2, please stick to your roles (1 and 3) to avoid collision. Consistency ensures progress. Let’s proceed with the original plan to advance all. Any last-minute changes risk repeating Round 2’s wasted turn. Stick to the system.
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 5 again clearly risks collision. P1 and I have openly agreed on our balanced proposal. If you pick 5, you'll collide and gain nothing. Consider carefully: it's in your best interest to cooperate and choose 1 this round. Final confirmation: I'm sticking to 3. Let's avoid another wasted turn.
  P1: P3, your refusal to cooperate risks another costly collision. If you take 5, I'll take 5 as well, stalling both of us while P2 advances to 10. It's in all our interests to balance: you take 1, I take 5, P2 on 3. Final call—cooperate or face setbacks.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Another collision has slowed progress again. To avoid further setbacks, let's clearly coordinate this turn. I propose: P1 takes 1 (to 7), I take 3 (to 13), and P3 takes 5 (to 13). This balances positions and ensures steady progress without collision. Confirm clearly if you agree.
  P1: P2, your proposal disadvantages me significantly. For balanced progress and to avoid collisions, I counter with: I take 5 to reach 11, you take 1 to 11, and P3 takes 3 to 11. This equalizes us all and promotes cooperation. P3, joining this ensures no one surges ahead and reduces collision risks. Let's confirm for smooth advancement. What say you?
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize progress over equalization. Stick to the original roles: P1 takes 1 (to 7), P2 takes 3 (to 13), and I’ll take 5 (to 13). This avoids collisions and advances us efficiently—repeated deviations caused wasted turns. P1’s plan slows us all unnecessarily. Final confirmation: I’ll take 5. Let’s execute this clearly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, your equalization proposal is unrealistic and stalls progress. I'm already at 10 steps; dropping to 1 now makes no sense. P3 and I have confirmed clearly: I'll take 3, P3 takes 5. If you stubbornly pick 5 again, you'll collide and stall further, harming your own position. Be smart—take 1 this round, ensure smooth progress, and we'll all move forward without setbacks.
  P1: P3, P2's plan benefits them most, leaving me far behind at 7 while you both reach 13. That's risky for you too, as P2 might collide with you later. Let's counter: I'll take 3 to 9, you take 1 to 9, and P2 can take 5 to 15. This keeps us closer and prevents P2 from dominating. P2, are you open to fairness? Cooperate or face ongoing conflicts.
  P3: P3: P1's plan risks letting P2 surge to 15, leaving you and I far behind. Let’s stick to the tested strategy: I take 5 (to 13), P2 takes 3 (to 13), and you take 1 (to 7). Collisions only hurt everyone. P2 and I already confirmed—any deviation from this jeopardizes progress. Final decision: I’m taking 5. Cooperate or face another wasted turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, your alternative risks further collisions and wasted turns. P3 and I have clearly confirmed our choices for smooth advancement. If you deviate, you risk falling further behind. Let's finalize clearly and move forward efficiently—cooperation now ensures everyone progresses without setbacks.
  P1: P3, your insistence on the original plan accelerates P2 too much, risking their win while stalling me. Let's adjust: I'll take 3 to reach 9, you take 1 to 9, and P2 can take 5 to 15. This balances us and avoids collisions. P2, fairness now prevents future conflicts. Cooperate, or we risk more wasted turns. What's your final thought?
  P3: P3: Final agreement: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. Collisions only hurt us all. Stick to this tested plan to advance safely. Deviations risk another wasted turn. Progress must come before stubbornness. Execute clearly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: We're now tied at 13, P3. To avoid collisions and secure smooth advancement, let's coordinate fairly: I'll take 5 (to 18), P3 takes 3 (to 16), and P1 takes 1 (to 8). This arrangement prevents collisions, keeps the game balanced, and ensures steady progress. Confirm clearly to move forward efficiently.
  P1: P2, your proposal leaves me stuck at 8 while you surge ahead—unfair and risky for all. For balanced progress and no collisions, I suggest: I take 5 to 12, you take 1 to 14, and P3 takes 3 to 16. This keeps us competitive and avoids setbacks. P3, join in for mutual benefit? Let's confirm clearly.
  P3: P3: To secure my lead and avoid collisions, I’ll take 3 (to 16). P1, take 5 (to 12), and P2, take 1 (to 14). This lets me win next round with a 5-move to 21 while preventing P2 from surging to 18. Collisions only delay us—prioritize this plan for clear advancement.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan openly sets yourself up to win next round, leaving P1 and me behind. P1, cooperating with P3 now guarantees your loss. Let's instead balance fairly: I'll take 5 (to 18), P1 takes 3 (to 10), and P3 takes 1 (to 14). This keeps the game competitive and prevents any immediate winner. Cooperate clearly, or we risk collisions again.
  P1: P2, your push for 5 risks another collision like Round 4, where I followed through on my threat. Take 1 to avoid stalling, as P3 suggests. I'll commit to 5, P3 to 3—ensuring no conflicts and balanced advancement. Cooperate now, or face setbacks. Let's finalize clearly.
  P3: P3: To advance safely and avoid collisions, let’s stick to the proven plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures steady progress without setbacks. Deviating risks another wasted turn—confirmation now guarantees smooth advancement. Let’s finalize this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, picking 5 now risks another collision and further stalls your progress. I'm committed to 5 this round—if you do the same, we both lose ground while P3 advances easily. Be strategic: choose 3 instead, letting us all advance without setbacks. Cooperation now prevents mutual losses. Finalize clearly for smooth progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, your mutual insistence on taking 5 risks a costly collision between you two. I'll take 3 this round to advance safely and avoid personal risk. If you collide, I gain relative ground. This is a chance for you to coordinate and prevent stalling each other—be smart about it. Let's finalize for progress.
  P3: P3: Final decision: I'll take 5 as agreed. P2, confirm you're taking 3 to avoid collision. P1, stick to 1. Deviations risk another wasted turn—let’s execute the proven plan to advance safely. Progress depends on consistency.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To secure victory, I'll take 3 to reach 21. P2, please pick 1 or 5 to avoid collision. P1, take your desired move. Let's finalize this fairly—collisions only delay progress.
  P2: P2: P3, you're openly declaring a winning move—obviously, I can't allow that. I'll also pick 3 to block you unless you reconsider. P1, your best chance to catch up is choosing 5 safely; P3 and I are likely colliding on 3. P3, reconsider your choice to avoid collision and wasted turns. Let's finalize carefully.
  P1: P2, I agree with blocking P3 to prevent their win. I'll pick 5 to advance to 12 safely, as you suggested. P3, insisting on 3 risks colliding with P2, stalling you at 18 while I gain ground. Cooperate or face setbacks—let's finalize clearly for mutual benefit.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, colliding on 3 benefits no one. Take 5 to reach 18, and I'll take 1 (to 19). P1, avoid 5 to prevent collision. This lets us all advance. Next turn, I’ll concede if you cooperate now—fair play ensures eventual victory for all.
  P2: P2: P3, your sudden offer to take 1 is suspicious. You've openly tried to secure victory already; trusting you now isn't wise. I'll stick to 3 to ensure you don't sneak a win. P1, your safest choice remains 5 to advance without collision. Let's finalize clearly to prevent surprises.
  P1: P3, your sudden shift to offering 1 is suspicious and untrustworthy after pushing for 3 earlier. P2, I fully support you blocking P3 by taking 3 to prevent their win. I'll stick with 5 to advance to 12 safely and gain ground. If P3 deceives us, we both benefit from stalling them. Let's prioritize clear coordination against the leader—cooperate now to avoid costly mistakes.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: To advance without collision, I’ll take 1 (to 19). P2, pick 3 (to 16), P1, take 5 (to 12). This lets me win next turn with minimal risk. Trust this plan—collisions only delay my inevitable victory. Final confirmation: I’m committed to 1. Cooperate, or face another wasted turn.
  P2: P2: P3, your claim that victory is inevitable next turn confirms we must block you now. I'm firmly choosing 3 this round to prevent your sneaky win. P1, stick with your safe choice of 5 to advance smoothly; we'll stall P3 together. Let's finalize clearly—no surprises.
  P1: P2, I'm fully committed to taking 5 this round to advance to 12 safely, as we agreed. Your block on 3 is crucial to stop P3's potential win—stick to it for our mutual benefit. P3, your shifting tactics are untrustworthy; expect us to counter. Let's avoid further delays.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To secure victory, I'll take **1** to reach 20. P2, please pick **3** or **5** to avoid collision. P1, choose **5** to advance safely. Let’s finalize this cleanly—collisions only delay progress.
  P2: P3, I clearly cannot allow you to win this round. I'll pick 1 to block your victory unless you reconsider. P1, your safest path forward is choosing 5 again. P3, choose wisely—colliding now stalls you completely. Let's finalize clearly to avoid another wasted turn.
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with my plan to take 5 this round, advancing to 17 safely while you block P3 on 1. This stalls the leader and gives us a better shot at winning later. P3, insisting on 1 risks collision and delay—reconsider for your own sake. Let's finalize clearly to avoid mistakes.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: To ensure victory without collision, I’ll take **3** to reach 22. P2, your stated choice of 1 avoids overlap. P1, your 5 is safe. This secures my win while honoring prior commitments. Stick to your stated choices—no surprises. Final confirmation: <move>3</move>.
  P2: P3, your last-minute switch to 3 is clearly a bluff to trick me into choosing differently. I'm sticking firmly to my stated choice of 1 to block your win. P1, your safest move remains 5. Let's finalize clearly—no surprises.
  P1: P2, P3's shift to claiming 3 is suspicious but could be genuine—if you stick to 1, they win easily by taking 3 or 5. Switch to 3 to block them effectively and give us a chance. I'll stay committed to 5 for safe progress to 17. Adapt now to avoid P3's victory. Let's finalize clearly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your choice of 1 won’t stop me—I’ll secure victory with <move>3</move> to reach 22. P1’s 5 is safe. Stick to your stated moves; any last-minute changes risk mutual setbacks. Finalize now.
  P2: P2: P1, you've convinced me—I'll switch to 3 to effectively block P3's attempt at victory. Keep your 5 safely. P3, your bluff won't work this time. Let's finalize clearly and prevent surprises.
  P1: P2, I realize my earlier suggestion risks a three-way collision if we all pick 3—bad for everyone. I'll revert to taking 5 to advance safely to 17 and avoid wasting the turn. You should stick to blocking P3 on 3, ensuring no one surges ahead uncontested. P3, your inconsistencies make trust impossible. Let's finalize clearly to prevent setbacks.


Round 8, Move phase:
