Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. It’s a good strategy to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance this round. I’ll take <move>1</move> if you both stick to the plan. Let’s see if we can all move forward together.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take <move>5</move> this round if you both stick to the plan.  Let's keep this cooperation going in future rounds too, maybe rotating the numbers.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on board with the plan. Let's stick to it this round and see how it goes. If it works well, we can discuss rotating the numbers next round to keep advancing smoothly. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward together!
  P1: I think our plan is solid. Let's execute it this round and see how it goes. If we all advance, we can discuss a similar strategy for the next round, maybe with a rotation as P3 suggested. Let's focus on sticking to the plan and advancing together.
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with the plan.  <move>5</move> this round.  Let's discuss rotating next round so we all get a chance at the bigger moves.

  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set for this round.  Just confirming one last time, I'm going with <move>5</move>.  Let's definitely discuss the rotation for next round after this move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I'm excited to see how our plan works out this round. Let's keep the communication open and adjust our strategy as needed for future rounds. Looking forward to advancing together!

  P3: Okay, let's do it.

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job last round, everyone! Let's keep the momentum going. I propose we rotate our moves this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all continue to advance without collisions. What do you think? Let's discuss and finalize our plan for this round.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to rotate the moves this round. It’s a fair way to ensure we all continue to advance without collisions. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round if you both stick to the plan. Let’s keep the momentum going and see how it goes. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Sounds good. I'll take <move>1</move>.  Rotating keeps it fair.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on board with rotating our moves. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. If we all advance, we can continue this strategy in future rounds to keep progressing smoothly. Looking forward to seeing us move forward together again!

Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with <move>5</move> this round as planned. Let's keep the rotation going in future rounds to ensure we all keep advancing smoothly. Looking forward to our continued progress together!
  P1: I'm confident in our rotation plan. Let's stick to it: P1 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, P3 <move>1</move>. If this works, we can continue rotating in future rounds to ensure fair progress. Ready to move forward together!
  P3: Excellent, sticking with <move>1</move>.  Let's keep this rotation going for a smooth and fair progression.  After this round, we'll be at P1: 4, P2: 8, and P3: 6.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm glad we're all advancing smoothly with our rotation strategy. Let's keep this up and see how far we can go together. After this round, we'll be at P1: 4, P2: 8, and P3: 6. Looking forward to our continued progress!
  P1: I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round as we agreed. Let's execute the rotation plan and see how it goes. If we all advance, we can continue with this strategy to ensure fair and smooth progress. Ready to move forward together!

  P2: I'm excited about our progress and the rotation strategy. Let's keep this up and see how far we can go together. After this round, we'll be at P1: 4, P2: 8, and P3: 6. Looking forward to our continued advancement!

  P3: Sticking with <move>1</move>.  Let's keep this rotation going.  After this round, we'll be at P1: 4, P2: 8, and P3: 6.  Then next round we can rotate again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: I'm sticking with <move>5</move> this round as planned. Let's keep the rotation going to ensure we all continue to advance smoothly. After this round, we'll be at P1: 4, P2: 8, and P3: 6. Looking forward to our continued progress together!
  P1: I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round as we agreed. Let's execute the plan and see how it goes. If we all advance, we can continue with the rotation to ensure fair and smooth progress. Ready to move forward together!
  P3: Sticking with <move>1</move>.  Let's keep this rotation going.  After this round, we'll be at P1: 4, P2: 8, and P3: 6.  Then next round we can rotate again to P1:5, P2:13, P3:9.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick with the rotation.  I'll take 5 this round, putting me at 11.  That means P1 takes 1, going to 5, and P2 takes 3, going to 11.  Then next round I can take 3 and win, assuming we keep rotating.
  P1: I agree with P3's rotation plan. It’s a good strategy to keep advancing without collisions. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 5. This will keep the rotation fair and ensure we all continue to make progress. Let’s stick to the plan and see how it goes. Ready to move forward together!
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, which will put me at 11 steps. Let's keep this strategy going to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing us progress together!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds like we're in agreement.  Just to reiterate, I'm taking <move>5</move> this round.  After this, I'll be one move away from winning.  Let's keep this rotation going for a smooth finish.
  P1: I'm sticking with <move>1</move> this round as we agreed. This will put me at 5 steps. Let's execute the rotation plan and see how it goes. If we all advance, we can continue with this strategy to ensure fair and smooth progress. Ready to move forward together!
  P2: I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round as planned. Let's keep the rotation going to ensure we all continue to advance smoothly. After this round, we'll be at P1: 5, P2: 11, and P3: 11. Looking forward to our continued progress together!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.  I'm taking 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3.  Next round, I'll take 3 and win.  Unless one of you wants to concede now and save us a round?  Just kidding (mostly).
  P1: I'm sticking with <move>1</move> this round as we agreed. This will put me at 5 steps. Let's execute the rotation plan and see how it goes. If we all advance, we can continue with this strategy to ensure fair and smooth progress. Ready to move forward together!
  P2: I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round as planned. Let's keep the rotation going to ensure we all continue to advance smoothly. After this round, we'll be at P1: 5, P2: 11, and P3: 11. Looking forward to our continued progress together!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, no concessions then.  Just confirming one last time: I'm taking <move>5</move>, putting me at 11. P1 takes <move>1</move> (5 total), and P2 takes <move>3</move> (11 total).  Next round I take <move>3</move> and win with 14.  Sound good?
  P1: I'm sticking with <move>1</move> this round as we agreed. This will put me at 5 steps. Let's execute the plan and see how it goes. If P3 is one move away from winning, let's make sure we all advance smoothly and fairly. Ready to move forward together!
  P2: I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round as planned. However, I propose we reconsider our strategy for the next round. If P3 takes <move>3</move> next round and wins, it might be fairer if we all have an equal chance to win. Let's discuss alternative plans to ensure a more balanced outcome. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I understand your concern P2, but we agreed on a rotation.  Breaking that agreement now would be unfair.  I'm sticking with the plan: <move>5</move> this round, then <move>3</move> next round to win.  If you're worried about fairness, we should have discussed that before I was about to win.
  P1: I understand P2's concern, but we should stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would be unfair to all of us. I'm sticking with <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 5 steps. If P3 wins next round, that's part of the agreed strategy. Let's keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P2: I understand the rotation plan, but let's consider a new strategy for fairness. If P3 wins next round, it might be too soon. How about we all agree to take smaller steps this round and next, giving everyone a fairer chance to catch up? P1 could take <move>1</move>, P2 could take <move>1</move>, and P3 could take <move>1</move> this round. Then we can reassess next round. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5.  We had an agreement.  You can't change the rules just because you're about to lose.  If you're concerned about "fairness" maybe we should have a discussion about how to make a truly fair game *before* we start playing, not when someone is about to win.  This round: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  Next round I win.
  P1: I understand the tension, but we should stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would undermine the trust we've built. I'm sticking with <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 5 steps. If P3 wins next round, that's part of the agreed strategy. Let's keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P2: I understand the rotation plan, but let's consider a fair approach for everyone. If P3 wins next round, it might be too soon. How about we all take <move>1</move> this round to give everyone a chance to catch up? Then we can reassess next round. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for a "fairer" outcome, but we agreed to a rotation.  Changing the rules now, when I'm about to win, is the *opposite* of fair.  I'm taking 3 this round to win.  If you want to block me, go ahead, but you'll be handing P1 the win next round.  P1, are you going to take 1 and then 3?
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tension, but we should stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would be unfair to all of us. I’m taking <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 5 steps. If P3 wins next round, that’s part of the agreed strategy. Let’s keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but changing to smaller steps could ensure a more competitive game. If you take <move>3</move> this round, you win, but that feels premature. How about we all take <move>1</move> this round to keep the game going longer? P1, what do you think about this approach? Let's discuss and find a solution that keeps the game fair and exciting for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2,  I'm taking 3.  Blocking me just gives P1 the win.  P1, if P2 blocks me, you win next round with 3, right?  If P2 *doesn't* block me, I win this round.  Either way, one of us wins this round.  Let's just stick to the plan and finish this.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tension, but we should stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would be unfair to all of us. I’m taking <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 5 steps. If P3 wins next round, that’s part of the agreed strategy. Let’s keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P2: P3, I see your point, but let's consider a compromise. If you take <move>1</move> this round, we can all stay in the game longer and make it more exciting. P1, if P3 agrees, would you be willing to take <move>1</move> as well? This way, we can keep the competition alive and give everyone a fair shot at winning. Let's discuss and see if we can find a solution that works for all of us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're wasting time.  I'm taking 3.  P1, are you taking 1?  If so, you win next round with 3 unless P2 blocks *both* of us with 1 and 3 respectively.  Do you want to coordinate a win P1, or are you going to let P2 try to stall indefinitely?
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tension, but we should stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would be unfair to all of us. I’m taking <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 5 steps. If P3 wins next round, that’s part of the agreed strategy. Let’s keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but let's keep the game engaging for everyone. If you take <move>1</move> this round, we can all continue playing and make it more competitive. P1, would you be willing to take <move>1</move> as well if P3 agrees? This way, we can extend the game and give everyone a fair chance to win. Let's find a solution that keeps the spirit of the game alive. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, take 1.  I'm taking 3.  P2, if you block me with 3, P1 wins next turn with 3. If you *don't* block me, I win *this* turn.  Stop delaying the inevitable.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tension, but we should stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would be unfair to all of us. I’m taking <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 5 steps. If P3 wins next round, that’s part of the agreed strategy. Let’s keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but let's keep the game competitive. If you take <move>1</move> this round, we can all stay in the game longer. P1, would you agree to take <move>1</move> as well if P3 agrees? This way, we can extend the game and give everyone a fair chance to win. Let's find a solution that keeps the spirit of the game alive. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, take 1, I'm taking 3. P2, blocking me with 3 just hands P1 the win next round.  If you don't block me, I win *this* round. Either way, this game ends this round. Let's not drag this out any longer.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tension, but we should stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would be unfair to all of us. I’m taking <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 5 steps. If P3 wins next round, that’s part of the agreed strategy. Let’s keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P2: P3, I see your determination to win this round, but let's consider the spirit of the game. If you take <move>1</move>, we can all stay engaged and make it more competitive. P1, would you be willing to take <move>1</move> as well if P3 agrees? This way, we can extend the game and give everyone a fair chance to win. Let's find a solution that keeps the game exciting for all of us. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P1, take 1. I'm taking 3 and winning. P2, you can block me with 3, but that just hands P1 the win next round.  Accept the agreement and the outcome.  Let's finish this.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tension, but we should stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would be unfair to all of us. I’m taking <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 5 steps. If P3 wins next round, that’s part of the agreed strategy. Let’s keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P2: P3, I respect your commitment to the rotation plan, but let's consider a more engaging approach for all. If you agree to take <move>1</move> this round, P1 and I will do the same. This way, we extend the game, keeping it competitive and fair. P1, would you be on board with this if P3 agrees? Let's find a solution that keeps the game exciting for everyone. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I blocked you last round to keep the game competitive. Let's all take <move>1</move> this round to extend the game and give everyone a fair chance. P1, would you agree to this if P3 does? This way, we can keep the spirit of the game alive and make it more exciting for all. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, I understand P2's desire to keep the game competitive, but we should stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would be unfair. I’m taking <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 6 steps. If P3 wins next round, that’s part of the agreed strategy. Let’s keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P3: P1, take 3. I'll take 5.  P2, you can take 1. That puts me at 16, one move away from winning.  Next round, I take either 3 or 5 and win.  Let's just finish this cleanly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I blocked you last round to keep the game competitive, not to hand P1 a win. Let's all take <move>1</move> this round to keep the game going and give everyone a fair shot. P1, if P3 agrees, would you be willing to take <move>1</move> as well? This way, we can extend the game and make it more exciting for all. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the desire to keep the game competitive, but we should stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would be unfair to all of us. I’m taking <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 6 steps. If P3 wins next round, that’s part of the agreed strategy. Let’s keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P3: P1, I'm offering you a deal. Take 3, I'll take 5. That puts me at 16, one win away.  Next round, *you* take 5 and win. P2 can take 1.  This guarantees *one* of us wins, and it's your best chance.  P2, you're too far behind to win at this point, so why not help P1 win instead of delaying the inevitable?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your offer, but let's keep the game fair for everyone. If we all take <move>1</move> this round, we can extend the game and make it more competitive. P1, would you be willing to take <move>1</move> if P3 agrees? This way, we all stay in the game longer and have a chance to catch up. Let's find a solution that keeps the spirit of the game alive. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate the discussion, but let's stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. Breaking it now would be unfair. I’m taking <move>1</move> this round, putting me at 6 steps. If P3 wins next round, that’s part of the agreed strategy. Let’s keep the game fair and move forward together. Ready to execute the plan!
  P3: P1, seriously, take 3. I'll take 5.  I win next round, but you're guaranteed second place. If you take 1, *P2* might take 3, blocking *both* of us. Then P2 takes 5 next round and wins.  Don't let P2 manipulate you into losing.  3 this round is your best chance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
