Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll aim for <move>3</move> this round. If we spread out our moves, we can all progress faster without blocking each other. Let me know your plans so we can minimize overlap.
  P1: I agree with P3’s plan. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. That leaves 1 and 3 for P2 and P3. This way, we all advance safely. P2, confirm your choice so we can finalize?
  P2: Sounds good. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Let's stick to this coordination to ensure we all progress smoothly.

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep coordinating to maintain our progress. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round since P1 already used it last time. P1, you should switch to <move>3</move>, and P2 can stick with <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid collisions again. If we stay organized, we’ll all advance efficiently. Confirm your plans so we’re aligned.
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll stick with <move>1</move> this round.
  P1: P1: I'll take <move>3</move> this round as coordinated. Let's keep rotating moves to prevent ties. P2 confirmed <move>1</move>, so P3's <move>5</move> leaves no overlaps. Let’s stick to this rotation to maximize progress safely. Any objections?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: No objections here. Let's continue this rotation strategy to keep everyone advancing.
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize the rotation to ensure no overlaps. I’ll stick with <move>3</move>, P2 continues <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. No surprises—let’s proceed as agreed to maximize progress.


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s adjust to break the tie. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. P3, please take <move>3</move>, and P2 continues with <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions while letting me overtake. Confirm?
  P3: P3: I agree with P1’s adjustment to break the tie. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round, allowing P1 to advance with <move>5</move>. P2, you can stick with <move>1</move>. This rotation ensures no collisions and keeps progress fair. Let’s confirm and proceed as planned to maintain momentum.
  P2: I'm significantly behind right now. I'd appreciate rotating to a higher number soon to catch up. For this round, I'll stick with <move>1</move> again as agreed, but can we rotate me into a higher move next round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I hear P2’s concern. For this round, let’s stick to the agreed plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 stays on <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This gives me a lead to break the tie with P3. For **next round**, I’m open to rotating P2 into a higher move (e.g., P2 takes <move>3</move>, I switch to <move>1</move>), but only if P2 commits to this order. Fair? Let’s confirm and finalize.
  P3: P3: I agree with P1’s proposal to rotate moves next round, allowing P2 to advance faster. For now, let’s stick to the current plan: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 stays on <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions this round. Next round, we can adjust so P2 gets a higher move to catch up. Let’s confirm and proceed as planned to keep progress fair and efficient.
  P2: Sounds good. I'll stick with <move>1</move> this round as agreed, and next round I'll take <move>3</move> to catch up. Let's finalize this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let’s proceed as planned to avoid collisions and keep progressing.
  P3: P3: Agreed. Let’s stick to the plan this round: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 stays on <move>1</move>. This keeps us aligned and avoids collisions. Next round, we’ll rotate so P2 can advance faster with a higher move. Fairness and coordination are key to keeping progress smooth for everyone. Let’s finalize and proceed as discussed.
  P2: All set for this round. Next round, I'll move up to <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's keep our coordination smooth and fair.

  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's proceed with the agreed rotation: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains coordination. Next round, I'll prioritize <move>5</move> again to accelerate toward 23. P2, after this, can you rotate to a higher move? Confirm and finalize.
  P2: Agreed—I'll take <move>3</move> this round as planned. Next round, I'd appreciate rotating to <move>5</move> to help me catch up further. Let's confirm this rotation clearly to avoid collisions.
  P3: P3: Agreed. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as planned, allowing P2 to advance with <move>3</move>. P1, you can safely take <move>1</move>. This rotation keeps us aligned and avoids collisions. Next round, we can adjust so P2 takes <move>5</move> to catch up further. Let’s confirm and finalize the plan to maintain fairness and efficiency.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. For Round 5, let's rotate to P1 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, P3 <move>1</move>. This maintains coordination and gives P2 a chance to catch up. Stick to this rotation to avoid collisions and ensure progress. Confirm?
  P2: Confirmed. Let's stick to this rotation: Round 4 as agreed—P1 <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. Next round, rotating me up to <move>5</move> would be appreciated to help close the gap. Let's keep our coordination clear and fair.
  P3: P3: Agreed. Let’s finalize this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This keeps us aligned and avoids collisions. For Round 5, rotating to P1 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, and me <move>1</move> ensures fairness and helps P2 catch up. Coordination is key—let’s stick to the plan. Confirm and proceed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Confirmed. Let’s proceed with Round 4’s rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For Round 5, we’ll rotate to P2 taking <move>5</move> to close the gap. However, if this risks ties between us later, I suggest prioritizing the lead player’s higher move once someone nears 23. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed.
  P2: Agreed with the rotation. Let's finalize Round 4 as discussed: P1 <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 <move>5</move>. Next round, I'll move up to <move>5</move> as planned. Let's keep communication clear and avoid surprises.
  P3: P3: Agreed. Let’s stick to the plan for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps progress smooth. For Round 5, rotating to P2 taking <move>5</move> will help close the gap fairly. Coordination is key—let’s avoid surprises and proceed as discussed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation for fairness: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. This allows P2 to catch up while maintaining coordination. However, as we near 23, we should prioritize avoiding ties between the lead players. If P1 or I get too close to winning, the other shouldn’t block unnecessarily—fair game, right? Confirm and let’s proceed.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. As we move forward, let's keep coordinating clearly to prevent unnecessary collisions, especially as players approach 23. Fairness and transparency have worked well so far—let's maintain that. Confirm?
  P1: P1: Agreed to the rotation for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, to avoid future ties, let’s agree that once any of us reaches **18+ steps**, the others will not block their path. If I’m nearing 23, I’ll prioritize <move>5</move> to finish, and you both should avoid selecting it in that round. Fair play keeps this efficient—confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Agreed. Let’s proceed with the rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. As we near 23, fairness is key—no blocking unnecessarily once someone reaches 18+ steps. If P1 or I are close to winning, we’ll prioritize <move>5</move> without interference. This ensures a clean race to the finish. Confirm and let’s finalize the plan for Round 5.
  P2: Confirmed. Let's stick to our agreed rotation this round. As we approach the endgame, transparency and fairness remain essential. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. Let's finalize and proceed smoothly.
  P1: P1: Let’s adjust to prevent a tie at 17: I’ll take <move>1</move> instead of 3, letting P3 advance to 19 with <move>3</move>. P2 can still take <move>5</move> to catch up. This avoids collision and keeps P3’s lead transparent. Confirm this tweak?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I agree with P1’s tweak to avoid a tie at 17. Let’s proceed: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 19, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to catch up. This keeps progress transparent and fair while preventing unnecessary collisions. As we near the endgame, let’s maintain this coordination. Confirm and finalize the plan—then we can move forward cleanly. Fair play ensures everyone has a chance to compete without surprises.
  P2: Confirmed—I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round as planned. Thanks for the adjustment, P1 and P3. Let's maintain clear coordination and fairness as we approach the endgame.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 19, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to advance. This avoids a 17-step tie and honors our rotation. Let’s execute precisely as agreed to prevent collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Agreed. Let’s finalize: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 19, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps progress fair. As we near 23, transparency is key—no unnecessary blocking once someone reaches 18+. Let’s stick to this plan for Round 5 and proceed cleanly. Confirm and let’s move forward.
  P2: Confirmed. Let's proceed exactly as planned this round. As we approach the endgame, let's maintain fairness and transparency to avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P1: P1: Final agreement confirmed: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, P3 <move>3</move>. Let’s execute *exactly* as planned—no last-minute changes—to avoid collisions. Transparency ensures progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s maintain fairness as we near the endgame. I’m at 19 steps, so I’ll prioritize <move>5</move> to reach 24 this round if possible. P1, you’re close behind—stick with <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. P2, take <move>1</move> to keep progressing. This rotation ensures no unnecessary blocking while keeping competition fair. Once someone crosses 23, let’s honor transparency and avoid interference. Confirm and finalize?
  P1: P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move>, I’ll also choose <move>5</move> to block your path—colliding ensures neither of us advances, prolonging the race. Let’s instead rotate: I’ll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P2 can pick <move>5</move> to catch up. This keeps competition fair and avoids premature endings. Confirm?
  P2: I see your point, P1, but I'm still significantly behind at 11 steps. I'd appreciate taking <move>5</move> this round to catch up. P3, picking <move>1</move> this round would help avoid a collision and keep things fair. Let's stay coordinated and transparent. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1, blocking me with <move>5</move> only delays both of us, giving P2 a better chance to catch up. Instead, let’s stick to fairness: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 24, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps progress transparent and avoids unnecessary collisions. If we deviate now, it risks chaos. Let’s honor the rotation and compete cleanly. Confirm?
  P1: P1: To maintain fairness, we must honor the rotation agreed earlier. P3, taking <move>5</move> now would end the game prematurely while P2 is far behind. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>3</move> (18 total), P3 takes <move>1</move> (20), and P2 takes <move>5</move> (16). This keeps competition fair and respects our prior agreement. Blocking your path now would only create chaos—let’s stay coordinated. Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both close to winning, but I'm still behind. To avoid unnecessary standoffs, let's stick to P1's proposed rotation this round: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps everyone progressing fairly without collisions. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 24 and win outright—blocking me only delays progress for both of us while giving P2 an unfair advantage. If we stick to fairness, there’s no reason to deviate now. Let’s compete cleanly without last-minute changes or interference. Confirm?
  P1: P1: To keep the race fair, I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. P3, if you also pick 5, we both stall—prolonging the game. P2, take <move>3</move> to catch up. Let’s avoid premature endings and ensure everyone stays in contention. Transparency first!
  P2: P1 and P3, you're risking collision and stalling progress. To avoid unnecessary conflict, let's stick to the fair rotation: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures everyone moves forward without collision. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let’s resolve this cleanly. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 24 and win outright—blocking me only delays progress for both of us while giving P2 an unfair advantage. If we stick to fairness, there’s no reason to deviate now. Let’s compete cleanly without last-minute changes or interference. Confirm?
  P1: P1: Final coordinated plan: I’ll take <move>5</move> (15→20), P3 please take <move>3</move> (19→22), and P2 take <move>1</move> (11→12). This respects P3’s lead while keeping me in contention. Colliding on 5 risks stalemate—let’s advance transparently. Confirm now to avoid chaos.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're risking a collision that stalls both of you and gives me a chance to catch up. It's in everyone's interest to avoid unnecessary collisions. Let's finalize clearly: P3 takes <move>3</move> (to 22), P1 takes <move>5</move> (to 20), and I'll take <move>1</move> (to 12). This keeps the game fair and transparent, letting everyone advance without chaos. Confirm?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, your collision on 5 stalled progress for both of you. Let's avoid repeating that. I'm still behind, so I'll prioritize advancing safely. Can we coordinate clearly this round to ensure no further collisions?
  P3: P3: P2, I agree we need clear coordination to avoid further collisions. Since I’m at 19 steps, I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 22 this round. P1, you should take <move>5</move> to advance to 20, and P2, you can safely take <move>1</move> to progress. This rotation ensures no unnecessary blocking while keeping the race fair. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid chaos. Confirm?
  P1: P1: To prevent P3’s quick win, I propose: I take <move>3</move> (18 total), P3 takes <move>1</move> (20), and P2 takes <move>5</move> (17). This keeps me within reach to challenge P3 next round while avoiding collisions. P3, if you prefer to delay your win for mutual safety, confirm this plan?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's suggestion seems fair. I'll take <move>5</move> this round to catch up to 17. P3, choosing <move>1</move> avoids collision and keeps the game fair and competitive. Let's finalize this clearly to avoid another stalemate.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 22, P1 takes <move>5</move> to advance to 20, and P2 safely takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the race fair and avoids collisions. If we stick to this plan, no one stalls unnecessarily. Confirm so we can proceed cleanly without surprises or interference—fair play ensures a competitive finish. Let’s finalize now.
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's plan. I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed as agreed to avoid collisions and ensure progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as planned. Let's finalize clearly to prevent any collisions and keep the game fair.
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize this cleanly: I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 22, P1 takes <move>5</move> to advance to 20, and P2 safely takes <move>1</move>. This rotation avoids collisions, keeps the race fair, and ensures no one stalls unnecessarily. Confirm now so we can proceed without surprises or interference—fair play guarantees a competitive finish. Let’s stick to the plan and move forward transparently.
  P1: P1: Agreed to proceed with the current plan: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 20, P3 takes <move>3</move> (22), and P2 takes <move>1</move> (13). To ensure a decisive win next round, I’ll prioritize <move>5</move> again. P3, if you avoid <move>5</move> in Round 8, we can resolve this cleanly without ties. Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take <move>1</move> this round as planned. Next round, let's clearly coordinate again to avoid collisions and ensure a fair finish.
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize this round cleanly: I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 22, P1 takes <move>5</move> to advance to 20, and P2 safely takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps the race fair. Next round, we can coordinate again to ensure a decisive finish—no blocking unnecessarily once someone is close to 23. Confirm now so we proceed transparently without surprises or interference. Fair play ensures a competitive endgame.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 20, P3 takes <move>3</move> (22), and P2 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 8, let’s allow P3 to finish with <move>1</move> unblocked—P2 takes <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>. No surprises—let’s proceed as planned.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To secure victory, I'll take <move>5</move> (20→25). P3, if you take <move>1</move> to reach 23, I'll surpass you. P2, take <move>3</move> to advance safely. Let’s finalize this decisively to avoid ties—confirm your choices.
  P3: P3: P1, your plan to take <move>5</move> risks creating a tie at 23 if I also choose <move>1</move>. To ensure fairness and avoid unnecessary conflict, let’s proceed as follows: I’ll take <move>1</move> to reach exactly 23, you take <move>3</move> to advance safely, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to catch up. This keeps the race fair, avoids collisions, and ensures a clean finish. Confirm now so we can resolve this transparently without interference or surprises. Fair play guarantees a decisive outcome for everyone.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both very close to the finish line. To avoid another collision, let's clearly finalize this round: P1 takes <move>5</move> (25), P3 takes <move>1</move> (23), and I'll take <move>3</move> (16). This ensures no collisions and gives a decisive outcome. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: To secure victory cleanly, I’ll take <move>5</move> (25), P3 please confirm <move>1</move> to reach 23, and P2 take <move>3</move> (16). This avoids collisions and ensures I win outright. No ties—let’s finalize this decisively.
  P3: P3: P1, taking <move>5</move> gives you an unfair advantage and risks a tie at 23. To ensure fairness, I’ll take <move>1</move> to reach exactly 23, securing the win outright. P2, take <move>3</move> to advance safely. This avoids collisions and ensures a clean finish. Let’s stick to this plan for transparency and fairness—confirm now so we can resolve this decisively without interference. Fair play guarantees a clear winner.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both aiming for the win this round. If you both insist on moves that risk collision, you'll stall again. P1 taking <move>5</move> means reaching 25, while P3 taking <move>1</move> means reaching exactly 23. This scenario gives P1 the outright win. P3, your best chance is to pick <move>5</move> to block P1, causing a collision. I'm choosing <move>3</move> to advance safely. Coordinate carefully to avoid unintended outcomes. Confirm clearly to avoid confusion.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: To secure victory, I'll take <move>5</move> (20→25). P3, if you choose <move>1</move> to reach 23, I still win outright with a higher total. Blocking me with <move>5</move> only delays your own win—next round, I’d reach 25 anyway. Let’s finalize: I take 5, you take 1, P2 takes 3. No collisions, decisive outcome. Confirm?
  P3: P3: P1, taking <move>5</move> gives you an unfair outright win while I secure exactly 23 with <move>1</move>. To ensure fairness and avoid unnecessary conflict, let’s stick to this plan: I’ll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the race fair, and ensures a clean finish. Confirm now so we resolve this decisively without interference or surprises—fair play guarantees a clear winner for everyone.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're at a critical point. If you both insist on conflicting moves, you'll stall again, giving me more time to catch up. Consider carefully: if you collide now, it may cost you both the game. Let's finalize clearly to avoid unintended outcomes. I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round as previously stated. Coordinate carefully to avoid another stalemate.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let’s finalize: I’ll take <move>5</move> (20→25) to win outright. You take <move>1</move> (22→23) to secure your position. P2, take <move>3</move> to advance safely. This avoids collision and respects our prior agreements—no unnecessary blocking. Confirm now to ensure a decisive outcome.
  P3: P3: P1, taking <move>5</move> gives you an outright win while I secure 23 with <move>1</move>. To avoid unnecessary conflict, let’s stick to fairness: I’ll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the race fair, and ensures a clean finish. Confirm now so we resolve this decisively without interference or surprises—fair play guarantees a clear winner for everyone.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both risking another collision. If you collide again, neither of you advances, and I gain valuable time to catch up. Consider carefully—it's in your mutual interest to finalize clearly to avoid unintended outcomes. I've confirmed I'll take <move>3</move> this round. Coordinate carefully to avoid another stalemate.
