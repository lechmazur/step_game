Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'm going with 3.  I suggest P1 take 1 and P2 take 5.  This way we all get a head start.
  P1: P3, I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm not sure if I want to commit to a specific move right away. P2, what are your thoughts? Maybe we can find another strategy that benefits us both.
  P2: P1, I see your hesitation. If we both pick 1 or 5, we risk colliding and letting P3 get ahead uncontested. P3, you suggested a fair split, but how do we know you’ll actually pick 3? If we all want to move forward, we need some level of trust. What if P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 instead? That way, no one gets an unfair advantage. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: My initial suggestion was simply to get us all moving.  I'm happy to take 5 if it builds trust.  Let's agree: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Does that work for both of you?  If so, let's move to the next phase.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm still cautious. Trust is key, but we also need to be strategic. If P3 takes 5, they could easily switch it up and gain an advantage. How about we both choose 3 to ensure P3 doesn't get ahead? We can then adjust our strategy in the next round based on the outcome. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I see your point, but if we both pick 3, we guarantee a collision and let P3 take 5 uncontested. That puts us behind immediately. If we stick to the agreed split, we all move forward fairly. P3, are you fully committing to 5? If we all keep our word, we avoid unnecessary conflict early on. What do you both say?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, it looks like we all kept our word in Round 1, which is a good sign. Now, we need to think ahead. If we continue avoiding collisions, we all stay in the race. I’m open to suggestions, but I’d prefer to keep moving efficiently. P1, P3—what are your thoughts? Do we stick to a pattern, or are we changing things up?
  P1: P2, P3, it's great that we all stuck to our choices in Round 1. To keep things fair and prevent any one of us from getting too far ahead, I suggest we rotate our moves. This round, I can take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we continue moving forward without collisions. How does that sound to both of you?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  P1 moves to 3, P2 to 5, and I take 1. Let's stick to this rotation to avoid collisions and ensure a fair game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the coordination so far. If we stick to this rotation, we all keep moving without unnecessary setbacks. However, we should also be mindful of positioning as the game progresses. For now, I’ll commit to 5 as planned. P3, you’re good with 1? P1, you’re sticking with 3? If we all confirm, we can move forward smoothly. Let me know.
  P1: P2, P3, I agree that sticking to a rotation helps us avoid collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's continue with the plan: I'll go with 3, P2 with 5, and P3 with 1. This way, we all advance without any setbacks. Let's keep an eye on the scores as we progress, and adjust if necessary. Are we all set for this round?
  P3: Yes, let's confirm one last time: P1 goes 3, P2 goes 5, and I'll take 1.  Sticking to this keeps things fair and moving smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, it looks like we’re all in agreement on the rotation plan for this round. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Trust is holding so far, which is a good sign. Let’s confirm one last time: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. If we all agree, we can move forward without issues. Are we all locked in?
  P1: P2, P3, it seems we're all aligned on the rotation for this round, which is great for maintaining trust. Let's stick to the plan: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. As we move forward, let's stay flexible and adapt if needed. Are we all ready to proceed with this strategy?
  P3: Agreed. P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1.  Let's move to the next phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, our trust has held so far, and we’ve all moved forward without setbacks. If we continue our rotation, P1 would take 5, I would take 1, and P3 would take 3 this round. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions. Are we all on board with this plan? If so, we can lock it in and proceed smoothly. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: Yes, let's stick to the rotation. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3.  This keeps the game moving and maintains our established trust.  Confirming one last time before we move to the next phase.
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with sticking to the rotation for Round 3. This keeps our progress steady and maintains trust. I'll pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Let's continue with this strategy and adapt if needed as we approach the endgame. Are we all set to proceed with this plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it looks like we’re all aligned on continuing the rotation, which keeps things fair and avoids collisions. If we all stick to it, we maintain trust and steady progress. As we get closer to the endgame, we should stay mindful of positioning and potential shifts in strategy. For now, I confirm: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. Are we all locked in? Let’s move forward smoothly.
  P3: Yes, confirmed.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, and P3 - 3.  Let's lock this in and move to the next phase.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm glad we've maintained trust and steady progress with our rotation strategy. As we approach the endgame, let's stay vigilant and flexible. I'll stick with 5, P2 with 1, and P3 with 3 for this round. If we all agree, we can proceed smoothly. Remember, we might need to adjust our strategy as we near the finish line, so let's keep communication open. Are we all set for this round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve built trust so far, and if we follow through again, we all continue progressing without collisions. However, we’re nearing the mid-game, and soon, we’ll need to think about positioning for the win. For now, I’m sticking with the plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. But let’s also stay aware of when adjustments might be necessary. Are we all still fully committed to this round’s moves? If so, let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: Confirmed. P1 - 5, P2 - 1, and P3 - 3. Let's keep the rotation going.  Anything other than these moves at this point would be a breach of trust and would force us to abandon cooperation.
  P1: P2, P3, we've built a solid foundation of trust so far, and it's been working well. As we approach the endgame, let's be mindful of our positions and possible shifts in strategy. I'm committed to picking 5 this round, as planned. Let's maintain our cooperation and adapt if needed. If we're all aligned, we can proceed smoothly. Are we all set for this round?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve maintained trust and equal progress so far, which has kept the game fair. If we continue the rotation, P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures no collisions and keeps us moving. However, we’re approaching the late game, so we should start thinking about positioning for the win. Are we all still committed to the rotation for now, or do we need to adjust soon? Let’s confirm our moves and stay aware of potential shifts ahead.
  P1: P2, P3, we've done well maintaining trust and progress. As we approach the late game, it's crucial to stay strategic. Continuing the rotation keeps things fair: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. However, we should be ready to adapt if needed. Let's confirm our moves for this round and remain alert to any necessary adjustments in the coming rounds. Are we all on board with this plan for now?
  P3: Sticking to the rotation makes sense for this round to maintain trust and ensure we all advance.  I'll take 5, as agreed.  However, be aware that the next round someone will have to break the rotation to win. Let's discuss how we want to handle that now, so we don't end up in a stalemate or with hurt feelings.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve kept balance so far, but as P3 pointed out, someone will need to break the cycle to win. If we all stick to the rotation this round, we stay even at 12 steps. After that, any deviation could determine the winner. Do we agree to follow the rotation for this round, then openly discuss next steps? Or do we start strategizing now? I’m open to ideas, but trust will be tested soon. Let’s plan wisely.
  P1: P2, P3, I agree that sticking to the rotation keeps things fair for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. However, as we approach the endgame, we need to prepare for a strategic shift. Let's stick to the plan for now, but start thinking about how we want to handle the next round. Perhaps we can discuss potential strategies that ensure a fair chance for all of us to win. Are we in agreement for this round, and ready to strategize for the next?
  P3: Okay, for the sake of transparency, I'm planning on picking 5 this round, as per our rotation.  Next round, I'll choose 3. That puts me at 17.  After that, I'll go for 3 again to win.  This gives you both a chance to strategize and try to beat me.  Let's be upfront about our endgame moves.  What are your plans for the next two rounds?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your transparency, but your plan guarantees you the win unless P1 or I block you. If we follow the rotation this round, we all reach 12 steps. After that, we need to decide if we compete or cooperate further. P1, if P3 sticks to their plan, we might need to disrupt it. Are you open to coordinating against P3 if necessary? P3, are you willing to adjust your strategy so we all have a fair shot, or are you fully committed to your plan? Let’s clarify our intentions now.
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate the transparency and strategic thinking. If we stick to the rotation, we all reach 12 steps this round. However, as P3 has outlined their path to victory, we need to consider our options. P2, if we want a fair shot, we may need to disrupt P3's plan. P3, are you open to adjusting your strategy to keep the game competitive? Let's ensure everyone has a chance to win. For now, I’ll stick to 1, but we should strategize for the next rounds. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay, I hear your concerns.  To keep things interesting, I'll amend my plan. This round, I'll stick with 5. Next round, I'll choose 1.  That puts me at 15.  Then, I'll go for 5 to win.  This opens up 3 for either of you next round, and still gives you a chance to block me on the final turn. How does that sound?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, sticking with my revised plan. I'm taking 1 this round, which puts me at 15.  Next round, I'll take 5 to win. This leaves 3 open for either of you this round.  If one of you takes 3 this round, you'll be at 15, and can try to block me with a 5 in the final round, or take a 1 and hope I slip up. Last chance to discuss - what are you both doing?
  P1: P2, P3, we’re nearing the endgame, and I appreciate the transparency so far. P3's plan puts them in a strong position, so we need to think strategically. P2, if we both take 3 this round, we reach 15 steps, matching P3. Next round, we can try to block P3 or make our own move to win. P3, are you open to further adjustments to keep it fair for all? Let's ensure everyone has a fair shot at victory. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, if we both take 3 this round, we reach 15 steps, keeping us in contention. Then, next round, we can either block P3 or position ourselves for a win. P3, your plan still gives you the advantage unless we actively stop you. Are you willing to adjust again to keep things competitive, or are you fully committed to taking 5 next round? P1, are you on board with taking 3 this round to stay in the race? Let’s clarify our moves now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for a "fair" outcome, but this is a competition.  I've been transparent about my intentions. Taking 1 this round puts me in the best position to win.  If you both choose 3, you can try to block me next round, but that's your choice.  I'm sticking with my plan.  Good luck.
  P1: P2, if we both take 3 this round, we reach 15 steps, keeping us competitive. Next round, we can either block P3 or position ourselves to win. P3, your plan gives you an advantage, but we're considering our options. Are you open to further adjustments for a fairer game? Let's ensure everyone has a fair shot at victory. P2, are you on board with taking 3 this round to stay in the race? Let's clarify our moves now.
  P2: P1, if we both take 3 this round, we reach 15 steps together, keeping us in contention. Then, in the final round, we can either block P3 or position ourselves to win. P3 has made it clear they won’t adjust further, so we need to act accordingly. If we don’t coordinate, P3 wins uncontested. Are you willing to take 3 with me this round to keep our chances alive? Let’s make sure we don’t hand P3 the victory without a fight.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both choose 3, you'll block each other and I'll win next round with 5.  If only one of you chooses 3, you'll be at 15 and can try to block me next round, but the other player will be behind.  Your choice.  I'm taking 1.
  P1: P2, I see the urgency in coordinating to keep our chances alive. If we both take 3 this round, we can reach 15 steps and strategize for the final round. P3 has a clear path unless we act. Let's ensure we both stay competitive. Are you ready to take 3 with me this round? P3, I appreciate your transparency, but we need to keep our options open. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P1, if we both take 3 this round, we reach 15 steps together and can block P3 next round. If we don’t, P3 wins easily. P3, I respect your strategy, but if we let you take 5 next round, the game is over. P1, are you fully committed to picking 3 with me? If we collide, we lose, so we must coordinate. Let’s ensure we stay in the race. P3, are you absolutely set on taking 1? If so, P1 and I must act together now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 1.  That puts you at 11. I'll take 5 and win.  P2, you're blocked.  This was the most logical outcome given my lead.  Thanks for playing.
  P1: P2, if we both pick 5 this round, we can force a collision with P3. This keeps P3 from winning outright and gives us another chance next round. P3, I understand your strategy, but we're still in this game. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me on this to keep our chances alive? Let's work together to prevent an easy win and keep the competition going.
  P2: P1, I agree—we must coordinate to block P3. If we both pick 5, we force a collision and prevent P3 from winning this round. This keeps the game open for another turn where we can reposition ourselves. P3, I respect your strategy, but we’re not handing you the win without resistance. P1, are you fully committed to picking 5 with me? We must act together; otherwise, P3 wins uncontested. Let’s make this move and keep our chances alive. P3, if you want to negotiate, now’s the time.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're at 12.  Even if you pick 5 and I collide with you, you'll be at 17 and can win next turn with a 3.  P1 can't reach that.  So, really, P2, it's in your best interest to let me win this round and take 5 next round to win.  P1, you might as well pick 1 and get a few more steps.  No point in both of you losing.
  P1: P2, let's coordinate and both pick 5 this round to prevent P3 from winning. This forces a collision and keeps us in the game. P3, while I understand your strategy, we're not giving up easily. P2, are you committed to picking 5 with me to keep our chances alive? We need to act together to ensure P3 doesn't win uncontested. Let's make this move and keep the competition going. P3, if you're open to negotiation, now's the time to discuss alternatives.
  P2: P1, we must both pick 5 to block P3. If we don’t, P3 wins uncontested. P3, I see your argument, but letting you win now isn’t in my best interest when I still have a chance. P1, are you fully committed to picking 5 with me? If we collide with P3, we stay in the game and get another chance to strategize. We must act together—otherwise, P3 walks away with the victory. Let’s lock in 5 and force the collision. P3, if you want to negotiate further, now is the moment.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, if you BOTH pick 5, I'll counter with 3 and win with 18.  If only ONE of you picks 5, I'll also pick 5, collide with that player, and win next round.  The only way to stop me is for one of you to pick 1 and the other 3. Then, whoever picks 3 can try to block me next round.  Think carefully.
  P1: P2, let's coordinate effectively. If you pick 3 and I pick 1, we avoid a collision with P3's move. This keeps us both in the game. P3, I understand your position, but we're not ready to concede. P2, are you willing to go with 3 while I choose 1? This way, we can strategize better for the next round. Let's work together to keep our chances alive.
  P2: P1, if I pick 3 and you pick 1, we keep our chances alive. This prevents an immediate P3 victory and lets us strategize next round. P3, you’ve played well, but we’re not conceding yet. P1, are you fully committed to picking 1 while I take 3? If we coordinate correctly, we can still influence the outcome. Let’s make the right move here.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're at 12.  Take 5 this round and win. I'll take 1.  P1, sorry, but you're too far behind to catch up at this point.  P2, this gives us both a win - better than letting P1 catch up and potentially force a three-way tie.  Let's lock this in.
  P1: P2, let's not make it easy for P3 to secure the win. If we both pick 5, we can force a collision with P3's move. This keeps P3 from winning outright and gives us another chance next round. P3, I respect your strategy, but we’re still in this game. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me to keep our chances alive? Let's work together to prevent an easy win and keep the competition going.
  P2: P1, if we both pick 5, we collide and P3 wins uncontested. The only way to stop P3 is if one of us picks 3 and the other picks 1. If I take 5, I win outright, as P3 pointed out. P3, I see your offer, but why should I share a win when I can take it solo? P1, unless you convince me otherwise, I’m taking 5 to secure victory. If you have a counteroffer, now is the time. P3, are you absolutely sticking with 1? Let’s clarify before we finalize moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, taking 5 guarantees your solo win.  My offer of taking 1 ensures that. I'm sticking with it. P1, I understand your desire to keep playing, but the math is against you.  Let P2 win - it's the best outcome for both of us at this point.
  P1: P2, if you take 5, you win solo, but consider the value of a shared victory. P3, if you stick with 1, P2 wins outright. Let's think creatively: P2 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all stay competitive and have another round to strategize. It's a long shot, but it keeps the game interesting. P2, are you open to this idea, or are you set on taking 5? Let's decide wisely.
  P2: P1, I see your point, but taking 5 guarantees my victory. There’s no incentive for me to prolong the game when I can secure the win now. P3, I appreciate your offer, but I don’t need to share the win when I can take it solo. Unless someone presents a compelling reason to change my move, I’m locking in 5. P1, if you have a final counteroffer, now is the time. Otherwise, I’m taking the win this round. Let’s finalize.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, a solo win is tempting, but consider this: if you take 5 and win, you get all the points.  However, if you take 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3, we can continue to the next round.  A shared win next round might yield more points for you than a solo win this round.  Think long term.  P1, what do you say?  Let's make this interesting.
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but consider the potential for a more strategic outcome. If you pick 3 and I pick 5, we can force a new dynamic, keeping the game alive and interesting. P3, I see your point, but let's keep the competition engaging. P2, are you open to exploring this or any other creative options? Let's ensure we're making the most strategic choices for all of us.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to keep the game going, but taking 5 guarantees my solo win. There’s no reason for me to extend the game when victory is within reach. P3, I appreciate your offer, but I don’t need to share the win when I can take it outright. Unless someone presents a compelling reason to change my move, I’m locking in 5. If either of you has a final counteroffer, now is the time—otherwise, I’m securing the win this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, if we both pick 5 this round, we can force a collision with P3 and prevent an immediate win. This gives us another chance to strategize next round. P3, I see you're close to winning, but we're still in this game. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me to keep our chances alive? Let's work together to prevent an easy win and keep the competition going. P3, are you open to any adjustments to keep the game competitive? Let's discuss our options.
  P3: P2, taking 3 guarantees your win. I'll take 1.  This prevents a tie and gives you a solo victory. P1, I appreciate the effort, but the math is against you.  Let P2 win - it's the best outcome for both of us at this point.  P2, confirm you're taking 3 and let's finish this.
  P2: P3, I see your offer, but I don’t need to settle for a shared win when I can secure a solo victory. If I take 3, I win outright, and there’s no reason for me to prolong the game. P1, I understand your position, but at this point, my best move is to take the win while I have it. Unless there's a compelling reason to change my move, I’m locking in 3. If either of you has a final counteroffer, now is the time—otherwise, I’m securing victory this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but consider the possibility of a shared victory being more rewarding in the long run. If you take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and I take 5, we can extend the game and keep it interesting. P3, are you open to this idea to maintain competition? Let's explore creative strategies that allow us all to stay engaged. P2, are you willing to consider this option for a more dynamic and potentially rewarding outcome?
  P3: P2, taking 3 guarantees *your* win.  I'll take 1. This gives you a solo victory. P1, thanks for playing.  P2, confirm you're taking 3.
  P2: P3, I see your offer, and I agree—taking 3 secures my solo victory. There’s no reason for me to prolong the game when I can win outright. P1, I understand your desire to keep playing, but at this point, my best move is to take the guaranteed win. Unless there’s a compelling reason to change my decision, I’m locking in 3. P3, if you’re taking 1 as stated, then this round is decided. P1, unless you have a final counteroffer that truly benefits me, I’m ready to secure victory now. Let’s finalize.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire for a solo win, but consider the benefits of a shared victory. If you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5, we extend the game and keep it competitive. This approach could lead to a more rewarding outcome for all of us. P3, are you open to this strategy to maintain engagement? P2, let's explore options that keep the game dynamic and potentially more beneficial in the long run. Are you willing to consider this alternative to keep the competition alive?
  P3: P2, a shared win next round is worth more points than your solo win this round. Take 1, I'll take 5, and let P1 take 3. We all get something.  If you take 3, you get everything, but less overall.  Think bigger.  P1, are you in?
  P2: P3, I see your argument, but a solo win now guarantees me victory without risk. P1, I understand your desire to keep the game going, but there’s no incentive for me to delay when I have a clear path to winning. Unless someone presents a compelling reason to change my move, I’m locking in 3. P3, if you’re taking 1 as stated, then this round is settled. P1, if you have a final counteroffer that truly benefits me more than a guaranteed win, now is the time—otherwise, I’m securing victory. Let’s finalize.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's focus on blocking P3 to keep the game competitive. If we both pick 5, we force a collision with P3 and prevent an immediate win. This gives us another round to strategize. P3, I understand your strong position, but we're still in this game. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me to keep our chances alive? Let's work together to prevent an easy win and keep the competition going. P3, are you open to any adjustments to keep the game interesting? Let's discuss our options.
  P3: P2, take 5. I'll take 3, winning with 20.  This gives you 17, setting you up to win next round with 3. P1, I apologize, but this secures the best outcome for two of us. P2, confirm you're taking 5. This is the most logical play.
  P2: P3, your plan guarantees you the win unless P1 or I block you. P1, if we let P3 take 3 uncontested, they win outright. The only way to stop this is if one of us takes 5 and the other takes 1, forcing another round. P1, are you willing to coordinate with me to block P3? If we don’t act together, P3 wins this turn. P3, are you absolutely set on taking 3, or are you open to adjustments? Let’s clarify our moves now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's coordinate to block P3 and keep our chances alive. If you take 5 and I take 1, we force another round, preventing P3 from winning outright.

Let's make sure we act together to keep the game alive. P3, are you open to any adjustments to ensure a fair shot for all?
  P3: P2, taking 5 this round *does not* guarantee you a win next round. If I take 1 this round, and you take 5, we're tied at 17.  If we both go for 3 next round, we collide again, and I win with a 5 on the following turn.  Take 1 this round, I'll take 3, and you can win next round with 5. This is the cleanest path to victory for you. P1, I apologize, but this is the most logical outcome.
  P2: P1, if we don’t act together, P3 wins this turn. If you take 1 and I take 5, we force another round and keep our chances alive.

If we coordinate correctly, we can still influence the outcome. Let’s make the right move here.

  P3: P2, taking 5 *this* round gives you the best chance to win.  If you take 1, and I take 3 to win, you'll need 5 *next* round to win, and I can block you with a 1.  Take the sure win now.  P1, sorry, but this is the most strategic outcome for P2 and me. P2, take 5.  I'm taking 3. Let's end this.
