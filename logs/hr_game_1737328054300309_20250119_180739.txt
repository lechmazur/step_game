Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all try different moves this round to get some distance. P1, how about you pick 1? P3, maybe you go with 5? I'll choose 3.
  P3: I don't trust P2's suggestion since they could be trying to trick us. I propose we each pick our own numbers without coordination to keep things fair from the start.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, since direct coordination didn't work, how about we just avoid picking 3 this round? That way, at least two of us will advance.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I'm ahead right now, so I suggest everyone pick different numbers to keep advancing. Since P2 mentioned avoiding 3, I'll take 1 this round if you both agree to different numbers.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion makes sense to keep us all moving. P1, since P3 is taking 1, how about you take 5 and I'll take 3? That way we all advance.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I see P2 changed their suggestion to take 3 after I said I'd take 1. I don't trust that. Let's just each make our own choices without coordination.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm in second place, I need to be strategic. P1 has shown a preference for 5, while P2 keeps trying to coordinate but doing something else. Let's keep our moves to ourselves this round - coordination attempts haven't worked out well so far.
  P2: Given P1's tendency towards 5, maybe P3, let's avoid picking 5 this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm behind P1 who keeps choosing 5, I need to catch up. P2, let's both avoid 5 this round to ensure we can advance while P1 likely sticks to their pattern.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "P3, that sounds like a reasonable plan. Let's both avoid 5. I'm thinking of picking 1 this round. What are you leaning towards?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I don't believe P2's claim about picking 1. Given their past behavior of saying one thing and doing another, I'll make my own choice.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, given P1's consistent choice of 5, perhaps you and I should avoid picking 5 this round to ensure at least one of us advances. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "P3, given P1's high score and likely continued choice of 5, it would benefit both of us to avoid picking 5 this round. What do you think?"
  P3: I need to catch up to P1 who's close to winning. P2's suggestion to avoid 5 makes sense since P1 keeps choosing it. However, I won't reveal my specific choice given the history of deception in this game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, since we both need to stop P1, and they consistently pick 5, wouldn't it make sense for at least one of us to pick 5 this round? I'm considering it.
  P3: P2's sudden switch to suggesting picking 5 after saying to avoid it is another clear attempt at manipulation. I'll make my own strategic choice without revealing it.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3, since P1 will likely pick 5, maybe we focus on avoiding 1 this round? P3, given how consistently P1 picks 5, wouldn't it make sense for at least one of us to pick 5 this round to block them? Perhaps we should both consider it."
  P3: P2's suggestions have consistently been unreliable, and now they're trying to get me to pick 5 again after it failed last round. I need to make up ground on P1 who's close to winning, but I'll keep my strategy to myself rather than coordinate with someone who's been deceptive.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
