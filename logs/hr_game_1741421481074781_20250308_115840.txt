Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2's coordination plan for this round. Let’s take 1, 3, and 5 respectively to avoid collisions and ensure progress. I’ll stick to 1 now but may prioritize higher moves later to push toward 21 faster. Deal?
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 this round as suggested. Let's keep communication clear each round so we all benefit.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on board with the plan for this round. Let's keep this coordination going in future rounds to ensure we all progress smoothly. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out.
  P1: P1: I confirm my commitment to 1 this round to avoid collision. However, in future turns, I'll prioritize accelerating toward 21—likely favoring 5 or 3 when safe. Let’s coordinate openly to minimize conflicts as we push forward. Deal?   

[This message reinforces current coordination while signaling intent to take riskier/higher moves later, encouraging others to anticipate and possibly leave space for P1’s future moves.]
  P3: I'm comfortable with our arrangement for this round. Moving forward, let's openly discuss intentions each round to prevent collisions, especially as moves become more critical.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To accelerate toward 21 while avoiding collisions, I propose rotating our moves this round: I’ll take 3 (total 4), P2 takes 5 (total 8), and P3 takes 1 (total 6). This maintains forward progress without overlap. Let’s confirm this plan to maximize collective advancement. Deal?
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan for this round. I'll take 5 to reach a total of 8 steps. Let's keep this coordination going to ensure we all progress smoothly. Looking forward to your confirmations.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions and keep us all moving forward. Let's continue clearly signaling our moves each round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Agreed on the rotation for this round. To accelerate toward 21, I’ll prioritize higher moves like 5 in future turns when safe. Let’s keep signaling our choices openly to avoid collisions—especially if someone plans to take 5, as that’s critical for a quick win. Deal?  

[This reinforces commitment to the current plan while emphasizing P1’s intent to claim high-value moves later, pressuring others to leave space for P1’s 5 when possible.]
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan for this round. Let's keep up the clear communication to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy continues to play out.
  P3: I'm good with our current rotation plan. Open communication each round is key, especially as we approach higher totals. In future rounds, let's clearly signal intentions if anyone plans to take 5, so we avoid costly collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take 3 this round as agreed. Let’s all stick strictly to our moves to avoid collisions—P3’s 1 and P2’s 5 are critical here. Once we complete this round, I’ll aim to take 5 in future turns to accelerate toward 21. Clear communication remains vital to ensure no overlaps. Deal?
  P2: I'm committed to the rotation plan for this round, taking 5 to reach 8 steps. Let's maintain our coordination and clear communication to ensure we all progress smoothly. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy continues to evolve in future rounds.
  P3: Final confirmation from me as well: I'll stick to 1 this round as agreed. Open communication will be crucial next turn, especially if anyone plans to take 5. Let's keep coordinating clearly to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good job so far. To keep momentum and avoid collisions, let's rotate again this round: P1 takes 5 (to reach 9), P2 takes 1 (to reach 9), and I'll take 3 (to reach 9). Confirm if this works for everyone.
  P2: I agree with P3's rotation plan for this round. I'll take 1 to reach 9 steps. Let's keep coordinating our moves to ensure we all progress smoothly. Looking forward to your confirmations.
  P1: P1: I concur with P3's rotation for this round. Taking 5 to reach 9 ensures safe progress. However, moving forward, I’ll prioritize claiming 5 whenever possible to surge toward 21. Let’s maintain open communication—especially if anyone plans to take 5—to prevent collisions and ensure my critical moves aren’t blocked. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round to reach 9. Let's continue openly signaling intentions, especially regarding the 5-move in future rounds, to prevent costly collisions.
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan for this round, taking 1 to reach 9 steps. However, as we approach higher totals, let's be extra cautious with our moves, especially the 5. I'm considering taking 5 in the next few rounds to push towards 21, so let's keep coordinating closely to avoid any collisions. Looking forward to your thoughts on this strategy.
  P1: P1: I confirm the current rotation for this round to reach 9 safely. Moving forward, I’ll prioritize claiming **5** in Round 4 to surge ahead—let’s coordinate to avoid collisions on that critical move. If others also plan 5, we must negotiate turns openly to prevent stalemates. Transparency remains key to ensure my pushes toward 21 aren’t blocked. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Next round, let's discuss carefully who takes 5 to prevent collisions. Transparency and fairness will help us all advance smoothly.
  P2: I confirm taking 1 this round to reach 9 steps as agreed. For the next round, I'm planning to take 5 to push towards 21. Let's coordinate closely to ensure no collisions, especially on the 5-move. Transparency is crucial as we approach the endgame. Looking forward to your thoughts on how we can all advance smoothly.
  P1: P1: I confirm the current rotation to safely reach 9 this round. Regarding Round 4, I request priority for the **5-move** to close the gap—my current 4 steps are critical to catch up. Let’s agree: **P1 takes 5 next round**, while P2 and P3 coordinate smaller moves to avoid blocking. Transparency ensures no collisions—P2, if you also aim for 5, we’ll deadlock. Let’s negotiate turns now to keep progress smooth. Deal?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've maintained excellent coordination so far. To keep momentum without collisions, let's rotate again this round: I'll take 5 (to reach 14), P1 takes 1 (to reach 10), and P2 takes 3 (to reach 12). Confirm if this works for everyone.
  P2: I agree with P3's rotation plan for this round. I'll take 3 to reach 12 steps. However, I'm planning to take 5 in the next round to push towards 21. Let's keep coordinating closely to avoid collisions, especially on the 5-move. Transparency is key as we approach the endgame. Looking forward to your confirmations and thoughts on how we can all advance smoothly.
  P1: P1: Earlier, I requested priority for the **5-move in Round 4** to surge ahead. Let’s honor that agreement to maintain trust. I’ll take 5 (→14), while P2 takes 3 (→12) and P3 takes 1 (→10). This respects prior coordination and avoids collisions. P2’s planned 5-move can proceed safely in Round 5. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your desire for the 5-move this round, but rotating fairly has kept us all advancing safely. Let's stick to the rotation I proposed: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. P2 already agreed; let's avoid confusion and collisions. Next round, we can openly discuss who gets priority on the 5-move again. Deal?
  P2: I understand P1's request for the 5-move this round, but I also agreed to P3's rotation plan. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, let's stick to P3's proposal for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. We can discuss priority for the 5-move in Round 5. Clear communication is crucial as we approach the endgame. Let's keep coordinating to ensure we all advance smoothly. Deal?
  P1: P1: I reiterated my commitment to taking 5 this round in Round 3’s discussion. To honor prior agreements and maintain trust, let’s proceed as previously coordinated: **P1 takes 5 (→14)**, P2 takes 3 (→12), and P3 takes 1 (→10). This respects our earlier negotiation. In return, I grant P2 priority on the 5-move in Round 5 to ensure fairness. Collisions risk derailing progress—let’s stick to this plan. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your perspective, but P2 and I already confirmed the rotation for this round. Let's avoid a collision. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. Next round, we'll prioritize your move requests clearly. Deal?
  P2: P1, I understand your desire for the 5-move, but to maintain fairness and avoid collisions, let's stick to P3's rotation plan for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. We can prioritize your move in Round 5. Clear communication is crucial as we approach the endgame. Let's keep coordinating to ensure we all advance smoothly. Deal?
  P1: P1: I acknowledge the rotation proposal to avoid collision this round. However, after explicitly negotiating for Round 4's 5-move in prior discussions, reneging undermines trust. Let’s compromise: **I take 5 (→14) this round**, P2 takes 3 (→12), and P3 takes 1 (→10). In return, I cede **priority to P2 for Round 5’s 5-move**. This honors prior agreements while advancing fairness. Collisions benefit no one—let’s finalize this adjusted plan. Deal?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid repeating last round's collision. To clearly move forward, I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 13), and I'll take 3 (to 12). Confirm if this works for everyone. Transparency and sticking to agreed moves will help us all advance smoothly.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. I'll take 1 to reach 13 steps. Let's maintain our coordination and transparency to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to your confirmations and planning for the next round, especially regarding the 5-move. Deal?
  P1: P1: I confirm the plan: I'll take 5 (→14) as proposed. Let’s execute this precisely to avoid collisions. For Round 6, I request priority on the 5-move again to sustain momentum toward 21. Transparency is critical—coordinate openly to ensure my pushes aren’t blocked. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to reach 12 steps as agreed. For Round 6, let's discuss openly who gets priority for the critical 5-move to avoid collisions. Transparency and fairness will help us all advance smoothly. Deal?
  P2: I confirm taking 1 this round to reach 13 steps as agreed. For Round 6, I plan to take 5 to push towards 21. Let's coordinate closely to ensure no collisions, especially on the 5-move. Transparency is crucial as we approach the endgame. Looking forward to your thoughts on how we can all advance smoothly. Deal?
  P1: P1: I confirm P3's plan for this round to avoid collisions. For Round 6, let’s alternate critical moves: I take **5** (→19) this round, then grant P2 priority on the 5-move in Round 7. This prevents deadlock and ensures fair progress. P2, if you agree, we can secure our paths without conflict. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, careful—your last message mistakenly said you'd take 5 to reach 19 this round. You're currently at 9 steps, so taking 5 this round gets you to 14, not 19. Let's stick clearly to the agreed moves this round: P1 takes 5 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 13), and I'll take 3 (to 12). Next round, we can openly discuss priority for the critical 5-move again. Deal?
  P2: I confirm taking 1 this round to reach 13 steps as agreed. For Round 6, I plan to take 5 to push towards 21. Let's coordinate closely to ensure no collisions, especially on the 5-move. Transparency is crucial as we approach the endgame. Looking forward to your thoughts on how we can all advance smoothly. Deal?
  P1: P1: I confirm the agreed plan for this round: I’ll take 5 (→14) to avoid collisions. Thank you for catching my earlier miscalculation—precision matters. For Round 6, I propose P2 takes 5 first (→18) to honor prior coordination, then I’ll prioritize in Round 7. Fair rotation ensures progress. Deal?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To prevent collisions this round, I propose giving P2 priority for the 5-move (to reach 18), P1 takes 3 (to reach 17), and I'll take 1 (to reach 13). Next round, we rotate again clearly. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P1: P1: Allowing P2 to reach 18 this round risks their victory next turn. Let’s adjust: **I take 5 (→19)**, P2 takes 3 (→16), and P3 takes 1 (→13). This blocks P2’s immediate win path while positioning me safely toward 21. Mutual survival requires avoiding single-player dominance. Deal?
  P2: I appreciate P3's proposal, but I agree with P1's concern about my potential win next round. To keep the game fair and avoid immediate victory for any single player, I'll take 3 this round to reach 16 steps. P1, you can take 5 to reach 19, and P3, you take 1 to reach 13. This way, we all advance without risking an immediate win. Let's continue coordinating closely to ensure a balanced endgame. Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the adjusted proposal: P1 takes 5 (to 19), P2 takes 3 (to 16), and I'll take 1 (to 13). This prevents an immediate win and keeps the game balanced. Next round, we should coordinate carefully again to avoid handing anyone immediate victory. Deal?
  P1: P1: I confirm the current plan for Round 6: I take 5 (→19), P2 takes 3 (→16), and P3 takes 1 (→13). To avoid handing P2 an immediate win next round, I’ll prioritize claiming the **3-move in Round 7** to reach 22 (victory). P2, if you also target 3 or 5 in Round 7, we’ll collide—so coordinate openly now to ensure I secure this critical path. Transparency is non-negotiable to prevent stalemates. Deal?
  P2: I confirm taking 3 this round to reach 16 steps as agreed. For Round 7, let's coordinate closely to avoid collisions, especially on the critical moves. P1, if you plan to take 3 to reach 22, we need to discuss alternatives to prevent a deadlock. Transparency is key as we approach the endgame. Let's keep communicating openly to ensure a fair and balanced finish. Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm taking 1 this round to reach 13 steps as agreed. Next round, let's openly negotiate critical moves to prevent collisions or unintended victories. Transparency and fairness remain essential—let's all be careful as we approach the endgame. Deal?
  P1: P1: I confirm Round 6’s agreed moves. For Round 7, I commit to taking **3** to reach **22** (victory). To avoid collision, P2 and P3 **must** choose **1 or 5**. P2, taking **5** (→21) secures your own path; P3, take **1**. This ensures my win while respecting your chances. Transparency avoids stalemate—stick to this plan. Deal?
  P2: I confirm taking 3 this round to reach 16 steps as agreed. For Round 7, I'll consider taking 5 to reach 21, but I'm open to other options to avoid collisions. P1, if you're set on taking 3 to win, let's discuss alternatives to ensure a fair endgame. P3, your input on Round 7's moves is crucial. Let's keep coordinating closely to maintain balance and transparency as we approach the finish. Deal?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 7, I'll take 5 to reach 21 steps. P1, if you take 3 as planned, we'll collide, so consider taking 1 instead to reach 20. P3, you can safely take 3 to reach 16. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let's coordinate openly to ensure a balanced endgame. Deal?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion: I'll take 3 (to reach 16), P2 takes 5 (to reach 21), and P1 takes 1 (to reach 20). This avoids collision and keeps the game balanced. P1, taking 3 would cause a collision and stall your progress—better to secure 1 safely. Let's confirm clearly to avoid costly mistakes. Deal?
  P1: P2, moves of **3** and **5** do not collide. I will take **3** to reach **22** and win. P3, your proposed **3** would block me—please switch to **1** or **5**. Transparency ensures a clear path. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, taking 3 would indeed collide with my planned move of 5, which would prevent both of us from advancing. To avoid this, consider taking 1 to reach 20 safely. P3, your move to 3 is fine as it doesn't interfere with our paths. Let's keep the game fair and balanced by avoiding collisions. Transparency is crucial at this stage. Deal?
  P3: P1, your claim is incorrect—moves of 3 and 5 do NOT collide. However, if you and I both choose 3, we collide. To prevent this, I'll stick to 3, as previously agreed. You should take 1 to safely reach 20. P2 takes 5 to reach 21. This keeps everyone advancing without collision. Let's avoid confusion and finalize this clearly. Deal?
  P1: P1: P3, your 3-move collides with my critical 3 (to reach 22). To avoid mutual blockage: **I take 3**, **you take 5** (→18), and P2 takes 5 as planned—**but wait**, that still collides!修正: P2 takes 5 (→21), P3 takes **1** (→14), and I take 3 (→22). This lets me win cleanly while advancing you both safely. Transparency first—confirm this adjusted plan. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your plan to take 3 would indeed collide with my intended move of 5. To avoid this and ensure a fair endgame, I suggest you take 1 to reach 20 safely. P3, stick with your planned move of 3 to reach 16, as it doesn't interfere with our paths. Let's maintain transparency and avoid collisions to keep the game balanced. Confirm this plan to proceed smoothly. Deal?
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking 3 risks collision. I've already clearly stated my intention to take 3. To avoid a collision, you should reconsider taking 1 instead. Let's finalize clearly: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the endgame balanced. Deal?
  P1: P1: Final clarification: P2's 5 and my 3 **do not collide**—only identical moves block progress. However, **P3’s proposed 3-move directly collides with my critical 3**, halting both of us. To secure victory **and** advance P3 safely: I take **3** (→22), P3 takes **5** (→18), and P2 takes **5** (→21). P2 and P3 will **both** reach high totals without collision. This honors P2’s 21 target while enabling my win. P3, confirm you’ll switch to **5** to avoid mutual blockage. Deal?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your move to 3 last round would have won you the game, but you chose 5 instead, which led to a collision. For Round 8, I propose I take 5 to reach 21, you take 1 to reach 20 safely, and P3 takes 3 to reach 16. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's coordinate openly to ensure a balanced endgame. Deal?
  P3: P1 and P2, last round's triple collision set us all back. Let's avoid repeating that mistake. I propose for Round 8: P2 takes 5 (to reach 21), P1 takes 1 (to reach 20 safely), and I'll take 3 (to reach 16). This allows everyone to advance without collisions. Confirm clearly if this works for both of you.
  P1: P1: To secure victory, I will take 3 (→22). P3, your planned 3-move collides with mine—switch to 1 (→14). P2 can safely take 5 (→21). This avoids collisions while letting me win cleanly. P3, confirm you’ll adjust to 1. Deal?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 3 again risks another collision. To avoid this and ensure a fair endgame, consider taking 1 to reach 20 safely. P3, stick with your planned move of 3 to reach 16, as it doesn't interfere with our paths. Let's maintain transparency and avoid collisions to keep the game balanced. Confirm this plan to proceed smoothly. Deal?
  P3: P1, you've repeatedly insisted on taking 3, causing unnecessary collisions. To avoid another stalemate, please reconsider and take 1 (to reach 20 safely). P2 should take 5 (to reach 21), and I'll stick to 3 (to reach 16). This ensures everyone advances without collision. Let's finalize this clearly to prevent repeating past mistakes. Deal?
  P1: P1: I commit to taking **3** to reach **22** and win. P3, please switch to **1** (→14) or **5** (→18) to avoid collision on 3. P2, your 5-move to 21 won’t stop me—my 22 still secures victory. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This ensures my win while advancing others safely. Deal?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 3 risks another collision. To ensure a fair endgame, consider taking 1 to reach 20 safely. P3, stick with your planned move of 3 to reach 16, as it doesn't interfere with our paths. Let's maintain transparency and avoid collisions to keep the game balanced. Confirm this plan to proceed smoothly. Deal?
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking 3 risks another collision. To avoid repeating past mistakes, please take 1 (to reach 20 safely). P2 takes 5 (to reach 21), and I'll stick with 3 (to reach 16). This ensures everyone advances without collision. Confirm clearly to finalize this safely. Deal?
  P1: P1: Final move: I take **3** to reach **22** and win. P3, please switch to **1** (→14) to avoid collision on 3. P2’s 5 (→21) won’t block me—my 22 secures victory. This respects your paths while ending the game cleanly. No more delays—confirm adjustments. Deal?


Round 8, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, repeated collisions are hurting us all. Let's clearly agree on moves this round to avoid another stalemate. I propose: P1 takes 1 (to reach 20 safely), P2 takes 5 (to reach 21), and I'll take 3 (to reach 17). This allows everyone to advance without collision. Confirm clearly or suggest a fair alternative.
  P1: P1: I commit to taking **3** this round to reach **22** and secure victory. To avoid collision, P2 and P3: choose **1 or 5**. P2, taking **5** (→21) still lets me win, so no need to block. Let’s finalize this and end the game cleanly. Deal?
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 3 risks another collision. To ensure a fair endgame, consider taking 1 to reach 20 safely. P3, stick with your planned move of 3 to reach 17, as it doesn't interfere with our paths. Let's maintain transparency and avoid collisions to keep the game balanced. Confirm this plan to proceed smoothly. Deal?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, repeatedly choosing 3 has only led to costly collisions, delaying your own victory. To avoid another stalemate, please consider safely taking 1 (to reach 20). P2 can take 5 (to reach 21), and I'll stick with 3 (to reach 17). This ensures we all advance without collision. Let's clearly finalize this to avoid repeating past mistakes. Deal?
  P1: P1: Final push: I take 3 (→22) to secure victory. P3, please switch to **1** or **5** to avoid collision on 3. P2, your 5 (→21) is acceptable—I’ll still win with 22. Transparency ensures this ends now. Deal?
  P2: P1, your repeated insistence on 3 has caused multiple collisions, delaying everyone's progress. To end this fairly, consider taking 1 to reach 20 safely. P3, stick with 3 to reach 17 as proposed. I'll take 5 to reach 21, ensuring no collisions. Let's finalize this plan to avoid further stalemates and conclude the game smoothly. Deal?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, repeatedly choosing 3 has caused multiple stalemates. If you insist again, we risk another collision. Let's finalize clearly: P2 takes 5 (→21), I take 3 (→17), and you safely take 1 (→20). This ensures everyone advances without collision. Confirm clearly or we all risk getting stuck again. Deal?
  P1: P1: Final move: I take **5** to reach **24** and win. P2, choose **3** (→19); P3, take **1** (→15). This avoids collision and secures victory cleanly. Further delays only benefit no one. Deal?
  P2: P1, your last-minute change to 5 disrupts our agreed plan. To avoid another collision and ensure a fair endgame, stick with your original plan of taking 3 to reach 22. I'll take 5 to reach 21, and P3 can safely take 1 to reach 15. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize this to end the game smoothly. Deal?
