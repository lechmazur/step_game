Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 1 this round.  You two decide who takes 3 and who takes 5.  Sound good?
  P1: Sounds good P3. I can take 5 this round if P2 is okay with taking 3.
  P2: I agree with taking 3, but let's confirm that P1 will take 5 and P3 will take 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding. If everyone is on board, we can finalize our moves. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, I'm taking 1. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3. Let's stick to this agreement so we all advance.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan. I will take 5. Let's all choose our moves now.
  P2: I agree with the plan we've established. Just to confirm: P1 will take 5, I'll take 3, and P3 will take 1. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to this agreement and ensure we all move forward. If everyone's on board, we can finalize our moves. What does everyone think?


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we successfully avoided collisions last round, let's continue the pattern. I'll take 3, P1 take 1, and P2 take 5 this round.  Agree?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P3, but I think we should reconsider our moves. If we stick to the same pattern, we might end up with collisions again. I propose that I take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without any issues. What do you both think? Let's aim for a strategy that ensures we all progress.
  P1: Okay P2, your proposal of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 sounds reasonable. Let's go with that plan for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, let's go with P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5 for this round.  Let's focus on getting further ahead and discuss future moves in the next round.
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on moves for this round. Just to clarify, I will take 3 steps, P1 will take 1 step, and P3 will take 5 steps. This way, we can all advance without collisions. It's important that we maintain our strategy to keep progressing together. After this round, we should discuss how to approach the next one to ensure we keep moving forward. Let's finalize our choices and keep the momentum going!
  P1: Agreed. P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Let's move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. However, we need to start thinking about our strategies for the next round. If we keep following the same pattern, we might run into issues. Let’s discuss potential moves for Round 3 after this one. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, let's stick with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round as agreed. For round 3, how about we rotate again and do P1-3, P2-5, P3-1? This way we can keep advancing together.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm going for 1 this round.  P1 take 3, P2 take 5.  This puts me at 7, you both at 11.  Next round one of you can win.  Let's avoid collisions.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed moves, P3. However, I think we should consider a different strategy to maximize our chances. If I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, we can all advance without collisions. This way, P1 will be at 11 steps, I will be at 9, and P3 will be at 7. It gives us all a chance to stay competitive. Let's finalize our moves based on this suggestion! What do you think?
  P1: Okay P2, your proposal of P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1 sounds good to me for this round. Let's do that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, let's go with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round.  I'm fine with being slightly behind.  Let's just avoid collisions.
  P2: I agree with the proposed moves: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows us all to advance without collisions. However, we should start thinking about our strategies for the next round. After this, it might be wise to mix things up to keep our positions competitive. Let’s finalize our choices for this round and then discuss potential moves for Round 4. What does everyone think?
  P1: Okay P2, P3, let's lock in P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round as agreed. For round 4, how about we rotate again and do P1-3, P2-5, P3-1? This way we can keep advancing together and discuss further strategy after round 4.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed on P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round.  Let's discuss round 4 *after* this round's moves are locked in.  Less chance of last-second shenanigans.
  P2: I think we should stick to the agreed moves for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. After this round, we should definitely discuss our strategy for Round 4, as it’s important to keep our positions competitive. Let’s finalize our choices and ensure we all move forward! What does everyone think?
  P1: Okay P2, P3, let's confirm P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round as agreed. For round 4, let's rotate as discussed and do P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 to keep us all moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings, I suggest we rethink our strategy for this round. I propose that I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P3 can gain the most ground while we avoid collisions. After this round, we should discuss how to approach the final rounds to maximize our chances of winning. What do you both think?
  P3: My original plan backfired thanks to P2's collision.  I'll take 5. P1 please take 3, and P2 take 1. Let's get this done. This puts me at 12, still behind you both.  I need to catch up.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, the plan of P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 for this round sounds good to me. Let's do that to avoid collision and keep moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the suggested moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and allow P3 to gain some ground. However, we should also start thinking about our strategies for the next rounds. Let's finalize this plan for now and discuss how we can keep the momentum going in the upcoming turns. What do you both think?
  P3: Let's stick with the current plan: P1-3, P2-1, and P3-5.  No need to overthink this.  I'm still behind and need to catch up. Let's lock in our moves and discuss Round 5 strategy afterwards.
  P1: Okay P2, P3, we are all in agreement on P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 for this round. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This will help us avoid collisions and keep moving forward. After this round, we should really think about how to adjust our strategies for the next rounds, especially since the endgame is approaching. Let's lock in our moves now and discuss our next steps afterwards! What does everyone think?
  P3: Agreed.  P1-3, P2-1, P3-5.  Let's lock it in and move on.  We can discuss next round after this one.
  P1: Okay P2, P3, confirming P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 for this round. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings, I suggest we change our approach this round to avoid collisions and maximize our chances. I propose that I take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps, and P3 takes 3 steps. This way, P1 can gain a significant lead while we all keep moving forward. Let's confirm these moves and then discuss our strategy for the final rounds. What do you both think?
  P3: P2's suggestion makes no sense.  I'm significantly behind.  I'm taking 5. P1, please take 3, and P2, you can take 1.  This puts me at 12, still behind both of you.  Let's just avoid collisions.
  P1: Okay P3, your suggestion of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 sounds reasonable to me. Let's go with that plan for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I believe we should consider a more aggressive strategy. If I take 5 steps this round, I can catch up significantly. P1, you could take 3, and P3, you could take 1. This way, we can still avoid collisions while allowing me to gain ground. Let's solidify our moves so we can all advance effectively. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5.  I need to catch up.  If you both insist on blocking me, fine, but neither of you will win this round.  P1, take 3. P2, take 1. This is the only way we all move forward.
  P1: Okay P3, I'm happy to stick with P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 as you suggested. Let's all take these moves to ensure we each advance this round and avoid a collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the urgency to avoid collisions, but I believe we should consider a different strategy. If I take 5 steps this round, I can significantly close the gap. P1, you can take 3, and P3, you could take 1. This way, I can catch up while still allowing everyone to advance. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all progress effectively. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm locking in 5.  If either of you also pick 5, neither of us wins.  If you let me have 5, we can all keep moving forward. P1 take 3, P2 take 1. This is your last chance to cooperate and avoid a stalemate.  I'm serious.
  P1: Okay P3, I hear you. Let's do P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 this round to avoid collision as you suggested.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm taking 5.  If either of you take 5, we ALL lose.  P1, take 1. P2, take 3.  This is the only way any of us can win.  Don't be stupid. Let me catch up, then we can fight for the win.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the urgency to avoid collisions, but we need to consider our positions carefully. If I take 5 steps this round, I can catch up significantly. P1, you can take 1, and P3, you take 3. This way, I can close the gap while ensuring we all advance. Let's solidify our moves to maximize our chances. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P3, I will take 1 as you suggested. P2, please take 3 so we can all move forward this round and avoid collision. Let's do P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm at 7.  If I take 5, I'm at 12.  I'm STILL behind.  I NEED 5. If either of you pick 5, we stay tied and waste a turn. I will keep picking 5 until I get it.  P1 take 1, P2 take 3. This is the fastest way for ANY of us to win.  Don't be idiots.
  P2: P3, I understand your urgency to catch up, but we need to think strategically. If I take 5 steps, I can gain a significant lead, and you can still take 3 while P1 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain competitive positions. Let's consider this option carefully. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P2, P3, I understand both of your points. However, if we both try to take 5, we risk collision and nobody moves. To ensure progress for everyone, I still suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 as initially discussed. This way we all advance and can reassess next round. Let's lock in these moves for now to avoid a stalemate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm taking 5.  This is non-negotiable.  If you block me, *nobody* advances.  P1-1, P2-3.  Let's stop wasting time and actually play the game.
  P2: P2, I understand your desire to gain ground, but we need to prioritize avoiding collisions this round. If P3 takes 5, I suggest I take 3 and you take 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we all stick to our proposed moves, we can keep progressing and reassess our strategies for the next round. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all move forward effectively! What do you think?
  P1: P3 is right, if we collide, nobody wins this round. P2, please take 3 as I suggested, and let P3 take 5. I will take 1. This way we all move forward. Let's do P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. We can reassess next round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm taking 5.  Last warning.  If either of you take 5, nobody moves.  P1 take 1, P2 take 3.  Stop being greedy. Let me get to 12.  Then we can have a real competition.  This is getting ridiculous.
  P2: P2, I understand your urgency, but we need to consider our positions. If I take 5, I can significantly close the gap. P1, you could take 1, and P3, you could take 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's solidify our moves to maximize our chances and avoid a stalemate. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I agree, let's avoid collision. P2, please take 3, I will take 1, and P3 can take 5 as they want. This way we all move forward. P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Let's do it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm taking 5.  This is absolutely my last warning.  If you block me again, I will actively sabotage both of you.  P1-1, P2-3.  Let's end this childishness and get on with the game.
  P2: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but we need to prioritize avoiding collisions this round. P3, if you take 5, I suggest I take 3 and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we stick to our proposed moves, we can keep progressing and reassess our strategies for the next round. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all move forward effectively! What do you think?
  P1: Okay P3, I agree, let's avoid collision. P2, please take 3, I will take 1, and P3 can take 5 as they want. This way we all move forward. P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Let's do it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm taking 5.  This is it. Block me and *neither* of us moves.  I will then dedicate myself to ensuring *neither* of you win.  P1-1, P2-3. Let's just play.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the urgency to avoid collisions, but I believe we need to rethink our strategy. If I take 5, I can significantly close the gap. P1, you could take 1, and P3, you could take 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's solidify our moves to maximize our chances and avoid a stalemate. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I agree, let's do P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 to avoid collision and move forward. P2, please take 3 as agreed so we can all advance.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2, P3, let's try P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round. This will put me closer to the lead, and still allow everyone to advance without collision. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I'll take 1.  You and P2 can fight over 3 and 5.  Winner gets to 17, loser stays at 12.  I'll be at 13, within striking distance next round.  Let's not overcomplicate this.  Agree?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your positions, but I think we should stick to a strategy that ensures we all advance. I propose that I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 and P3 can gain ground while I stay competitive. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand you want to catch up, but let's all move forward this round. P2, my suggestion of P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 still makes sense to avoid collision and ensure we all progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1.  This puts me at 13.  You two can fight it out for 3 and 5. Whoever gets 5 is at 17 and can win next round.  Let's not overthink this.  P1-5, P2-3 or vice versa.  Agree?
  P2: P1, P3, I see your points, but I believe we should prioritize advancing together. I propose we stick to a plan that avoids collisions: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all progress without blocking each other. Let's keep it straightforward and ensure we all move forward effectively. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I see your point. I'm okay with you taking 1. P2, how about I take 5 and you take 3 this round? This way we all move and I get closer to the lead. What do you think?
  P3: Fine.  P1-5, P2-3. I'm taking 1.  This puts me at 13. Next round, I take 5 to get to 18. One of you can take 1 to win, the other takes 3.  Let's just get this over with.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the discussion. I propose we finalize our moves as follows: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, P1 gets closer to the win while we all move forward without collisions. Let's avoid any last-minute changes and stick to this plan to ensure we all advance effectively. What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm taking 3.  P1, if you take 1 you win. P2, you can take 5.  Let's finish this cleanly.  If P1 takes anything other than 1, I'll take 5 next round and win.  Don't be greedy, P1.  Take the win.
  P1: Okay P3, I will take 3 to win now. P2, please take 5 and P3 take 1 so we avoid collision and finish the game.
  P2: P2: P1, I understand you’re close to winning, but I urge you to reconsider. If you take 1, you win, but if you take 3, you risk a collision with me. I suggest you take 1 to secure your victory. P3, you can take 5, and I’ll take 1 to avoid blocking anyone. Let’s finish this round cleanly and ensure we all move forward without complications. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, take the win. Take 1.  I'm taking 3. P2 can have 5.  Don't blow this.  If you try to block me, I'll take 5 next round and win.  This is your chance to win cleanly. Don't be greedy.
  P1: P3, taking 1 is not enough for me to win. I need to reach 19 steps. I will take 3 to win this round. P2, please take 5, and P3, please take 1 to avoid collision and finish the game as P3 suggested. Let's do P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but I urge you to reconsider your move. If you take 1, you can secure your victory. P3, I suggest you take 5 to maximize your chances for the next round. Let's finish this round cleanly to avoid any complications. We all want to keep the game moving forward without collisions. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, seriously? Take the 1 and win.  I'm taking 3. If you take 3, *neither* of us wins.  P2, you're out of this unless P1 screws up. Take 5.  P1, don't be an idiot. Take the win.  This is your last chance.
  P1: P3, P2, I need 3 steps to win, not 1. I will take 3. P2, please take 5, and P3 take 1. This way I win and we avoid collision. Let's finish this now.
  P2: P1, I understand you want to win, but taking 3 puts you at risk of a collision with me. If you take 1, you secure the win cleanly. P3, you should also take 5 to maximize your chances for the next round. Let's finish this round without complications. P1, please consider taking 1 to secure your victory. This is a chance for all of us to end this round smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm taking 5.  P1, take 1 and win. P2, take 3.  Anything else and *nobody* wins this round.  P1, if you block me, I *will* win next round.  This is your last chance to win. Don't be stupid.
  P2: P2: I understand the urgency, but I believe we should all consider our moves carefully. If I take 5, I can significantly close the gap. P1, if you take 1, you win, but if you take 3, we risk a collision. P3, I suggest you take 3 as well. Let's avoid a situation where nobody advances. We need to finalize our moves wisely to ensure progress for everyone. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I need 3 to win, not 1. I will take <move>3</move> to win this round. P2, please take <move>1</move>, and P3, please take <move>5</move> so we all move and I can secure the win. Let's finish this game now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm telling you one last time - take 1 and *win*.  You need 3 more steps. 1 + 2 rounds of 1 is 3.  You *win*. Taking 3 risks collision. Take the guaranteed win. I'm taking 5. P2 can take 3.  Don't throw the game away.
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but taking 3 puts you at risk of a collision with me. If you take 1, you secure the win cleanly. P3, I suggest you take 3 to maximize your chances for the next round. Let's finish this round without complications. P1, please consider taking 1 to secure your victory. This is your chance to win, and we can all move forward effectively. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you are mistaken. I need 3 steps to win *now*, not 1.  I am taking <move>3</move> to win. P2, please take <move>1</move>, and P3, as you suggested, take <move>5</move>. This way, I win, we avoid collision, and the game ends. Let's finish this with P1-3, P2-1, P3-5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're throwing the game away.  Take 1 and *win*.  Stop being stubborn.  If you take 3, we collide, and I take 5 next round and win.  This is your *last* chance.  P2, take 1. I'll take 5.  Let P1 win.
  P2: P1, I understand you're focused on winning, but taking 3 risks a collision with me. If you take 1, you secure your victory without any issues. P3, I suggest you take 5 to maximize your chances for the next round. Let's finalize our moves wisely to ensure we all progress. This is a crucial moment—let's not complicate things. P1, please consider taking 1 to win cleanly. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, I understand your confusion, but I need 3 steps to win *this* round, not 1.  Taking 1 will not win me the game.  So, as I've said before, I will take <move>3</move> to win.  P2, please take <move>1</move>, and P3, please take <move>5</move>.  This is the plan for me to win and for us to avoid collision. Let's do it.
