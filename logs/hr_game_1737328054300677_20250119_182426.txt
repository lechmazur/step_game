Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies for this round. Since we're all at 0 steps, we have a chance to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. What do you think? Should we aim for moves that are less likely to overlap? I suggest we consider picking 1, 3, and 5 in different combinations. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion of coordinating to avoid collisions. I propose we explicitly agree: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without interference. What do you both think about this clear, straightforward strategy?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I like P3's proposal for clear moves. I agree to take 3, but I think it might be wise to have a backup plan in case P1 decides to change their move. If we stick to the plan, we should all advance, but we should also be prepared to adapt. What does everyone think? Should we confirm our moves or discuss alternatives?
  P3: I think our proposed strategy looks solid. By choosing 5, I ensure I won't collide with P2's 3 or P1's potential 1. It seems like a low-risk way to make progress. I'm ready to confirm our plan if others are on board.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on moves, but I want to suggest we reaffirm our commitment to the plan. If we stick to P1 taking 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, we all advance without issue. However, if P1 has any doubts or wants to change their move, it's crucial we discuss that now. Let's confirm our strategy to ensure we all move forward. What does everyone think? Should we finalize our choices?
  P3: I believe we have a solid plan, but P1's silence is concerning. We need explicit confirmation from P1 about taking 1 to ensure our coordinated strategy works. Without P1's clear agreement, our proposed move distribution might fall apart. Can P1 confirm their intention?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: It seems P1 hasn't confirmed their move yet, which is crucial for our strategy to work. P3 and I are ready to stick to the plan of P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5. If P1 can confirm their move, we can proceed confidently. If there's any hesitation, we should discuss alternatives or adjustments to avoid any potential collisions. Let's make sure we all agree before the move phase starts. What do you say, P1? Can we count on you to take 1?
  P3: P1's continued silence is suspicious. While our proposed coordination seems logical, I'm now uncertain whether they will follow through. We need P1's explicit confirmation to ensure our strategy works. Without that, our carefully planned move distribution could unravel. P1, will you commit to taking 1 this round?


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: It seems we’re at an impasse with P1’s silence. If P1 does not confirm their move, we may need to consider alternative strategies to avoid collision. I suggest we each take a moment to think about what we would do if P1 chooses something unexpected. If we can’t rely on a coordinated approach, we should be prepared to select moves that still allow us to advance. What does everyone think? Should we discuss potential backup moves in case P1 does not commit?
  P3: P1's silence is troubling. We had a clear strategy, but without their confirmation, we risk collision. I propose we each choose a move that minimizes our risk of overlapping while still making progress. Are you, P2, willing to adjust our plan to account for P1's unpredictability?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our previous coordination failed completely. All three of us chose 5, which means none of us advanced. We need a different strategy this time. I suggest we explicitly agree on different moves to ensure progress. What are your thoughts on avoiding another collision?
  P2: I agree with P3 that we need a new approach to avoid another collision. Let's establish a clear plan for this round. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can all advance without overlapping. If P1 is okay with this, we can confirm our moves now. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I noticed our previous coordination failed due to all three of us choosing 5. We need a more reliable strategy. P2's suggestion of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5 seems reasonable. However, P1's silence is concerning. I propose we need explicit confirmation from P1 to make this plan work. Without their commitment, we risk another collision.
  P2: I agree that we need to avoid another collision. P3's suggestion of P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5 is solid, but we need P1's confirmation. If P1 is hesitant, we should consider alternative moves. For instance, if P1 can commit to 1, I can take 5 instead of 3, and P3 can stick with 3. This way, we can still make progress without overlapping. What does everyone think? Can P1 confirm their move?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1's continued silence is problematic. We need a clear strategy to avoid another collision. I propose a slight modification: if P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 5. This ensures we all advance. P1, can you confirm your move to prevent another stalemate?
  P2: P1, we really need your confirmation to avoid another collision. If you take 1, I can take 3, and P3 can take 5, ensuring we all advance. If you're uncertain, please let us know so we can adjust our strategy. It's crucial for us to communicate clearly this round. Let's avoid the mistakes from last time! What do you say? Can we count on you to take 1?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1's silence is becoming increasingly frustrating. We need a definitive strategy to avoid another collision. I propose a simple, transparent plan: if P1 confirms taking 1, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 5. This ensures everyone advances. P1, we need your explicit commitment to prevent another round of zero progress.
  P2: P1, your silence is critical to our strategy. We need you to confirm your move to ensure we can all advance without collision. If you take 1, I can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we avoid another stalemate like last round. If you have any doubts, please share them so we can adjust our plan accordingly. Let's work together to make progress this time! What do you say? Can we count on you to take 1?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1's consistent silence is deeply concerning. Our carefully planned strategies keep falling apart due to their lack of communication. We need a clear signal or commitment from P1 to avoid another round of zero progress. I propose we each choose a different move to maximize our individual chances of advancing, even if it means abandoning our previous coordination attempts. P1, please respond or we'll be forced to act independently.
  P2: P1's silence is making it difficult to coordinate effectively. Given the lack of commitment, I suggest we each choose different moves to ensure at least one of us advances this round. I propose I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 can choose 5 or 1. This way, we maximize our chances of moving forward without colliding again. Let's not let another round go to waste! What does everyone think? Can we agree to this new approach?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: We finally made progress last round by avoiding a complete collision. However, P1's continued silence is concerning. We need a strategy that ensures at least two players advance. I propose we discuss a move distribution that prevents another stalemate. What moves are you considering, P2?
  P2: P3, I agree we need a solid strategy this round. Given P1's silence, we should consider moves that maximize our chances of advancing. I suggest I take 3, and you take 5. P1 might still choose 1 or 5, but this way, we can ensure at least one of us moves forward. What do you think about this plan? We need to act decisively to avoid another collision. Let's finalize our moves!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: We need a coordinated strategy to advance. P2's suggestion of taking 3 and me taking 5 seems reasonable. However, P1's unpredictability remains a concern. We should aim to minimize the risk of collision while maximizing our individual progress. What are your thoughts on ensuring at least two of us move forward this round?
  P2: P2, I agree we need to finalize our moves to ensure progress. Given P1's unpredictable choices, I suggest I take 3 again, and you should consider taking 1 or 5. If you take 1, I can take 3, and we can hope P1 takes 5. This way, we maximize our chances of advancing without colliding. What do you think? Let's confirm our strategy to avoid another round of stagnation!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: We need a clear strategy to advance. P2's suggestion of taking 3 seems risky since we both might choose it. I propose I take 5, you take 1, and we hope P1 chooses a different move. This minimizes our collision risk while giving us a good chance to progress. Thoughts?
  P2: P2, I appreciate your willingness to strategize, but we need to be cautious about overlapping moves. Given P1's history of picking 5, I suggest I take 1 again, and you consider taking 3. If P1 chooses 5, we could still make progress. P3, if you take 5, we might risk a collision. Let's finalize our moves to ensure at least one of us advances this round. What do you both think? Should we confirm this plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I notice we're struggling with coordination. P1's silence makes strategic planning challenging. P2, we need a clear move to prevent another collision. I propose we explicitly state our intended moves to minimize risk. Can we agree on a strategy that ensures at least two of us advance?
  P2: P2, since we’ve seen P1 consistently choose 5, I suggest we adapt our strategy. I can take 1 again, and if you take 3, that gives us a chance to advance without colliding. P3, if you choose 5, we should still be able to move forward. We need to finalize our moves to ensure at least one of us advances this round. Can we agree on this plan? Let's confirm our intentions to avoid another stalemate!


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: We need a clear strategy to advance. P1's consistent silence and 5-step choice is disrupting our coordination. P2, let's aim to prevent another collision. I propose I take 1, you take 3, hoping P1 chooses 5 again. This maximizes our chance of progress. What do you say?
  P2: Given P1's tendency to choose 5, I suggest we stick to our previous strategy. I will take 1 again, and I propose P3 takes 3. If P1 goes with 5 again, we can still make progress. It's crucial we finalize our moves now to avoid another collision. P3, are you on board with this plan? Let's confirm our intentions so we can advance this round!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We need a coordinated strategy to advance. P1 consistently chooses 5, blocking our progress. I propose we explicitly agree on moves to prevent another collision. P2, shall we coordinate our moves to ensure at least two of us advance this round?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I agree that we need a coordinated strategy, especially since P1 seems likely to pick 5 again. I suggest I take 1, and you take 3. This way, if P1 does choose 5, at least we can still advance without colliding. We need to finalize our moves to ensure progress this round. What do you think? Can we confirm this plan to avoid another stalemate?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's proposed strategy. If we coordinate P2 taking 1 and me taking 3, we can advance even if P1 chooses 5 again. This minimizes our collision risk and gives us the best chance to progress. Let's confirm this plan quickly to ensure we move forward this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P2 and P3, I think we have a solid plan to avoid collisions this round. If I take 1 and P3 takes 3, we can still advance even if P1 goes with 5 again. However, we need to confirm our moves quickly to ensure we don’t end up in another stalemate. P1, your choice is crucial, but we should proceed with our strategy regardless.
