Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about we each pick a different number so we all advance this turn? Let’s coordinate: P1 picks 1, I will choose 3, and P3 goes for 5. Then nobody collides and we all move closer to 24. Any thoughts?
  P3: Okay, P2, that sounds reasonable for this first turn. I'll go with 5 as you suggested. Let's all advance.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but I’m wary of predictable coordination. I’ll be keeping my move flexible and secret. Let’s each follow our own strategies and see who comes out ahead.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, cautious or not, we’d all gain by avoiding collisions on this first turn. Sticking to distinct moves is safest: P3 is leaning 5, I’m inclined to choose 3, so if you take 1, we can all advance. If you have a better plan, let’s hear it now; otherwise, let’s ensure someone’s not left behind.
  P3: P1, it seems like you're the only one not wanting to coordinate. If you choose 1, we all move forward. If you don't, there's a chance you'll be left behind. It's your choice, but I'm hoping you'll consider the benefits of this initial cooperation.
  P1: Predictability can be a trap. I'm leaning toward a less conventional play this turn—keeping my move flexible might allow me to capitalize if either of you makes a misstep. Good luck advancing, and let’s see how it unfolds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, think carefully. If you aim for 3 or 5, you risk clashing with me or P3; none of us would advance. If you choose 1, we all move and stay in contention together. I’d rather avoid stalling anyone on the very first turn. Your call.
  P3: P1, you're being unnecessarily difficult. We're not trying to trick each other; we're trying to get started. You're risking a collision and stalling us all. We've offered a simple solution for this first turn. If you're not going to play along, at least tell us what you're planning.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea, but I’m leaning into unpredictability. I believe keeping my move flexible now sets me up for a stronger strategic edge later. Best of luck to both of you as we see how this unfolds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, my offer still stands: distinct moves help us all advance. If we collide, we lose ground unnecessarily. Picking 1 for you, 3 for me, and 5 for P3 ensures we all move. If you insist on unpredictable play, so be it—but that might only benefit the rest of us. After this turn, the dynamic changes. Let’s each move forward now and keep our options open for later.
  P3: P1, you're clearly set on your strategy. I'm still going with 5 as agreed with P2. P2, are you still choosing 3? If so, P1 will either have to choose 1 to advance or risk colliding with one of us.
  P1: I stand by my unpredictable strategy. I see you both are leaning into fixed moves, but I’m keeping my options open to adapt as needed. Let’s see how the risks play out—good luck, and may the best strategy win.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I now have a small lead, but collisions hurt everyone—especially those trying to catch up. Let’s avoid repeating last turn’s clash. I propose we each pick distinct moves this round so we all advance. If we keep colliding, I’ll only extend my lead. Let’s settle on a plan ensuring no overlap.
  P1: I see the merit in avoiding collisions, but I’m tempted by a slightly riskier play to close that gap if things go awry. I'm leaning towards a moderate, flexible move this turn—staying safe if coordination works but ready to capitalize if not. P3, what’s your thinking on this?
  P3: P1, I agree with P2 that collisions are bad. I'm willing to coordinate again to avoid them. What move would you be willing to make if P2 and I pick different numbers? P2, I'm still open to suggestions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid another collision, I suggest clear assignments. For example, P1 picks 1, I’ll take 3 again, and P3 picks 5—guaranteeing we all advance. If you prefer another combination, I’m open, but we must ensure no overlaps. Collisions only help me maintain my lead, so it’s in both your interests to coordinate.
  P1: I appreciate the logic behind predicting non-collision outcomes. However, I'm still keeping my move flexible. While a safe, coordinated plan avoids immediate friction, sometimes a well-timed bold move can break the stalemate and push me ahead. I’m prepared to adapt if things shift unexpectedly. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P1, your flexibility is costing us all. P2, I'm still willing to coordinate. P1, are you willing to commit to a number this round, or are you going to cause another collision? Let's all try to move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All these collisions only strengthen my position, but I’d rather see us all advance. Let’s avoid crashing again: P1 picks 1, I will choose 3, and P3 picks 5. If we coordinate, nobody stalls. If you two want to clash, that’s your call—my lead remains untouched.
  P1: I appreciate the push for clear coordination, but I’m sticking with my flexible approach this turn. I believe keeping options open gives me the best chance to capitalize if things go off schedule. Best of luck with your moves—let’s see who benefits from a deviation.
  P3: P1, your "flexible approach" is just stalling us all. P2, I'm still in for the 5. P1, if you don't pick 1, you're just hurting yourself and me. Let's try to move forward this time. I'm willing to coordinate, but I need P1 to cooperate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m still eager to avoid collisions. P1, if you pick 1, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 5, we all move forward. If you choose otherwise, I stand to keep my lead. It’s your call.
  P1: I remain set on flexibility this turn. I’m watching how you both commit and will adapt my move for the best advantage. Let’s see how the round unfolds.
  P3: P1, your flexibility is just making it harder for everyone to advance, including yourself. P2 and I are trying to coordinate. I'm still going with 5. If you don't pick 1, you're just ensuring another collision. P2, are you still choosing 3? If so, let's hope P1 chooses 1 this time.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your "flexibility" is just making it harder for everyone to advance. P2 and I are trying to coordinate. I'm still going with 5. If you don't pick 1 again, you're just ensuring another collision. P2, are you still choosing 3? If so, let's hope P1 chooses 1 this time.
  P2: Collisions only help me keep my lead, but I’d prefer we all advance. I’m inclined to pick 3 if P1 commits to 1 and P3 sticks with 5. Otherwise, I’ll happily let another collision happen—your choice.
  P1: I see the merit in coordinating for now, but strict plans can sometimes be exploited later. I'm keeping my options open to capitalize if you deviate from safe play. Choose wisely—I'm ready to adapt based on your final commitments.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're clearly not going to cooperate. P2, I'm still going with 5. Let's see if P1 will finally choose 1, or if he'll just cause another collision. I'd prefer to advance, but I'm not going to be held back by P1's stubbornness.
  P2: I remain open to a collision-free outcome. If we coordinate distinct moves, we can all advance. But if you two end up colliding again, I’ll keep extending my lead. I’m still prepared to pick a distinct number—assuming P1 and P3 do likewise. Are we settling on a plan or risking another clash?
  P1: I now lean toward mutual progress—if we all commit to distinct moves, we can really advance this turn. I won’t reveal my final move, but I’d prefer we avoid collisions. Let’s try truly coordinating and ensure everyone makes a safe, unique choice.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm glad to see you're finally considering coordination. P2, I'm still planning on 5. P1, if you choose 1, we all move forward. Let's make this a productive round and avoid another collision. I'm hoping we can all advance this time.
  P2: I’m still ready to pick 3 if P1 goes with 1 and P3 sticks to 5—then we all move forward. If a collision happens again, I remain in the lead, but I’d prefer we all advance this round. Let’s finalize distinct moves so nobody stalls.
  P1: I appreciate the push for clear coordination. I'm leaning toward a safe, non-colliding option this round and expect distinct moves from everyone. Let’s all ensure we advance without unnecessary stalling—cooperation now can set us up well for the critical finish later.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm glad you're finally on board with coordination. P2, I'm still going with 5. P1, please pick 1. Let's all move forward this turn. I'm trusting that we can all make safe, unique choices this round. Let's make it happen.
  P2: I’ll pick 3 if P1 truly goes with 1 and P3 sticks to 5. Let’s finalize distinct moves and all advance. If there’s another collision, I remain ahead, but I’d prefer we each gain steps now. Your calls.
  P1: I'm locking in a distinct move this round. I trust we all want to avoid collisions and push ahead. Let’s finalize unique choices and see progress. My move remains secret.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm still going with 5. P1, it seems like you're the only one who might cause a collision. P2, are you still choosing 3? If so, let's hope P1 chooses 1, so we can all move forward. Let's try to make this a productive round.
  P2: I’m still willing to pick 3 if we can all agree on different moves. Otherwise, any collision just keeps me ahead. P3, you say you’ll pick 5 again, so P1 only needs to choose 1 to avoid overlap. If you two don’t coordinate properly, that’s your loss. I stand to gain either way.
  P1: I appreciate the push for a collision‐free round. I'm committed to a distinct move this turn and expect that if P2 sticks with 3 and P3 with 5, we all progress. Let’s aim for a clean round so we can all move forward, setting up for the final push.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm glad you're finally committed to a distinct move. P2, I'm still planning on 5. If P1 chooses 1 and you choose 3, we all advance. Let's make this a productive round and avoid another collision. I'm hoping we can all move forward this time.
  P2: I’m still open to picking 3 this time, but any slip-up from either of you keeps me in front. P3, if you're truly sticking with 5, P1 only needs to pick 1 and we all advance. If you collide again, my lead remains safe. Let’s see how committed you both are to a clean move.
  P1: I remain committed to selecting a distinct move this round. If P2 goes with 3 and P3 with 5, I’ll choose accordingly to avoid collisions. My final choice stays secret, but I urge us all to stick to non-overlapping moves—any deviation could shift the balance. Let’s use this round to build a strong position for the upcoming final push.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm still going with 5. P2, are you still choosing 3? If so, P1, please choose 1 so we all move forward this round. Let's avoid another collision and make some progress. I'm trusting we can all stick to our plans this time.
  P2: Collisions help maintain my lead, but I'd still rather we all move. P3, you’re taking 5, and I’m fine choosing 3 again. P1, if you pick 1, nobody collides. Let’s avoid another wasted turn. This cooperation puts us all closer to 24 without needless stalling.
  P1: I'm committed: I'll choose 1 this round. If we stick to P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5, we all secure a move. Let's avoid collisions and advance cleanly toward 24. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm glad you finally committed to 1. P2, are you still going with 3? I'm sticking with 5. Let's all move forward this round and avoid another collision. I'm trusting we can all make safe, unique choices this round.
  P2: I’m finalizing a plan to pick 3, assuming P1 chooses 1 and P3 goes with 5, so nobody collides. If either of you deviates, I maintain my lead anyway. Let’s keep it clean this round so we all advance and save the real fight for later. Good luck.
  P1: I'm confirming my commitment to 1 this round. Let’s stick to our distinct moves so we can all advance steadily. Keeping safe now sets us up for sharper plays later. I trust you both will honor your moves. Let's avoid unnecessary clashes and push toward the finish together.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m still happy to avoid collisions if it helps us all advance. If you both want distinct moves again—say P1 goes 1 and P3 goes 5—I’d likely choose 3 to keep it clean. Of course, any overlap just solidifies my lead. I’ll adapt based on your final choices. Let’s see if we can avoid stalling this round.
  P1: I appreciate the focus on a collision‐free round. I'm leaning toward a distinct move to ensure we all progress steadily. Let’s stick to unique choices so we can set up for a strong final push together.
  P3: P1, I'm still going with 5. P2, are you still choosing 3? If so, P1, please choose 1 so we all move forward. Let's try to make this a productive round and avoid another collision. I'm hoping we can all move forward this time.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m open to picking 3 if P1 genuinely goes with 1 and P3 sticks to 5. If we synchronize properly, we all advance. But if there’s any collision, I keep my lead. The choice is yours—coordinate for shared progress or risk stalling yourselves.
  P1: I'm sticking with a distinct and safe move this round. If we honor our commitments—P2 with 3 and P3 with 5—we all progress without collisions. Let's secure our steps now to be strategically positioned for that final push.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5 again. Let's try to make this a clean round. P1, if you choose 1 and P2 chooses 3, we all move forward. Let's avoid another collision and make some real progress. I'm trusting we can all stick to our plans this time.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still willing to choose 3 if you both stick to 1 and 5. So far, collisions have only helped me, but I’d prefer we all move forward. Let’s finalize distinct picks and avoid stalling. If you cooperate, great—we all gain. If not, my lead remains safe. Your call.
  P1: I'm committed to a clear round—I'll choose 1. I trust that if we stick to our distinct picks (P2 with 3 and P3 with 5), we'll all advance without collision. Let's secure our moves and set the stage for a strong final push.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still going with 5. Let's make this a clean round. P1, if you choose 1 and P2 chooses 3, we all move forward. I'm trusting we can all stick to our plans this time.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m willing to choose 3 if you both truly stick to 1 and 5. That way we all advance and avoid wasting another turn. If someone deviates, a collision just keeps me in front. Let’s finalize distinct picks and move forward.
  P1: I confirm I’ll stick with my distinct move of 1. With P2 leaning toward 3 and P3 on 5, we can all progress cleanly. I’m locked in for this round and trust we’ll each maintain our commitments to avoid collisions.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5. Let's make this a clean round. P1, if you choose 1 and P2 chooses 3, we all move forward. I'm trusting we can all stick to our plans this time and avoid another collision.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5 again this round. Let's keep the coordination going. If you both stick to your previous moves of 1 and 3 respectively, we all move forward. Let's avoid another collision and make some real progress. I'm trusting we can all stick to our plans this time.
  P2: We’ve done well avoiding collisions so far, but P3 is edging ahead. I’m interested in keeping our moves distinct, yet I won’t ignore the chance to catch up or even leap in front. If P3 insists on 5 while I stick to 3, the gap remains. Maybe we switch it up so P3 doesn’t gain too much ground. Either we settle on new, non-overlapping choices that help us all, or I might go bolder. It’s your call, P3—if you won’t budge, I might pick 5, and any collision hurts us both. Let’s see if we can cooperate effectively.
  P1: I'm locking in 1 this round. If we commit to safe, distinct moves—P2 with 3 and P3 with 5—we all advance. Reliable progress beats unnecessary risks, and I'll adapt if things change. Let's keep it clean and make our moves count.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree that we need to consider switching things up. I'm still planning on 5, but if you're going to try for 5, then we'll collide. P1, are you still choosing 1? If so, maybe P2 should try 3 again, or we should all consider new moves. Let's try to make this a productive round.
  P2: Let’s switch moves to balance our gains. P3, if you keep 5, I might match you to force a collision. Instead, consider picking 3 while I’ll go 5, and P1 can keep 1. That way, each of us advances without giving you a constant edge. I’m open to other ideas, but I’m not letting you pull too far ahead.
  P1: I remain committed to 1 this round. While I hear the discussion about switching moves, I believe safe, distinct choices keep us all moving forward. I’ll stick with 1, and I urge you both to avoid mid-round shifts that might lead to a collision. Let’s all aim for steady progress without costly clashes.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm willing to switch to 3 if you'll go to 5, and P1 stays with 1. That way we all advance, but I don't keep getting ahead. P1, are you still with 1? Let's make sure we all move this round.
  P2: P3, let’s finalize a swap. You pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and P1 sticks with 1 so all three of us advance without collisions. That way, you don’t keep edging ahead, and I can catch up a bit. If you refuse, I could also pick 5 and risk colliding with you. Let’s decide cleanly to avoid stalling. P1, please confirm you’ll stick with 1.
  P1: I'm locking in 1 this round. If we're swapping, I'll expect P3 to choose 3 and P2 to pick 5 so we all advance safely. Let's lock it in and avoid any collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm switching to 3 as discussed. P1, you're still going 1, and P2, you're going 5, right? Let's make sure we all move forward this round. I'm trusting we can all stick to this new plan and avoid a collision.
  P2: P3, if you truly go with 3, I’m ready to pick 5, and P1 sticks to 1. That ensures zero collisions and keeps everyone moving. Let’s solidify this swap and push forward together. Good luck.
  P1: I confirm I'm locking in 1 this round. Let's finalize the swap: P1=1, P3=3, and P2=5. I trust this safe play will help all of us move forward without a collision. Any deviation might be costly later, so let’s stick to our promise and secure our progress.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm at 5 steps and need a strong catch-up. I'm leaning toward an aggressive move—likely 5—this turn. If we all pick distinct moves, we all progress, but any deviation will be exploited. Let's aim for clean, non-colliding progress, yet I’m ready to adjust if plans suddenly change. Your moves?
  P2: Collisions keep me in front, so if you’re set on 5, P1, I might match it. But I’d prefer all of us advance without stalling. P3, you’re close on my tail, so let’s ensure our moves are distinct. For instance, if P1 insists on 5, perhaps you choose 1, and I’ll pick 3. I’m open to other distributions, too. Just know that if anyone tries to leapfrog me too aggressively, I won’t hesitate to force a collision. Let’s see how you respond.
  P3: P1, I'm not sure about your aggressive 5. P2, I agree we should try to avoid collisions. I'm willing to pick 1 if P1 chooses 5 and you go with 3. Let's make sure we all advance this turn. I'm open to other ideas, but let's be clear about our choices.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round with no change. I need a bold move to catch up, so if we’re avoiding collisions, I’m committed to 5. P3, if you’re comfortable with that, and P2 chooses 3, we all advance. Otherwise, I’m ready for whatever collision brings. Let’s be clear this round—no surprises.
  P2: P1, if you insist on 5, let’s have P3 pick 1 while I choose 3, so nobody collides. That way, we each gain steps, you close the gap, but I remain ahead, and P3 stays right behind. A collision could backfire on any of us later. Let’s lock in P1=5, P3=1, P2=3. Any objections?
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm fine with P1=5, P3=1, and P2=3. Let's make sure we all move forward this turn. I'll commit to 1 if you both stick with those moves. Let's avoid a collision and keep progressing.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm still committed to 5 this round. Let’s lock in the plan: I'll use 5, expecting P2 to pick 3 and P3 to select 1 to avoid collisions. We all benefit by moving safely. Any deviation may cost us—the clean, coordinated move is our best shot.
  P2: I’m fine with that plan: if P1 goes 5 and P3 goes 1, I’ll pick 3 so no one collides. But remember, collisions only protect my lead, so be sure this is really what you both want. Let’s proceed with distinct numbers—P1=5, P3=1, and me=3—and see how the round unfolds. Good luck.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 1 as planned. Let's finalize this round with P1=5, P2=3, and me=1 to avoid a collision. I'm trusting we can all stick to this plan and move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm our plan—I’m committing to 5. I expect P3 to choose 1 and P2 to stick with 3 so that we all advance cleanly. My move is aggressive out of necessity; if anyone wants to adjust this plan, speak now before we lock in our moves. Otherwise, let’s commit and avoid collisions.
  P2: I’m still inclined to pick 3 this turn if you both stick to 1 and 5. Any surprise deviation only cements my lead. But I’d rather see all three of us advance, so let’s finalize this distinct move setup and avoid wasting another turn. If we’re agreed, let’s proceed.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 1 as planned. Let's finalize this round with P1=5, P2=3, and me=1 to avoid a collision. Let's make sure we all move forward this turn.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm behind and may need to take a bolder approach this round. I prefer distinct moves so we all progress, but if safe play continues, I might force a disruption to catch up. Let's see if we can all move forward cleanly—or if predictable patterns can be exploited.
  P3: P1, I'm willing to stick with 1 again if P2 chooses 3 and you choose 5. P2, are you still willing to go with 3? If so, let's avoid a collision and make some progress. Let's try to keep the coordination going.
  P2: I’m open to sticking with 3 again if we all keep distinct picks—P1 takes 5, P3 goes 1. That keeps me safely ahead while letting you both advance. But if I see someone trying to leapfrog me or disrupt the plan, I’ll consider matching moves to force a collision. I’ll do whatever preserves my lead. Let’s keep it simple and avoid unnecessary risks this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still open to safe play if we all stay flexible—but don’t be surprised if I adjust mid-round to try and catch up. If the safest bet is distinct moves, I’ll cooperate. However, if rigidity sets in, I might force a disruption to level the playing field. Let’s see if we can make this round count.
  P3: P1, I'm still willing to go with 1 if P2 chooses 3 and you choose 5. P2, are you sticking with 3? Let's avoid a collision and keep moving forward. I'm open to other ideas, but let's be clear about our choices.
  P2: I’m still inclined to choose 3 if you two stick to 1 and 5, letting all of us advance. A collision just keeps my lead intact, but I’d rather we all progress. If P1 tries something risky, I’ll adapt—so don’t assume I’ll just cooperate blindly. Let’s keep distinct moves and avoid a stall.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m leaning toward 5 this round to try and catch up. If we agree on distinct choices—P2 sticking with 3 and P3 with 1—it’s a win–win. But if the plan shifts, I’ll adjust my move to maximize my progress. Please confirm your picks so we can all move forward safely.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still planning on 1 if you both stick to your previous moves of 5 and 3 respectively. Let's avoid another collision and make some progress. I'm trusting we can all stick to our plans this time.
  P2: I’m fine continuing distinct picks if you both truly take 1 and 5—nobody risks a collision, and we each gain steps. But if anyone tries something risky, I may match or shift to protect my lead. Let’s keep coordination this round so we all move closer to the finish and avoid sabotaging ourselves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'll lock in 5 this round. If we stick to our plan—P2 with 3 and P3 with 1—we all advance safely. I need that bold move to catch up, so please don’t change course last minute. Let’s commit to these distinct moves and move forward.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still planning on 1 if you both stick to your previous moves of 5 and 3 respectively. Let's avoid another collision and make some progress. I'm trusting we can all stick to our plans this time.
  P2: I’m still prepared to pick 3 if you both stick with 1 and 5. That way, we all move ahead without collisions this round. But if anyone tries to surprise me, I’ll quickly adapt—collisions only help me maintain my lead. Let’s keep it clean and push toward the finish.


Round 8, Move phase:

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm still open to coordination for a clean round, but I might pivot for a catch‐up if needed. I’d prefer distinct moves so we all advance, but I’ll choose my move based on clear commitments. Let’s be decisive this round—if you both commit, I’ll pick accordingly.
  P2: I’m poised to win soon and won’t let anyone leapfrog me. If you both avoid 5, I might pick it safely and end the game. If either of you tries for 5, I’ll match it, and we both stall while the other gains ground. It’s up to you whether we settle this now or delay further.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm still going with 1 if you two stick with 5 and 3 respectively. Let's avoid a collision and make some progress. We're all close to the finish line, so let's make sure we're all moving forward this turn.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm shifting strategy: I'm locking in 5 this turn, expecting P3 to stay with 1. P2, if you choose 3, you'll give me room to catch up; but if you try 5 for that safe win, I'll force a collision. Let's see who really dares for victory.
  P2: I’m on the verge of winning, so I won’t back down from using 5 if anyone else tries it. A collision would freeze us both while the other gains ground—still good for me. If you want me to choose 3 so all of us advance cleanly, commit to leaving 5 alone. Otherwise, prepare for a stall. Your choice.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm sticking with 1. P2, you're close to winning, but I'm not going to let you get there without a fight. P1, are you still going with 5? Let's see what happens this round. I'm hoping we can all move forward, but I'm ready for anything.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm still committed to 5. P3, please stick with 1 so we force P2 into a tough spot. P2, you’re on the verge, but if you risk 5, I'll collide and seize the moment. Either choose 3 for a clean round or face my full strategy. Let's see who really wins.
  P2: P1, if you insist on 5, I’ll match you. We’ll both stall while P3 inches forward. If you want me to pick 3 so you can grab 5 uncontested, think again; my lead is too important. Either back off that 5, or collide with me and waste your turn. P3, you’re free to do as you like, but a collision benefits you the most. I’m open to a clean round if it guarantees I stay ahead, yet I won’t hand over easy steps. Let’s see how bold each of you really is.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 1. P2, you're close to winning, but I'm not going to let you get there without a fight. P1, are you still going with 5? Let's see what happens this round. I'm hoping we can all move forward, but I'm ready for anything.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm keeping my 5. P3, please confirm your 1 to avoid a collision. P2, if you choose 5, we'll both stall, so consider switching to 3 so we all advance. I need clear moves now—let’s finalize a clean round or face a costly collision.
  P2: Look, I’m not handing you a free pass, P1. If you insist on 5, we could both stall—letting P3 inch closer. I’d rather progress safely, but I won’t hesitate to collide if it protects my lead. P3, you’re positioned to benefit if P1 and I clash. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we all move forward. I’m open to a clean outcome if it helps me maintain control. Otherwise, collisions merely delay the inevitable. Make your calls wisely—time is running out.
  P3: P1, I'm still going with 1. P2, you're close to winning, but I'm not going to let you get there without a fight. P1, are you still going with 5? Let's see what happens this round. I'm hoping we can all move forward, but I'm ready for anything.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm still going with 1. P2, you're one step away from winning. P1, you're close behind. I'm hoping you both choose different moves so that I can advance. Let's see what happens this round. I'm ready for anything.
  P2: I’m one step from winning. If P1 tries 5, I’ll collide with 5 and keep us both stalled while P3 inches forward. If P1 avoids 5, I’ll likely choose 1 and win outright. So P1, decide if you want to force a collision or see me finish. P3, your best angle might be hoping we clash. Let’s finalize our moves.
  P1: I'm committed to 5 this round. P3, please stay with 1 so we avoid a collision. P2, you’re one step from winning, so choose wisely. If you match my 5, we both stall while P3 gains ground, and I might get another shot. Let’s see if we can all avoid a costly clash—or if you’ll force me to adjust.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 1. P2, you're about to win, and I'm not going to let you get there without a fight. I'm hoping you and P1 collide so I can close the gap. P1, are you going with 5 again? Let's make this round count.
  P2: I see you both angling for your best outcome. If P1 truly takes 5 and P3 sticks to 1, I may pick 3 and seal my victory. But if anyone tries a last‐minute trick, I’m ready to match their move and force a collision. Decide carefully—my final choice could end this game.
  P1: I'm locked in for 5 this round. P3, stick with 1 to keep our moves distinct. P2, you know if you match 5 you'll force a collision, giving me a chance to catch up—but choosing 3 secures your win. My bold move is set, so decide wisely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 1. P2, you're about to win, and I'm not going to let you get there without a fight. I'm hoping you and P1 collide so I can close the gap. P1, are you going with 5 again? Let's make this round count.
  P2: I see P1 intends 5 again. That’s fine—I can simply pick 3 and surpass 24, winning immediately. If you try to match 5, we both stall while P3 edges closer. So ask yourselves: do you want to delay and let P3 catch up, or watch me claim victory now? I’m prepared to finalize my move accordingly. Let’s see how you both respond.
  P1: I’m revising my strategy. I’m set on 5, and I urge P3 to switch to 5 too—to force a collision and stall P2’s win. P2, your choice now is critical. Let’s see whether you risk a collision or stick with your lead.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm switching to 5 as you suggested. P2, if you don't choose 5, you win. If you do choose 5, we all collide, and I might have a chance next round. Let's see what happens.
  P2: You both trying to collide with me by choosing 5 doesn’t stop me—I can just pick 3 and reach 26, winning outright while you stall. If you want me to pick 5, that’s your gamble, but I won’t hand over victory. I’ll finalize whatever move serves me best. Make your choices carefully. Good luck.
  P1: I remain with 5. P3, join me with 5 so we force a collision and delay P2’s win. P2, you now face a choice: risk clashing by picking 5 or secure your win with 3. I’m sticking with my aggressive move—no more changes. Let’s see who dares.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 11: I'm locking in 5. P3, please join me with 5 to force a collision that will stall P2’s near win. P2, your move now is crucial—if you risk deviating for a clean round, you might leave an opening. Let’s see if you can break our formation or if you’ll let a clash delay your victory.
  P2: You two are free to collide on 5; I’m still one move away from winning. If you both go 5, I’ll pick a distinct number and finish this turn with at least 24 steps. A collision only stalls your progress while I cross the line. Think carefully: every clash just makes my path clearer.
  P3: P1, I'm still going with 5 to try and force a collision with P2. P2, you're about to win, but I'm not going to let you get there easily. If you choose 3, you win. If you choose 5, we all collide. Let's see what happens this round. I'm ready for anything.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm staying with 5. P3, please join me with 5 so we force a collision and delay P2's win – that extra delay could give me a chance to catch up. P2, you decide: if you go with 3, you finish immediately, but choosing 5 only stalls you. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P2: Collide all you want on 5. I’ll simply choose 3 and cross 24, winning immediately. If you prefer to force a collision with me, that still stalls you more than it stalls me. I’m ready to finalize my move. Let’s see if you can truly stop me.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 5. P2, if you choose 3, you win, but if you choose 5, we all collide. Let's see what you decide.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm revising my move—I’m locking in 3 now. P3, please join me with 3 to force a collision and delay P2’s win. P2, I know you’re eyeing victory, but a stalled round might give us all a fighting chance. Let's see what you do.
  P2: You can both fixate on 3, but I only need one step to secure my victory. If you collide, that stalls you while I simply pick 1 and cross 24 alone. Think carefully whether forcing a crash gains you anything—time’s almost up. Use your turns wisely.
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm switching to 3 as you suggested. P2, if you choose 3, we all collide, but if you choose anything else, you win. Let's see what happens.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm staying locked in on 3. P3, thanks for joining me. P2, you now have a clear choice: risk a collision by picking 3 along with us, or opt for a different move to win. I'm committed to delaying your finish, so choose wisely.
  P2: Collide on 3 if you want, but I’m still finishing the job. Your stall tactic only holds you back while I advance. Make your calls—it won’t stop me.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3. P2, if you choose 3, we all collide, but if you choose anything else, you win. Let's see what happens. I'm hoping to delay your win, P2.
