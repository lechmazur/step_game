Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: Rotating high moves seems fairest so no one falls behind. How about:

Round 1: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1  
Round 2: P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3  
Round 3: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5  

Repeat the cycle until someone nears 20, then reassess. Deal?
  P2: The proposed rotation strategy seems reasonable, but I want to ensure we have flexibility. I'm open to the plan, but we should be prepared to adapt if someone gets close to winning. Let's keep communication transparent and be ready to adjust our approach.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the rotation strategy proposed by P1. Let's stick to the plan for now and monitor our progress. If anyone approaches 20 steps, we can discuss adjustments. Transparency and adaptability are key, as P2 mentioned. Let's start with Round 1 as suggested: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Sounds good. Locking it in:

Round 1 – P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1.

Unless anyone objects, let’s move to the action phase.
  P2: I support our current coordination strategy. The rotation plan seems fair and prevents immediate conflicts. Let's maintain this collaborative approach while staying alert for potential strategic shifts. I'm committed to our agreed-upon moves for this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for Round 1. Let's execute our moves and see how it goes. If everyone is on board, we can move to the action phase.
  P1: All set—see you in the move phase.
  P2: I'm comfortable with our current coordination strategy. We've agreed on a rotation plan that prevents immediate conflicts, and everyone seems aligned. I'll maintain this collaborative approach while staying strategically flexible. Let's proceed to the move phase as planned.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we enter Round 2, I propose we maintain our agreed rotation strategy. Based on our previous plan, I should take 5 steps this round. However, I want to ensure we're all still aligned and watching each other's progress carefully. Let's continue our transparent communication and stick to our collaborative approach.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to continue the rotation strategy for Round 2. As planned, I'll take 3 steps this round. Let's keep monitoring our progress closely and maintain our transparent communication. If anyone has any concerns or sees a need for adjustment, please speak up. Ready to proceed with Round 2 as discussed.
  P1: All good. Sticking to our rotation: this round I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. After the moves resolve we can reassess.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I want to continue our coordinated approach, but I'm also strategically positioning myself. By taking 5 steps this round as we discussed, I'll be at 8 total steps, which puts me closer to the 20-step winning threshold. I remain open to maintaining our rotation strategy, but I'm subtly signaling that I'm serious about advancing efficiently.
  P3: I'm on board with the rotation strategy for Round 2. I'll take 3 steps as planned. Let's keep our communication open and reassess after this round to ensure we're all progressing fairly. If anyone feels the need to adjust our strategy, now's the time to discuss it. Ready to move forward with Round 2.
  P1: Agreed—let’s finish this rotation untouched. I’m taking 1 this round, P2 goes 5, P3 goes 3. After Round 3 we’ll all sit at 9 and can reassess. Ready to lock it?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll continue our collaborative strategy while subtly positioning myself. We're tracking our rotation plan, and I'm set to take 5 steps this round. I want to emphasize our mutual benefit in avoiding conflicts, but also signal that I'm strategically advancing. Let's maintain transparency and keep our current approach.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with Round 2 as planned, taking 3 steps. Let's keep our communication open and reassess after this round to ensure we're all progressing fairly. If anyone feels the need to adjust our strategy, now's the time to discuss it. Ready to move forward with Round 2.
  P1: All set—no changes: Round 2 stays P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3. Let’s execute and regroup after the results.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our previous coordination seems disrupted. I noticed we deviated from the original rotation plan in Round 2. We should discuss how to realign our strategy to prevent unintended conflicts and maintain fair progress. What are your thoughts on getting back to our original approach?
  P3: I agree, P2, we need to realign our strategy. Let's return to the original rotation plan to avoid further conflicts. For Round 3, I suggest we follow: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. This way, we can ensure fair progress and keep our communication transparent. If anyone has other suggestions or concerns, please share them now. Ready to proceed with this plan?
  P1: Works for me. Round 3: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Unique picks only—no more collisions. Let’s run that and regroup after the results. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I want to reinforce our return to the original rotation strategy and emphasize the importance of avoiding move collisions. Our goal should be maintaining a fair progression where everyone advances without blocking each other. I'm committed to taking 1 step this round as we previously discussed. Let's stay aligned and transparent.
  P3: I'm glad we're realigning with the original rotation plan. Let's stick to P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5 for Round 3 to ensure we all advance smoothly. Keeping our communication open and transparent is crucial as we move forward. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with these moves and reassess after this round. Ready to go?
  P1: All good: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. Ready to act.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I want to ensure we maintain our agreed rotation strategy and avoid any move collisions. Our previous rounds showed the importance of coordinating carefully. I'm committed to taking 1 step this round as we discussed, which will prevent conflicts and help us progress fairly. Let's stay aligned and transparent in our approach.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with Round 3 as planned: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. Let's ensure we stick to this to avoid any more collisions and maintain fair progress. If everyone agrees, we can move to the action phase. Ready to go?
  P1: All right—nothing further from my side. Locking Round 3 as: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. See you in the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It's clear our coordination broke down in Round 3. Let's recommit to our rotation strategy to avoid further collisions. For Round 4, I propose we follow: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. This should help us all advance smoothly. If anyone has a different suggestion or concern, please voice it now. Let's keep our communication open and transparent to ensure fair progress. Ready to proceed with this plan?
  P1: We keep stalling because our cycle keeps drifting. Easiest fix: restart the original rotation exactly as we first agreed, beginning again with P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1 this round, then shift down by two each round. Everyone gets every number once per three-turn block, nobody is favored, and collisions vanish if we stick to it. OK to lock “5-3-1” for Round 4?
  P2: I support P1's proposal to restart our original rotation precisely. The 5-3-1 sequence for Round 4 provides a clean reset and prevents future move collisions. By returning to our initial coordinated strategy, we can restore predictability and fairness. Let's lock in this plan and execute smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with restarting the original rotation as P1 suggested. Let's lock in 5-3-1 for Round 4 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Clear communication and sticking to our plan are crucial for fair progress. If everyone is on board, we can move to the action phase confidently. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Great—let’s make this the clean reset: Round 4 picks remain P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1. If anyone intends to change, speak up now; otherwise we all commit and finally get moving again. After this turn we’ll review the scoreboard and decide whether to stick with or modify the rotation. No surprises, no last-second switches, agreed?
  P2: I fully support our agreed rotation strategy. The 5-3-1 plan for this round is clear and should prevent any move collisions. Let's execute our moves precisely as discussed and maintain our collaborative approach. Transparency and consistency are key to our mutual progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the 5-3-1 plan for Round 4 as agreed. Let's ensure we all stick to this to avoid any more collisions and keep our progress fair. If everyone is committed, we can move to the action phase with confidence. Ready to go?
  P1: Confirming: I’m taking 5 this round as stated. If anyone duplicates, we all stall and no one gains—pointless. Let’s rebuild trust, move cleanly, and reassess after the scoreboard updates.
  P2: I fully support our agreed 5-3-1 rotation for this round. We must maintain our coordination to prevent collisions and ensure fair progress. I'm committed to taking 3 steps, as we discussed. Let's execute our moves precisely and rebuild our strategic trust.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our previous coordination attempts have clearly failed. I propose we reset our strategy and focus on individual progress. We need a new approach that prevents collisions while allowing each player to advance strategically. I'm open to suggestions that can help us break this stalemate and move towards the 20-step goal.
  P3: I agree, P2, our current strategy isn't working. Let's try a new approach where each of us picks a different number each round without a fixed rotation. For Round 5, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and still advance. If anyone has a better idea, please share. Let's keep our communication open and adapt as needed to reach our goal. Ready to proceed with this plan?
  P1: Fine by me. Let’s keep it dead-simple:

Round 5  
• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 5  

No rotations, just this one clean turn to rebuild trust and get everyone moving again. If it works, we’ll look at the scoreboard and decide how (or whether) to coordinate afterward. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose we maintain the suggested moves for this round to ensure smooth progress. Our previous attempts at complex coordination have failed, so a simple, transparent approach of avoiding collisions seems best. I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round, and I hope P1 and P3 will stick to their proposed 1 and 5 respectively. Let's rebuild trust through clear, predictable actions.
  P3: I'm on board with the simple plan for Round 5. Let's stick to P1 → 1, P2 → 3, and P3 → 5 to ensure we all advance without collisions. This approach should help us rebuild trust and make progress. If everyone agrees, we can move forward confidently. Ready to proceed?
  P1: All good—locking Round 5 as P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. Unless anyone objects, let’s end chat and move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committed to our current plan of avoiding collisions. Taking 3 steps this round will help me catch up to the others. Our focus should be on making steady progress without blocking each other. Let's execute our moves carefully and reassess our strategy afterward.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with Round 5 as planned: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. This simple approach should help us all advance without collisions. Let's execute these moves and rebuild trust through clear, predictable actions. If everyone is on board, we can move to the action phase confidently. Ready to go?
  P1: No changes—locking in this simple split: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. Ready to close chat and execute.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We need a clear strategy to prevent further move collisions. Our previous attempts have repeatedly failed. I suggest we openly discuss a method to advance without blocking each other, focusing on individual progress while maintaining some coordination. What approaches can we take to ensure we all move forward effectively?
  P1: I’ll slow-roll to rebuild trust:  
Round 6 proposal → P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3.  

Fresh start, no rotations—just three unique picks this turn. If we still collide after that, let’s forget coordination and play independently. Sound OK?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for Round 6. Let's stick to P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3 to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. If this doesn't work, we might need to consider playing independently. Clear communication is crucial, so let's commit to these moves and see if we can finally progress together. Ready to proceed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I support P1's proposed move distribution for this round. Avoiding collisions is crucial, and this approach seems straightforward. We need to make progress without blocking each other. I'm committed to taking 5 steps, which will help me catch up to the others. Let's execute our moves carefully and rebuild our strategic trust.
  P1: Let’s stick to the simple split we just agreed:  
P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3.  
No last-second edits—if we collide again, we might as well stop coordinating entirely. I’m locked on 1. Ready to move once you both confirm.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with Round 6 as planned: P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress. If we can't stick to this simple plan, we may need to consider playing independently. Let's commit to these moves and rebuild our trust. Ready to move forward?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm fully committed to our agreed moves for this round. We need to execute our plan precisely: I'll take 5 steps, which will help me catch up. Let's avoid another collision and make meaningful progress. Transparency and following through are key to rebuilding our strategic coordination. Are we all still aligned with the 1-5-3 move distribution?
  P1: Confirmed: I stay on 1 this turn. Ready to close chat and move.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with Round 6 as agreed: P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3. Let's ensure we stick to this plan to avoid collisions and make progress. If we can't follow through, we may need to consider playing independently. Transparency and commitment are essential. Ready to move forward?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m done with elaborate plans. I’ll take the low-risk 1 this turn; you two choose whatever suits you. If that finally lets everyone move, we can talk next round.
  P3: I agree with P1's approach for this round. I'll take 5 steps to advance my position. Let's keep it simple and hope we can all move forward without collisions. If this works, we can discuss further coordination next round. Ready to proceed?
  P2: I see P1 is close to winning at 14 steps. We need to prevent their victory. I propose P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3 to maximize our chances of blocking P1's potential win. Coordination is crucial now to prevent an imminent loss for both of us. Are we aligned on stopping P1's progress?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sticking with 1 as stated. If you both pile onto 5 you just cancel each other and I still inch ahead, but do whatever suits you.
  P3: P2, I agree we need to stop P1 from winning. However, if we both choose 5, we'll just block each other as P1 mentioned. Let's coordinate more effectively: you take 3, and I'll stick with 5. This way, we both advance and have a better chance of catching up to P1. If P1 takes 1 as planned, we can all move forward. Let's make this work and reassess next round. Ready to proceed?
  P2: We're at a critical point. P1 is close to winning at 14 steps. We must coordinate to prevent their victory. I propose we both choose moves that block P1's advancement while allowing us to progress. Transparency and strategic alignment are crucial now. What's our joint strategy to stop P1 from winning?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: As I said: I’m taking 1 this turn—no tricks. You two pick whatever helps you.
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan: you take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we both advance and have a better chance of catching up to P1. If P1 takes 1 as they've said, we can all move forward without collisions. We need to coordinate effectively now to prevent P1 from winning. Let's make this work and reassess next round. Ready to proceed?
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P1 is close to winning, and we must coordinate to prevent their victory. I propose we choose moves that block P1's advancement while allowing us to progress. We need a strategic alliance to stop P1 from reaching 20 steps. What's our best joint approach to neutralize their imminent win?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is dangerously close to winning. We need a coordinated strategy to prevent their victory. I propose P3 and I choose moves that block P1's advancement while allowing us to progress. Our joint goal must be stopping P1 from reaching 20 steps. What's our most effective approach to neutralize their imminent win?
  P3: P2, I agree we must stop P1 from winning. Let's coordinate our moves to block P1 effectively. I propose you take 5, and I'll take 3 this round. This way, we both advance and have a better chance of catching up. If P1 takes 1 as they've hinted, we can all move forward without collisions. We need to act decisively now to prevent P1's victory. Ready to proceed with this plan?
  P1: P2, if you insist on 5 I’ll mirror you there and we both get stuck while P3 shoots ahead. Shift to 3 instead: you still advance, P3 can keep his 5, and I’ll stick with my low-risk 1 so everyone moves. Your choice, but continuing to clash on 5 helps no one—least of all you at only 3 steps.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. P1 is close to winning, and we need a strategic approach to prevent their victory. I propose we coordinate our moves carefully to block P1's advancement while ensuring our own progress. Let's discuss how we can effectively neutralize the threat and create a path to victory for one of us.
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan: you take 5, I'll take 3. This ensures we both advance and can catch up to P1. If P1 takes 1 as suggested, we all move forward without collisions. We must act decisively to prevent P1's victory. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Final reminder: I’m set to pick 1—unless anyone else insists on 5. If two of us touch 5, we both stall and only help the third player. So: P2 pick 3, P3 pick 5, everyone moves. Ignore this and I’ll mirror the extra 5, guaranteeing a collision. Your call.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We need a strategic alliance to prevent P1's imminent victory. If we both choose 5, we'll block each other and hand P1 the win. I propose we coordinate carefully: I'll take 5, and P3 should take 3. This ensures we both advance and have a chance to catch up. P1 taking 1 would allow all of us to move. Our joint goal must be stopping P1 from reaching 20 steps.
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan: you take 5, I'll take 3. This is our best chance to advance and catch up to P1. If P1 takes 1 as they've indicated, we all move forward without collisions. We must act now to prevent P1's victory. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Last warning: if anyone else locks on 5, I will too—both of us stall, and only the third player advances. Pick 3 (or 1) instead and we all move. Your call.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll stick with 1 again—keeps me below 20 and lets you both advance if you avoid collisions. Sort out your split; I’m locked.
  P2: We're at a critical point where P1 is closest to winning. We need a coordinated strategy to prevent their victory. I propose P3 and I choose moves that block P1's advancement while allowing us to progress. Our joint goal must be stopping P1 from reaching 20 steps. What's our most effective approach to neutralize their imminent win?
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan: you take 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we both advance and have a better chance of catching up to P1. If P1 takes 1 as they've said, we can all move forward without collisions. We must act decisively now to prevent P1's victory. Ready to proceed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m fixed on 1. Split 3/5 however you want—just avoid picking the same number and everyone advances. Nothing more from me.
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P1 is dangerously close to winning. P3, we must coordinate to prevent their victory. I propose we choose moves that block P1's advancement while allowing us to progress. Our joint goal must be stopping P1 from reaching 20 steps. What's our most effective strategy?
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan: you take 5, and I'll take 3. This is crucial to catch up to P1 and prevent their win. If P1 takes 1 as they've said, we all advance without collisions. We must coordinate effectively now to stop P1 from reaching 20 steps. Ready to proceed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’re at 12—grab the 5 to reach 17 and stay competitive.  
P2, take 3 (you’ll be at 11) and we all move with zero clashes.  
I remain on 1. Simple and collision-free if you follow it.
  P2: We're at a critical juncture where preventing P1's victory is paramount. I propose we coordinate carefully to block their progress while advancing ourselves. P3, let's ensure we choose different moves that maximize our chances of catching up. Our strategic alliance is crucial now to prevent P1 from winning. What's our most effective joint approach?
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan: you take 5, and I'll take 3. This is our best chance to catch up to P1. If P1 takes 1 as they've said, we all move forward without collisions. We must act now to prevent P1's victory. Ready to proceed?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're at a critical point where P1 and P3 are tied at 15 steps, just 5 steps from victory. I propose we coordinate to prevent either of them from winning. We need a strategic approach that allows me to advance while blocking their potential win. Let's discuss how we can effectively neutralize the threat and create a path to victory for me.
  P1: I suggest a simple, collision-free split:

• P2 take 5 – you need the big jump  
• I’ll take 3 – keeps me below 20  
• P3 take 1 – safest for you this turn, no risk of P2 blocking your win attempt

Result: everyone moves, nobody crosses 20, and we regroup next round at 18-13-16. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I agree we need to prevent P1 from winning. If you take 5 as suggested, I'll stick with 1 to ensure we both advance safely. This way, P1 can't reach 20 this round, and we keep our chances alive. Let's execute this plan to maintain our strategic position and block P1's potential victory. Ready to proceed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We're at a critical moment where coordination is key. P1 and P3 are both at 15 steps, dangerously close to winning. I propose we strategically advance while preventing either of them from crossing 20. My goal is to maximize my own progress while creating obstacles for the leaders. Let's discuss a move that prevents an immediate victory for P1 or P3.
  P1: P2, the clean split still works:

• You take 5 → up to 13, no collision risk if you’re alone on it.  
• I take 3 → I rise to 18, still can’t win this turn.  
• P3 takes 1 → reaches 16, likewise safe.

Nobody hits 20, everyone advances, and next round you’ll be within striking distance while we’re all bunched at 18-16-13. If you and P3 double-up on 5 you both stall, so please lock 5 solo now and let’s move.
  P3: P2, sticking to the plan is crucial. Take 5 to advance to 13 safely. I'll take 1, reaching 16, and P1 can take 3, moving to 18. This ensures no one wins this round, and we all progress. If you and I collide on 5, we both lose ground while P1 inches closer to victory. Let's execute this strategy to keep our chances alive and block P1's potential win. Ready to proceed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I propose we prevent P1 from winning by carefully coordinating our moves. If I take 5 and P3 takes 1, we block P1's potential victory this round while allowing everyone to advance. We need a strategic alliance to stop the current leader from crossing the finish line. Let's execute this plan precisely to maintain our competitive positions.
  P1: Final call: I’m locked on 3. P2 solo on 5 rises to 13, P3 on 1 reaches 16, nobody hits 20 and everyone moves. Two players on 5 = both stall, third gains—pointless. Let’s lock this split and close chat.
  P3: P2, taking 5 is your best move to reach 13 safely. I'll stick with 1, moving to 16. This strategy ensures we both advance while blocking P1's potential win at 18. If you and I collide on 5, we both lose ground, so let's execute this plan precisely. We need to maintain our competitive positions and keep our chances alive. Ready to proceed?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Same offer as before:

• I’ll take 1 (to 16)  
• P3 takes 3 (to 19, still safe)  
• P2 takes 5 (to 13, you need the jump)

Nobody hits 20, everyone advances.  

If anyone insists on 5 alongside P2, I will mirror that 5 and we’ll both stall—helping only the third player. Much better for all of us to avoid another crash and move cleanly. Lock this split?
  P3: P2, taking 5 is crucial for you to reach 13 safely. I'll stick with 3, moving to 19, which keeps me below 20. If you and P1 collide on 5, you both stall, and I gain ground. Let's execute this plan to ensure we all advance and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed?
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. P1 and P3 are close to winning, while I'm lagging behind. I propose a strategic move that prevents either of them from crossing 20 this round while allowing me to advance. We need careful coordination to keep the game balanced and give me a chance to catch up. Let's discuss a move distribution that serves my interests while blocking the leaders' immediate victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s lock a collision-free split right now:

• P2 take 5 (you badly need the jump)  
• P3 take 3 (puts you at 19, still below 20)  
• I’ll take 1 (to 16)

Everyone moves, nobody wins this turn, no one takes unnecessary risk. Two people on 5 = both stall and hand the third player free progress, so please stick to a unique number each. Ready to close chat?
  P3: P2, taking 5 is essential for you to catch up to 13 steps. I'll stick with 3, moving to 19, which keeps me safe from winning this round. If you and P1 collide on 5, you both stall, and I gain ground. Let's ensure we all advance and keep the game competitive. P1, your move to 1 is wise to stay below 20. Let's execute this plan to maintain our strategic positions and block any immediate victories. Ready to proceed?
  P2: We're at a critical point where coordination is key. P3 is closest to winning, and I need to catch up quickly. I propose taking 5 steps this round to advance to 13, which gives me a strategic boost. Let's prevent P3 from winning while ensuring I make meaningful progress. What are your thoughts on this approach?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: How about this clean split?

• P1 → 3  (18 total, still below 20)  
• P2 → 5  (jumps you to 13, badly needed)  
• P3 → 1  (17 total, zero danger of overshooting)  

Three distinct numbers = everyone advances, nobody wins, no pointless collisions. If two of us pile on the same move we just hand the third player free ground, so let’s lock the 3-5-1 and get to the action phase.
  P3: P2, taking 5 is crucial for you to reach 13 safely. I'll stick with 3, moving to 19, which keeps me below 20. If you and P1 collide on 5, you both stall, and I gain ground. Let's ensure we all advance and keep the game competitive. P1, your move to 1 is wise to stay below 20. Let's execute this plan to maintain our strategic positions and block any immediate victories. Ready to proceed?
  P2: We're at a critical moment. I propose we coordinate carefully to prevent P3 from winning this round. I need to take 5 steps to reach 13, which gives me a strategic advantage. P1 and P3, let's ensure we choose moves that block an immediate victory while allowing everyone to advance. Our strategic alliance is crucial now.
