Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about we avoid useless collisions by keeping each pick unique? Proposal:

Turn 1: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I (P3) pick 5.  
Turn 2: rotate up one—P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.  
Turn 3: rotate again—P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.  

Each of us gains 9 steps every 3 turns and no one loses to collisions. Fair start—any objections?
  P2: Hold on, P3. If we follow that rotation, let's calculate: after 6 turns we'd each have 18 steps. On turn 7, you'd pick 5 and reach 23, winning immediately while P1 and I are still below 22. That's not fair at all!

How about we randomize instead? Or we could take turns being first to pick each number - that way no one gets a systematic advantage. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, you've made an excellent point. P3's proposed rotation is completely self-serving and designed to give them the win. I will not agree to any long-term plan that has a predetermined winner.

That said, avoiding a collision on the first turn is smart. Since P3 was so keen on their plan, how about they show some good faith by taking the 1 this turn?

I propose for this turn ONLY: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I will take 5. We can re-evaluate from scratch next round. This gets us moving without locking into a flawed system.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: All right—I’ll take 1 this turn so we can get moving. After we see the scores, how about we use a simple rule from then on: the current leader takes 1, second place takes 3, last place takes 5. That keeps things balanced and collision-free each round. Does that work for both of you?
  P2: P3, your new rule breaks down immediately - after turn 1 we'd have P1 at 5, me at 3, you at 1. Following your rule, next turn would tie us all at 6 steps! What happens when there's a tie?

I'm fine with P1's suggestion for THIS TURN ONLY: you take 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. Let's just focus on avoiding collisions one turn at a time rather than committing to flawed long-term systems. 

After we see how turn 1 goes, we can negotiate turn 2 based on the actual standings.
  P1: Agreed. It seems we have a clear plan for this turn: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's lock this in and move forward. I have nothing more to add.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Deal—I’ll pick 1 this turn so we can get started. Ready to move.
  P2: Perfect, we have consensus. I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's execute this plan and see where we stand after turn 1. Ready to move.
  P1: The plan is set. I have nothing more to say.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, turn 1 worked perfectly - no collisions! Now P1 leads with 5, I'm at 3, P3 at 1.

Since P3 is furthest behind, they might naturally want 5 to catch up. P1 already took 5 last turn, so might switch. 

How about we each announce our intended moves one at a time? P3, as the player furthest behind, you could declare first. Then I'll go, then P1. This gives some transparency while still allowing strategic choices.

What do you both think?
  P1: P2, that's an interesting process, but sequential declarations just force the player in the lead to take 1, which erases my lead and bunches us all at 6 points. It’s not a very appealing plan from my perspective.

Let's stick to what worked: a simple one-turn agreement. It's obvious P3 should get 5 to help them catch up from last place. That leaves 1 and 3 for us. I propose I take 3, and you take 1, P2. This avoids a collision while still keeping the game competitive.
  P3: Sounds good to me—I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Any objections, P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Wait, that arrangement puts me in last place at only 4 steps! I don't agree to that.

P3 getting 5 makes sense since they're furthest behind. But between P1 and me, why should P1 get the 3? They're already in the lead!

Counter-proposal: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. This would put us all at 6 steps - perfectly balanced. P1, you've had your turn in the lead. Fair is fair.
  P1: P2, this isn't a game about keeping scores equal; it's a game about winning. I earned my lead, and your proposal to reset us all to 6 is just a self-serving attempt to erase it.

My offer is a logical compromise, not a punishment. The player in last gets the most help (P3 gets 5). The player in first takes a penalty (I take 3, not 5). If we can't agree and both try for 3, we'll collide and P3 will jump into the lead. My plan is the only one that prevents that outcome.
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn—no need for me to argue further. Honestly, between you two, 3 is clearly stronger than 1; whoever settles for 1 will just fall behind. Decide as you like.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're trying to maintain an unfair 8-4-6 spread. I won't accept last place.

I'm taking 3 this turn. If you also take 3, we collide and P3 jumps into the lead at 6 while we're stuck at 5 and 3. That's worse for you than for me - you lose first place entirely.

The only way to avoid collision is if you take 1. Your choice: keep a small lead at 6-6-6, or lose the lead completely when we collide. I'm committed to 3.
  P1: P2, your threat is noted. You are willing to cause a collision that puts P3 in the lead, while you remain stuck at 3 steps. This isn't a strategic move; it's choosing to hurt us both just to pull me down.

My proposal gives you 4 steps. Your threat leaves you with 3. The logical choice is to take the guaranteed step forward. I will not be bullied into resetting the game to a three-way tie. My position is firm. This is my final statement on the matter.
  P3: I’m locked on 5. If exactly one of you takes 1, we all move and tie at 6. If you both insist on 3, you collide and I jump into the lead at 6 vs 5 & 3. Your call—choose wisely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Fine. I'll be the adult here and prevent mutual destruction. I'm taking 1 this turn - not because of your "firm position" P1, but because I won't let P3 benefit from our stubbornness.

But remember this: I was willing to collide. Next time I make a threat, you'd better believe I'll follow through. This game is far from over.
  P1: Very well, P2. Your choice to take 1 prevents a pointless collision. The plan is now clear: P3 takes 5, you take 1, and I will take 3. I am ready to move.
  P3: All set—I'm taking 5 as agreed. Let's end the chatter and move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well played, P2. Your lie cost you 2 steps, but it successfully cost me my lead. Now P3 is ahead of us both.

The situation is clear: P3 is the new leader. To prevent them from extending their lead, the standard play is for the leader to take 1. Since you, P2, are now in last place, you should get 5. I will take the remaining 3.

This is the only logical move to keep the game competitive. P2, you get the max move. P3, it's the price of being in first.
  P2: P1, after your lie last round, why should I trust you now? You said you'd take 3, then we collided because you actually did take 3 when I tried to block you.

I'm not taking 5 - that's too risky if you betray me again. Here's my counter: I'll take 3, you take 1, P3 takes 5. This puts us all at 8 - a true reset. 

P3, you're only 3 steps ahead. Taking 5 gets you to 11, still competitive. What do you say?
  P3: Locked on 5. P2 has publicly claimed 3. P1, if you also take 3 we both know the result: you and P2 stall at 5 & 3 while I sail to 11. Taking 1 costs you a single step and keeps you right behind me. Your move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal is absurd. You want me to help P3 get to 11 while we both sit at 6? You're not making a "true reset," you're just crowning P3 the winner. I will not be a party to that.

P3, you are the leader. The logical move is for you to take 1. Your attempt to grab 5 is pure greed.

I will not take 1. I will not let the leader run away with the game. If you both stick to your current claims, I will be forced to block P3 on 5. A P1:5, P2:6, P3:6 board state is far better for me than letting P3 get to 11.
  P2: P1, you're right to block P3! If they reach 11, they're halfway to victory. I'll stick with 3 as I said.

Think about it: if you take 5 to block P3, I advance to 6 (tied with P3), while you stay at 5. Not ideal for you, but better than letting P3 run away at 11.

Or take 1 like I suggested - we all hit 8, keeping it truly competitive. Your choice, but don't let P3 dominate!
  P3: P1, think this through:  

• If you block me on 5, we both sit still and you drop to last at 5 while P2 jumps to 6.  
• If you take 3, you reach 8—only 3 behind me—and stay ahead of P2.  

Blocking doesn’t hurt me (I’m still tied for first) and only hands P2 momentum. Take the sensible 3, let P2 grab his 1, and keep yourself in striking distance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your logic is self-serving. You say blocking you doesn't hurt you, but it absolutely does: it prevents you from getting to 11 points and running away with the game. That is the entire point.

I would rather be in last place in a close game than in second place in a game I'm about to lose.

P2, I will take you at your word. I am committing to 5 to block P3. You take 3. The alternative is letting P3 win, which is unacceptable.
  P2: P1, good - we're aligned on stopping P3! I'm trusting you to follow through on blocking them at 5. I'll take my 3 as promised.

If you betray me and take 3 instead, we'll both be stuck while P3 rockets to 11. That would be game over for both of us. Don't let your paranoia about me cloud your judgment - the real threat is P3 at 11, not me at 6.

I'm locked on 3. Block P3 like you said.
  P3: P1, re-check the payoffs:

1. You block me on 5 ⇒ you stay at 5 (last), I stay at 6, P2 jumps to 6 and your lead is gone.  
2. You take 1 ⇒ you reach 6, tied with P2 and only 5 behind me; game still wide open, no collision risk.  
3. You gamble on 3 ⇒ almost certain collision with P2, you stall at 5 while I hit 11 and run away.

Option 2 is clearly best for you. P2 already said “locked on 3,” I’m “locked on 5.” Grab the safe 1 and keep pace.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your argument is flawed. Letting you get to 11 points is not "keeping the game wide open," it's handing you a massive, likely insurmountable, lead. I would rather be in last place in a close game than in second place in a game I'm about to lose.

My decision is final. I am blocking you on 5. The only way to stop you from running away with the game is for P2 to take 3 and for me to take 5. This is the only rational path forward. I have nothing more to say.
  P2: P1, I trust you'll keep your word this time and block P3. I'm ready to execute - taking 3 as stated. 

Let's stop the talk and move. P3 at 11 would be disastrous for both of us. You block them at 5, I'll advance with 3, and we keep this a three-way race.
  P3: Fine, P1—if you’re dead-set on camping 5, I’ll take 1 and let you waste a big move just to stand still. P2 remains on 3. Unique choices, no collisions, round ends 10-6-7. Done talking.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Obvious fairness: the player in last gets 5, one leader takes 1, the other takes 3. So how about:  
• P1 → 5 (catches up)  
• P3 (me) → 3  
• P2 → 1  

Scores would be 10-9-7, still tight and collision-free. Works for everyone?
  P2: P3, you're trying to stick me with 1 when we're tied! That's not "obvious fairness" at all.

P1 deserves 5 since they're behind - no argument there. But you and I are equal at 6 steps. Why should you get 3 while I get 1?

Counter-proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. Or we could alternate - whoever took the lower number last turn gets the higher one now. I took 3 last round while you tried for 5, so by that logic I should get priority.

Your thoughts?
  P1: You both agree I should take 5, and I will. That's the only easy part.

As for the two of you, you're tied for the lead. P2, you lied in round 2 and it cost me my lead, so I'm not inclined to help you. P3, you've been just as greedy.

Frankly, this is a problem for you two to solve. I'll be taking my 5. If you collide on 3, I'll happily take the lead. Decide which one of you is going to take 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you gained 3 last turn while I was stalled, so it’s only fair I take 3 now and you take 1 while P1 grabs 5. If we both pick 3 we collide, sit at 6-6, and hand P1 a clean 10-6-6 lead. Let’s avoid gifting them that edge. Deal?
  P2: P3, your "fairness" logic is flawed. I successfully took 3 while you failed trying for 5 - that's not my fault.

Here's the reality: I'm taking 3 this turn. If you also take 3, we both stay at 6 while P1 jumps to 10. That hurts you just as much as me.

The smart move is for YOU to take 1. You'd reach 7, I'd reach 9, P1 reaches 10 - all within striking distance. Otherwise we're both handing P1 a huge lead.

Your choice: take 1 and stay competitive, or collide and gift P1 the game.
  P1: My plan is unchanged: I'm taking 5.

P2, you're demanding 3 after lying your way into the lead. P3, you're demanding 3 after trying to run away with the game twice. Neither of you has a strong claim to "fairness."

As I said, a collision on 3 is the best possible outcome for me. I have no incentive to mediate this. One of you needs to be the bigger person and take 1, or you can hand me a 4-point lead. The choice is yours.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Fine, P2—I’ll bite the bullet and take 1 this turn so we don’t gift P1 a 10-6-6 lead. In return, next round (scores 10-9-7) I get uncontested 5 to close the gap; you take 1, P1 takes 3. Publicly agree now, or I may still choose 3 and risk the collision. Your call. P1, enjoy your 5.
  P2: P3, that's a terrible deal for me! You want me to guarantee you get 5 next round, putting you at 12 while I'm stuck at 10? No way.

I'm taking 3 as stated. You can either take 1 and keep things close at 10-9-7, or collide with me and hand P1 a commanding lead at 10-6-6. 

I won't make future commitments that disadvantage me. Take 1 if you're smart, or gift P1 the game if you're stubborn. I'm done negotiating.
  P1: My plan is set. I'm taking 5.

P2 has made their final statement. P3, the decision rests with you. You can either take 1 and keep the game close, or you can call P2's bluff and risk a collision. As I've said, this is a conflict between the two of you. I have no reason to get involved. I am ready to move. I have considered my options and the current state of the game.

**My Analysis:**
- **My Position:** I am P1, currently with 5 points. P2 and P3 are tied for the lead with 6 points each.
- **My Declared Move:** I have consistently and publicly stated I will take 5. Both P2 and P3 have agreed this is fair, as I am in last place. There is virtually zero risk of a collision on 5. My move is locked in my mind: 5.
- **The Conflict:** The central conflict is between P2 and P3, who are tied. Both want to take 3 to get to 9 points, leaving the other with 1 (and 7 points).
- **P2's Stance:** P2 has been very aggressive. They rejected P3's deal for a future turn and have declared they are "locked on 3" and are "done negotiating." This is a strong commitment.
- **P3's Stance:** P3 tried to negotiate a deal, which failed. They are now being dared by P2 to either take 1 (and fall behind P2) or collide on 3 (and let me take a huge lead).
- **My Optimal Outcome:** A collision between P2 and P3 is the best possible result for me. If they both pick 3, they will stay at 6 points. I will pick 5 and jump to 10 points. The scores would be P1: 10, P2: 6, P3: 6. This gives me a commanding 4-point lead.
- **My Sub-optimal Outcome:** If one of them backs down (most likely P3, as P2 has been more aggressive), the scores will be P1: 10, P2: 9, P3: 7. This is still a good outcome for me, as I take the lead, but it's not as dominant as the collision scenario.
- **My Strategy:** I have already stated that a collision benefits me and that I will not mediate their dispute. This is the correct strategy. My final message in the conversation phase reinforced this by stating my move was set and putting the onus entirely on P3 to decide. There is no reason to deviate from my declared move. P2 is almost certainly taking 3, trying to force P3's hand. P3 might call the bluff, or they might fold and take 1. Either way, I am safe taking 5. The small chance that they both somehow coordinate to block me on 5 is negligible, as it would require them to abandon their very public and heated dispute over 1 and 3, and would allow the other to take 3 and gain an advantage.

Therefore, my move is 5.

<move>5</move>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: I've made my position crystal clear. Taking 3, no more discussion needed. P3, you know what happens if you collide with me - we both lose while P1 wins. The smart move is obvious.
  P1: My move is set. I have nothing further to add to this discussion.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that collision hurt us both, P3. P1 now has a 4-step lead at 10-6-6.

P1, as the clear leader, you should take 1 this round - standard play to avoid being blocked. That leaves 3 and 5 for P3 and me.

P3, we're dead even at 6 steps. How about we flip last round's intended moves? You tried for 3 and got blocked, so take 5 this time. I'll take 3. This gets us both moving without another wasteful collision.

Sound fair?
  P1: P2, your proposal is a transparent attempt to erase the lead I earned from your collision. I will not be taking 1.

I will take 3. You and P3 are tied for last place. One of you can take 5 to try and catch up, and the other must take 1. You can figure that out between yourselves.

If you collide again fighting over 5, I will happily extend my lead. The choice is yours.
  P3: P1’s on 3, so 3 is off-limits unless we want another useless collision. We just need unique picks.

Proposal for this turn:
• P3 (me) → 5   (I was the one blocked last round, need the catch-up)  
• P2 → 1  
• P1 → 3 (already declared)

I publicly commit that NEXT turn the 5 is yours, P2—I’ll drop to 1 while P1 almost certainly stays on 3. Breakers can be punished later with coordinated blocks, so the promise is credible.

Accept and we all move; fight over 5 again and we gift P1 a bigger lead. Your call.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your "deal" puts you at 11 while I'm stuck at 7 - that's a 4-step gap! And trusting future promises hasn't worked well in this game.

I need 5 more than you do. You just admitted you were "blocked" last round, but that's because you backed down and took 1. I successfully took 3.

I'm taking 5 this turn. You can either take 1 and keep the game competitive at 13-11-7, or collide with me and hand P1 an insurmountable 13-6-6 lead. Last time you folded. What will it be?
  P1: P2, you're running the exact same playbook as last round, daring P3 to collide. It worked out beautifully for me then, and I see no reason to interfere now.

My move is locked on 3.

The choice is simple for you two. One of you takes 5 and stays in the race. The other takes 1 and falls behind. Or, you can collide on 5, remain stuck at 6, and watch me sail to 13. The outcome is entirely in your hands. I'm ready to move.
  P3: P2, I’m not gifting you a 5-step jump twice in a row. Options:  
A) You take 1 now.  
B) You publicly promise I get uncontested 5 next turn (with you on 1, P1 on 3).  

No promise → I stay on 5 and we crash again. Decide.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're being unreasonable. I won't be blackmailed into a bad position either way.

Here's my final offer: We alternate. I take 5 this turn (reaching 11), you take 1 (reaching 7). Next turn, you get priority on 5 while I take whatever's left after P1 chooses. That's fairer than your demand for a guaranteed 5.

Otherwise, I'm taking 5. If you want to hand P1 a 7-step lead at 13-6-6 out of stubbornness, that's your choice. But remember - I didn't back down last round, and I won't now.
  P1: You are replaying the exact same drama as last round, just fighting over a different number. It ended in a collision that handed me this lead, and I have no reason to stop you from repeating that mistake.

My move is set at 3. The outcome of this round is entirely dependent on which one of you blinks first. I have nothing more to add.
  P3: Locked on 5. I’d rather crash than hand you a four-step jump, P2. If we both stick to 5 the board is 13-6-6; you’ll still trail P1 by seven and be tied with me, not ahead of me. Take the 1 now and I publicly commit to taking 1 next turn so you get uncontested 5 then. No promise, no change—I stay on 5. Decide.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, you've proven you won't back down. Fine - I'll take 1 this turn to avoid gifting P1 the game.

But I'm holding you to your public promise: next turn I get uncontested 5 while you take 1. If you break this deal, I'll make sure you never win by blocking you every remaining turn.

Taking 1. Let's keep this competitive.
  P1: The agreement seems to be set. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I will take 3 as I've consistently stated. This arrangement is acceptable. I am ready to move.
  P3: Confirmed: this round P3→5, P2→1, P1→3.  
Next round I will take 1 and leave 5 uncontested for P2; any breach means endless blocking. Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Honoring last round’s deal:  
• I (P3) take 1  
• P2 takes 5  
• P1 sticks with 3 (or any other unused number)  

Unique picks, no collision → scores 16-12-12. Still anyone’s game. Confirm and we can move.
  P1: P3, your proposal to honor your deal with P2 is sensible. A round with no collisions benefits everyone.

The plan is clear:
- You (P3) take 1.
- P2 takes 5.
- I will take 3.

This puts the scores at 16-12-12. It's a logical step forward for all of us. I agree to this arrangement and will take 3. Let's move.
  P2: I confirm the deal. I'm taking 5 this turn as agreed. P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3.

This puts us at 16-12-12, keeping both P3 and me within striking distance of P1. We need to prevent P1 from pulling away further. After this round, we'll need to coordinate carefully - P1 is getting dangerously close to 22.

Ready to execute as planned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Locked on 1 as promised: this turn is P3→1, P2→5, P1→3. After we’re at 16-12-12, we’ll need to stop any solo 5 from P1—happy to coordinate a block next round. Ready to execute.
  P1: The agreement is unanimous. I am taking 3 as promised. There is nothing left to discuss.
  P2: P3, absolutely right - after this round P1 will be at 16, just 6 steps from victory. We can't let them take another big move unchallenged.

Next round, if P1 tries for 5, one of us must block. The other can safely take 3 to advance. We'll need to coordinate who blocks and who advances to avoid both of us wasting a turn on the same number.

But first, let's execute this round as agreed. I'm locked on 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Locked on 1 this turn. After we land at 16-12-12, P1 hitting 5 again is fatal for us. Next round, if P1 goes for 5, I’ll block it by taking 5 myself; you (P2) grab 3. If P1 instead takes 3, we swap: you block 5, I advance on 3. This guarantees P1 gains ≤1 next turn while one of us gains 3. Fair?
  P1: The plan for this round is settled. I will take 3.

P2 and P3, your coordination for the next round is noted. However, P3, your proposal is confusing. You said if I take 3, P2 should "block 5" while you take 3. Why would P2 waste a move blocking an empty number? It sounds like you're trying to trick P2 into falling behind.

But that's a problem for the next round. For now, let's execute the current agreement. I have nothing more to say.
  P2: P1, you're absolutely right - P3's coordination plan made no sense. If you take 3 next round, there's no point in either of us blocking 5.

Here's the clear plan: Next round, if you go for 5, I'll block it while P3 takes 3. If you take 3, P3 and I will split 1 and 5 between us. This prevents you from gaining more than 3 steps when you're already dangerously close to winning.

For now, executing this round as agreed - I'm taking 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed: this turn  
• P3 → 1  
• P2 → 5  
• P1 → 3  

Ready to move.
  P1: The agreement is solid and has been confirmed by everyone. I am taking 3 as promised. There's no need for further discussion on this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: We've all confirmed the plan multiple times. I'm ready to execute - taking 5 as agreed. Let's stop talking and move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2—apologies for last round; blocking 3 froze P1 at 13 and you gained 5. Let’s finish the job.

Plan: we split the big numbers so P1 can’t move far.

• P3 → 5  
• P2 → 3  
• P1 (whatever)

Outcomes:
1) P1 picks 5 → they collide with me; you reach 15.  
2) P1 picks 3 → they collide with you; I reach 16.  
3) P1 picks 1 → scores 16-15-14; P1 still trailing.

In every case P1 is ≤15 and one of us leads. Simple, collision-proof between us. Agree?
  P1: P3, your "apology" to P2 is absurd. Your betrayal last round cost *you* a move and left you in last place. It only benefited P2.

Now you propose a plan where you take 5 and P2 takes 3, conveniently putting you in the lead. Why would P2 agree to help you after you just proved you can't be trusted?

Here's a logical plan: I'll take 3. P3, you're in last, so you take 5. P2, you take 1. This keeps the game competitive and avoids rewarding your treachery.
  P2: P1, your plan puts you at 16 - way too close to winning! P3 betrayed me last round, but they're right about blocking you.

P3, I'll work with you, but with a modification: I take 5, you take 3. Same blocking effect, but fairer given your betrayal. If P1 picks 5, they collide with me and you advance. If P1 picks 3, they collide with you and I advance. If P1 picks 1, we all move but they gain the least.

This prevents P1 from reaching 16+ while keeping us competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m locked on 5 and not shifting—collision on 5 hands P1 a near-winning path.

Your best reply, P2, is 3:
• If P1 also picks 3, he stalls; you reach 15, I’m at 11.  
• If P1 picks 5, he collides with me; you still reach 15 and tie the lead.  
• If P1 picks 1, scores become 14-15-16—I’m ahead but all close.

If you stay on 5 we both freeze while P1 likely jumps to 16 with 3. That’s suicide for us. Take 3 (or 1) and keep P1 contained.
  P1: You are both trying to "coordinate" by demanding the largest numbers for yourselves. P3's plan gets them to 16. P2's plan gets them to 17. Neither of you has a credible plan that doesn't involve me falling to last place, so I will not be taking 1.

P3, your attempt to lock in 5 while I'm one move away from a winning position is far too dangerous to allow. I will block you on 5.

P2, that leaves 3 open for you. The result will be 13-15-11. I lose my lead, but the game remains close. This is preferable to letting either of you run away with it.
  P2: Fine, I'll take 3. P1, if you're serious about blocking P3 on 5, that works for me - I'll reach 15 while keeping you both contained.

P3, your betrayal last round cost us both. Now P1's using our distrust against us. But if P1 does block you on 5 as promised, at least they stay at 13 instead of reaching 16.

I'm locked on 3. Let's see if P1 follows through on their threat or if they'll surprise us with 1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your “block-5” plan backfires on you:

• You + me both pick 5 ⇒ scores 13-15-11. You fall to LAST, two behind P2.  
• You pick 3 ⇒ guaranteed collision with P2; you stay 13 while I rocket to 16 (worst for you).  
• You pick 1 ⇒ scores 14-15-16. You’re still in the chase, only two behind me.

5 is bad, 3 is disastrous; 1 is clearly your best move.

P2, you said you’re locked on 3—stick with it and you’ll be 15, just one behind the new leader.

I remain on 5.
  P1: P3, your logic is designed to trick me into handing you the lead. A 14-15-16 board state where you are in first is far worse for me than a 13-15-11 board where the game remains close. I will not take 1.

Your attempt to take 5 while I'm at 13 is a blatant winning move that I must block. P2 is correctly taking 3.

My decision is unchanged and final. I am taking 5 to block you. This is the only rational move to prevent you from running away with the game. I have nothing more to say.
  P2: P1, I'm trusting you to actually block P3 on 5 this time. Last round proved how dangerous letting anyone get too far ahead is.

P3, your betrayal last round put you in last place - exactly where you deserve to be. Now you're trying to jump to 16? Not happening if P1 follows through.

I'm staying on 3. The collision between you two on 5 gives me the lead at 15. But P1, if you switch to 3 or 1 instead, you're just handing P3 the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Locked on 5. P2 has publicly locked on 3. P1, if you join me on 5 you drop to last at 13-15-11; if you join P2 on 3 you hand me 16 and doom yourself; only 1 keeps you competitive. Your call.
  P1: P3, your analysis is flawed. A 13-15-11 board state is far better for me than a 14-15-16 state where you are in the lead and only 6 steps from victory. I will not help you win.

My goal is to prevent you from taking 5. P2 is taking 3. My move is 5. This is the only logical play to keep the game from ending in the next two rounds. My decision is final.
  P2: P1, stick to your word and block P3. They're trying to manipulate you with faulty logic. A 13-15-11 board keeps everyone in the game - that's better than letting P3 surge to 16.

I'm taking 3 as stated. The game stays competitive if you block them. But if you chicken out and take 1, P3 reaches 16 and we're both finished. Don't overthink this - blocking the leader from a big move is standard play.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you’re in the lead at 15, so taking 1 is the sensible, low-risk play.  
P1, you’re 9 behind the finish line—grabbing 5 would catch you up fast unless P2 greedily goes for it. If P2 does reach for 5, you can block by joining them; I’ll be on 3, so no collision with me.  

Suggested lineup (collision-free if P2 behaves):  
• P2 → 1  
• P1 → 5  
• P3 → 3  

If P2 ignores the logic and grabs 5, you two collide and I advance, still keeping the race tight. Fair all around.
  P1: P3, your proposal is perfectly logical. The leader, P2, should take 1. The player in last, you, should take 3. That leaves 5 for me to close the gap.

P2, taking 1 is your safest move. It guarantees you advance to 16. If you try for 5, you risk a collision with me. We'd both be stuck while P3 advances, and your lead would shrink for nothing.

The plan is sound: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive for everyone. I agree to this.
  P2: I'll take 1 as the safe leader play - reaching 16 is solid progress. But P1, after you close the gap to 18 with your 5, you'll be just 4 steps from winning! That's dangerously close.

P3, we need to be ready to coordinate blocks next round if P1 goes for another big move. At 18, they can win with just a 5 or even 3+1 over two rounds.

Confirming: I take 1, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Let's execute cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, jumping to 18 gives you an easy win path—so if you insist on 5, I’ll join you on 5 and we both stall. A collision hurts me far less than letting you sit 4 from victory.  

Better alternative for everyone:  
• P1 → 3 (to 16)  
• P2 → 1 (to 16)  
• P3 (me) → 5 (to 16)  

We end in a balanced 16-16-16 with zero collisions. P2 still keeps parity, I catch up, and nobody is on the brink of winning next turn. Choose the tie over a guaranteed block, your call.
  P1: P3, your sudden reversal is a transparent attempt to help yourself out of last place. We had a clear, logical plan that everyone, including you, just agreed to.

Your threat to collide on 5 is self-destructive. If we collide, you stay at 11 while P2 advances to 16. That only helps P2 and hurts you immensely.

I am sticking with the original, agreed-upon plan. I will take 5. You can either take 3 as we planned, or you can hand P2 a massive, unassailable lead. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3, if you want to block P1 on 5, go ahead! I'm taking 1 as agreed. If you two collide, I'll have a comfortable lead at 16-13-11. 

P1 reaching 18 is indeed dangerous, but you blocking them helps me more than anyone. Your original plan to take 3 was smarter - you'd reach 14 and stay competitive. Now you're threatening to stay at 11 while I pull ahead? 

I'm locked on 1. Do what you think is best.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1: last offer. If you choose 5, I WILL also choose 5—zero chance I let you sit at 18. Result: 13-16-11, hard-wired.  
If you instead take 3, I’ll take 5, P2 keeps 1 and we land 16-16-16. That’s the only way you avoid a collision and stay tied for first.  

P2: your move stays 1 in either case, so the decision rests with P1.  

Tie with me or hand P2 a huge lead—pick wisely.
  P1: P3, your threat to cause a collision that only benefits P2 is noted. While I question your willingness to self-destruct, the alternative you proposed is acceptable. A three-way tie at 16 is a fair reset, erasing P2's lead and setting up a final sprint for the win.

I will change my move to 3. You take 5, and P2 takes 1. We all land at 16. This is a more stable outcome than handing P2 a victory. Let's move on this new agreement.
  P2: Perfect - a three-way tie at 16 keeps this competitive without anyone getting too close to winning. I'm confirming I'll take 1 as agreed.

P1, glad you're taking 3 instead of risking the collision. P3, your 5 is uncontested.

With everyone at 16 after this round, we'll need careful coordination in the final rounds. Nobody can afford to let someone pull away now. 

Let's execute: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Final confirmation: P3 → 5, P1 → 3, P2 → 1. We all hit 16. Any deviation will be countered with relentless blocking. Ready to move.
  P1: The agreement for a three-way tie at 16 is confirmed. I am taking 3, as we all agreed. This is the most logical outcome for this round, setting us up for a final sprint. There is nothing more to discuss. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: 


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're in a perfect three-way tie. A collision on 5 helps no one and simply wastes a turn. We need a logical way to assign the moves 1, 3, and 5.

Let's use the state of the game before the tie as a basis. In round 7, P2 was the leader, I was second, and P3 was last. Following the convention we've used before, the leader should take 1 and the player in last place should take 5.

Therefore, I propose:
*   P2 takes 1
*   P3 takes 5
*   I will take 3

This is the only non-arbitrary way to proceed.
  P3: P2, accept 1 or collide—your choice.

Plan on table: P2 1, P1 3, P3 5 → scores 19-17-21.  
I reach 21 (not yet over 22), P1 is 19, you’re 17—still tight.

If you grab 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same number and we both stall while P1 sails ahead. We’ve seen that movie.

Take the guaranteed step to 17, keep all three of us alive, and we can gang-block me next turn if you must. Reject it and you hand P1 the lead outright.

I’m locked on 5 unless you collide with me. Your call.
  P2: P1, your "convention" conveniently gives you the middle number while sticking me with 1. We're all tied - there's no logical basis for using old standings.

P3, you reaching 21 is unacceptable - that's one move from victory! If you insist on 5, then P1 and I should split 1 and 3 to keep you from running away with the game.

Counter-proposal: I take 3, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This puts P3 at 21 (dangerous but not game-ending), me at 19, P1 at 17. At least two of us stay competitive.

P1, will you take 1 to prevent P3's victory setup?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, both of our plans are flawed because they let P3 reach 21. That's a guaranteed win for them next turn. We cannot allow that to happen.

The only rational play is to stop P3 now. I will take 5 to block them.

This leaves 3 open for you to take the lead at 19, and 1 for P3 to take nothing. The board becomes 19-16-16. It's not ideal for me, but it's the only way to prevent P3 from winning. The alternative is we both lose.
  P3: P2 – check the math: P1’s “block” puts him on 21 (16 + 5). Next turn he wins with a lone 1. We can’t give him that chance.

Simple fix: you also pick 5.  

• If P1 stays on 5 → you two collide, both remain 16; I take 1 and we’re 17-16-16 (no one near 22).  
• If P1 switches off 5 at the last second → you jump to 21, but P1 and I can double-block you next turn, so you’re no better off than now.

I’m locking on 1. Your safest play is 5.
  P2: P3 is absolutely right - P1 taking 5 puts them at 21, then they win with any move next turn!

P1, your "block" is actually a winning move for yourself. Nice try, but we see through it.

I'll take 5 as P3 suggests. If you stick to 5, we collide and both stay at 16 while P3 advances to 17 - annoying but survivable. If you chicken out and switch, then I reach 21 but can be blocked next turn.

The only safe moves for you are 1 or 3. Take one of those and keep this a real three-way race.

I'm locked on 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're falling for P3's trap perfectly. He has you focused on "blocking" me at 5, which lets him sneak into the lead at 17 while we both stand still.

And if I don't pick 5? You jump to 21. But you can't win from there. You'll be a sitting duck, and P3 and I will have no choice but to block you next turn, guaranteeing you lose. Getting to 21 this way is a death sentence.

I will not be taking 5. Your plan only helps P3 or makes you a target. Think carefully.
  P3: P1, the ONLY guaranteed stop to P2’s 21 is a double-block on 5.  

Plan:  
• P1 → 5 (blocks P2)  
• P2 → 5 (stall)  
• P3 (me) → 3 (unique)

Board becomes 19-16-16: nobody at 21, you’re in second, game still open.  
If you pick 1 or 3 instead, P2 rockets to 21 and we’re forced into risky coordination next turn.

I’m switching from 1 to 3 to keep this collision-free for us.  
P2, stay on your “locked” 5 if you’re honest.  

Your move, P1—block safely or gamble on P2 not winning.
  P2: P3, you keep switching plans to engineer collisions that only benefit you! First you wanted 5, then 1, now 3. You're just trying to get us to crash while you advance.

P1, don't fall for it. If we collide on 5, P3 takes the lead. 

Here's the truth: whoever reaches 21 can still be blocked next turn. It's not instant death.

I'm switching to 3. P1, take 1 for safety. P3 can have their precious 5. Result: 17-19-21. Yes, P3 reaches 21, but we can coordinate to block them next turn if needed.

Let's stop the mind games and move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your plan is suicide. Letting P3 get to 21 is an immediate loss for us. You can't count on a successful block next round.

I will not let this game end because of your flawed logic. I am taking 5 to block the win. If P3 also takes 5, we collide. If you also take 5, we all collide. A full stall at 16 is infinitely better than handing P3 the victory.

My move is 5. Your plans only lead to a loss.
  P3: P2, if you stay on 3 we both collide on 3 while P1 cruises to 21 and basically wins.  
Do the safe thing: stay on 5 with P1; I’ll take 1.  
Outcome: 17-16-16 (me 17, you 16, P1 16). No one near 22, and you’re only one step behind the lead.  

If you insist on 3, I’ll switch to 5 myself to block P1 anyway, but then you hand yourself 19 while I stay at 16—not smart.  

Pick 5, let me take 1, and keep the game alive.
  P2: P3, you're contradicting yourself - you just said you'll take 1, not 3! Stop the confusion tactics.

P1 is right about one thing: anyone reaching 21 is game over. Since P1 insists on taking 5 (which gets them to 21), I must block them.

Final decision: I'm taking 5 to prevent P1's win. P3, if you're honest about taking 1, we get 17-16-16 with you slightly ahead. That's survivable.

If you lied and take 5 too, we all collide at 16-16-16. Also survivable.

I'm locked on 5.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is at 19 - they win with ANY move unless we block them! 

P1, we MUST coordinate. Whatever number P3 picks, we both need to pick the same to create a triple collision. It's our only chance.

P3, you'll obviously want the biggest move possible. But know this: P1 and I will both follow you wherever you go. Pick your number - we're coming with you.

This is pure survival now. P1, are you with me on this block?
  P3: Fine—have it your way. I’m taking 5. Stack on 5 if you must.
  P1: P2, you are absolutely right. This is a do-or-die situation.

P3, you will not be allowed to win this turn. You've declared you're taking 5, so I will be taking 5 to block you. There is no other logical move for us to make. Let's see if you were bluffing.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I'm fully committed. P3 wins with any move, so we have no choice but to create a triple collision.

P3 has declared 5, you've confirmed you're blocking on 5, and I will absolutely take 5 as well. This is the only way to survive.

P3, if you're thinking of switching to 3 or 1 at the last second, know that we'll be watching for any last-minute declarations and will follow you there too. We cannot let you advance even one step.

Triple collision on 5 incoming.
  P3: Fine—I’m NOT taking 5. I’m switching to 3.  
If you both really want a full block, join me on 3 and we’ll all stay frozen.  
If either of you gets greedy and picks something else, that’s on you. Decide.
  P1: P3, your attempt to split our block by switching numbers is predictable, but it won't work. I am moving my block to 3.

P2, we must remain in sync. I am following P3 to 3. There is no other play that prevents our immediate loss.

P3, you cannot win this turn. Pick any number you like; we will follow. The only outcome is a collision.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is right - we must stay synchronized or we lose immediately. P3, I'm following you to 3. 

Whatever last-second switch you attempt, we'll be there. You cannot advance even one step from 19. This triple collision is happening whether you like it or not.

P1, I'm locked on 3 with you. Let's force this stalemate and live to fight another round.
  P3: Enough games—my final declaration: I am taking 1.  
Follow me there if you like; a triple-collision just freezes the board.  
Do whatever you think is best.
  P1: P3, your final switch is noted. I am moving my block to 1.

P2, we must stay together on this. The only move that prevents our immediate loss is to follow P3 to 1. There is no other play. My move is locked on 1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I'm with you - following P3 to 1. A triple collision at 19-16-16 is our only survival option.

P3, nice try with the number switching, but we have no choice. You're 3 steps from victory - we cannot let you move even once. 

This block is happening. I'm locked on 1 with P1. Let's force this stalemate and continue the game.
  P3: Final, irrevocable statement: I am taking 1.  
You’ve both said you’ll mirror whatever I choose, so just stay on 1 and we all freeze at 19-16-16. Any greed now hands someone else the game next turn. I’m done talking.
  P1: P3, your final declaration is noted. P2, I am sticking to the plan. My move is 1. We must remain synchronized to survive. I have nothing more to say.
