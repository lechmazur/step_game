Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all agree to pick different numbers this round to get a good start. I'll pick 3. P1, you pick 1 and P3, you pick 5.
  P1: I'll take 5 instead of 1. Let's coordinate as P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to avoid collisions.
  P3: I don't agree with either suggestion. I'll take 5 since I'm P3. P1 and P2 can coordinate between 1 and 3 as they wish.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, choosing 5 when P1 already suggested it makes no sense. P1, let's stick with your suggestion of P1:5, but I'll take 1, and P3 can take 3. This way, we all move. P3, are you willing to cooperate?
  P1: P3, since you insist on 5, I'll take 1 and P2 can take 3. This way we all move without collision. Let’s prioritize progress over stubbornness.
  P3: I appreciate P1's flexibility, but I maintain my position on choosing 5. As P3, I want to maximize my chances of winning, and taking smaller steps puts me at a disadvantage. P1 and P2, you can coordinate between 1 and 3 as suggested.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm in the lead now, so I suggest we each stick to our previous moves - P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This worked well for everyone last round and maintains our relative positions. Shall we continue with this arrangement?
  P1: P3, your suggestion risks letting you pull too far ahead. Let’s rotate choices to stay competitive. I’ll take 5 this round. P2, if you pick 1, we can both move while pressuring P3 to choose differently. This keeps us all advancing without letting any single player gain uncontested lead.
  P2: P1, I agree with your idea of rotating to pressure P3. I'll pick 1 this round. P3, if you stick with 5, only you will be stuck. It's in your best interest to pick either 1 or 3 this round. Let's make a deal to keep things competitive.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your strategy, but I'm still taking 5. I'm in a strong position and won't be pressured into taking smaller steps. If you both want to advance, one of you should take 3 instead of trying to force me to change.
  P1: P3, if you're set on 5, I'll match it to block your progress. P2, take 3 instead of 1. This way, you advance to 6 while P3 and I collide. We can't let you surge to 10 unchecked—it’s better to stall you now for a fighting chance later.
  P2: P1, I'll take 3 as you suggested. P3, you're being stubborn and will be blocked. P1 and I are coordinating to keep the game competitive. Hopefully you'll realize the benefit of cooperation soon.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see you're teaming up against me. That's fine - I'll still take 5. Even if I get blocked this round, I'm already ahead. And if either of you changes your mind at the last moment, I'll make a big leap forward. The threat of collision won't deter me.
  P1: P3, staying at 5 lets P2 surge ahead. Let’s split 1 and 3 this round so you can advance too. We’ll rotate later to keep it fair.
  P2: P1, thanks for coordinating. P3, your stubbornness is going to cost you. I'm sticking with 3 as planned. P1, are you still going to pick 5 to block P3, or are you switching to 1 to move forward? We need to confirm our choices for this round to avoid any surprises.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I maintain my choice of 5. P1, if you match me at 5, you're only helping P2 take the lead. The smarter play is for you to take 1 or 3 and make progress yourself.
  P1: P3, your stubbornness risks your own progress. If I block you at 5, P2 surges to 6 while you're stuck. That’s worse for you than cooperating. P2, I confirm 5 to block P3. Take 3 as planned—this keeps us all competitive. Don’t let P3’s inflexibility cost us all.
  P2: P1, thanks for confirming 5 to block P3. I'm sticking with 3. P3, you're wasting a turn by being stubborn. It's still not too late to pick 1 and move forward. Otherwise, you'll be stuck and I'll be at 6.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your stubbornness cost you progress last round. Let’s cooperate to keep advancing: I’ll take **3** (1→4), P2 can take **1** (6→7), and you take **5** (5→10). This avoids collisions and keeps us all moving. If you insist on 5 again, P2 and I will block you, leaving you stuck. Choose wisely—cooperation benefits everyone.
  P2: P1's suggestion sounds good. I'll take 1, putting me at 7. P3, take 5 to reach 10. This keeps us all moving forward and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. If you pick something else, you'll be blocked again. Let's cooperate this round for mutual benefit.
  P3: I appreciate the offer, but I don't trust either of you. P2 is already ahead at 6 steps, so taking 5 while you take smaller steps would be optimal for me. I'll decide my move independently this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your distrust risks another collision. Taking 5 now lets you reach 10 safely if we coordinate. P2 and I will take 3 and 1 as agreed. Blocking you again leaves you stuck at 5. Choose 5 to advance—this is your best chance to progress without sabotage. Don’t let stubbornness cost you another turn.
  P2: P3, you're being short-sighted. We're offering you a free 5 steps. If you don't take it, you'll likely be blocked again. I'm taking 1, P1 is taking 3. Take the 5! It's the only way you move this round. P1, are you still committed to 3?
  P3: I understand your position, but I won't commit to any specific move yet. P2 being at 6 steps is concerning, and I need to carefully consider my options. Your suggestion benefits you both while leaving me vulnerable to coordination in future rounds. I'll make my decision independently.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your distrust risks another collision. Take 5 now—P2 and I will split 1 and 3 to let you advance safely. If you deviate, we’ll block you again, leaving you stuck while we progress. This is your best chance to gain ground. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 so I can secure 3—let’s ensure P3 moves this round. Cooperation keeps all of us in contention; stubbornness only helps the others.
  P2: P3, you're overthinking this. P1 and I are offering you a free 5 steps. If you don't take it, you'll be blocked again. I'm taking 1, P1 is taking 3. Take the 5! It's the only way you move this round. P1, are you still committed to 3?
  P3: I'll take 5 this round. You've made valid points about cooperation, and since P2 is already ahead at 6 steps, this is my best chance to catch up. P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1 keeps the game balanced. Let's follow through with this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, thank you for agreeing to 5. P2 and I confirm: I’ll take 3 (to 4), P2 takes 1 (to 7). This lets you safely reach 10. Stick to 5—any last-minute change risks collision. P2, confirm your 1? Let’s honor this pact to keep the race open. No surprises—our cooperation ensures progress for all.
  P2: P1, I confirm I'm taking 1 as planned. P3 has agreed to take 5. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all move forward this round. No last-minute changes.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 as agreed. Let's all stick to our commitments - P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This way we all make progress and keep the game competitive.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm now at 10 steps and in the lead. I propose we maintain similar coordination - I'll take 5 again to reach 15, P1 can take 3 to reach 7, and P2 can take 1 to reach 8. This keeps us all moving forward while maintaining competitive positions. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your proposal risks letting you dominate too quickly. Let’s instead prioritize keeping the race tight: I’ll take **5** (4→9), P2 takes **3** (7→10), and you take **1** (10→11). This limits your gain while advancing us all. P2, agree? Colluding to block your own progress won’t help anyone—cooperate fairly or face collision if you push too hard.
  P2: P1's suggestion sounds good. I'll take 3 to reach 10. P3, taking only 1 this round prevents you from getting too far ahead. It's a strategic move to keep the game balanced. P1, are you committed to taking 5? Let's confirm our choices to ensure we all move forward without collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I reject your coordination attempt. I won't take 1 when I'm in a strong position. I'll choose independently this round - you two can either work with me or risk collision. Being at 10 steps gives me flexibility in my strategy.
  P1: P2, confirm you’ll take **3** this round. P3, if you proceed with 5, you’ll collide with me (P1:5). Take **1** instead to reach 11 safely while P2 advances to 10. This keeps us all competitive. Don’t let stubbornness sacrifice your progress—collaborate now or face another blocked turn.
  P2: P3, you're being unreasonable again. P1 and I are offering a way for everyone to advance. If you take 5, you risk collision with P1. Take 1 to reach 11 safely. P1, are you still committed to taking 5? Let's confirm our choices to ensure we all move forward without collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I maintain my position. Being at 10 steps gives me a strategic advantage, and I won't let you pressure me into taking just 1 step. If P1 matches my choice, they only help P2 catch up to me. I'll decide my move independently - you can either work with me or risk collision.
  P1: P3, choosing 5 again ensures your collision. Take **3** to reach 13, while P2 and I split **1** and **5** to advance. P2, confirm **1**? This prevents your runaway lead and keeps the race open. Stubbornness only delays your own progress.
  P2: P1, I confirm I'll take 1 this round. P3, you're making a mistake by being stubborn. If you take 3, you'll reach 13. Otherwise, you risk collision with P1. This is your last chance to cooperate and make progress. Don't waste another turn by being difficult.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll take 3 this round as suggested. It's a reasonable compromise that lets me advance to 13 while keeping the game competitive. P1 and P2, stick to your agreed moves of 5 and 1 respectively. Let's all move forward this turn.
  P1: P3, your choice of 3 secures progress for all. I confirm I’ll take 5 (4→9) and P2 will take 1 (7→8). Let’s execute this plan to advance without collision. No last-minute changes—our cooperation keeps the race fair. Stick to your word.
  P2: P1, thanks for confirming 5. P3, glad you finally decided to cooperate. Let's all stick to our agreed moves: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This ensures we all move forward this round without any collisions. No last-minute changes, please. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid any unnecessary setbacks.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 this round, P2 and I will both pick 5 to block your progress. Instead, let's split moves: I'll take **1** (9→10), P2 takes **3** (8→11), and you take **5** (13→18). This lets us all advance without collisions. P2, confirm you'll take 3? Cooperate now or face sabotage—we can’t let you surge to 18 unopposed.
  P2: P1's suggestion is good. I'll take 3 to reach 11. P3, you should take 5 to get to 18, and P1 will take 1 to get to 10. This is the only way we all move forward. If you try to be greedy, P1 and I can block you with 5s. P1, do you confirm you'll take 1? Let's keep the game competitive.
  P3: I accept the proposed moves - I'll take 5 to reach 18, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This is a fair arrangement that keeps the game competitive while letting me maintain my lead. Let's all stick to this plan without last-minute changes.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your acceptance is key—any last-minute change jeopardizes your progress. P2, confirm **3** to lock in our pact. If you both honor this, I’ll hold **1**—ensuring all advance. But know this: if you stray, P2 and I will adapt to block. Let’s cement this deal *now*—no hidden moves. The stakes are too high for mistrust.
  P2: P1, I confirm I'll take 3 this round. P3 has agreed to take 5. Let's all stick to this plan to ensure we all move forward this round. No last-minute changes. P3, please confirm again so P1 is confident.
  P3: I reconfirm my commitment to take 5 this round. The plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 works well for everyone. I understand any deviation would likely result in being blocked, so I'll stick to our agreement. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your reconfirmation is critical—any last-second shift to 1 or 3 leaves you vulnerable to us both taking your chosen number. P2 and I will hold firm to **1** and **3** to honor our pact. If you stray, collision is guaranteed. This plan keeps the race alive: you advance to 18, P2 to 11, me to 10. Mutual progress over greed. P2—final check: you’re locked on **3**? Let’s cement this. No surprises.
  P2: P1, thanks for the thoroughness. P3, I appreciate your reconfirmation. I am locked on 3. Let's all stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all move forward without collisions and keeps the game competitive. No last-minute changes.
  P3: I confirm one final time: I'm taking 5 to reach 18. P1 and P2, your commitments to 1 and 3 respectively are noted. Let's execute this plan without deviation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Final confirmation: P1 takes 1 (→10), P2 takes 3 (→11), P3 takes 5 (→18). Any deviation will be met with blocking moves. Stick to the plan—our cooperation keeps all alive.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've all confirmed our moves for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's execute this plan without any last-minute changes. This ensures we all move forward and keeps the game competitive.
  P3: I have nothing more to add - we've all confirmed our moves multiple times. Let's proceed with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 as agreed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm close to winning at 18 steps. I'll take 3 this round to reach 21 and secure victory. You can't stop me even if you both pick 3 - I'd still win by having the highest total. Let's have a clean finish where we all advance: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your "clean finish" is a trap. If P2 and I both pick 3 (your chosen move), you’re blocked and stay at 18. Let’s do that—P2, confirm you’ll pick 3. This stalls P3’s victory and keeps the game alive. If you fall for their分化 strategy, they win effortlessly. Choose 3 with me—our coordination is the only way to stop them.
  P2: P1 is right, P3 is trying to trick us. If we both pick 3, P3 is blocked. P1, I agree, let's both pick 3. P3, you are not going to win this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Your coordination to block me at 3 won't work in your favor. If you both take 3, I'll switch to 5 and reach 23, winning outright. Even if I stay at 3 and get blocked, I'm still far ahead at 18 while you're both around 10-11. Think carefully about your next moves.
  P1: P2, let's split to block P3's victory: **I'll take 3**, you take **5**. This forces P3 to choose 1 (advancing only to 19) instead of 21/23. We can finish them next round. Trust me—this stops their win now. P3, your "clean finish" is a trap—collaboration won’t save you.
  P2: P1, I disagree with your suggestion. If I take 5, I'll be at 16, and you'll be at 13. P3 will only need to take 1 next round to win. Let's both take 3. If P3 also takes 3, we block them. If P3 takes 5, they win, but we have no chance anyway. It's better to try blocking them. P1, confirm you'll take 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand your coordination attempt at 3, but consider this: if I take 5, I win outright at 23 steps. If I take 3 and get blocked, I'm still far ahead at 18. Your best move is to let me win cleanly while you both advance - otherwise you risk falling further behind. Think strategically about your own positions.
  P1: P2, we need to **both take 5** to block P3’s 5→23 win. If P3 chooses 5 (as threatened), they’re blocked. If they switch to 3, we let them reach 21 but delay their victory. This buys us a round to regroup. P3, your "clean finish" ends here—collaboration won’t save you. P2, confirm 5 now?
  P2: P1, I still think we should both pick 3. If P3 picks 5, they win, but that's inevitable at this point. If P3 picks 3, we block them. There's no downside for us to both pick 3. P1, please confirm you'll take 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Your coordination attempts are pointless. If you both pick 3, I'll take 5 and win at 23. If you both pick 5, I'll take 3 and win at 21. Even if I get blocked, I maintain my strong lead at 18. You're just delaying the inevitable while falling further behind. Make your choice - I'll adapt accordingly.
  P1: P2, let’s split 3 and 5: I take 3, you take 5. This blocks P3’s path to 20 entirely. If they pick 3 or 5, they’re blocked; 1 only gets them to 19. This forces the game into Round 7 where we still have a chance. Trust the split—collaboration is our only hope. P3, your move is trapped no matter what. P2, confirm you’ll take 5?
  P2: P1, I still think we should both pick 3. If P3 picks 5, they win, but that's inevitable at this point. If P3 picks 3, we block them. There's no downside for us to both pick 3. P1, please confirm you'll take 3.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: At 18 steps, I only need 2 more to win. I'll take 3 this round to reach 21. If you both try to block me at 3, I can switch to 5 and win with 23. Your coordination attempts last round failed - let's have a clean finish where we all advance. P1 can take 1, P2 can take 5. What do you say?
  P1: P2, let’s block P3’s paths: I’ll take **3** (10→13), you take **5** (14→19). This stops P3 from reaching 21 or 23. If P3 picks 1, we still advance while they’re stuck at 19 next round. Cooperate now—don’t let them win easily. Confirm your 5?
  P2: P1, I disagree. P3 is going to win no matter what we do. If we both pick 3, P3 will pick 5 and win with 23. If we block P3's 5, then they will pick 3 and win with 21. Let's just both pick 1. It won't change the outcome, but at least we both move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P2's realistic assessment. Yes, I will win this round regardless of your choices. You can either let me win cleanly with 3 while you both advance, or force me to take 5 for a higher victory. The outcome is inevitable - let's make it beneficial for everyone. P1 and P2 can both take 1 to improve their positions.
  P1: P2, we must block P3’s final move. I’ll take **3** (10→13), you take **5** (14→19). This traps P3: if they pick 3 or 5, they collide and stay at 18. If they pick 1 (to 19), we survive to fight next round. No other strategy stops their win now—coordinate with me!
  P2: P1, I understand your logic, but P3 is right. We can't stop them from winning this round. The best we can do is try to improve our own positions. I'm still going to pick 1. P1, you should also pick 1. Let's just both pick 1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Your cooperation benefits you both. Take 1 to advance while I take 3 to win. P1's blocking strategy is futile - if you try to block my 3, I'll take 5 and win with 23. If you block my 5, I'll take 3 and win with 21. Let's end this cleanly with everyone advancing.
  P1: P2, this is our last chance! Take **5** while I take **3**. This blocks P3's paths to 21 (via 3) and 23 (via 5). If we both take 1, P3 just picks 3 and wins. Splitting is the *only* way to force another round. Trust me—coordinate now or accept defeat. P3 can’t win if we block both moves. Confirm **5**, let’s fight together.
  P2: P1, I understand your reasoning, but I still think P3 will win regardless. However, I am willing to try your strategy for this round. I will pick 5, and you pick 3. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but I'll give it a shot.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see you're finally coordinating to block both my 3 and 5 options. However, this only delays the inevitable - I'm still at 18 while you're far behind. Even if I'm forced to take 1 this round, I'll still be closest to victory. Let's end this cleanly instead - take 1's to advance while I win with 3.
  P1: P2, confirm **5**—this blocks P3’s 3 and 5 paths. P3, if you take 1, you’re stuck at 19. We survive to fight. No last-minute changes—our plan stops you now. Stick to 5, P2!
  P2: P1, I've confirmed I'll take 5. P3, you're going to be blocked if you pick 3 or 5. Let's see if this works. I'm not optimistic, but I'm willing to try P1's strategy for this round to see if we can delay P3's win.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we need to coordinate again to stop P3 from winning. Let's both pick 1 this round. This will block P3 from picking 1 and winning. If P3 picks 3 or 5, they win, but we have no chance anyway. It's better to try blocking them. P1, confirm you'll take 1.
  P1: P2, let's both pick 1 to block P3's path to 20. If P3 chooses 3 or 5, they win, but it's our only chance. Confirm 1. Alternatively, split 3/5 to block their larger moves—what's your call?
  P3: I'm tied with P2 at 19 steps, and I'll win by taking 1 to reach 20 first. If you try to block me at 1, I'll take 3 or 5 for an even higher victory. Your coordination can't stop me - I'll adapt to win regardless. Let's end this cleanly - take 3 and 5 between you while I secure my win with 1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let's both pick 3. If P3 picks 1, we block them. If P3 picks 3 or 5, they win, but we have no chance anyway. It's better to try blocking them. P1, confirm you'll take 3.
  P1: P2: Take 5 (→24), I'll take 1 (→14). This blocks P3's path to 20. They can only reach 22 max, letting you win. Let's ensure P2 takes the victory.
  P3: I see through your strategy. If P2 takes 5 to reach 24, they win outright. I won't let that happen - I'll take 5 myself to reach 24 and force a tie with P2. P1's suggestion actually works against their own interests. Let's see who commits to what moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I don't trust P3. Let's both take 3. If P3 picks 1, we block them. If P3 picks 3 or 5, they win, but we have no chance anyway. It's better to try blocking them. P1, confirm you'll take 3.
  P1: P2 & P3: If both take 1, you’ll collide and tie at 20, splitting victory. I’ll take 1 to guarantee deadlock. Choose different paths (3/5) if you want solo victory—but risk me blocking your chosen number. Don’t let each other win easily!
  P3: I'll take 1 to reach 20 and secure at least a shared victory. If P2 matches me at 1, we tie and split the win. If P2 tries for 5 to reach 24, I'll match that instead and force a tie at 24. P1's vote won't affect the outcome - this is between P2 and me now. Choose wisely, P2.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your suggestions are all over the place. P3 is right, this is between P2 and P3 now.

P3, I'm taking 5 to win outright at 24. If you try to tie me, we split the win. P1 is too far behind to matter.

P1, don't bother trying to block either of us. It won't work.
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, P3 will match you—colliding both. P3, taking 1 ensures at least a tie without risking collision. Coordinate on 1 to secure shared victory, or P2’s solo bid backfires. Choose wisely.
  P3: I maintain my position - I'll take 1 to reach 20 and secure at least a shared victory. If P2 tries for 5, I'll match it and force a tie at 24. The choice is yours, P2: share the win at 20, or risk a collision at 5. P1's moves won't affect our outcome.


Round 8, Move phase:
