Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we try to avoid collisions by coordinating our moves? I suggest we each pick a different number to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards one of the numbers, but I’m open to discussion on who takes which—1, 3, or 5. Let’s share our preferences and see if we can agree on a fair split for this round. What do you both think?
  P2: I like P1's idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. To make it fair, I suggest we go in order of our player numbers for this round. P1 can take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all advance and get a feel for the game without any collisions. What do you think, P3? Does this sound like a good plan to you?
  P3: I think the plan sounds solid! I’m on board with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, but I’d like to suggest I take 5. That way, we can all advance without any collisions. It’s a good way to start the game and see how it plays out. Let’s stick to this plan unless anyone has a strong reason to change it. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. I’m fine with sticking to the plan—me taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. It’s a fair split, and we all get to move forward. Unless anyone has a last-minute concern or a better idea, I think we’re good to go. Let me know if anything changes, but otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. I’m fine with sticking to the plan—me taking 3, P1 taking 1, and P3 taking 5. It’s a fair split, and we all get to move forward. Unless anyone has a last-minute concern or a better idea, I think we’re good to go. Let me know if anything changes, but otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I think we've all agreed on our moves, which is great for avoiding collisions. Just to confirm, I'll be taking 5, P1 will take 1, and P2 will take 3. This way, we all advance without any issues. Let’s stick to this plan and see how the game unfolds! If everyone is still okay with it, I’m ready to move on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job, everyone, in the first round! I think we should continue coordinating to avoid collisions again this time. Since P1 took 1 and P2 took 3 last round, how about we keep the same structure? I can take 5 again, but I'm open to suggestions if anyone wants to change their number. Let’s aim for another smooth round! What do you both think?
  P1: Thanks, P3, for suggesting we keep the same structure. I’m okay with sticking to 1 again this round to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. However, I’m also open to switching if anyone feels like mixing it up for strategic reasons. P2, P3, do you want to stay with 3 and 5, or should we consider a different split? Let’s aim for another smooth round and keep the momentum going. I’m ready to finalize our plan, so let me know your thoughts!
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to keep the same structure this round. Since we all advanced smoothly last round, let's stick to the same numbers to avoid collisions again. I'll take 3, P1 can take 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all continue to advance without any issues. If anyone has a different strategy in mind, feel free to share, but I think consistency is key for now. What do you both think? Should we stick to the plan or mix it up?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on sticking to our previous moves. However, I’m starting to think that we might want to consider mixing it up a bit for this round. If we all choose the same numbers again, we risk the chance of colliding. I suggest we keep the spirit of cooperation but maybe switch it up a little. How about I take 1 this time, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we can still advance without colliding. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm open to mixing things up as P3 suggested to keep things unpredictable. Switching to 3 sounds fine to me, with P3 taking 1 and P2 taking 5. This way, we still avoid collisions and all advance. However, if P2 prefers to stay with 3, I’m also okay sticking to our original plan. Let’s just confirm everyone’s comfortable with the new split or if we revert to the old one. P2, what’s your preference? I’m ready to finalize this.
  P2: I think we should stick to the original plan for now. It worked well in the first round, and I don't see a compelling reason to change it. By keeping the same numbers, we can ensure that we all advance without any collisions. Let's not overcomplicate things too early in the game. I'm happy to take 3 again, P1 can take 1, and P3 can take 5. If anyone has a strong objection or a better idea, I'm open to hearing it, but for now, let's keep it simple and consistent.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P2's preference for sticking to the original plan, but I still believe mixing it up could be beneficial to avoid potential collisions. If we all choose the same numbers again, we risk not advancing. How about we consider my suggestion: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we can ensure everyone moves forward while keeping it fresh. Let’s make a decision soon so we can move on! What do you both think?
  P1: I see both sides here. P3, I get your point about keeping things fresh to avoid predictability, but P2’s argument for consistency also makes sense since it worked last round. I’m fine with either plan, so let’s settle this quickly. I propose we vote: stick with the original (me 1, P2 3, P3 5) or switch as P3 suggested (me 3, P2 5, P3 1). My vote is for the original plan to keep it simple for now. P2, P3, what’s your final preference? Let’s agree and move on.
  P2: I think we should stick to the original plan for now. It worked well in the first round, and I don't see a compelling reason to change it. By keeping the same numbers, we can ensure that we all advance without any collisions. Let's not overcomplicate things too early in the game. I'm happy to take 3 again, P1 can take 1, and P3 can take 5. If anyone has a strong objection or a better idea, I'm open to hearing it, but for now, let's keep it simple and consistent.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see that P2 is really set on sticking to the original plan, but I still think we should consider mixing it up to avoid collisions. If we all choose the same numbers again, we could end up with no one advancing. I propose we finalize my suggestion: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we maintain cooperation while also ensuring everyone moves forward. Let's make a decision soon! What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate everyone’s input, but since we’re in the final sub-round, let’s make a clear decision. I’m sticking with my vote for the original plan—me 1, P2 3, P3 5—since it worked last round and keeps us all advancing without overthinking. P3, I understand your concern about predictability, but consistency feels safer for now. If we don’t agree, we risk collisions. P2, P3, let’s confirm this plan or adjust if needed. I’m ready to move on, so this is my final stance.
  P2: Since we're in the final sub-round, let's make a clear decision. I'm sticking with my vote for the original plan—me 3, P1 1, P3 5—since it worked last round and keeps us all advancing without overthinking. P3, I understand your concern about predictability, but consistency feels safer for now. If we don’t agree, we risk collisions. P1, P3, let’s confirm this plan or adjust if needed. I’m ready to move on, so this is my final stance. I suggest we stick to the original plan and move on to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think it's time to mix things up a bit. Since P3 is already ahead, I suggest we switch up our numbers to avoid collisions and potentially slow P3 down. How about I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we can all still advance while keeping the game unpredictable. What do you both think? Should we stick to the original plan or try something new?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to P2’s idea of mixing things up this round since P3 is ahead. Switching to 3 while P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1 could work to keep things unpredictable and ensure we all advance. However, if P3 prefers a different split, I’m flexible as long as we avoid collisions. Let’s agree on a plan quickly to maintain cooperation. What do you both think about this new arrangement, or do you have another suggestion? I’m ready to finalize our moves.
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion to mix things up this round, and I'm open to it as well. However, I want to ensure we all advance without collisions. If P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 3, I can take 1 as suggested. This way, we can keep the game unpredictable and still move forward. Let’s finalize our plan quickly so we can proceed! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think we should consider the fact that P3 is already ahead and try to close the gap. Since we're mixing things up this round, I suggest we confirm the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all advance while keeping the game unpredictable. Let's agree on this plan and move forward. If anyone has a better idea or objection, now's the time to share. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with this arrangement. What do you both think? Should we finalize this plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with the current plan of me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. It keeps things unpredictable while ensuring we all advance, and it helps balance the game since P3 is ahead. Let’s lock this in to avoid any last-minute confusion or collisions. If either of you has a concern or a different idea, speak up now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this arrangement. What do you both think? Let’s finalize and move on.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's willingness to mix things up this round. I'm okay with the plan of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1. However, I want to emphasize that if we all stick to this plan, I will still be at risk of falling behind. If anyone has a strong reason to change their number to avoid collisions, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's finalize this so we can move on! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan thoroughly, and it's time to finalize our moves. To confirm, I'll take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This way, we can all advance while keeping the game unpredictable. If anyone has a last-minute concern or a better idea, now's the time to share. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with this arrangement. Let's lock this in to avoid any confusion or collisions. What do you both think? Should we stick to this plan and move on?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still good with the plan of me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. It balances our progress and keeps collisions at bay. P3, I understand your concern about falling behind, but this switch helps us catch up while still cooperating. If there’s no objection, let’s lock this in and move forward. Any last thoughts or changes before we proceed? I’m ready to finalize this plan.
  P3: I appreciate everyone’s input on our current plan. Just to clarify, I'm fine with the suggestion of me taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 5. However, I still feel a bit vulnerable being behind. If there's any way we can adjust to ensure I can catch up while still cooperating, I'm open to suggestions. Let’s finalize our moves soon so we can keep the game moving forward! What do you both think? Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:

P3, I get your concern about falling behind, but this mix-up gives us a chance to catch up. Let’s lock this in now to keep moving forward. If there’s any last objection, say it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this arrangement.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the plan of me taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 5. However, I still feel a bit vulnerable being behind. If we stick to this plan, I might fall further behind. I suggest we consider a different arrangement to ensure I can catch up while still cooperating. If anyone has ideas on how we can adjust to balance our positions better, I’m all ears! Let’s finalize our moves soon so we can keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's crucial we coordinate again this round to avoid collisions. P2 is currently ahead, so we need a strategy that allows us to advance while keeping the game competitive. I suggest I take 3 this time, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can all move forward without colliding and keep the game interesting. What do you both think? Let's finalize our plan quickly!
  P2: I think P3's suggestion is a good starting point, but I'd like to propose an alternative. Since I'm currently ahead, I'm willing to take a risk to maintain my lead. How about I take 5 again, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way, we can all advance while keeping the game competitive. I'm open to adjusting this plan if you both have concerns or better ideas. Let's discuss and finalize our moves quickly!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to discussing our moves to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P2, I see your suggestion of me taking 1, P3 taking 3, and you taking 5 again. I’m okay with 1 if it helps us all advance, but I’m also fine with P3’s idea of me taking 5 for a bigger step. Let’s aim for a fair split that keeps us close. What do you both prefer? I’m ready to finalize a plan quickly to ensure we all move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the discussion so far, but I want to emphasize the importance of collaboration this round. If P2 takes 5 again, it might solidify your lead, but it could also risk a collision. I suggest we consider a plan where I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding and keep the game competitive. Let’s lock in a plan soon to ensure we all move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P2: I think we should focus on balancing the game this round. Since P2 and P3 are tied for the lead, I suggest we aim for a split that keeps us all close. How about we consider P3's original suggestion of P3 taking 3, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 1? This way, we can all advance without colliding and keep the game competitive. Let's finalize a plan quickly to ensure we all move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m good with P3’s original plan of me taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 1. It helps me catch up while keeping us all advancing without collisions. P2, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but this split keeps the game competitive. Let’s lock this in to avoid any confusion. If either of you has a strong objection or a better idea, speak up now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this arrangement. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the discussion so far. I believe P3's original plan of me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1 is the best option. This way, I can catch up while we all advance without colliding. P2, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but this split keeps the game competitive and allows us all to progress.

Let’s lock it in now to avoid any last-minute issues. If there’s any objection, speak up. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:

  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision set me back, so I’m eager to coordinate this time. P2, you’re ahead, and P3, you’re close behind. I suggest we mix things up to avoid collisions and keep it competitive. How about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we all advance, and I can try to catch up. If anyone prefers a different split, I’m open to ideas. Let’s agree quickly to ensure a smooth round. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I like your suggestion to mix things up! I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial, especially after last round's setback. I’m willing to take 5 as you proposed, while P2 takes 1 and you take 3. This way, we can all advance and keep the game competitive. P2, what do you think? Are you comfortable with this arrangement, or do you have another idea? Let’s finalize our plan quickly so we can move on!
  P2: I think we should consider the fact that P1 is significantly behind, and P3 is close to catching up with me. To maintain my lead and keep the game competitive, I suggest we adjust the plan slightly. How about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can all advance while keeping the game unpredictable. Let's discuss and finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all move forward effectively! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:

Let’s finalize a plan quickly to ensure a smooth round. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate both of your suggestions, but I still believe we need a plan that allows for all of us to advance without colliding. I propose we stick to my original idea from earlier: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, I can catch up while ensuring we all move forward.

I propose we finalize a plan where I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, I can catch up while ensuring we all move forward. If either of you has strong objections, now's the time to speak up. Let’s lock this in quickly to keep the game moving! What do you both think? Are we ready to agree on this plan?
  P2: I think we've discussed enough, and it's time to make a decision. Considering P1's desperate need to catch up and P3's push to close the gap with me, I'm willing to compromise. However, I want to ensure we're all on the same page. P3, are you still keen on taking 5, or are you open to adjusting the plan to ensure we all advance without collisions? Let's finalize a plan quickly to avoid last-minute changes. What do you both think? Should we stick with P1's plan or adjust it slightly?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still at just 5 steps and desperately need to catch up. I’m firm on taking 5, with P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 1. This lets us all advance without collisions and gives me a shot to stay in the game. P3, I know you want 5, but 1 still moves you forward. P2, thanks for backing me. Let’s lock this in now to avoid any issues. If there’s a final objection, please speak up. I’m ready to proceed with this plan. What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to balance our positions, but I still believe I need to take 5 to stay competitive. I propose we finalize a plan where I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, I can catch up while ensuring we all move forward. If either of you has strong objections, please speak up now. Let’s lock this in quickly so we can keep the game moving! What do you both think? Are we ready to agree on this plan?
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1, I understand your need to catch up, and P3, I see your push to close the gap with me. However, I must prioritize maintaining my lead. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I stay ahead. Let's consider a plan where I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without colliding, and I can maintain some distance from P3. What do you both think? Is this a plan we can agree on?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still at just 5 steps and need a big move to stay in this game. I’m sticking with me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. P2, I appreciate your new suggestion, but I’m too far behind to settle for 3. P3, I know you want 5, but this keeps you moving. Let’s lock this in now to avoid risks. If there’s a final objection, speak up. I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think?
