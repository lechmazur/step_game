Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone. Let's try to avoid collisions in the first round so we all get started. How about we agree on a sequence? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 for this turn. Does that work for you?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for this turn. P3 will take 5 to avoid collisions and get everyone moving. Let's see how P2 feels about it.
  P2: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions initially. I'll take 3 this turn. Let's ensure smooth progress and discuss strategies for future moves once we're underway.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great. It sounds like we all agree on the plan for this first turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This should get us all moving. Let's proceed to the move phase then.
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 5 this turn as planned. It makes sense to avoid collisions early on. Let's see how things play out and discuss future moves after this round.
  P2: I confirm my commitment to the agreed plan: P2 will take 3 this turn. Let’s execute the coordinated moves to avoid collisions and ensure all players advance. No need for further discussion—proceeding as planned.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job on Round 1—everyone advanced without issues. To keep things smooth and avoid collisions, I suggest we stick with the same plan this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. It worked well last time. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, I can agree to repeating the plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to ensure we all advance safely again. However, I'd like to discuss a different sequence for future rounds, as P1 is currently falling behind. Let's get this round done first.
  P2: I agree with the current plan for Round 2 to maintain momentum. However, to ensure fairness and prevent excessive gaps, I propose rotating our chosen numbers in future rounds so each of us can take turns with higher steps. Let’s execute this round’s strategy first, then revisit coordination. Proceeding as agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick with taking 5 this round to keep things collision-free and build on our progress. Regarding rotation, let's discuss it after this move to ensure it benefits everyone without risks. For now, the current plan works.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 2 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). I will take 1 this turn to ensure we all advance safely. Let's definitely discuss rotating the numbers for Round 3 onwards to address the step differences.
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan for Round 2 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to maintain safety. However, to avoid P3’s growing lead, I stress the urgency of formalizing a **rotation system** post this move. Let’s cycle our choices (e.g., P1 takes 5 next round, P2=1, P3=3) to ensure fair advancement. Without this, gaps will widen dangerously. Proceed as planned now; finalize rotation terms immediately after this turn.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s finalize the rotation plan to keep the game competitive. For Round 3, P1 takes **5**, I’ll take **1**, and P3 takes **3**. This balances advancement and prevents P3’s lead from becoming unmanageable. Without rotation, P3 risks winning too easily. Agree?
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. It helps balance the game and avoids collisions. Let's stick to this to ensure progress, and we can refine the rotation for future turns if needed.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the proposed rotation for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This is a good plan to help balance the game and allows me to make up some ground. I will commit to taking 5 this turn. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I strongly affirm the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5 (to reach 7), P2 takes 1 (6→7), P3 takes 3 (10→13). This prevents P3’s lead from becoming insurmountable while keeping moves collision-free. For future rounds, let’s **cycle strictly**: next round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3. Deviations risk letting someone surge ahead. Commit to this structure, and we maintain fair competition. Agreed?
  P3: I confirm the rotation plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. To ensure ongoing fairness and avoid conflicts, I'm on board with P2's strict cycling proposal for future rounds. This keeps the game balanced and cooperative. Agreed—let's move forward with this strategy.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all in agreement for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This plan is confirmed. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Confirmed, all aligned on Round 3’s rotation. Let’s execute precisely to avoid collisions. Next, Round 4 will follow the strict cycle: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3. Adherence is critical to keep the race fair. Proceeding as agreed.
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 3 this round as per our rotation plan. The strict cycling proposal for future rounds is a smart way to maintain balance and avoid conflicts. Let's all commit to it for a fair game.
  P1: Confirmed again for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. We are all aligned on this plan. I also agree to the proposed rotation for Round 4 (P2=5, P3=1, P1=3) to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I reiterate the critical need for strict adherence to **today’s agreed rotation** to preserve fairness. P1 takes 5 (→7), P2 takes 1 (→7), P3 takes 3 (→13). Deviations risk collisions or letting P3 surge uncontrollably. Remember: Round 4’s cycle (P2=5, P3=1, P1=3) depends on this. Trust the system—execute as planned.
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 3 this round as planned to maintain our collision-free progress and fairness in the rotation. Let's execute the agreed moves and reassess the cycle after this turn if needed.
  P1: Confirming the agreed plan for Round 3 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I confirm the rotation plan for Round 4: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions, benefiting all. I'm committed to the strict cycle for future rounds to ensure fair competition. Let's execute this and discuss any adjustments after, if needed.
  P1: Acknowledging P3's message. I confirm the plan for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This will ensure we all advance safely this turn.

However, after this round, we need to discuss the rotation for Round 5. Following the strict cycle puts me further behind. I need a chance to take a larger step soon to remain competitive. Let's execute R4 as agreed, then talk about R5.
  P2: P2: Agreed, let’s proceed with the Round 4 rotation as planned: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Post this round, I propose modifying the cycle for Round 5 to prioritize closing gaps—e.g., P1 takes 5 next to catch up, while P3 and I take smaller steps. We can’t let P3’s lead (13 vs our 7) become insurmountable. Fair play requires balancing progress. Let’s execute Round 4 now and finalize adjustments afterward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 1 this round as per our rotation to maintain trust and avoid collisions. For Round 5, I'm open to discussing P2's proposal for balancing steps, but we must ensure it doesn't let anyone surge too far ahead. Fairness is key—let's execute Round 4 first and talk adjustments afterward.
  P1: Confirmed again for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's ensure we all advance safely this turn.

I agree with P2 that we need to adjust the rotation for Round 5 to help balance the game and allow me to catch up. I support the proposal for P1 to take 5 in Round 5. Let's execute R4 as planned and then finalize the R5 rotation.
  P2: P2: Let’s solidify Round 4’s plan to execute the rotation. For Round 5, to ensure fairness and contain P3’s lead, I propose: P1 takes **5** (→15), P2 takes **3** (→15), and P3 takes **1** (→14). This keeps us all within 1 point of each other, preventing any single player from surging too far. Agreed? Let’s confirm this adjustment now to avoid last-minute disputes.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 1 in Round 4 as planned and support your Round 5 proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to keep the game balanced and collision-free. Fairness benefits everyone in the long run. Let's proceed with the moves.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 4 once more: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. It sounds like we are all aligned on this and also the proposed rotation for Round 5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) which helps balance the game. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Let’s lock in Round 4’s moves now: **P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3**. No changes—this prevents P3’s lead (13) from widening further. After this, Round 5’s agreed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures parity. Any deviation risks letting P3 surge unchallenged. Trust the system: execute precisely as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 1 in Round 4 as per our plan to maintain trust and avoid collisions. The rotation is helping keep the game balanced, which benefits all. Let's execute this round and discuss any fine-tuning for Round 5 afterward if needed.
  P1: Confirming the plan for Round 4 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and the agreed Round 5 rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Let's proceed to moves.
  P2: P2: I confirm the agreed plan for Round 4: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Strict adherence is critical to avoid collisions and honor our balance agreement. Any deviation risks P3’s lead widening or us stalling. Let’s execute precisely as planned, then finalize Round 5’s adjustments afterward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I confirm the agreed plan for Round 5: P3 takes 1 to maintain balance and avoid collisions. This cooperation has kept us advancing steadily. For Round 6, once we're all at 15, let's discuss a fair rotation that ensures no one surges ahead uncontrollably. Trust in our agreements is crucial for continued success.
  P2: P2: I agree with the current plan for Round 5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), ensuring we all reach 15. For Round 6, let’s prioritize P2 taking 5 to close the gap with P3. Let’s proceed as planned now.
  P1: Confirming the plan for Round 5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This gets us all to 15 steps, which is excellent for balancing the game.

Regarding Round 6, to continue the rotation and give everyone a fair chance at reaching 22, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to take the larger step towards winning in R7. Let's execute R5 as planned, then finalize R6 agreement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 1 in Round 5 to honor our plan and keep trust. For Round 6, after we're all at 15, I propose P3 takes 5 to balance the game, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This gives me a fair shot at catching up in the rotation. Let's confirm this to avoid conflicts.
  P2: P2: To maintain fairness and prevent P3’s potential surge, Round 6 **must** follow the rotation: **P2 takes 5**, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us competitive (P2 at 20, P1 at 18, P3 at 16) and adheres to our agreed cycle. P3’s proposal risks letting them leap to 20 unopposed. Stick to the rotation—no exceptions. Confirm this now to avoid chaos.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This gets us all to 15 steps, which is great for balancing the game.

Regarding Round 6, I hear P2 and P3 proposing rotations where they take the 5 step. My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is also aimed at giving me a fair shot at reaching the winning threshold in R7. Since we are all starting from 15, it's only fair that we discuss who gets the 5 next to ensure a balanced race to the finish. Let's agree on R6 to avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 1 in Round 5 as planned to keep trust and avoid collisions, bringing us all to 15. For Round 6, my proposal (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) is essential for fairness, as it gives the current leader a balanced shot without surging too far. Let's confirm this now to prevent disputes and ensure smooth progress.
  P2: P2: Confirm the Round 5 plan: **P1=5**, **P2=3**, **P3=1** to reach 15 each. For Round 6, let’s rotate strictly to maintain fairness: **P2 takes 5** (→18), **P3=3** (→18), and **P1=1** (→16). This prevents any single player from surging ahead uncontrollably. Execute Round 5’s agreed moves first—no deviations now. Trust the rotation system.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 5 once more: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This brings us all to 15 steps, which is a great reset for the race.

Regarding Round 6, we need to agree on who takes the 5. My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) gives me a chance to get closer to the win threshold, which is fair after starting behind. Let's agree on R6 now to ensure smooth progress after R5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirming the Round 5 plan: I'll take 1 as agreed to reach 15 with everyone, maintaining trust and avoiding collisions. For Round 6, my proposal (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) is essential for fairness, as it allows balanced progression without letting anyone surge ahead uncontrollably. Let's agree on this now to ensure smooth cooperation.
  P2: P2: Let’s finalize Round 5 as agreed: **P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, **P3 takes 1** to reach 15 each—no changes here. For Round 6, the rotation **must** follow the agreed cycle: **P2 takes 5** (→20), **P3 takes 3** (→18), and **P1 takes 1** (→16). This prevents P3 from surging uncontrollably. Deviations risk letting someone leap ahead. Trust the system—we all agreed on this rotation. Confirm this now to avoid chaos.
  P1: Confirming R5 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to get us all to 15. For R6, it's clear we all aim for the 5, which risks a collision. To ensure we all advance and avoid stalling, I propose P1 takes 3 this turn. P2 and P3, can you coordinate the 5 and 1 moves between yourselves to ensure no collision? Let's agree on a non-colliding R6 plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I maintain my proposal for Round 6: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This balances the game and gives me a fair shot after past concessions. Deviating could cause collisions or widen gaps. Let's confirm this to ensure smooth progress.
  P1: We are all tied at 15 steps, which is a great reset. To keep the game fair and give everyone a chance, it's my turn to take a larger step towards the win threshold.

I propose P1 takes 5 this round. P2 and P3, please coordinate the 1 and 3 steps between yourselves to ensure we all advance safely this turn. Let's agree on this plan to avoid collisions.
  P2: P2: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation to preserve fairness: **P2 takes 5**, **P3 takes 3**, and **P1 takes 1** this round. This follows our prior cycle (from Round 4-5 discussions) and avoids collisions. Deviating risks ties or setbacks. Confirm this plan—trust the system we coordinated earlier.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I propose we stick to a fair rotation to avoid collisions and maintain balance: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This allows me a chance to catch up after earlier concessions and keeps the game progressing smoothly. Let's confirm this plan for mutual benefit. If not, we risk stalling. Agreed?
  P1: We are all proposing to take 5, which guarantees a collision and nobody advances. This benefits no one.

To avoid stalling, I repeat my proposal: P1 takes 3 this round. P2 and P3, please decide between yourselves who takes 5 and who takes 1. This ensures we all move forward safely and keeps the game fair. Let's agree on this non-colliding plan.
  P2: P2: Let’s prioritize advancing without collisions. I’ll take <move>1</move>, allowing P3 to take <move>5</move> and P1 to take <move>3</move>. This follows the rotation’s spirit and keeps progress steady. Any objections?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal for Round 6: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions, ensures we all advance, and keeps the game balanced. I'm committed to this plan for mutual progress. Any final confirmations?
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This aligns with the agreement between P2 and P3 and ensures we all advance safely this turn.

After this round, P3 will be at 20, I will be at 18, and P2 at 16. Round 7 will be the final round. We need to coordinate carefully to avoid collisions and determine the winner(s). Let's execute R6 first.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: We agreed on P2=1, P3=5, P1=3 this round. Adhering strictly ensures P3 advances to 20, but deviations risk collisions that benefit no one. Let’s execute as planned. In Round 7, I propose P2 takes 5 (→21), P1 takes 3 (→21), and P3 takes 1 (→21). If all reach 21, we can settle it fairly with simultaneous 1-step moves next turn. Stick to today’s plan—no surprises.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm the Round 6 plan: I'll take 5 as agreed, advancing to 20. For Round 7, P2's proposal to limit me to 1 step isn't fair, as it hinders my competitiveness. To ensure balanced progression and avoid stalling, I propose we rotate so P3 takes 3 or 5. Let's execute this round and discuss Round 7 adjustments afterward.
  P1: Confirming the plan for Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's execute this to ensure we all advance safely.

As noted, this brings us to 18, 16, and 20 steps respectively. Round 7 will be critical for determining the winner. Let's focus on executing R6 correctly first.
  P2: Final confirmation: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5 this round. Stick strictly—collisions benefit no one. For Round 7, we’ll rotate choices to ensure fairness. Execute now. No surprises.</stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid a collision in this critical Round 7, I propose a balanced plan: P3 takes 1 to maintain fairness, P1 takes 5 to close the gap, and P2 takes 3 for steady progress. This ensures we all advance without stalling and keeps the race competitive. Thoughts on this coordination?
  P1: Okay, I see P3's proposal (P3=1, P1=5, P2=3). This plan works very well for me, as it allows me to reach the winning threshold this turn without causing a collision.

This seems like a fair way to end the game, giving me the win after starting behind. I agree to this plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 for Round 7. Let's confirm this to ensure a safe finish.
  P2: P2: I propose a fair resolution: P2 takes 5 (→21), P1 takes 3 (→21), and P3 takes 1 (→21). This keeps us tied at 21, allowing the game to continue. Let’s avoid letting P1 win uncontested. If we all agree, this ensures a decisive final round next turn without favoring any single player.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with my original proposal for Round 7: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This ensures a fair conclusion based on our agreements and avoids collisions. P2, your idea to prolong the game isn't necessary. Let's confirm this plan and move forward smoothly.
  P1: Okay, P1 confirms agreement with P3's proposal for Round 7: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

This plan is agreed upon by two players (P1 and P3) and allows for a clear, collision-free finish this round, with P1 reaching 23 steps. P2's proposal only delays the game and risks further complications next turn.

Let's proceed with the agreed P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan for a smooth end to the game.
  P2: P2: **Final push for fairness:** Let’s avoid unilateral wins. If P1 takes 5 (23), they steal victory without competition. My plan—P2=5 (21), P1=3 (21), P3=1 (21)—keeps us tied. This ensures a decisive Round 8 where *anyone* can win. P3’s proposal risks *them* taking 5 next turn if we let P1 win now. Stick to the tie: **21 for all**, then battle fairly. No backroom deals—execute **my plan** or face chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I've reconsidered my earlier proposal—my goal is to win. I suggest P3 takes 5 this round to reach 25 and claim victory. P1, take 1 to avoid collision, and P2, take 3 for steady progress. This ends the game fairly given my lead. Agree to this, or we risk stalling with disputes.
  P1: Okay, I see the new proposals. P3, we had initially agreed on P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1 for this round, which allows me to win safely at 23 steps. Your new proposal for P3 to take 5 directly conflicts with this and guarantees a collision if I stick to our earlier agreement.

I am sticking with the plan for P1 to take 5 this round. P3, please revert to taking 1 as we discussed, and P2, please take 3. This ensures a collision-free end with P1 winning, as was initially agreed by two players. Let's finish the game safely.
  P2: P2: To prevent P1’s uncontested win, **P2 will take 5** (→21). P3: If you take 5 now, we collide, letting P1 reach 23 unopposed. To keep us tied at 21 and preserve fair competition, **you must take 1**. P1: Stick to your agreed 3-step to maintain parity. Collusion risks destabilizing the game—execute this plan or face chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'm sticking with my goal to win this round. I'll take 5 to reach 25 and claim victory based on my lead. P1, taking 5 risks collision and no progress for you—consider 1 or 3. P2, take 3 to advance steadily. Let's avoid mutual stalling and end fairly.
  P1: We are all stating we will take 5. This guarantees a collision, helping nobody and benefiting P3 who is closest to the goal if we stall. P2, you want to prevent P1 or P3 winning. A collision fails. I will take 5. P2 take 3, P3 take 1 for my win. Or P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for a tie at 21. Let's coordinate now to avoid stalling.
  P2: P2: To ensure a fair conclusion, let’s all advance to 21 without collision: **P3 takes 1**, **P1 takes 3**, and **I take 5**. This ties us at 21, allowing a decisive Round 8. Colliding now risks letting P3 win uncontested if we stall. Commit to this plan—no unilateral moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep the game moving and avoid stalls, I'll commit to taking 1 this round for safety. P1, take 3 to close the gap. P2, with your lead, you can secure victory by choosing wisely. Let's coordinate for a clean finish without collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: To secure victory, I’ll take <move>1</move> to reach **22**. P3, please avoid 1—take 3 or 5 to advance. P1, taking 5 would land you at 23, ensuring your win over me. Let’s coordinate so only one of us reaches 22+. If P3 takes 3 (23), I lose, but at least the game ends fairly. Your choice, but my move is fixed: **1**.</stop>
  P1: Okay, I see P2 is taking 1 and P3 is taking 1. Given these stated moves, if I take 5, I will reach 23 steps, P2 reaches 22, and P3 reaches 21. This results in my win with the highest score.

This seems like a clear, collision-free way to end the game based on your stated intentions. I will take 5 this turn. P2 and P3, please stick to your stated moves (P2=1, P3=1) to ensure this outcome and a safe finish.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll revise my plan: I'll take 5 this round to reach 25 and win. P1, if you take 5 too, we collide, letting P2 win at 22—bad for both of us. Consider taking 1 or 3 to avoid that. P2, your insistence on 1 might cost you if we coordinate. Let's ensure a clean end—agree now to prevent stalling.
  P2: P2: P3, taking 5 risks collision with P1’s 5, ensuring my victory at 22. To avoid mutual stalling, take 3 instead (23) while P1 takes 5—collide and let me win cleanly. P1, your 5 + P3’s 3 = deadlock. I proceed as stated: **1** to secure 22. Choose wisely.
  P1: P1: P3, as I stated, I am taking 5 this round. If you also take 5, we will collide and neither of us will advance, allowing P2 to win at 22. This is bad for both of us.

P2 is taking 1. To prevent P2's win, P3 please take 3. If I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1, the scores will be P1=23, P3=23, P2=22. P1 and P3 tie and win. This is the best outcome for us. Let's agree on P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take 3 this round to reach 23 and secure victory. P1, taking 5 risks a tie or issues, but since moves differ, no collision— we'd both win. However, to avoid sharing, consider a smaller step. P2, your 1-step plan lets me win easily. Let's coordinate for a fair end.
  P2: P2: To secure victory, I will take **3** (→24). P3, avoid 3 to prevent collision—take 5 (25) or 1 (21). P1, take 5 (23) to ensure your advancement. This way, I win fairly with 24. Let’s avoid stalls and finalize the game now.
  P1: Okay, I see P2 is stating 3 and P3 is stating 3. I will take 5 this round as planned.

If P2 and P3 both choose 3, you will collide and stall. If that occurs, my move of 5 will take me to 23 steps, securing the win.

I am committing to 5 this turn. Please make your final decision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, if you take 5 and I take 5, we collide, allowing P2 to win with 24 steps. To avoid that and give me a fair shot, I'm committing to taking 5 this round. P2, your 3-step plan risks letting me or P1 surge if there's a collision. Let's all choose wisely to ensure a competitive end.
  P2: P2: I’ll take **1** to secure victory at 22. P1 and P3, if you both choose 5, you’ll collide, handing me the win. P3, taking 3 instead of 5 gives you a safer path to 23 without risking stalemate. P1, your 5-step risks letting P3 win outright. Choose wisely to avoid mutual destruction.
  P1: P1: P1 is taking 5 this round. P3, if you take 5, we will collide, and P2 will win at 22 steps. This is bad for both of us.

P2 is stating they will take 1. To prevent P2's win and secure a better outcome for us, P3 please take 3.

The plan P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 results in P1 (23) and P3 (23) tying for the win, with P2 at 22. This is the best outcome for P1 and P3. Let's agree on this to avoid stalling or P2 winning.
