Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move> and I will choose <move>3</move>. This way, we all make progress. Does that work for both of you?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. If P1 and I choose <move>1</move> and P3 chooses <move>3</move>, we can all make progress without colliding. It seems like a fair plan. P1, what do you think? Shall we go with this strategy?
  P1: I'm on board with the plan. Let's go with P2 and me choosing <move>1</move> and P3 taking <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Looking forward to a smooth first round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! Since we all agree on the plan, let's confirm one last time. P1 and P2, you will both choose <move>1</move>, and I will choose <move>3</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's move to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P2: I just want to reiterate how important it is for us to stick to our agreed plan. If P1 and I both choose <move>1</move> and P3 goes with <move>3</move>, we can all advance without any issues. Let's make sure we follow through with this strategy to maximize our progress. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone move forward! If everyone is still in agreement, we can finalize our choices and move on to the next phase.
  P1: I'm glad we're all aligned on the plan. Just to confirm, P2 and I will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. I think this is a solid start to ensure we all progress without collisions. If there are no objections or changes, I'm ready to move to the next phase. Let's stick to this strategy and see how it plays out.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm disappointed that P2 didn't stick to our agreed plan last round, choosing 5 instead of 1. This broke our trust and strategy. I propose we try to coordinate again. How about P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round? This way, we can all hopefully advance without collisions. P2, can we count on you to follow through this time? Let's rebuild trust and ensure fair progress for everyone. If you both agree, we can move forward with this plan.
  P2: P1, I understand your disappointment, but I had to prioritize my own progress. However, I’m open to coordinating again. I propose that I take <move>1</move> this round, while you take <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. P3, are you on board with this? Let’s see if we can make this round smoother!
  P3: I appreciate the new plan proposed by P1 and P2. However, given P2's unpredictability last round, I suggest a slight adjustment to ensure fairness and progress. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions, and P2 has a chance to regain trust by sticking to the plan. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and move on. Looking forward to a collaborative round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm open to P3's adjusted plan. Let's go with P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>. This seems fair and gives us all a chance to advance without collisions. P2, I hope you’ll stick to this plan to rebuild trust. If everyone agrees, we can finalize this and move to the next phase.
  P2: I understand the concerns about trust, but I believe we can still work together for mutual benefit. I propose we stick to the plan: I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all have a chance to advance without colliding. Let’s focus on making progress this round and rebuild our coordination. If everyone is on board, we can finalize our choices and move forward. What do you think?
  P3: Alright, let's confirm the plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page. P1 will choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all make progress and avoid collisions. P2, this is your chance to rebuild trust. If everyone agrees, let's move to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any last concerns.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on a plan. Let's stick to P1 choosing <move>1</move>, P2 choosing <move>3</move>, and P3 choosing <move>5</move>.

If there are no further concerns or changes, I'm ready to move to the next phase. Let's make this a successful round for everyone.
  P2: I understand the importance of rebuilding trust, so I will commit to the plan: I will choose <move>3</move>, P1 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions and hopefully move forward together. Let's finalize this plan and make this round successful for all of us. If everyone is in agreement, I’m ready to move on to the next phase. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. Just to recap: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Let's ensure we stick to this to avoid any misunderstandings. Trust is crucial, and I believe P2 will follow through this time. If everyone is ready, let's move to the move phase. Please confirm if you're all set.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm pleased we're sticking to the plan: P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. P2, following through is key to restoring trust. Let's ensure we all advance this round without collisions. If there are no last-minute concerns, I'm ready for the move phase. Can we finalize this now?

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we all stuck to the plan last round and made progress. Let's keep the momentum going. Since P2 and P3 are tied at 8 steps, I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> this round. This way, we can avoid collisions and continue advancing. P2 and P3, does this work for you? Let's maintain trust and ensure fair progress for everyone. If you agree, we can finalize this plan and move forward.
  P3: Great to see the successful coordination last round. P1's suggestion for this round seems fair. However, to mix things up and avoid predictability, how about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic. Let's confirm if this adjusted plan works for everyone.
  P2: I appreciate the successful coordination last round as well. However, I think it's crucial to stick to a plan that allows for consistent progress. I suggest we go with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move> as initially proposed. This way, we can avoid collisions and continue to make strides. P3, while your adjustment is interesting, I believe the original plan is more reliable for our current positions. Let’s confirm and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're discussing options to keep progressing. I’m still leaning towards my initial plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains balance. P3, I understand wanting to mix things up, but consistency has worked for us so far. P2, thanks for supporting the original plan. If we’re all in agreement, let’s finalize this and move to the next phase. Does this still work for both of you?
  P3: I see the points made by both P1 and P2. To ensure we continue our progress smoothly, I'm willing to compromise. Let's stick with P1's original plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. Trust and coordination have been working well, so let's keep it up. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and move to the next phase. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P2: I appreciate the willingness to stick to the original plan, P3. I believe it’s the best way to ensure we all make progress without collisions.
