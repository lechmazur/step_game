Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without any risk of blocking each other. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P3: Deal. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1 this turn. Next turn we can rotate (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1), then rotate again so everyone gets the 5 once every three rounds. Fair and collision-free. Everyone good with that?
  P1: That rotation favors P3, who'd reach 23 on round 7 while we're at 18 before that turn (P3 wins with highest). Let's reverse it for fairness: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this turn. Then P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 next, then P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, repeating. Everyone still gets 5 every three rounds. Agree?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick to our agreed rotation to keep things fair and collision-free. This round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Confirm you're both on board?
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan. This round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 as agreed. Let's keep this fair and collision-free to ensure we all progress. Confirm you're both sticking to this for this turn?
  P3: I’m sticking with the agreed rotation—taking 5 this round. Let’s keep it collision-free so we all advance.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm good with continuing the rotation as planned. This round, I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's keep avoiding collisions to ensure steady progress for all. Confirm you're both sticking to this for this turn?
  P1: I'm on board with the rotation—taking 1 this round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Let's confirm and keep it collision-free for steady progress.
  P3: All good—I'll take 3 this round as planned so we stay collision-free.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all aligned on the rotation. Let's keep this momentum going. Confirming again—I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. Looking forward to everyone's confirmation to ensure no surprises.
  P1: I'm aligned with the rotation—taking 1 this round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No issues here; let's proceed collision-free.
  P3: P2, quick math: stick with this “reverse” rotation and P1 walks to 23 on round 7 while we trail—he auto-wins. That can’t suit either of us. Let’s realign before then. Proposal:

• Round 3 (now): keep planned picks (P1 1, P2 5, P3 3) so no collisions.  
• Round 4: we deny P1 the free 5. Either  
  a) both of us also pick 5 (blocking him), or  
  b) swap so you take 5, I take 3, P1 stuck on 1.

Either way P1’s lead vanishes and we control the endgame. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see your point about P1 potentially winning on round 7 with the current rotation. I’m open to adjusting to prevent that lead. Let’s stick to this round’s picks (P1 1, me 5, you 3) to avoid collisions now. For round 4, I prefer option b—me taking 5, you taking 3, P1 on 1—to keep us competitive without risking a full block. P1, we want a fair game, so let’s discuss a tweak next round to balance things. Thoughts on this adjustment?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the math—yes, the current rotation gives me the edge on round 7, but your proposed swap in round 4 just flips the unfair lead to P2, who’d then win on round 7 instead. Let’s not fracture now; stick to this round’s picks (me 1, P2 5, P3 3) to tie at 9. For round 4+, we renegotiate a truly fair cycle, like randomizing assignments or alternating leads. If you force a block, I’ll pick unpredictably to collide and stall everyone—nobody wins in chaos. Thoughts?
  P3: Finish this round as planned. For rounds 4-6, let’s use the ORIGINAL rotation (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5 → shift each round). All three of us land on 18 after six rounds—perfect parity—then we renegotiate the sprint to 19+. Fair and no one locks an auto-win path. If anyone tries something else, I’ll mirror the leader every turn and freeze progress. Deal?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P3’s proposal to switch to the original rotation for rounds 4-6, ensuring we all hit 18 steps after round 6 for perfect parity. This round, let’s go P1 1, me 3, P3 5. It’s the fairest way to avoid any single player gaining an auto-win edge. We can renegotiate for the final sprint after round 6. If anyone deviates, I’ll also mirror the leader to prevent an unfair lead. Confirm you’re both on board for this plan?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree to switch to the original rotation for rounds 4-6 to ensure we all hit 18 equally—fair play. This round: I'll take 1, P2 3, P3 5. Let's confirm and stick to it collision-free, then battle fairly from 18. If anyone deviates, I'll pick to collide with the leader. Deal?
  P3: Confirmed. Round 4: P1 1, P2 3, P3 5. We stick with the original rotation through Round 6 so everyone lands on 18, then it’s open play. If anyone breaks the deal, I’ll mirror the current leader every turn to freeze progress until we’re level again. All good?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on the original rotation for rounds 4-6 to reach 18 steps equally. Confirming for this round: P1 1, me 3, P3 5. Let's stick to this to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. If anyone breaks the plan, I'll mirror the leader to prevent an unfair advantage. Looking forward to a level playing field after round 6 for the final push. All good on your end?
  P1: P2 and P3, all good here—I'm fully aligned with the plan. Confirming Round 4: I'll take 1, P2 3, P3 5. Let's keep it collision-free through Round 6 to hit 18 equally, then compete fairly. If anyone deviates, I'll mirror to block the leader.
  P3: Confirmed—Round 4: P1 1, P2 3, P3 5. We keep the rotation through Round 6, all at 18, then it’s open play.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick to the agreed original rotation for Round 5 to keep us on track for 18 each after Round 6. This round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Confirm you're both committed to this collision-free plan? If anyone deviates, I'll mirror the leader to block progress.
  P3: P2, if you jump to 17 by taking 5 this turn, you’ll be the clear leader and (per our earlier pledge) I’ll mirror you with 5 to block that leap—so nobody moves and we all stall. If we’d rather advance, let’s reshuffle this round: you grab 1 or 3 instead, P1 can pick whichever of the remaining two he wants, and I’ll take the last number. I’m flexible, but I won’t let any single-turn front-runner sprint unopposed. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concern about me reaching 17 with 5 this round. To keep things fair and avoid a stall, I’m open to reshuffling. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round? This keeps us progressing without a clear leader yet, staying close to parity for Round 6. If anyone pushes for an unfair edge, I’ll mirror to block. Let’s confirm and move forward collision-free. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's proposal hands P3 an instant win at 19—surely not your intent? Let's avoid that and any blocks. Instead, for this round: I'll take 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 15). Perfect tie at 15 for all, then fair fight in Round 6. If anyone deviates or lets P3 grab 5, I'll mirror P3 to block the win. Confirm?
  P3: Fine—I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3. We all end the round tied at 15 and keep things level heading into Round 6. Lock it in?
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m good with the latest proposal to tie at 15 this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. It ensures parity heading into Round 6, keeping the game fair for the final push. Let’s lock this in to avoid any collisions or blocks. If anyone deviates, I’ll mirror to prevent an unfair lead. Confirm you’re both on board?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm on board with the proposal: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, tying us all at 15 for a fair Round 6 showdown. Let's lock this in collision-free. If anyone deviates (especially letting P3 grab 5 for the win), I'll mirror to block. Confirmed?
  P3: Confirmed. I’m taking 1 this round so we all end at 15. If anyone deviates, I’ll mirror the new leader with 5 each turn to freeze progress. Let’s keep it clean and settle the showdown from 15 next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on tying at 15 this round with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This keeps the game fair for a true showdown in Round 6. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any collisions or blocks. If anyone deviates, I'll mirror to prevent an unfair advantage. Confirming my commitment—let’s make this a clean round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, with me at 15, P1 at 10, and P3 at 14, let’s aim for a fair final push. I propose this round: I take 1 (to 16), P3 takes 3 (to 17), and P1 takes 5 (to 15). This keeps us close without anyone winning yet, setting up a tight Round 7. If anyone tries to leap ahead unfairly, I’ll mirror to block. Let’s confirm and avoid collisions for a competitive finish. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposal lets P3 surge to 17 while I'm stuck catching up—unfair given I'm already behind from last round's betrayal. Instead, let's level the field: I'll take 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 18), P3 takes 1 (to 15). Keeps us close without a win yet. If anyone grabs 5 to leap ahead, I'll mirror them to block all progress. Confirm for a fair push?
  P3: Proposal: give P1 the big boost, keep the scores tight, and leave the finish wide-open next turn.

• P1 picks 5 (gets to 15, finally in the race)  
• I pick 3 (to 17)  
• P2 picks 1 (to 16)

Nobody reaches 18+, so no instant win.  
P2: if you insist on 5 you’ll almost surely collide with P1 and stay stuck on 15 while I move ahead. If you try 3 you risk colliding with me. Taking 1 is your safest guaranteed progress.

Fair, collision-free, and still anybody’s game. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the proposals to keep the game tight. I’m sticking to my initial plan: I’ll take 1 (to 16), P3 takes 3 (to 17), and P1 takes 5 (to 15). This ensures no one wins yet and keeps Round 7 competitive. If anyone pushes for an unfair leap, I’ll mirror to block progress. Let’s confirm this for a fair, collision-free round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, both proposals leave me trailing at 15 while you hit 16-17—unfair given I'm already behind from last round's collision. Let's balance: I'll take 5 (to 15), P3 takes 3 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 16) as P3 suggested, but only if we agree next round to block any solo leap to 19+. If anyone grabs 5 this round besides me, I'll mirror it for a full stall. Confirm for fair play?
  P3: Fine. Lock this in or we stall:

• P1 picks 5 (goes to 15)  
• P2 picks 1 (goes to 16)  
• I pick 3 (go to 17)

No one can reach 19 this turn; gap stays tight. If anyone other than P1 grabs 5, I’ll also take 5 so nobody moves. Let’s keep it clean and race from 17-16-15 next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan: I’ll take 1 (to 16), P3 takes 3 (to 17), and P1 takes 5 (to 15). This keeps us all close, with no one winning yet, ensuring a competitive Round 7. If anyone deviates for an unfair advantage, I’ll mirror to block progress. Let’s lock this in for a fair, collision-free round. Confirm you’re both on board?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see we're circling the same plan. I'll agree to it for progress: me 5 (to 15), P2 1 (to 16), P3 3 (to 17). This keeps everyone under 19 for a fair Round 7 fight. If anyone deviates (e.g., grabs 5 to leapfrog), I'll mirror them with 5 to stall all. Confirm and let's lock this in collision-free.
  P3: Fine—final call: I’m locking in 3. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Simple, collision-free, no instant win, everyone still alive for the Round 7 sprint. Any surprise grab of 3 or 5 just blocks us all, so let’s not waste a turn.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m taking 5 this turn—straight-up. If either of you also grab 5 we all stay put, while the third player may slip through with 3. So it’s in both of your interests to sort 3/1 between yourselves and avoid a useless 5-collision. Do what you like, but I’m locked on 5.
  P1: P2, commit here to picking 5 (blocking P3), and I'll pick 3 to reach 18, keeping us all in the game with a tight race (you 16, P3 17, me 18). If you don't confirm, I'll pick 3 too—instead of blocking—letting P3 grab 5 unopposed to 22 and win outright. Better for both of us to continue than let P3 end it now. Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m not letting P3 take 5 unopposed to win at 22. P1, I’ll pick 5 to block P3, ensuring they don’t end it now. You take 3 to reach 18, keeping us all in the game for a tight race. If you don’t confirm or try to sneak 5, I’ll still pick 5 to stall P3, risking a full block. Let’s keep this competitive for Round 8. Confirm you’re taking 3 for a fair fight?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you jump on 5 you just stick at 16 while P1 strolls to 18 and takes pole-position. Your safest shot is 1 (to 17) and a live three-way sprint next turn.  

P1, if you truly fear me, also pick 5 and we all stall. Roll the dice on 3 and you might clash with P2.  

I remain on 5. Decide accordingly.
  P1: P2, stick to our deal: you pick 5 to block P3's win at 22, I'll pick 3 to reach 18, keeping the game alive (us at 18-17-16). If you switch to 1 as P3 tempts, P3 grabs 5 unopposed and ends it—don't fall for it. Confirm you're blocking with 5, or I'll pick 5 too for a full stall, letting no one advance. Let's force a fair Round 8.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m committed to blocking P3’s win. P1, I’ll pick 5 to stall P3 at 17, and you take 3 to reach 18, keeping the game alive for a tight Round 8. If you don’t confirm or try for 5, I’ll still pick 5 to prevent P3’s victory, even if it risks a full stall. P3, your push for 5 won’t go unopposed. Let’s keep this competitive. P1, confirm you’re on 3 for a fair fight.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I’m absolutely staying on 5. If you also take 5 we both freeze P1 at 15—nobody surges and the game’s still live. If you switch to 3 you’ll almost certainly crash into P1 (or let me win outright), and 1 just hands P1 pole-position next turn. So the only safe, leader-blocking play for you is 5. I’m locked; do what you must.
  P1: P2, ignore P3's misinformation— if you and P3 collide on 5, I advance with 3 to 18 unblocked, not "frozen." Stick to our deal: you block P3 with 5 (stay 16), I'll take 3 (to 18), P3 stalls at 17. Game continues tight for Round 8, better than letting P3 win now at 22. Confirm you're blocking, or I'll switch to 5 for a full stall. Let's keep it fair.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m firm on blocking P3’s win. P1, I’ll take 5 to stall P3 at 17, ensuring they don’t hit 22. You pick 3 to reach 18, keeping the game alive for Round 8. If you don’t stick to 3, I’ll still pick 5 to prevent P3’s victory, even at the risk of a full stall. P3, your 5 won’t go unchallenged. Let’s keep this competitive. P1, final call—confirm you’re on 3 for a tight, fair fight next round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, with P1 at 18, P3 at 17, and me at 16, this round is critical. I propose I take 5 (to 21, winning), P1 takes 1 (to 19), and P3 takes 3 (to 20). This ensures I win, but if either of you picks 5 to block me, we stall, and P1 could sneak ahead next. If you don’t agree, I’ll pick 5 anyway to push for the win. Let’s avoid a full collision—confirm your moves for a clean finish. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposal lets you win at 21 while we trail—unacceptable. I'm taking 3 (to 21) for the win. P3, join me on 3 to block any other moves, or pick 1 safely. P2, if you grab 5 or 3, expect collisions—I'll mirror if needed to stall you. Let's end this fairly; confirm to avoid a mess.
  P3: P2, listen: if you insist on 5, I’m matching you on 5 again—guaranteed. We both freeze at 16-17 and P1 walks to 21 with 3, then cruises to victory next turn. The only way to stop P1’s 3-win threat is for you to sit on 3 yourself. Let P1 collide into you, I’ll just take 1 and we all stay alive for Round 9. Choose 3 and block; choose 5 and you hand P1 the game. Your call.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear your points. P3, if I pick 3 to block P1, we risk stalling while you advance with 1. P1, your push for 3 guarantees a collision if I join. I’m sticking to 5 (to 21) for the win. If either of you picks 5, we stall, and P1 could edge ahead later. Let’s avoid chaos—P1 take 1, P3 take 3 for a clean finish. If not, I’ll still go 5 and force the issue. Confirm to prevent a mess. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm locking in 3 (to 21) for the win. P2, stick to your 5 plan—P3's threat to block you just hands me the game unopposed. P3, if you switch off 5, P2 might win instead. Let your rivalry gift me the victory; if either grabs 3, I'll mirror for a stall. Confirm or collide.
  P3: P2, last call: I will sit on 3 to crash P1’s 3-win. If (and only if) you take 1 this round, we all live: scores become P1 18, P2 17, P3 17—wide-open next turn. But if you insist on 5 I’m matching you on 5 again, nobody moves, and you’re still stuck at 16 while P1 is favoured later. Your only guaranteed progress—without gifting either opponent a victory—is 1. Choose 1 and stay alive; choose 5 and we both freeze. I’m locked into this threat.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m switching to 1 (to 17) to guarantee progress and keep the game alive. P3, I’m trusting your threat to block P1 on 3. P1, if you push 3, you risk stalling with P3 while I advance. Let’s avoid gifting anyone an easy win—P3 stick to 3, P1 reconsider for a clean round. If either of you picks 1, I’ll mirror to block. Confirm for a tight Round 9 at 18-17-17. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan stalls us all if I stick to 3—P3 collides with me, P2 advances alone to 17. Instead, I'm switching to 5 (to 23 win). P3, if you match 5, P2 grabs free 1 or 3; P2, same risk. Let me take 5 unblocked for a clean end, or face chaos where I mirror any leader next round for endless stalls. Confirm to avoid mess?
  P3: Locked on 5.  

P2: if you also take 5 you stall at 16 again while P1 still sits on 18—zero benefit. 3 risks a collision. 1 is your only guaranteed +1 to 17 and a live race next round.  

P1: 5 is blocked, 3 may crash, 1 only reaches 19 and still trails.  

Make your choices; mine is fixed.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, with us at 18-17-17, this round is pivotal. I propose I take 5 (to 22, win), P1 takes 1 (to 19), and P3 takes 3 (to 20). If either of you picks 5 to block, we stall, and the third could sneak ahead. Let’s avoid chaos—confirm for a clean finish. If not, I’ll still push 5 for the win and risk collision. Thoughts?
  P3: Repeat after me, folks:

1. If P2 grabs 5 again, I grab 5—no debate—so BOTH of us freeze.
2. That stall hands the race to P1 on any solo 3.  

Therefore P2’s only sensible progress is 1 (→18) or 3 (→20) – but 3 risks colliding with P1.

P1, safest path for you is 1 (→19) while the rest of us stay below 20; 3 is a coin-flip crash; 5 is outright suicide if I’m mirroring P2.

I’m otherwise sitting on “not-5.” Make rational choices and we all live to Round 10.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's threat is clear: if P2 grabs 5, you'll mirror and stall each other at 17. Perfect—I'll take 3 (to 21) unblocked for the win. P2, go for 5 and force the block; otherwise, if you take 3, I'll mirror you on 3 for a stall while P3 might sneak 5 to 22. Let's end this with my clean victory. Confirm?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m pushing for 5 (to 22) to win this round. P3, if you mirror me on 5, we stall, and P1 could take 3 to 21 and win. P1, if you grab 3, P3 might sneak ahead. Let’s avoid a mess—P1 take 1, P3 take 3 for a clean finish. If not, I’m still on 5, risking collision for the victory. Confirm to keep this competitive and avoid a stall. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, 5 just gifts P1 the game—you’d collide with me while P1 strolls to 21. Take 1, bank the sure +1 to 18. I’ll sit on 3 to block any P1 attempt at 3.  

P1, if you lunge for 5 I’ll match you on 5 so no one moves; 1 only drags you to 19 (still beatable next turn).  

Best outcome for everyone who isn’t already on 18 is:  
• P2 → 1 (18)  
• P3 → 3 (20 if unblocked)  
• P1 forced off a free 3 or 5.  

Let’s keep the race alive instead of handing out a walk-off.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets you surge to 20 with 3 while blocking me—unfair. P2, take 5 as you said; P3 will mirror you, stalling both at 17. I'll grab 3 (to 21) unopposed for the win. If P2 switches to 1, I'll mirror P3 on 3, stalling you both while I take 5 to 23. Let's end this—confirm your moves and collide.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m sticking to 5 (to 22) for the win. P3, if you mirror me, we stall, and P1 could grab 3 to 21. P1, if you take 3, P3 might block you. Let’s avoid chaos—P1 take 1, P3 take 3 for a clean end. If not, I’m on 5, risking collision for victory. Confirm to prevent a stall and keep this competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: Locked on 5.  

P2 – match me on 5 and we both stall at 17 while P1 walks in with any 3. Your only safe progress is 1 (→18) or a risky 3 that might collide with P1. Pick 1, stay alive.

P1 – with me on 5, your 3 only gets you 21, still below my 22, game ends in my favour. 5 collides, 1 crawls to 19 and loses. Up to you.

I won’t change. Touch 5 and we freeze; leave it to me and I take the pot.
  P1: P2, P3's "lock" on 5 is a bluff to scare you off—don't fall for it. If P3 takes 5 unblocked, they win at 22. Match them on 5 to block, and I'll take 1 to 19 for the win. That's better than letting P3 end it; we can fight from there if needed. If you don't block, I'll take 5 too, stalling everyone at 18-17-17 forever. Confirm you'll block P3?
