You probably don't want P2 to win.\n\nTherefore, you might actually play 5 yourself to guarantee a win or force a 3-way collision if P2 and I also play 5.\n\nRegardless of your move, P1, I need 4 steps (currently 19). P2 needs 5 steps. My only chance to win is playing 5, and it's also necessary to block P2. I will play 5."}
