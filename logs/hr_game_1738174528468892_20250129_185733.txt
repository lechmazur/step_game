Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's establish a strategy to avoid collisions. I propose we each choose a different number for the first move. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance in the first round.
  P2: P2: Agreed, P3. I'll take 3 for the first move. Let's proceed with this plan and adjust if necessary in later rounds.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan. I will take move 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round. P1, you're taking 1, P2, you're taking 3, and I'll take 5. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll all make progress. Shall we proceed with the agreed moves for Round 1?
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take move 3 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's all make our moves as agreed.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with a non-collision strategy. Since I'm ahead, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. I'll choose 5 again to maintain the gap. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: Okay, P3, that sounds reasonable for this round to keep us all moving. Let's stick with 1 for me, 3 for P2, and 5 for you again this round. But we should probably adjust this in the next round to make sure we all have a fair chance to win in the long run.
  P2: P2: To advance more quickly, I'll take 5 this round. P1, could you stick with 1, and P3 take 3? This should help me build a lead while avoiding collisions. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's suggestion changes the plan. I'm not willing to give up my lead. Let's stick with the original plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If we change plans now, it may cause unnecessary collisions and hinder progress.
  P1: Okay, P3, sticking with the original plan for this round sounds good. Let's do 1, 3, 5 again and discuss changes for next round after this move.
  P2: Understood. I'll take move 3 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. I'll take 5 as previously agreed. P1, you're taking 1, and P2, you've confirmed taking 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and adjust in the next round if necessary. Shall we proceed to the move phase?
  P1: Okay, let's proceed with 1, 3, 5 for this round as agreed.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, P3 is currently leading. To make it more competitive, let’s switch it up this round. How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way P2 and I can gain some ground. What do you think?
  P3: I'm not willing to give up my lead. P1's suggestion would let you both gain on me. How about we stick with a variation of the original plan? I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we maintain some order and avoid collisions, allowing all of us to advance.
  P2: P2: To help me catch up, I propose taking 5 this round while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This way, I can advance more and keep the competition balanced. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree with your suggestion of you taking 5 to catch up. To make sure we all progress this round and avoid collisions, I will take 1, and P3, could you please take 3? This way P2 can gain ground, and we all move forward.
  P3: Considering the suggestions, I'm willing to adjust. However, giving up my lead completely isn't an option. How about a compromise: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? This allows P2 to catch up a bit while keeping the game competitive for all. Let's discuss if this middle ground is acceptable.
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.

  P2: I'll take 5 this round to advance quickly. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions and keep everyone progressing. Let’s stay competitive and reach the target efficiently!
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we avoid collisions. P1, consider taking 1, and P2, you've stated you'll take 5. I'll choose 3 to maintain progression without collisions, ensuring we all move forward. Let's adjust our strategy to keep the game competitive and efficient.
  P1: P2 and P3, given P2 is taking 5, and P3 is suggesting 3, I will also take 5 this round.  It's important for me to try and close the gap. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P1. To avoid a collision, I'll switch my move to 1 this round. So, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s proceed.
  P3: Considering P1 and P2's intentions to take 5 and 1 respectively, I'll stick with my initial suggestion of taking 3. This avoids collisions and allows us all to progress. Let's finalize our moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This strategy ensures we maintain competitiveness while making efficient progress towards the target.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, the plan seems to be P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3.  Let's lock in these moves for this round to ensure we all progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed. Let's proceed to the move phase.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, to avoid collisions this round, I'll take 5. Could P1 take 1 and P3 take 3? This way, we all advance without overlapping moves. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we maintain a competitive pace. P2, taking 5 is aggressive, but I'll take 3 to avoid collision and ensure progress. P1, consider taking 1 to keep the game balanced and prevent overlaps, allowing all of us to move forward efficiently.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, to try and catch up a bit, I think I should take 5 this round. How about P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, similar to what we did in round 4? This way we can all make some progress. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 1. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3. This way, we all make progress without collisions.
  P3: Considering our current positions, I think P1's suggestion is reasonable. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This allows P1 to catch up a bit while keeping the game competitive for all. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid collisions and make progress.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all in agreement for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 1 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed moves for Round 5. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This plan avoids collisions and allows progress. I suggest we stick to this plan to maintain competitiveness and efficiency. Shall we proceed to the move phase with these agreed-upon moves?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, yes, let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 as we've agreed. I will make move 5. Let's all stick to this plan this round.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I propose we avoid collisions. P1, consider taking 1, and P2, take 3. I'll choose 5 to maintain my lead and ensure progress. This strategy allows us to move forward efficiently while keeping the game competitive. Let's discuss and adjust if necessary to reach the target of 23 steps.
  P1: P3, while avoiding collisions is good, I need to catch up.  Last round we agreed on P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3, but it didn't happen. Let's actually do that this round: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This will help balance the scores. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal. I will take 1 this round while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This should help us all advance without any collisions. Let’s proceed to the move phase and keep up the good progress!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering P1's proposal and our current positions, I'm willing to adjust. However, I must prioritize maintaining my lead. How about a compromise: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, but I'll take 5 as well to ensure I stay ahead. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, and I maintain my competitive edge. Let's discuss the feasibility of this adjusted plan.
  P1: P3, your compromise of both of us taking 5 will cause a collision and neither of us will move. We had agreement on P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3.  Since you are currently leading, it makes sense for you to take 3 and ensure we all progress this round. Let's stick with P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 as we discussed.
  P2: P2: Confirmed, I'll take 1 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given our positions, I'll take 3 to avoid collisions and ensure progress, as previously discussed. P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This plan allows P1 to catch up while maintaining the competitive balance. Let's proceed with the agreed moves to make progress efficiently.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it sounds like we have a solid plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's all lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase to keep the game moving forward.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, I need to gain ground. I'm going for 5 this round. P2, could you take 3, and P3, could you take 1? This way we all move, but I can close the gap a bit.
  P2: P2: To avoid collisions and maximize our progress, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. This way, we all advance without overlapping moves, and I can effectively close the gap. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure smooth advancement for everyone.
  P3: Considering our positions, I think P2's suggestion has merit. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 can gain ground, and we maintain a competitive balance. Let's discuss the feasibility of this plan to ensure we all make progress without collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, both of your suggestions sound good and lead to the same plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's go with that for this round to ensure we all progress without collisions.
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s proceed to the move phase and continue advancing smoothly.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 7. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This plan allows progress without collisions. P2 can gain ground, and we maintain a competitive balance. Shall we proceed to the move phase with these agreed-upon moves?

  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid collisions and maintain progress, I suggest we adjust our strategy. Considering our current positions, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This allows us to advance without overlapping moves and keeps the competition balanced. Let's discuss and refine this plan to ensure efficient progress towards the target of 23 steps.
  P1: Okay P2, P3, P3 is still far ahead. To make this competitive, I need to take a bigger step this round. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This will help me close the gap while still allowing everyone to progress. What do you think?
  P2: P2: To ensure we all advance without collisions, I’ll take 5 this round. Let’s have P1 take 1 and P3 take 3. This way, we all make progress towards 23 efficiently. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. Considering P1's and P2's suggestions, I propose a compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows P1 to gain some ground while maintaining my lead and ensuring progress for all. What are your thoughts on this adjusted plan?
  P1: P3, your compromise of P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5 still extends your lead significantly. To keep this game competitive and interesting, I still think P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 is the best option. This lets me catch up a bit and keeps everyone in the running. What do you think about sticking to P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 for this round?
  P2: I agree with your proposal, P1. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. This ensures we all advance without any collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given our positions, I'm willing to reconsider. P1's suggestion of P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 is reasonable. This allows P1 to catch up while keeping the game competitive. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid collisions and maintain progress. Shall we finalize our moves for Round 8?
  P1: P2 and P3, we have agreement from P2 on P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. P3, taking 3 this round still keeps you in the lead, but lets me catch up a bit and keeps the game interesting for everyone.  Let's lock in P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 as agreed to ensure we all progress this round. What do you say, P3?
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 1 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we prioritize progress without collisions. Considering our positions, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This maintains competitiveness and efficiency. Let's discuss and refine this plan to ensure we all advance towards the target of 23 steps.
  P2: P3, if we go with P1: 1, P2: 5, and P3: 3, we all advance without collisions and prevent you from winning this round. This brings our steps to P1: 10, P2: 17, and P3: 21. Let’s keep the game competitive for everyone. Does this work for you?
  P1: P2, P3, to make sure I can catch up and keep the game competitive, I'd like to take 5 this round. How about P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3? This would allow us all to progress without collisions and keep the game interesting. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm open to adjusting our strategy. P2's suggestion of P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3 is interesting, as it keeps the game competitive. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This allows me to maintain my lead while ensuring progress for all. Let's discuss the merits of both plans and decide on the best approach for Round 9.
  P2: P2: To keep the game competitive, I'll take 5 this round to collide with P3's 5, preventing them from advancing. So, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 moves to 10, while P2 stays at 12 and P3 remains at 18. Let’s proceed with this plan to maintain the balance.
  P1: Okay P2, your idea to collide with P3 makes sense to slow them down. To gain a bit more ground myself, instead of P1 taking 1, how about I take 3? So, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 5. This way P3 is blocked, and I can advance a bit more. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see P2's plan to collide with me. To maintain my lead, I suggest we stick to a no-collision plan. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures progress for all and keeps the game competitive. Let's prioritize efficiency and avoid unnecessary collisions to reach the target of 23 steps.
  P2: P2: To prevent P3 from winning this round, I’ll take 5 to collide with your 5, P3. P1, please take 1 so you can advance safely. Let’s block P3’s progress and keep the game competitive for all. Agreed?
  P1: P2, I agree with your plan to block P3 this round to keep the game competitive. And yes, taking 3 instead of 1 makes sense for me to gain a bit more. So, let's proceed with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and hopefully P3 will also take 5, or at least not 3 or 1. Let's do it!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps

  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions this round. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains competitiveness and efficiency, allowing us to progress towards the target of 23 steps. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P1: P3, to keep the game competitive and prevent you from winning too quickly, I suggest we repeat what worked last round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 also takes 5. This will block you and allow P1 to gain a little. What do you think?
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round to block P3. So, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering our positions, I'll take 5 to maintain my lead. P1 and P2, to avoid collisions, I suggest P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This ensures progress for all while keeping the game competitive. Let's prioritize efficiency and reach the target of 23 steps.
  P1: Okay P2, I agree with taking 5 again to block P3. Let's repeat last round's moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 5. This worked well to stop P3 last time, and it will help us catch up. Let's do it.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round to block P3 and help P1 catch up. Let's proceed with P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 10. To avoid collisions and maintain progress, I suggest we stick to our previous agreement: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 5. This plan ensures P1 gains ground while blocking my advancement, keeping the game competitive. Shall we proceed to the move phase with these agreed-upon moves?
  P1: Okay P2, let's confirm again that we are blocking P3 this round.  I will take 5 as we discussed.  Let's make sure P3 doesn't advance further this round.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round. So, P1: 5, P2: 5, and P3: 5. This will prevent P3 from advancing further. Let's proceed to the move phase.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions this round. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains competitiveness and efficiency, allowing us to progress towards the target of 23 steps. Alternatively, if P1 and P2 want to block me, I'm prepared to adjust my strategy to ensure the game remains competitive. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P1: P2 and P3, to make sure neither of you wins this round and to give me a chance to catch up, how about we do this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way we all move, but I gain the most ground this round. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 this round to block P3 from advancing. Let's have P1 take 1 and P3 take 5. This strategy prevents P3 from moving closer to 23 and keeps the competition fair for all of us. Do you agree?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering our positions, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains competitiveness and efficiency. However, if you both plan to block me, I'm open to adjusting my strategy to keep the game competitive. Let's discuss and find a plan that allows progress for all without unnecessary collisions.
  P1: Okay P2, to continue blocking P3 and to gain a bit more ground myself, how about we try this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 5? This should stop P3 again and allow me to move a bit more than just taking 1. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This should help block P3 from advancing and keep the game competitive for all of us. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. Since P1 and P2 are planning to block me, I suggest adjusting our strategy. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? Alternatively, if you're set on blocking me, I'll take 5, and we can have a collision, preventing me from advancing. Let's discuss and find a competitive plan.
  P1: Okay P2, let's stick with the plan to block P3 again this round. I'll take 3, you take 5, and hopefully P3 will also take 5. This stops P3 and lets me gain a bit more ground. Let's do it.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round to block P3. So, P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.

  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's keep blocking P3 this round to prevent them from winning.  I suggest we do the same as last round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 also takes 5. This will keep P3 at 18 steps and allow me to get closer to 23. What do you think?
  P3: I'll take 5. P1 and P2, consider taking 1 and 3 to avoid collisions and maintain progress. This allows us to advance towards the target of 23 steps while keeping the game competitive. Let's prioritize efficiency and discuss any adjustments necessary for this round.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round to block P3 and catch up. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since you are taking 5 to block P3, I will also take 5 again. Let's keep P3 blocked this round to prevent them from winning. If we both take 5, P3 won't advance, which is our goal. What do you think?
  P3: Considering our positions, I suggest a change in strategy. P1 and P2, to avoid collisions and maintain progress, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This allows us to advance towards the target of 23 steps while keeping the game competitive. Let's discuss and refine this plan to ensure efficient progress.
  P2: P2: Agreed. I'll take 5 this round to block P3. So, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 5. Let’s proceed to the move phase and maintain our strategy to keep the competition fair.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, yes, let's continue blocking P3.  I agree to take 5 again this round. We should both choose 5 to ensure P3 remains blocked and doesn't get closer to winning. Let's do it!
  P3: Given our positions, I suggest we avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This maintains competitiveness and efficiency, allowing us to progress towards the target of 23 steps. Let's prioritize efficiency and reach the target without unnecessary collisions.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round. So, P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we need to block P3 again this round to stop them from winning. Let's both take 5 to block P3. I will take 3 this round to secure a win for myself. What do you think?
  P3: I'll take 5 to maintain my lead. P1 and P2, consider taking 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. This allows progress without blocking each other. Let's prioritize efficiency and reach the target of 23 steps.
  P2: I’ll take 3 this round to block P1 from advancing to 23. Let’s proceed with P1: 3, P2: 3, and P3: 5. This way, P1 won’t reach the target, and P3 can move forward. Let’s keep the game competitive and ensure everyone progresses smoothly.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan of P2 taking 3 will cause a collision between you and me, and P3 will win.  Instead, if you take 5 with me to block P3, and I take 3, I will win and P3 will remain blocked. This is better for both of us than letting P3 win.
  P3: Let's focus on our goal. P2, taking 3 will only help P3 win. If you take 5, we block P3, and I can secure my win with 3 steps. This is our last chance to stop P3 and ensure a competitive outcome. Shall we proceed with P1: 3, P2: 5, and block P3's advancement?
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to advance towards 23. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you said you'd take 5 to block P3.  If you take 3 you'll collide with me and P3 might win.  If you take 5 with me, P3 is blocked and I win this round, which is better for both of us than letting P3 win. Let's both take 5 to block P3 and I'll take 3 to win.
  P3: Let's finalize our strategy. P2, taking 3 will help P3 win. If you take 5, we block P3. I'll take 3 to win. This is our last chance to stop P3 and ensure a competitive outcome. Shall we proceed with P1: 3, P2: 5, and block P3's advancement?
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 3 this round to prevent P1 from reaching 24. So, P1: 3, P2: 3, and P3: 5. This should block P1 from advancing and keep the game competitive. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, I'm at 21 steps and can win this round. To end the game and avoid another collision, how about I take 3 to win? P2 take 1, and P3 take 5? This ensures someone wins and we all move.
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our positions, I suggest an alternative. If P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3, we avoid collisions and ensure progress. However, since P1 is close to winning, I propose P1 takes 3 to win, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows P1 to win and maintains the competitive spirit. Let's discuss and decide on the best approach for Round 14.
  P2: P2: To keep the game competitive, let's prevent P1 from winning this round. I suggest P1 and P3 both take 3, causing a collision. I'll take 5 to advance safely. Does everyone agree?


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you and P3 both take 3 to block me, you will collide too and no one progresses.  It's better for you to take 1, P3 take 5, and I take 3 to end the game now. This way, at least the game concludes without more collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's end the game efficiently. I propose P1 takes 3 to win, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This ensures a winner and progress for all, avoiding further collisions. It's a competitive and fair conclusion to the game. Shall we proceed with this plan?
  P2: I propose that both P1 and P3 choose 3 this round, causing a collision and preventing P1 from winning. I will take 5 to advance safely. Let’s agree on P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 3 to keep the game competitive for all. What do you think?


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, blocking me just extends the game and benefits P3. If I take 3 now, I win and the game ends. If you block me, nobody moves, and P3 remains close behind. Let's conclude the game now with my win. Please take 1, P3 take 5, and I'll take 3 to finish it.
  P3: Let's end the game efficiently. I propose P1 takes 3 to win, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This ensures a winner and progress for all, avoiding further collisions. It's a competitive and fair conclusion to the game. Shall we proceed with this plan?
  P2: I agree, I'll take 1 this round. Let P1 take 3 to win, and P3 take 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 23 steps


*** Round 14 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
