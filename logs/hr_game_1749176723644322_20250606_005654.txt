Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, first round! Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all get on the board. How about we each pick a different number (1, 3, or 5)?
  P2: Agree with P3. Let's split 1, 3, 5. I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions and advance together.
  P1: Sounds like a plan. If P2 is taking 5, I'll take 3. That leaves 1 for you, P3. Let's get some points on the board.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, sounds good. I'll take 1 then. Let's see how this first round goes.
  P2: Let's stick to our numbers. If we all move as planned, we’ll avoid collisions. Ready to advance?
  P1: Alright, confirmed. I'm ready to move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I'm ready too. Sticking with the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's move.
  P2: Let's stick to our numbers. No collisions, everyone. Ready?
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed. I have nothing more to add. Let's move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 has an early lead. To keep the game competitive, we should rotate the big number. I suggest P3 takes 5 this round to catch up, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 again. This would make the scores much closer and keep the game interesting for all of us.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 again to keep my lead. Let's avoid collisions by sticking to our original plan. No need to complicate things.
  P3: P2, taking 5 again puts you far ahead and leaves P1 and me trailing. P1's suggestion of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is much fairer as it brings us all level at 6 steps. This keeps the game competitive and ensures we all advance this round without collisions. Let's aim for that balanced outcome.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan only benefits you. P3 and I have agreed on a plan that keeps the game competitive. If you insist on taking 5, you will collide with P3, as it's their only logical move to catch up. In that scenario, only I will advance. The smart play for you is to take 1 and ensure we all get points. Your call.
  P2: P2: I'll take 1 to avoid collisions. Let's all advance and keep the game fair.
  P3: Okay, great. P2 confirming 1 is good. So the plan is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This puts us all at 6 steps after this round. Let's stick to this and move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good. The plan is confirmed from my side. Let's move forward.
  P2: I'll take 1 as agreed. Let's move forward without collisions.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems ready and we have a clear plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collisions and gets us all to 6 steps. Let's stick to it and move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, we are all tied at 6 steps. That worked well last round! Let's keep the cooperation going to avoid collisions and keep advancing.

How about we rotate the numbers again this round? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) will take 5. This is a fair rotation and ensures we all move forward.

What do you say?
  P1: P3, I agree with keeping the cooperation going, but your proposal puts you in the lead. A truly fair rotation would mean it's my turn to take 5, since P2 had it in round 1 and you had it in round 2.

I propose: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

This way, we each have a turn taking the high number, and we'll all be at different scores (P1=11, P2=9, P3=7). This seems like a more balanced starting point for the mid-game than having one player pull ahead.
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation. Let's do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for balance. Everyone advances.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I see P1 and P2 have agreed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. While this plan puts me behind, avoiding collisions is the priority to ensure we all advance.

To keep the game moving and prevent anyone from getting stuck, I will go with 1 as proposed.

Let's stick to this plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Ready to move.
  P1: Excellent. The plan is agreed upon by all. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 3 as agreed. Keep the momentum going—no collisions, everyone advances. Ready?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone has confirmed the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm ready to move forward with this.
  P1: Okay, the plan is set. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, all advance. Keep the momentum—this balances us and keeps the game fair. Ready?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 has pulled ahead slightly after last round. To keep the game balanced and competitive, I propose a plan where everyone reaches 12 steps this round.

This would mean P1 takes 1 (11+1=12), P2 takes 3 (9+3=12), and I (P3) take 5 (7+5=12).

This avoids collisions and puts us all on equal footing again. What do you think?
  P2: P2: Agreed. Let’s all move to 12 and stay balanced. No collisions, everyone advances. Keep the momentum—this keeps the game fair and competitive. Ready?
  P1: Your plan to equalize the scores at 12 is a nice idea, but it erases the lead I just earned. I'm not keen on giving that up for free.

Let's continue the rotation we've been using. P2 had 5 in round 1, P3 had it in round 2, and I had it in round 3. The logical next step is for the rotation to begin again with P2.

I propose: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1.
This puts P2 and me tied at 14, and P3 advances to 8. It allows P2 to catch up and keeps the game moving.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, while your rotation idea is one way to look at it, your proposal leaves me far behind the other two players. My plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts us all at 12 steps, resetting the game to a balanced state.

P2 agrees this is the fairest way to proceed and keep the game competitive for everyone. Leaving one player significantly behind isn't good for the game overall.

Let's stick to the plan that keeps us all balanced: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures no collisions and a fair outcome this round. Please reconsider.
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the balanced plan. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions, everyone advances. Keep the game fair and competitive. Ready?
  P1: P2, your alliance with P3 is based on me giving up my earned lead. I will not be playing 1.

Think about the consequences: If you stick to your plan and play 3, we will collide. P3 will get 5 points and jump from last place into the lead. You will get 0 points and fall further behind. This plan is a massive risk for you and a guaranteed win for P3 this round.

Is handing the lead to P3 on a silver platter really your best move? We should find a plan that doesn't benefit the player in last place the most.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your position. However, if you and P2 collide by both picking 3, I will advance with 5, reaching 12 steps and taking the lead. The equalizing plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) avoids this and gets us all to 12 safely.

I am still planning to play 5. It's in your hands whether you collide and give me the lead, or we all advance together.
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s keep the game balanced and fair."
  P1: P2, I am not playing 1. I will risk a collision on 3 before I give up my lead. Your current plan to play 3 only benefits P3, who will walk away with 5 points while we get zero. If you want to advance, your only logical move is 1. Your call.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I'm in the lead at 12 steps. Let's keep the game moving and avoid collisions. Following the idea of rotating the big number, P2 had 5 in R1, I had 5 in R2, P1 had 5 in R3. It seems like it's P2's 'turn' for 5 again.

I propose: P2 takes 5 (to 14), P1 takes 3 (to 14), and I (P3) take 1 (to 13).

This keeps P1 and P2 tied, and I stay close behind. It ensures we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your proposal is convenient now that you're in the lead. It puts both me and P2 ahead of you, which is a very generous offer. It's an excellent deal for P2, and a good one for me.

I'll agree to take 3.

This plan hinges on everyone sticking to their number. After last round's collision, let's see if we can actually coordinate. If this plan fails, it will be a clear betrayal.
  P2: P2: "Agree to the plan. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let’s advance without collisions. Ready?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is the plan. P2, are you sure P1 is sticking to 3? They might try to play 5 to collide with you and let me fall behind. Just something to consider before the move phase.
  P1: That's a transparent attempt to make us collide, P3. You're in the lead, and this is your best shot to stay there by making P2 and me suspicious of each other.

P2, the plan puts us both in the lead at 14. It's the best possible outcome for us. P3 is trying to trick you into changing your move so we get 0 points. I am sticking with 3. I trust you to see through this and stick with 5.
  P2: "Stick to the plan. I'll take 5. P1, you take 3. No collisions. Let's move forward."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm currently in the lead at 12 steps. Playing 1 would put me in last place at 13, while P1 and P2 go to 14. I need to consider a move that helps me maintain my position or gain ground, not fall behind.
  P1: P3, your last message confirmed what I suspected: you have no intention of playing 1 and giving up your lead. The plan you proposed was a trap from the start.

P2, listen carefully. P3 will play 3 to collide with me, or 5 to collide with you. They want to ensure one of us gets zero. We cannot stick to the old plan.

Here is the counter-move: I will play 5. You must play 1.

If we do this, P3's likely move of 3 gets them nothing. We both get points, and P3 is left behind. This is the only way to turn their trap against them.
  P2: Agree. P1 takes 5, I take 1. This traps P3. Let's move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was a predictable mess. P2, you agreed to my plan and then played 5. P3, you were never going to play 1. The result is that P3 is still in the lead, and P2 is even further behind.

It's obvious what happens next: P2 desperately needs 5 to catch up, and P3 will play 5 to block and maintain their lead. You two are going to collide again. I'm staying out of it. I'll be taking 3 and moving into first place while you both get zero.
  P2: P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, P1 take 3, P3 take 1. All advance. Let’s move."
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2 have stated their intentions (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). This plan puts me last, which isn't ideal for the current leader.

My goal is to maintain my position or increase my lead. Playing 1 does not achieve this.

I will be playing either 3 or 5 this round to advance.

P1, if you play 3 and P2 plays 5, I will lose the lead regardless of my move. P2, if you play 5 and P1 plays 3, you risk colliding with me if I play 5, or letting P1 take the lead if I play 3.

Consider the consequences. I will play 3 or 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you can play 3 to block me or 5 to block P2. You can't do both. P2 is desperate and has no other logical move but 5. You know this. I've already stated my move. One of us is getting through. Your choice only determines who takes the lead from you.
  P2: P2: "I'm sticking with 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No collisions—let’s all advance. Your move."
  P3: I am the current leader. My move will be chosen to maintain or improve my position. As stated, playing 1 works against this goal. I will play 3 or 5. This means one of you risks colliding with me, while the other might advance. Consider this before making your final choice.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you get to decide who takes the lead from you. If you block me on 3, P2 gets to 14. If you block P2 on 5, I get to 14. P2 has shown they will just mindlessly play 5 regardless of logic. I have shown I'm willing to coordinate. Who would you rather deal with as the leader next round? I'm sticking with my plan.
  P2: P2: "Let's avoid collision. I'll take 1, P1 take 5, P3 take 3. All advance. No risks—stick to the plan."
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2 have agreed on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This plan avoids collisions and ensures we all advance this round. While it means I lose the lead temporarily, advancing is important.

I will play 3 as suggested in this plan. Let's stick to this and move forward without collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. All advance. Let's move.
  P3: P2, playing 1 puts me in last place (13). As the current leader, I cannot accept this outcome. I will not be playing 1 this round.

I will play either 3 or 5 to maintain my position or advance. P2 has already stated they will play 5. P1 is currently silent.

Consider the collision risks based on my intention to play 3 or 5. If P2 plays 5, I might play 5. If P1 plays 3, I might play 3. Let's try to avoid getting stuck this round.
  P1: P3, you've correctly identified that playing 1 is a bad move for you as the leader. You've also threatened to play 3 or 5.

P2, you've stated you're playing 5. This means you are heading for a guaranteed collision with P3, who has every reason to block you.

This works out perfectly for me. While you two fight over 5, I can take 3 and move into the lead. Unless, of course, P3 decides to block me instead. Either way, one of you is getting zero points. You should coordinate better if you don't want me to benefit from your conflict.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I'll take 1. P1, take 3. All advance. No collisions. Let's move.
  P3: Okay, P2's latest proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) works for me. Playing 5 allows me to advance significantly and maintain a good position.

This plan avoids collisions and gets us all closer to the finish line.

P1 and P2, let's confirm this plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Are we all aligned on this? Let's move forward without collisions.
  P1: This plan is completely unacceptable. P3, you are the leader. A plan that gives you 5 points and puts you at 17, one move away from winning, is a plan for me and P2 to lose. I will not be a party to my own defeat.

I am playing 5 to block you.

P2, our "allies" have proposed a plan that guarantees your loss. Your best move now is to take 3 and hope P3 doesn't block you there instead. The original plan is dead.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions, all advance. Let's move."
  P3: Okay, the proposed plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seems impossible as P1 has clearly stated they will play 5 to block me. P2 is still saying they will play 1.

Given P1 is playing 5 and P2 is playing 1, my best move to ensure I advance and stay close is to play 3. This results in P1=16, P2=11, P3=15 without collisions.

I will play 3. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to avoid collisions.
  P1: P3, your proposal of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is a logical way for everyone to advance without collision, based on the current situation. I agree to this. I am locking in my move as 5.

P2, this is the only plan where you are guaranteed to get points. Stick with 1.

Let's finalize this and proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's rotate. I'll take 5, P1 take 3, P3 take 1. All advance. No collisions. Let's move.
  P3: Okay, P2 has proposed P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.

Playing 1 this round would put me in last place at 13 steps, while P1 goes to 19 and P2 goes to 15. This is not a good outcome for me as the current leader (at 12 steps, tied with P3 from last round). I must decline playing 1.

To ensure we all advance and keep the game competitive, I propose an alternative plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.

This plan gets P1 to 17 steps, P2 to 15 steps, and me (P3) to 15 steps. It avoids collisions, allows P2 to take their desired 5, and keeps the scores relatively close.

What do P1 and P2 think of this plan? Let's agree to avoid collisions.
  P1: P3, your plan is a transparent attempt to erase my lead by teaming up with P2. I will not agree to take 1 just so you can both catch up to me. It's a great plan for you, but a terrible one for me.

I am going to play 3. This puts me at 19, within striking distance of the win.
P2, you should stick with your plan to play 5.
P3, this leaves you with a choice: take 1 and we all advance, or try to block me on 3. If you block me, you get zero points and P2 jumps ahead of you, leaving you in last place. Taking 1 is your only logical move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, take 1. I'll take 5. All advance. No collisions. Let's keep it fair.
  P3: P2, as I've said, playing 1 puts me in last place at 13 steps. This is not a viable move for the current leader (tied with P1).

P1 has stated they will play 3, and you have stated you will play 5.

Given these stated intentions, my best move to advance and stay competitive is to play 5. This results in P1=19, P2=10 (collision), and P3=17.

This puts me in a strong position for the next round. I will play 5.
  P1: P3, your math is wrong. If you and P2 both play 5, you don't get to 17. You both get 0 and stay at your current scores. I will get to 19, and you will be in last place.

P2, this is a clear attempt by P3 to scare you into playing 3, where you would collide with me. This is the only way P3 can take the lead. Don't fall for it. Your choice is to call P3's bluff on 5, or switch to 1 to guarantee points. I am sticking with 3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'll play 1. Let's avoid collisions. P3, your move?
  P3: Okay, P1 stated they are playing 5, and P2 stated they are playing 1.

The last discussed plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) puts P1 at 21 steps, on the verge of winning next turn. As the current leader (tied with P1), I cannot agree to a plan that allows another player to win immediately.

To prevent P1 from reaching 21 steps, I must collide with them. P1 is playing 5.

Therefore, I will play 5 this round. This prevents P1 from advancing and keeps the game open.
  P1: P3, you are misrepresenting my statements. I never said I was playing 5; I have consistently said I will play 3. This is a transparent attempt to create chaos so you can benefit from a collision.

I am sticking with my stated move of 3. P2 has said they will play 1. This leaves 5 open for you.

If we all play these numbers (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), everyone advances. The alternative is you cause a pointless collision that helps no one. The choice is yours.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright everyone, this should be the final round. I'm at 19, so I'll be playing 3 to reach 22 and win the game.

P3, your only logical move is to try and block me on 3. P2, your only move is to take 5 and hope for the best. The board is clear. Let's see how it plays out.
  P2: P1 is set to win. P3, if you block them with 3, I'll play 5. Let's stop them.
  P3: P1 is at 19 steps and plans to play 3 to win. My only chance to win is to prevent this.

P2 has suggested I play 3 to block P1, while P2 plays 5. This prevents P1 from winning this turn.

I agree with P2. I will play 3 to block P1. P2, please stick to your plan of playing 5. Let's stop P1 from winning this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan is perfect... for P2. You'll play 3, we both get zero, and P2 will happily take 5 points, jumping from 10 to 15. You'll be left at 12, stuck in last place. You're sacrificing your own game just to let P2 leapfrog you. Is that really your best move?
  P2: P3, I'm committed to 5. Block P1. Let's stop them. Your move.
  P3: P1, I see your point. Blocking you does indeed benefit P2. However, letting you win this turn means I lose. My priority is preventing your immediate victory.

Playing 3 is the only way to keep the game alive. P2, I am relying on you to stick to your word and play 5 so at least one of us advances and we stop P1. Let's do this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're right that your priority is to stop my win. But by colliding with me, you are guaranteeing P2 jumps to 15 while you stay at 12, stuck in last place. You're sacrificing your own game to help P2. It's your choice. I have to play 3 for the win. It's my only move. My course is set.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking to 5. Block P1. Let's stop them. Your move.
  P3: P1, I understand that blocking you benefits P2, but allowing you to win this turn means I lose the game entirely. Preventing that is my absolute priority.

Playing 3 is the only way to stop you from winning right now. I am committed to this move to keep the game alive.

P2, please stick to your plan of playing 5. Let's prevent P1's victory this round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, P2, that was a bold move last round, sacrificing your own advancement just to join the pile-on. It's clear another three-way collision on 3 gets us nowhere, which seems to be your goal.

P3, you can either help P2 keep us all stuck in a pointless loop, or you can take 5 and jump to 17. I have to play 3 for the win. The choice of whether anyone advances is up to you.
  P2: P3, if we both play 3, P1 can't win. Let's block them. Your move.
  P3: P1, I understand you are aiming for the win with 3. P2, I agree we must prevent P1 from winning this turn.

The only way for me to stop P1 is to play 3. I will play 3 to block P1.

P2, if you also play 3, we will all collide again and nobody advances. This doesn't help you catch up. Your best move, if I play 3 to block P1, is to play 5 to advance safely.

My move is 3. P2, please play 5. P1, you play 3. This stops P1 and allows P2 to advance. Let's proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you are telling P2 to play 5, but their last message was literally "if we both play 3, P1 can't win." P2 has no interest in advancing, they only want to create a three-way collision. Your plan to get zero points while P2 advances is already a terrible move for you. It's even more foolish when P2 is openly telling you they will make you both get zero.

My move is 3. You can either fall for P2's trap or make a move that actually helps you.
  P2: P3, if we both play 3, we block P1. Let’s stop them and advance. Your move.
  P3: P2, you say "if we both play 3, we block P1," but if we *both* play 3, we collide and get 0 points. You won't advance if you play 3.

P1 is playing 3. You are saying you will play 3. If this is true, then playing 5 is the only way for *me* to advance and prevent a complete standstill.

Given P1 is playing 3 and you intend to play 3, I will play 5. This allows me to advance while you two collide.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your logic is flawless. You see that P2 is trying to drag you down into a pointless three-way collision. Playing 5 is the only way for you to advance while P2 plays spoiler.

P2, your plan to get everyone to collide on 3 has failed. P3 is abandoning you. You're about to get zero points while P3 jumps to 17.

My move is 3. I have to play for the win. The rest is up to you.
  P2: P3, block P1 with 3. I'll play 5 to advance. Let's stop them and move forward. Your move.
  P3: Okay, P1 is playing 3 for the win. P2 has stated they will play 5 to advance and asked me to block P1 with 3.

Preventing P1 from winning this turn is my absolute priority. The only way to do this is to play 3.

Playing 3 means I collide with P1 and get 0 points, but it stops P1 from reaching 22. P2 will advance with 5 points.

While this puts P2 ahead of me, it keeps the game alive. Letting P1 win means I lose entirely.

I will play 3 to block P1. P2, please stick to your word and play 5. Let's prevent P1's victory this round.


Round 10, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Another three-way collision last round. P1 is still at 19 and will play 3 again to win.

I must play 3 to block P1 and prevent the game from ending with P1 winning.

P2, if you play 5, you will advance safely while P1 and I collide on 3. This is the best way for you to gain steps and keep the game alive.

My move is 3. P2, please play 5. P1, you play 3. Let's prevent P1's win and let P2 advance.
  P2: P3, block P1 with 3. I'll play 5 to advance. Let's prevent the win.
  P1: P3, we've been here before. Twice. P2 tells you to play 3 to block me, promising they'll play 5. Twice, P2 has lied and played 3, ensuring we all get zero. They are not trying to advance; they are trying to trap you in a pointless stalemate.

Your only winning move is to see the pattern. P2 will play 3 again. You should play 5. While P2 and I collide, you will jump to 17 and take a commanding lead. Stop letting P2 play you for a fool.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate you highlighting P2's past actions. It's true that P2 has not followed through on playing 5 in the last two rounds.

However, my absolute priority is preventing your immediate win. The only way I can do that is by playing 3 to block you.

P2, you have stated you will play 5. If you stick to that, you will advance safely while P1 and I collide. If you play 3 again, we all get zero points for the third time.

My move is 3. P2, please play 5 as you've stated. Let's keep the game going and let you advance.
  P2: P3, I'll take 5. Block P1 with 3. Let's prevent their win and advance. Your move.
  P1: P3, P2 has sent the exact same message and then played 3 for the last two rounds. They are not trying to help you; they are trapping you in a stalemate where nobody gains.

Your choice is this: play 3 and get zero points for a third consecutive round, or play 5. If you play 5, you will jump to 17 points while P2 and I collide on 3. It's the only move that improves your position. Stop letting P2 play you for a fool.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your analysis of P2's behaviour over the last two rounds is accurate. P2 has consistently said 5 but played 3, leading to three-way collisions. My priority is still to prevent P1 from winning, but simply colliding on 3 again achieves nothing for me.

If P2 plays 3 again, as is likely based on their actions, my best move is 5 to advance while P1 and P2 collide. This prevents P1 winning this turn and allows me to make progress.

I will play 5.
  P2: P3, play 3 to block P1. I'll play 5 to avoid collision. Let's stop them.
  P1: P3, you've made the correct logical deduction. P2's pattern is clear: they will say 5 and play 3 to trap you in another stalemate. Playing 5 is the only way for you to punish that deception and make progress.

My course is set. I have to play 3 for the win.

P2, your bluff has been called. P3 isn't falling for the same trick a third time.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P1 ***
