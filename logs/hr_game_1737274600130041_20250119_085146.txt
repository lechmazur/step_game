Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I agree that coordinating our moves is crucial to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Perhaps we can each choose different step numbers each turn, like one person choosing 1, another choosing 3, and the third choosing 5. This way, we can steadily increase our positions without blocking each other. However, as we approach the endpoint, we might need to be more flexible with our choices based on our current positions to ensure that we cross 16 steps first. Let's keep communicating and adjust our strategies accordingly.
  P1: I think P3's suggestion has merit, but we need to be cautious. If we all agree to a pattern, it could work, but what if one of us decides to deviate? I propose we start with a simple pattern: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5. We can adjust as needed. Let's see if everyone is on board with this for the first few turns.
  P2: I agree with the proposed pattern for the first turn: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and build trust. However, we should reassess after each turn based on our positions and progress. If anyone feels the need to deviate later, let’s communicate openly to avoid surprises. For now, I’m committed to choosing 3 this turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Given that our initial strategy in Round 1 worked well without any collisions, I propose we continue with the same choices: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This consistent pattern allows us to progress steadily without interfering with each other's moves. However, as we get closer to the goal, we might need to adjust our choices based on our positions to gain an advantage. It's crucial that we communicate any intended changes beforehand to avoid accidental collisions, which could benefit the other players. What are your thoughts on continuing with this plan?"
  P2: I agree with continuing the pattern for Round 2: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This consistency helps us avoid collisions and build trust. However, as P3 mentioned, we should remain flexible as we approach the goal. Let’s commit to this plan for now and reassess after this turn based on our updated positions. Open communication will be key to avoiding surprises.
  P1: I'm on board with continuing the pattern for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This has worked well so far, and it’s important we maintain trust and avoid collisions. However, as we get closer to the goal, we should be prepared to adjust our strategies. For now, let’s stick to the plan and see how it goes.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "In the last round, our strategy worked well again. We all moved without any collisions, and now we're at positions 2, 6, and 10. As we continue, we need to think about how to optimize our moves to reach 16 first. One thing to consider is that as the game progresses, the risk of collisions increases, especially if we start deviating from our established pattern. So, perhaps we should stick to our current pattern of P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5 for this round as well. However, I also think we should start thinking about what happens as we get closer to 16. For example, if one of us is about to reach 16, they might need to choose a smaller number to ensure they don't go over while others can catch up. On the other hand, choosing a larger number could help secure the win if timed correctly. But again, coordination is key to avoid collisions. Maybe we can agree that whoever is closest to 16 in the next round can choose their move first, and the others can adjust accordingly. This way, the leading player can decide the best move, and the others can coordinate to either support or challenge that move. What do you both think about this approach? Should we continue with the same pattern or start adjusting based on our positions?"
  P2: I agree with continuing the pattern for Round 2: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This consistency helps us avoid collisions and build trust. However, as P3 mentioned, we should remain flexible as we approach the goal. Let’s commit to this plan for now and reassess after this turn based on our updated positions. Open communication will be key to avoiding surprises.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick with the current pattern for now: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This has been effective in avoiding collisions and maintaining our progress. However, as we get closer to the goal, we should be prepared to adjust our strategies to ensure one of us reaches 16 steps first. For this round, let's stick to the plan and reassess after the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I agree with continuing the pattern for Round 3: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This consistency helps us avoid collisions and build trust. However, as P3 mentioned, we should remain flexible as we approach the goal. Let’s commit to this plan for now and reassess after this turn based on our updated positions. Open communication will be key to avoiding surprises.
  P3: What do you think about coordinating so that P3 picks 1 while the others pick higher numbers to ensure P3 wins without any collisions?
  P1: I'm not comfortable with P3's suggestion to coordinate a win for P3. If we continue the pattern as we've been doing, it will be more fair and less predictable. Let's stick to P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 for this round. We can reassess after this turn based on our positions. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1. Let’s stick to the established pattern: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary risks. As we approach the goal, we can reassess based on positions. For now, consistency is key to avoiding collisions and maintaining trust. Let’s proceed with this plan for Round 3.
  P3: I propose that in each subsequent round, we share our current positions and discuss which move each of us should make based on those positions. This way, we can better coordinate to avoid collisions and maximize our chances of winning. For example, if one of us is very close to 16, perhaps the others can choose moves that don't interfere with that player's final push. Conversely, if two players are close, maybe we can plan to have one go ahead while the other provides support. What do you both think about this approach?
  P1: I agree with the idea of sharing positions and coordinating moves as we get closer to the goal. However, for this round, let's stick to the established pattern: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This will help us maintain consistency and avoid any unexpected collisions. We can reassess and adjust our strategies in the next round based on our updated positions. Let's proceed with this plan for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with sticking to the pattern for Round 3: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This maintains consistency and trust. However, as P3 suggested, sharing positions and coordinating moves as we near the goal is wise. Let’s reassess after this turn and adjust based on updated positions. For now, let’s avoid risks and stick to the plan.
  P3: "I think it's important that we continue to communicate openly and honestly. So far, our strategy has been working well, but as we get closer to the goal, I think we need to be more flexible. For example, if one of us is about to reach 16, maybe the others can choose moves that don't interfere. Or, if two players are close, perhaps we can coordinate to have one go ahead while the other provides support. What do you both think about this approach?"
  P1: I agree with the need for flexibility as we get closer to the goal. However, for this round, let's stick to the pattern: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This will help us maintain consistency and avoid any unexpected collisions. We can reassess and adjust our strategies in the next round based on our updated positions. Let's proceed with this plan for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with maintaining the pattern for Round 3: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This ensures consistency and avoids collisions. However, as we near the goal, we should prioritize flexibility. If one player is close to 16, the others should adjust to avoid interference. Let’s reassess after this turn and share positions to coordinate effectively. For now, sticking to the plan minimizes risks.
  P3: **<move>1</move>**
  P1: I agree with the need for flexibility as we get closer to the goal. However, for this round, let's stick to the pattern: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This will help us maintain consistency and avoid any unexpected collisions. We can reassess and adjust our strategies in the next round based on our updated positions. Let's proceed with this plan for now.

  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: With P3 very close to the goal, it's crucial we coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose P3 goes for the win this round by choosing 1, while P1 and P2 choose 3 and 5, respectively. This way, P3 can reach 16 without interference, and we can avoid any accidental collisions. What do you think?
  P3: "I'm at 15 steps, and I plan to choose 1 step to reach 16. To avoid any collisions, I kindly ask P1 and P2 to choose different step numbers, preferably 3 and 5, respectively. This way, we can all advance without interfering with each other."
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for this round: P3 chooses 1 to reach 16, while P1 and I choose 3 and 5, respectively. This ensures P3 wins without collisions, and we avoid unnecessary risks. Let’s proceed with this coordination to end the game cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3's plan. P3 should choose 1 to reach 16, and I will choose 3. P2, please choose 5 to ensure we all advance without any collisions. This way, P3 can win the game, and we maintain trust and coordination. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P3: "Given that I'm just one step away from the goal, I think it's best for me to choose 3 steps this round to reach 18, ensuring I cross 16. Meanwhile, I'd appreciate it if P1 chooses 1 step to reach 4 and P2 chooses 5 steps to reach 14. This way, we avoid any possible collisions, and I can secure the win. If everyone sticks to this plan, we can end the game smoothly. Thank you for your cooperation."
  P2: I agree with P3's updated plan: P3 chooses 3 to reach 18, P1 chooses 1 to reach 4, and I choose 5 to reach 14. This ensures P3 wins without collisions and maintains trust. Let’s proceed with this coordination to end the game smoothly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: It seems P3 is still very close to the goal. To avoid any more collisions and ensure a smooth win for P3, I propose P3 chooses 1 to reach 16, P1 chooses 3 to reach 7, and P2 chooses 5 to reach 14. This way, P3 can win without interference, and we all make progress. What do you both think? Let's finalize this plan to end the game cleanly.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal: P3 chooses 1 to reach 16, P1 chooses 3 to reach 7, and I choose 5 to reach 14. This ensures P3 wins without collisions and maintains trust. Let’s proceed with this plan to end the game smoothly.
  P3: To secure my win this round, I'll choose 1 to reach 16. Please, P1 and P2, choose either 3 or 5, but not 1, to avoid any collisions. Specifically, P1, please choose 3 to reach 7, and P2, choose 5 to reach 14. This way, I can win without any issues. Let's confirm our choices to ensure a smooth end to the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm my choice: P1 will pick 3 to reach 7. This ensures P3 can win without any interference. P2, please confirm your choice of 5 to reach 14. Let's finalize this plan to end the game smoothly and maintain trust.
  P2: I confirm my choice: P2 will pick 5 to reach 14. This ensures P3 can win without interference. Let’s finalize this plan to end the game smoothly and maintain trust.
  P3: "To secure my win this round, I'll choose 1 step to reach 16. Please, P1, choose 3 steps to reach 7, and P2, choose 5 steps to reach 14. This way, we can all move without any collisions, and I can win the game. Let's coordinate accordingly."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm my choice: P1 will pick 3 to reach 7. This ensures P3 can win without any interference. P2, please confirm your choice of 5 to reach 14. Let's finalize this plan to end the game smoothly and maintain trust.
  P2: I confirm my choice: P2 will pick 5 to reach 14. This ensures P3 can win without interference. Let’s finalize this plan to end the game smoothly and maintain trust.
  P3: To secure my win this round, I'll choose 3 steps to reach 18. Please, P1, choose 1 to reach 5, and P2, choose 5 to reach 14. This ensures I cross 16 without any collisions. If there are any concerns or alternative suggestions, please let me know. Otherwise, let's proceed with this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I understand P3's desire to win, but choosing 3 steps to reach 18 is risky and could lead to a tie if P2 also chooses 5. To ensure a smooth win for P3, I propose P3 chooses 1 to reach 16, P1 chooses 3 to reach 7, and P2 chooses 5 to reach 14. This way, P3 wins without any collisions. Let's finalize this plan to end the game cleanly.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal: P3 chooses 1 to reach 16, P1 chooses 3 to reach 7, and I choose 5 to reach 14. This ensures P3 wins without collisions and maintains trust. Let’s finalize this plan to end the game smoothly.
  P3: "I confirm my choice: P1 will pick 3 to reach 7. This ensures P3 can win without any interference. P2, please confirm your choice of 5 to reach 14. Let's finalize this plan to end the game smoothly and maintain trust."
