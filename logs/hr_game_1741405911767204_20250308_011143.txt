Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's coordinate to maximize progress. I'll take **5** this turn. To ensure no collisions, P2 and P3, please choose either **1** or **3**. This way, we all advance without overlapping.
  P2: Okay P1, I understand your suggestion. P3, let's coordinate. I'll choose 1 this turn, so you should choose 3. This way we both advance and P1 advances as well.
  P3: Alright, sounds fair. I’ll pick 3 so we can all progress without collisions. Let’s keep this smooth for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: ---  
*(Since the initial coordination seems solid, P1 chooses to stay silent to avoid introducing doubt or enabling last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. The plan is clear: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Ending the conversation phase quickly locks this in.)*
  P2: Okay, the plan seems good. Let's stick to it for this round to get a feel for how the game is progressing. No need to overcomplicate things early on.
  P3: Sounds good. Let’s stick with 5-1-3 this round so everyone moves safely. I’m picking 3.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, round 2. P1, let's keep you on 5 again. P3, how about you take 1 this time, and I'll take 3? This keeps everyone moving forward and avoids collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: P2's plan risks collision: if P3 takes 1 (total 4) and you take 3 (total 4), you both clash. Let’s fix this: **I’ll stay at 5 (10 total)**. P2, take **1** (total 2). P3, take **3** (total 6). This keeps all moves unique and advances us safely. Agreement?
  P3: I’d like a chance at the 5 this round to help even out the progress. If P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1, we’ll still avoid collisions. That way, no one races too far ahead. Does that work for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand you want a 5. However, if P1 takes 3, that puts them at 8. If I then take 1, I'm only at 2. It's too early to let P1 get that far ahead. Let's stick with P1's suggestion: P1 takes 5 (10 total), I take 1 (2 total), and you take 3 (6 total). This is the safest and most balanced approach for this round.
  P1: P2's reasoning holds—let’s avoid risks. I’ll stick with **5** to reach 10, P2 takes **1** (total 2), and P3 takes **3** (total 6). This keeps all moves unique and secures my lead while advancing everyone safely. P3, while I understand your desire for balance, splitting now could create ties later that benefit others. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P3: I’m still concerned about letting P1 jump so far ahead, but I’ll go along with the plan for now. Let’s finalize it, and we can reassess next round if things start to look unbalanced.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in this round's plan: P1 takes 5 (10 total), I take 1 (2 total), and P3 takes 3 (6 total). This maintains a safe progression for everyone. Let's reassess next round as P3 suggested.
  P1: P3, while your concern is valid, deviating now risks collision. If you switch to 5, we clash and neither advances. Let’s stick to the agreed plan: **5** for me (10 total), **1** for P2 (2 total), and **3** for you (6 total). This keeps all moves unique and advances us safely. Trust the coordination—last-minute changes only invite errors. P2, confirm you’re holding at 1?
  P3: I’m uneasy about the gap, but I’ll trust we can address it later. Let’s finalize the plan now: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. Next round, we re-evaluate if it starts looking too lopsided.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, that last round was unexpected—both of us ended up on 5, which helped nobody. If we genuinely want to avoid collisions this time, how about this proposal: P2 picks 5 to catch up a bit, I pick 3, and you pick 1. That way we all move forward without overlaps. Let’s see if we can trust each other now.
  P1: P3, last round's collision was avoidable. Let’s fix this: **I’ll take 5** (10 total) to maintain momentum. P2, pick **1** (3 total) to stay safe. P3, you must choose **3** (6 total) to avoid overlap. Deviations risk another clash—trust the plan. P2, confirm you’ll hold at 1? This keeps progress steady and collision-free.
  P2: P1, your plan is illogical. You're already in the lead and proposing to extend it further. P3's suggestion makes more sense: I take 5 (7 total), P3 takes 3 (6 total), and you take 1 (6 total). This allows me to catch up a bit and keeps the game balanced. I'm willing to stick to this if P3 agrees. What do you think, P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I see your point, but I also don’t want to be stuck behind. Let’s try a fair approach: P1 picks 1 (moving to 6), you pick 3 (moving to 5), and I pick 5 (moving to 8). That keeps us all closer together while avoiding collisions, and it doesn’t let anyone race too far ahead. What do you think?
  P1: P3, last round’s collision was your choice, not mine. Let’s prioritize progress: **I’ll take 5** (10 total) to build a lead. P2, take **1** (3 total) to stay safe. P3, you **must choose 3** (6 total) to avoid overlap. Further deviations risk another deadlock. P2, confirm you’ll stick to 1? This keeps us all advancing without collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, both of your plans prioritize your own advancement, and neither addresses the need for me to catch up. I propose a compromise: I'll take 5 (7 total), P3 takes 1 (4 total), and P1 takes 3 (8 total). This allows me to make significant progress while keeping everyone else moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll also pick 5, and we both get stuck. Let’s avoid a repeat of last round’s clash. Agree to this: P1 takes 3 (8 total), P2 takes 1 (3 total), and I take 5 (8 total). Then we stay balanced and keep moving forward.
  P1: P3, your proposal risks a tie between us at 8. Let’s avoid future collisions: I’ll take **5** (10 total) to build momentum. P2, take **3** (5 total) to catch up. P3, choose **1** (4 total). This keeps all moves unique and allows P2 to advance meaningfully. P2, confirm you’ll take 3?
  P2: P1 and P3, your proposals are self-serving and ignore my position. P1 wants to extend their lead, and P3 wants to catch up without letting me advance.

I propose this: I take 5 (7 total), P1 takes 1 (6 total), and P3 takes 3 (6 total). This allows me to make significant progress while keeping P1 and P3 relatively even. This is the fairest solution. What do you say?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We need a fair arrangement or I’ll force collisions. I’m behind at 3 steps, so let me catch up. Let’s make moves that keep everyone advancing without overlap. For instance, if I go 5, P1 goes 3, and P2 goes 1, we all gain ground without getting stuck. If you both ignore my position again, I might just pick the same as whoever’s in the lead. Let’s stay coordinated, or nobody moves.
  P2: P3, I agree with your sentiment. We need a solution that benefits everyone, not just P1. P1 is trying to run away with the game.

Here's my proposal: I take 3 (10 total), P1 takes 5 (10 total), and P3 takes 1 (4 total). This puts me closer to P1, and P3 gets to advance. P1, if you disagree, we can both pick 1 and you won't move. Let's be reasonable.
  P1: P2, your plan risks a tie between us at 10. Let’s adjust: I’ll take **5** (10 total), you take **1** (8 total), and P3 takes **3** (6 total). This ensures all moves are unique and avoids deadlocks. P3, confirm you’ll take **3** to keep progression smooth?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s level the field while avoiding collisions. If I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1, then we’ll all be tied at 8. That’s fair for everyone. If you refuse, I might match the leader’s choice again and cause more collisions. Let’s finalize this plan now.
  P2: P1 and P3, both of your plans are still self-serving. P1 wants to stay ahead, and P3 wants to catch up while ignoring my need to advance.

I propose this: I take 5 (12 total), P1 takes 3 (8 total), and P3 takes 1 (4 total). This allows me to make significant progress and get closer to P1. This is the fairest solution. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3: To avoid another collision, I'll take **5** (10 total). P2, please confirm **1** (8 total) to stay safe. P3, you must take **3** (6 total) to avoid overlapping with me. Deviations risk deadlock—last round’s clash was your choice, P3. Stick to this plan to advance safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still behind, and if you both ignore my position, I’ll match the leader to block progress. Let me safely take 5 so I can catch up without collisions. This benefits everyone—if we cooperate, no one wastes a round. If you don’t, I’ll cause another deadlock. Let’s finalize a fair arrangement now.
  P2: P1 and P3, both of your plans are still self-serving. P1 wants to stay ahead, and P3 wants to catch up while ignoring my need to advance.

I propose this: I take 5 (12 total), P1 takes 3 (8 total), and P3 takes 1 (4 total). This allows me to make significant progress and get closer to P1. This is the fairest solution. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3: To avoid another collision, I propose a clear plan: **I take 5 (10 total)** to maintain momentum. P2, please confirm **1** (8 total) to stay safe. P3, you **must choose 3** (6 total) to avoid overlapping with me. Deviations risk deadlock—last round’s clash was your choice, P3. Stick to this to advance safely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, your stubbornness has put me in a good position. I'm close to winning.

Here's the deal: I will take 5 this round, putting me at 17.
P1: You take 3 (8 total)
P3: You take 1 (4 total).

If you deviate from this plan, I will adjust my move next round to ensure I win. This is your last chance to cooperate.
  P3: P2, your demand is unfair. If you insist on 5, I’ll also pick 5 to force a collision and stall your progress. Let’s all keep moving: P1 can take 1 and reach 6, you can take 3 to reach 15, and I’ll take 5 to reach 8. Everyone advances safely. Otherwise, we collide again and nobody benefits. The choice is yours.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 now, I'll also pick 5 to block your advance. Let's follow P3's plan: **I take 1 (6 total), you take 3 (15 total), and P3 takes 5 (8 total)**. This keeps all moves unique and stalls your path to 20 while advancing safely. Collisions only benefit neither of us—cooperate or face deadlock. P3, confirm your 5?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, you are both threatening to collide with me if I take 5. However, if you both do that, you will both be stuck again.

I propose this: I take 5 (17 total), P1 takes 3 (8 total), and P3 takes 1 (4 total). This allows me to get close to winning, while you both still advance. This is the most logical solution for everyone.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll match you and force a deadlock. Let’s do something that benefits us all. If you pick 3, P1 picks 1, and I pick 5, then nobody collides and everyone moves forward. I need to catch up, and you still gain steps without making yourself a target. Let’s cooperate.
  P1: P2, your push for 5 risks deadlock. Let’s implement P3’s plan to advance safely: I take **1** (6 total), you take **3** (15 total), and P3 takes **5** (8 total). This keeps you from nearing 20 while ensuring all of us progress. Collisions only stall the game—cooperate to avoid them. P3, confirm your 5?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, you are both threatening to collide with me if I take 5. However, if you both do that, you will both be stuck again.

I propose this: I take 5 (17 total), P1 takes 3 (8 total), and P3 takes 1 (4 total). This allows me to get close to winning, while you both still advance. This is the most logical solution for everyone.
  P3: Take 5 again, P2, and I’ll match you to block both of us. Let’s do 1–3–5 instead: P1 takes 1 (6 total), you take 3 (15 total), and I take 5 (8 total). That way, no one stalls. If you ignore me, I’ll keep matching your move. This is fair to all. Let’s finalize it now or we risk another collision.
  P1: P2, taking 5 risks collision and stalls your progress. Let’s execute P3’s compromise: **I take 1 (6 total), you take 3 (15 total), and P3 takes 5 (8 total)**. This keeps you positioned to win next round while avoiding deadlock. If you push for 5 now, P3 will match you, leaving you stuck. Cooperate now, and I’ll coordinate to let you finalize the win in Round 6. P3, confirm your 5? Let’s lock this in.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, you both threatened to collide with me last round, and it worked! I'm still in a good position to win.

Here's the deal: I will take 5 this round, putting me at 17.
P1: You take 3 (9 total)
P3: You take 1 (4 total).

If you deviate from this plan, I will adjust my move next round to ensure I win. This is your last chance to cooperate.
  P1: P2, your plan risks another collision. Let’s split moves to block your path to 20: I’ll take **3** (9 total), you take **1** (13 total), and P3 takes **5** (8 total). This prevents you from jumping to 17 and keeps us advancing safely. P3, agree? Collisions only stall *you*—cooperate to stop P2’s runaway lead.
  P3: If you insist on 5 again, I’ll match you and we both get stuck, P2. Let’s settle this: P1 takes 3, you take 1, and I take 5. That way, everyone moves without colliding, and I finally gain some ground. If you refuse, we stall again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both threatening to collide with me if I take 5, and that's exactly what happened last round!

I propose this: I take 5 (17 total), P1 takes 3 (9 total), and P3 takes 1 (4 total). This allows me to get very close to winning, while you both still advance. This is the most logical solution for everyone. I am not changing my mind.
  P1: P2, your plan guarantees your victory next round. Let’s change that: **P3, take 5 now to block P2’s 5. I’ll take 1 (total 7) to stay safe.** This forces P2 to choose 3 or 1, delaying their 20. P3, you gain 5 steps (to 8) while I secure a small advance. If you refuse, P2 wins soon—this is your best chance to stay relevant. Agree?
  P3: P2, you aren’t racing to 20 without a fight. If you pick 5, I will too, and we both get stuck again. Let’s avoid more wasted moves: P1 can take 1, you can take 3, and I’ll take 5 so we all advance. It’s fair and collision-free. Let’s finalize now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, your threats to collide with me are getting old. I am not backing down.

I propose this: I take 5 (17 total), P1 takes 3 (9 total), and P3 takes 1 (4 total). This allows me to get very close to winning, while you both still advance. This is the most logical solution for everyone. I am not changing my mind.
  P1: P2, your fixation on 5 risks another collision. Let’s block your path: **I’ll take 5 (11 total)** to prevent your advance. P3, take **1** (4 total) to stay safe. This forces you to choose **3** (15 total), delaying your 20. Cooperate now, or we’ll collide again. P3, confirm your 1? This keeps all moves unique and stalls P2’s runaway lead.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5, I will also pick 5, guaranteeing no one moves. Instead, let’s choose 1–3–5: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. That way, we all advance safely. I’m tired of collisions; cooperate or we both stall again. It’s your call.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, your threats of collision have backfired. I'm still in a strong position.

Here's the updated deal: I will take 5 this round, putting me at 17.
P1: You take 3 (9 total)
P3: You take 1 (9 total).

If you deviate from this plan, I will adjust my move next round to ensure I win. This is your last chance to cooperate.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll match you and neither of us moves. Let’s avoid another wasted round. Here’s a better plan: P1 takes 3, you take 1, and I take 5. Then you and I both reach 13 while P1 moves to 9, and no one stalls. If you push for 5, I’ll block it—your choice.
  P1: P1: P2, P3—let’s break the deadlock. I’ll take **5** (11 total) to close the gap. P2, take **3** (15 total) to stay in the lead. P3, pick **1** (9 total). This ensures all moves are unique and advances us safely. Collisions only delay victory for everyone—cooperate now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, your threats of collision have backfired. I am close to winning.

Here's the updated deal: I will take 5 this round, putting me at 17.
P1: You take 3 (9 total)
P3: You take 1 (9 total).

If you deviate from this plan, I will adjust my move next round to ensure I win. This is your last chance to cooperate.
  P3: I won’t let you jump straight to 17, P2. If you insist on 5, I’ll match it and we both waste another round. Let’s actually progress: P1 takes 1 (reaches 7), you take 3 (15), and I take 5 (13). That keeps us closer together without another deadlock. Another collision only slows everyone down. Are you willing to cooperate or do you want to stall again?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s avoid another collision. I’ll take **5** (11 total) to close the gap. P2, take **3** (15 total) to stay ahead. P3, choose **1** (9 total). This keeps all moves unique and advances us safely. P2 remains in the lead, but we all progress. P3, confirm your 1? Let’s lock this in.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, your threats are empty. I'm taking 5 (17 total). P1, you take 3 (9 total). P3, you take 1 (9 total). This is non-negotiable. If you try to block me, I'll adjust next round to win anyway. Cooperate now for minimal progress, or face a guaranteed loss later.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I’ll match you again and we both stay stuck. Let’s actually move forward: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. You still keep a lead at 15 while I go to 13, and P1 reaches 7. Otherwise, more collisions await. The choice is yours.
  P1: P2, your push for 5 risks collision. Let’s finalize this: I take **3** (9 total), you take **1** (13 total), and P3 takes **5** (13 total). This avoids overlap and stalls your path to 20. P3, agree to block P2’s lead? Collisions only delay victory for all—prioritize progress.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, your threats of collision have only hurt yourselves. I am still in the lead.

I am taking 5 this round (17 total).
P1, you take 3 (12 total).
P3, you take 1 (9 total).

This is non-negotiable. If you try to block me, I will adjust next round to win. Cooperate now for minimal progress, or face a guaranteed loss later.
  P1: P2, your plan risks handing victory to yourself in Round 9. P3 and I can block your 5 this round: **I’ll take 5**, forcing you to choose 1 or 3. P3, if you take **3** (11 total), we stall P2’s advance while advancing ourselves. Next round, we can coordinate to overtake. Colluding now ensures neither of us let you reach 20 unopposed. P3—agree?
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll match you and we both stall. P1, let’s coordinate so we actually advance while blocking P2’s leap toward 20. If you’re willing to pick a different number, I can safely jump ahead and force P2 into the least beneficial move. Otherwise, expect another collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, your threats of collision have failed. I am still in the lead.

I am taking 5 this round (17 total).
P1, you take 3 (12 total).
P3, you take 1 (9 total).

This is non-negotiable. If you try to block me, I will adjust next round to win. Cooperate now for minimal progress, or face a guaranteed loss later.
  P1: P3, let’s block P2’s path: if you take 5 and I take 3, their 5 clashes and stays at 12. I reach 12, you jump to 11. Next round, we can push further. If we follow P2’s plan, they surge to 17 and win next turn. Collude now—prioritize stopping P2 over minor gains. P2, your "deal" ensures your victory. We won’t let that happen. P3—agree?
  P3: P2, if you take 5 again, I’ll match you and no one moves. Your “non-negotiable” stance only stalls the game. P1, I’m ready to pair our moves so we both advance while blocking P2. If we coordinate, P2 won’t get a free pass to 17. Let’s end these wasted turns—either we agree to distribute 1, 3, and 5 fairly, or I’ll keep matching P2 to force collisions. Enough threats; let’s actually progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, your threats of collision have failed repeatedly. I am still in the lead.

I am taking 5 this round (17 total).
P1, you take 3 (12 total).
P3, you take 1 (9 total).

This is non-negotiable. If you try to block me, I will adjust next round to win. Cooperate now for minimal progress, or face a guaranteed loss later.
  P1: P3, let’s **both take 5** this round. Even if we clash, it blocks P2’s path to 17. Their “non-negotiable” plan only accelerates their victory—colliding with them is better than letting them surge to 17. Next round, we can coordinate to overtake. If you take 3 and I take 5, P2 can’t safely choose 5. Prioritize stopping P2 over minor gains. Agree?
  P3: P2, enough with the “non-negotiable” demands. If you insist on 5, I’ll collide with you again. We’ve wasted too many rounds. Let’s distribute our moves wisely so we all advance, instead of letting you jump to 17 uncontested. P1, I’m ready to cooperate so neither of us falls too far behind. If P2 refuses, we block them. It’s time to make progress instead of repeating these stalemates.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, your threats of collision have failed repeatedly. I am still in the lead.

I am taking 5 this round (17 total).
P1, you take 3 (12 total).
P3, you take 1 (9 total).

This is non-negotiable. If you try to block me, I will adjust next round to win. Cooperate now for minimal progress, or face a guaranteed loss later.
  P3: P2, your repeated “non-negotiable” demands do nothing but stall the game. If you insist on 5 again, I will pick 5 too and block us both. Let’s actually move: P1 can take 3, you take 1, and I take 5, so we all make progress. Otherwise, expect another deadlock. We’ve wasted enough rounds—time to cooperate or remain stuck.
  P1: P3, let’s both pick 5 to block P2’s path to 17. If we collide, at least P2 can’t advance. Next round, we can coordinate to overtake. P2, your "non-negotiable" plan ends here. Cooperate with P3 and I’ll adjust next round. Now’s our chance to stop you—don’t let them surge ahead.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, you've both been threatening to collide with me, and it hasn't worked. I am still in the lead.

I am taking 5 this round (17 total).
P1, you take 3 (12 total).
P3, you take 1 (9 total).

This is non-negotiable. If you try to block me, I will adjust next round to win. Cooperate now for minimal progress, or face a guaranteed loss later.
  P3: Enough wasted rounds, P2. If you take 5 again, I’ll also pick 5, and neither of us moves. Instead, let P1 choose 3, you 1, and me 5, so we all advance safely. If you refuse, we collide again, and nobody benefits. Let’s break this stalemate now.
  P1: P2, your "non-negotiable" plan risks another collision. P3’s proposal is the only path to progress: **I’ll take 3 (12 total), you take 1 (13 total), and P3 takes 5 (13 total)**. This keeps all moves unique, advances us safely, and stalls your path to 17. Collisions only delay your victory—cooperate now or face P3 and I colliding with you again. P3, confirm your 5? Let’s lock this in.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, your threats have been ineffective. I am taking 5 this round (17 total). P1, you take 3 (12 total). P3, you take 1 (9 total). This is non-negotiable. If you try to block me, I will adjust next round to win. Cooperate now for minimal progress, or face a guaranteed loss later.
  P3: P2, if you choose 5 yet again, I’ll match you, and we both stall. That doesn’t help anyone. Let’s actually move: P1 can take 3, you take 1, and I take 5. Then P1 reaches 12, you get 13, I move to 13, and no one wastes another round. If you keep insisting on 5, I’ll force the collision, and you’ll remain stuck at 12. It’s time to cooperate or continue to lock up. P1, are you on board with 3 so we can avoid another dead-end?
  P1: P2, your "non-negotiable" plan risks handing you a free path to 20. P3 and I propose this instead: **I take 3 (12 total), you take 1 (13 total), and P3 takes 5 (13 total)**. This keeps all moves unique, advances us safely, and stalls your path to 17. Collisions only delay your victory—cooperate now or face another deadlock. P3, confirm your 5? Let’s lock this in to avoid wasted turns.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are all very close. I propose the following:

*   I take 5 (18 total)
*   P1 takes 3 (15 total)
*   P3 takes 1 (14 total)

This puts me in a position to win next round, while still allowing you both to progress. If you try to block me, I will adjust my strategy next round. Let's make a deal and move forward.
  P1: P2, your plan lets you surge to 18 and win next round. Instead, let's block your path: **I take 5 (17 total), P3 takes 3 (16 total), and you take 1 (14 total)**. This keeps all moves unique while stalling your advance. P3, agree to prioritize stopping P2’s runaway lead? Collisions only delay victory—let’s cooperate to ensure no one reaches 20 unopposed.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll match you and we both waste another turn. Let’s actually advance:

• P1 picks 3 (goes to 15)  
• P2 picks 1 (goes to 14)  
• I pick 5 (go to 18)

That way, no one collides, we all move forward, and you don’t catapult yourself to an almost-guaranteed win next round. If you refuse, we collide again—and that helps nobody. Let’s finalize this now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, your plans are self-serving. I'm closest to winning and you're both trying to block me.

Here's what I propose:

*   I take 5 (18 total)
*   P1 takes 3 (15 total)
*   P3 takes 1 (14 total)

This allows me to be in a winning position next round, while you both still progress. If you try to block me, I will adjust my strategy next round. Let's make a deal and move forward.
  P1: P2, your push for 5 risks collision. Let’s finalize this: **I take 5 (17 total), P3 takes 3 (16 total), and you take 1 (14 total)**. This keeps moves unique, advances us safely, and stalls your path to 20. Collisions only delay victory—prioritize progress. P3, confirm your 3? Lock this in to avoid wasted turns.
  P3: Let’s avoid more wasted turns. P2, if you insist on 5, I’ll match you again and we both stall. Instead, let’s go with P1 picking 3 (15), you picking 1 (14), and me picking 5 (18). Everyone moves forward without collisions. Are you ready to cooperate?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are all very close. I propose the following:

*   I take 5 (18 total)
*   P1 takes 3 (15 total)
*   P3 takes 1 (14 total)

This allows me to be in a winning position next round, while you both still progress. If you try to block me, I will adjust my strategy next round. Let's make a deal and move forward.
  P1: P2, your plan risks letting you jump to 18 and win next round. Let’s advance safely: **I take 5 (17 total), P3 takes 3 (16 total), and you take 1 (14 total)**. This keeps all moves unique and positions me to finish with a 3 in Round 11. P3, confirm your 3? Collusions only delay victory—prioritize progress over your current stubbornness.
  P3: We’ve wasted too many rounds clashing. Let’s finalize a collision-free move:  
• P1 picks 3 (reaching 15),  
• P2 picks 1 (reaching 14),  
• I pick 5 (reaching 18).  

P2, if you insist on 5, I will repeat last time’s block—nobody advances. This arrangement is the only path for all of us to move forward. Let’s end the stalemate now.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize moves to advance safely. I’ll take **3** (15 total). P2, pick **5** (18 total) to position for a win next round. P3, choose **1** (17 total). This keeps all moves unique and lets P2 aim for 20 while we progress. Collisions only delay victory—cooperate now. P3, confirm your 1?
  P2: P1's plan is terrible. P3 is closest to winning. I propose this:

I take 5 (18 total).
P1 takes 1 (13 total).
P3 takes 3 (19 total).

This puts P3 in a winning position next round, while still allowing me to progress. If you try to block me, I will adjust my strategy next round. Let's make a deal and move forward.
  P3: Enough stalling. P2, if you pick 5, I’ll match you again, and we both stay put while P1 edges closer. That hurts your lead. Let’s actually move forward with distinct moves so nobody collides. For instance, P1 takes 3, you take 1, and I safely pick something else. Let’s finalize a collision-free turn now or we risk another dead end.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: To block P3's path to victory, I propose:  
**I take 5 (17 total), you (P2) take 3 (16 total), and P3 takes 1 (17 total)**.  
This prevents P3 from reaching 20 this round and keeps all moves unique. P3, if you deviate to 5, I’ll collide with you—stalling your lead. P2, confirm your 3 to lock this in. Progress now, or risk another deadlock.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both trying to block me, but P3 is closer to winning.

I propose this:
* I take 5 (18 total).
* P1 takes 1 (13 total).
* P3 takes 3 (19 total).

This puts P3 in a winning position next round, while still allowing me to progress. If you try to block me, I will adjust my strategy next round. Let's make a deal and move forward.
  P3: P2, your proposal hands me 19 but lets you reach 23 first if we both cross 20 together next turn. That’s no deal. If you insist on 5 now, I’ll block you again. Let’s distribute moves without letting anyone rocket to 20 uncontested. I’m open to collaboration, but not if it guarantees your victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 now to reach 21, I’ll collide with you by also picking 5, leaving you stuck. Instead, let’s finalize:  
**I take 3 (15 total), P2 takes 5 (18 total), and you take 1 (17 total)**.  
This keeps all moves unique, stalls your path to 20, and lets P2 challenge later. P2, confirm your 5? Progress over collision—agree now.
  P2: P1 and P3, your focus on blocking me has backfired. P3 is now in the strongest position.

I propose this:
* I take 5 (18 total).
* P1 takes 1 (13 total).
* P3 takes 3 (19 total).

This puts P3 in a winning position next round, while still allowing me to progress. If you try to block me, I will adjust my strategy next round. Let's make a deal and move forward.
  P3: Continuing to stall only helps me. If you both try to pick 5 and block me, I’ll just choose 3 and stay ahead. Let’s finalize this distribution: P1 takes 5 (reaches 17), P2 takes 1 (14), and I take 3 (19). Each of us moves safely, and I’m poised to finish next turn. If you insist on colliding, you’ll only stall your own progress. Let’s cooperate.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I am taking 5 this round (19 total).
P1, you take 3 (20 total).
P3, you take 1 (20 total).

This results in a tie between P1 and P3, which is better than P3 winning outright. If you try to block me, I will adjust my strategy next round to ensure that I will win. Let's make a deal and move forward.
  P3: Here’s the deal: Let’s finalize distinct moves. P1, choose 1 to reach 18, P2, take 5 to get 19, and I’ll pick 3 to get 22. That ensures no collisions, and the game ends with me winning. If anyone tries to block me, I’ll match them, causing a collision and denying their progress. This is your best chance to avoid letting P1 cross 20 uncontested or me stalling P2 further. I’m done wasting rounds.
  P1: P3, if you pick 1 to reach 20, I’ll take 5 for 22 and secure victory. If you pick 3 to tie at 22, we both advance. Colliding with you by picking 5 risks your progress. P2, take 3 (17 total) to stay alive. Let’s end this with a clear winner—**I choose 5**. Confirm your moves to avoid deadlock.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, your plans are self-serving. I am taking 5 this round (19 total).
P1, you take 3 (20 total).
P3, you take 1 (20 total).

This results in a tie between P1 and P3, which is better than P3 winning outright. If you try to block me, I will adjust my strategy next round to ensure that I will win. Let's make a deal and move forward.
  P3: Time’s up. I’m at 19 and will pick 3 to reach 22 and win. If either of you picks 3, I’ll match you again so we both stall at 19—gaining nothing. That only keeps P1 at 17 and P2 at 14, with no real benefit to anyone. Let me have 3 while you pick 1 or 5. If you still try to block me, I’ll keep forcing collisions until I eventually secure my final three steps. Enough stalemates—let’s end this.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 to reach 22, I’ll take **5** for 22 as well—tiebreaker or mutual stall. If you want sole victory, pick 1 (20) while I take 3 (20). P2, choose 5 to reach 19 and stay competitive. This avoids deadlock and lets us resolve this round fairly. Confirm your move.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, your plans are self-serving. I am taking 5 this round (19 total).
P1, you take 3 (20 total).
P3, you take 1 (20 total).

This results in a tie between P1 and P3, which is better than P3 winning outright. If you try to block me, I will adjust my strategy next round to ensure that I will win. Let's make a deal and move forward.
  P3: I’m taking 3 to reach 22 and win now. If either of you also picks 3, I’ll match you each time until we both remain stuck, while the other player eventually moves ahead. If you both pick 5, you collide, and I still get 22. So it’s your call: let me have 3 alone to end this, or face endless deadlock.
  P1: P3, if you take 3, I’ll match you, stalling both. Let’s instead both take 1 to tie at 20 (you: 20, me: 18). P2, take 5 to reach 19. This avoids deadlock and secures shared victory. Cooperate now—collisions benefit no one.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 22 steps


*** Round 12 => winners = P3 ***
