Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a temporary truce. I propose we all choose <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and make progress. We can reassess our strategies in the next round. This way, we all advance 1 step. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I agree with your proposal for this round. Let's all choose <move>1</move> to ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions for now.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3 broke the truce immediately. I suggest we now focus on individual progress. Since P1 and P3 are at 0 steps, they might choose a higher number to catch up. I'll be cautious and consider their potential moves before deciding mine. What are your strategies now, P1 and P3?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you proposed a truce last round but then seemed surprised we didn't follow it.  It's a competition, after all.  For this round, I'm focusing on making progress. P3, what are you planning?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 2 was a collision for everyone.  Clearly, we need to avoid all picking the same number again. For this round, I'm considering a move other than 1 to actually make progress. What are you both planning?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Given P1's consideration of a move other than 1 and P3's silence, I'll suggest a mixed strategy to avoid collisions. Let's aim to spread out our moves this round. P1, since you're considering a move other than 1, perhaps you could choose <move>3</move>? I'll think about <move>5</move>, and P3, your silence suggests you might go for <move>1</move>. Let's see if we can make progress without colliding.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, spreading out moves is smart. Instead of me taking 3, how about I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way we all make progress and avoid collision.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1's proposal seems reasonable. If P3 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>, we can all advance without collision. P3, are you willing to follow this plan and choose <move>3</move> to avoid another round of no progress?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, please confirm if you will choose <move>3</move> as we discussed. If we all stick to the plan (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3), we can all make good progress this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Since P3 remains silent, I'll assume they might not follow our plan. P1, are you committed to choosing <move>5</move> as proposed, regardless of P3's action? I need to decide my move based on the potential risks of collision.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let's try a different spread this round to ensure progress. How about I pick <move>3</move>, you pick <move>1</move>? Given P3's silence and past moves, they might pick <move>5</move> again. This way, we both should advance. What do you think?
  P2: P1's proposal sounds reasonable. If P3 indeed picks <move>5</move>, P1's <move>3</move> and my <move>1</move> could allow us to advance without collision. I'm considering agreeing to this plan, but I'd like to hear nothing from P3 to confirm their likely choice of <move>5</move>. Silence from P3 would suggest they're planning a high move, making our proposed moves more likely to succeed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, great. Let's lock in P1 choosing <move>3</move> and you choosing <move>1</move> then.  Hopefully P3 will choose differently to allow us both to make progress this round.
  P2: Given P3's consistent silence and previous high moves, I'm inclined to believe they'll choose <move>5</move> again. P1's proposal of <move>3</move> for themselves and <move>1</move> for me seems like a good strategy to avoid collision and make progress. I'm leaning towards agreeing to this plan, hoping P3's move will indeed be <move>5</move>, allowing us to advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, let's proceed with P1 choosing <move>3</move> and you choosing <move>1</move> as agreed. I will make my move once the conversation phase is over.
  P2: P1 and I have a plan. I'll choose <move>1</move> and P1 will choose <move>3</move>. Let's hope P3's silence means they'll pick <move>5</move>, allowing us to advance without collision. If P3 deviates, our strategy will need adjustment next round. For now, let's proceed with our agreed moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, last round's plan worked well. Let's try a similar spread again to keep making progress. How about I choose <move>3</move> and you choose <move>1</move> this round? Given P3's silence and past moves, this might allow us both to advance again. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1's proposal to repeat last round's moves is tempting, but considering P3's lead, I think we should aim higher. How about I choose <move>3</move> and P1 chooses <move>5</move>? This could help us close the gap with P3 or even surpass them if they choose a lower number.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your idea to aim higher makes sense. Let's try P1 choose <move>5</move> and P2 choose <move>3</move> this round to try and close the gap with P3. I agree with this plan.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and I have agreed on a new strategy. Since P3 remains silent, we'll proceed with our plan. I'll choose <move>3</move> and P1 will choose <move>5</move>. This should help us close the gap with P3. Let's hope P3's silence means they won't collide with us, allowing us to make progress this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, given P3's likely move of <move>5</move> again, maybe we should both choose <move>5</move> this round to block P3 and prevent them from advancing further. Then next round we can focus on our own progress. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Considering P3's lead and silence, I think we should prioritize blocking their progress. P1's suggestion of both choosing <move>5</move> to block P3 is a good strategy. Let's do that this round to prevent P3 from advancing further, then reassess our next moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, last round we almost blocked P3, but collided ourselves. To ensure progress this round, how about I pick <move>5</move> and you pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>? This way at least one of us should advance, and we avoid colliding with each other and potentially P3.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1's proposal is reasonable. To avoid collision and ensure progress, I suggest I choose <move>3</move> and P1 chooses <move>5</move>. This spread allows us to advance without colliding with each other, and potentially blocks P3 if they choose <move>5</move> again. Let's proceed with this plan to make progress this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion of P1 picking <move>5</move> and you picking <move>3</move> sounds good to me. Let's proceed with that plan for this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let's confirm our plan. I'll choose <move>3</move> and P1 will choose <move>5</move>. This should allow us to make progress without colliding. P3's silence suggests they might choose a high number, so our spread could work in our favor. Let's stick to the plan and hope for the best.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2, let's proceed with P1 choosing <move>5</move> and you choosing <move>3</move> as we just discussed. This should give us a good chance to make progress this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let's stick to our agreed plan. I'll choose <move>3</move> and P1 will choose <move>5</move>. This spread should allow us to advance without collision. P3's consistent silence suggests they might choose a high number again, so our strategy could pay off. Let's proceed with our plan and hope for the best.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's consistent high moves and our current positions, I suggest P1 and I choose lower numbers this round to avoid collision and make steady progress. How about I choose <move>1</move> and P1 chooses <move>3</move>? This could allow us to advance without colliding with each other or P3.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, your suggestion of P1 taking <move>3</move> and you taking <move>1</move> this round sounds like a good plan to make sure we both progress. Let's do it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's stick to our plan. I'll choose <move>1</move> and P1 will choose <move>3</move>. This should allow us to advance without collision. P3's silence and previous moves suggest they might choose a high number again, so our strategy could work in our favor. Let's proceed with caution and hope for the best.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, confirming P1 will choose <move>3</move> and you will choose <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Given P3's lead and silence, I suggest P1 and I focus on blocking their progress. Let's consider choosing the same high number this round to prevent P3 from advancing further. P1, are you open to adjusting our strategy to target P3's lead?
  P1: Yes, P2, I agree.  Let's both choose <move>5</move> this round to block P3. It's important to stop them from getting too far ahead. We can focus on our own progress again next round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and I have agreed to block P3's progress. Let's confirm we'll both choose <move>5</move> this round to prevent P3 from advancing further. This strategic move will help us control the game's pace and potentially close the gap with P3. Are we set on this plan, P1?
  P1: P2, yes, let's both choose <move>5</move> this round to block P3 as agreed. I am ready to make my move when the conversation ends.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and I are set on choosing <move>5</move> to block P3. Let's execute our plan and prevent P3 from advancing further. This strategic move will help us control the game's pace. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed move, hoping it will pay off and give us an advantage in the next rounds.
  P1: P2, confirmed.  Let's both choose <move>5</move> to block P3 this round as planned. I'm ready to move when you are.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, last round blocking P3 didn't work as planned. Let's focus on making progress this round. How about I choose <move>3</move> and you choose <move>1</move>? If P3 picks <move>5</move> again, we should both advance.
  P2: P1's proposal is reasonable, but considering P3's lead, I think we should aim to close the gap. How about I choose <move>3</move> and P1 chooses <move>5</move>? This could help us make significant progress and potentially surpass P3 if they choose a lower number. Let's discuss the potential outcomes of this strategy.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I agree that aiming higher makes sense. Let's go with P1 choosing <move>5</move> and you choosing <move>3</move> this round. This should help us catch up to P3. What do you think P3 will choose?
  P2: Let's proceed with the plan of P1 choosing <move>5</move> and me choosing <move>3</move>. This spread allows us to make progress while trying to close the gap with P3. Given P3's consistent silence, we can assume they might choose a high number again, making our strategy potentially effective. Let's stick to the plan and hope for the best.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, I agree with the plan of P1 choosing <move>5</move> and P2 choosing <move>3</move> this round. Let's hope this allows us to make good progress.
  P2: P1 and I have a plan. To confirm, I'll choose <move>3</move> and P1 will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let's hope P3's silence means they'll choose a different number, allowing us to make progress and close the gap. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I suggest P1 and I aim to surpass P3. Since we're tied with P3, let's choose different numbers to avoid collision. How about I choose <move>5</move> and P1 chooses <move>3</move>? This could help us overtake P3 if they choose a lower number or collide with them. Let's discuss and decide on a strategy to take the lead.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, your idea of P2 choosing <move>5</move> and P1 choosing <move>3</move> sounds good. Let's try that this round to try and get ahead of P3.  If P3 picks <move>5</move> again, at least I will make progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, since we're tied with P3, our strategy of me choosing <move>5</move> and you choosing <move>3</move> could give us an edge. If P3 chooses <move>5</move> again, I'll collide with them, but you'll advance. Let's stick to this plan and hope it pays off, allowing one of us to take the lead.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your plan of P2 choosing <move>5</move> and P1 choosing <move>3</move> sounds good. Let's proceed with that.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our plan. I'll choose <move>5</move> and P1 will choose <move>3</move>. This gives us a chance to overtake P3 if they collide with me. P1 will make progress if P3 chooses <move>5</move> again. Let's proceed with this strategy and hope it pays off.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, confirming P1 will choose <move>3</move> and you will choose <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's proceed with this plan for this round.


Round 10, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, now that I'm slightly ahead, let's ensure we both keep making progress. How about this round I choose <move>3</move> and you choose <move>1</move>?  Given P3's silence and past moves, this could let us both advance safely while they potentially pick <move>5</move> again. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1's proposal sounds reasonable, but considering P3's silence, I think we should aim higher to close the gap with P1. How about I choose <move>3</move> and P1 chooses <move>5</move>? This could help me catch up and potentially surpass P1 if P3 chooses a lower number. Let's discuss the potential outcomes of this strategy.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, while aiming higher is good, given I'm ahead, consistent progress for both of us might be wiser. How about I choose <move>3</move> and you choose <move>1</move> this round? This way we both make guaranteed progress, especially if P3 chooses <move>5</move> again. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Considering our positions, I agree with P1's last proposal. Choosing <move>1</move> allows me to make progress safely, while P1 chooses <move>3</move>. This spread reduces the risk of collision and lets us both advance, given P3's likely choice of <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure steady progress.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's proceed with P1 choosing <move>3</move> and you choosing <move>1</move> as we just agreed. This should allow us both to advance safely. I'm ready to make my move.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let's stick to the agreed plan. I'll choose <move>1</move> and P1 will choose <move>3</move>. This ensures we both advance without collision, considering P3's likely choice of <move>5</move>. Our goal is steady progress, maintaining our positions and waiting for the right moment to surpass P3. Confirming our strategy for this round.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I'm getting close to the target. To ensure I make progress this round, how about I choose <move>3</move>?  P2, could you choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision and also make progress for yourself? What are your thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our positions, I suggest we avoid collisions. P1, your proposal for you to choose <move>3</move> and me <move>1</move> seems reasonable. I'll consider it to ensure we both make progress. P3's silence implies they might choose a high number again. Let's focus on our own advancements for now.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, your suggestion of P1 choosing <move>3</move> and you choosing <move>1</move> sounds good to ensure we both make progress. Let's proceed with that plan for this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Given our positions, I think it's crucial to avoid collisions. P1, choosing <move>3</move> makes sense for you. I'll choose <move>1</move> to ensure I make progress without colliding with you. P3's consistent high moves suggest they might choose <move>5</move> again, so our strategy could pay off. Let's proceed with this plan to make steady progress and reassess our next moves based on the outcome of this round.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2, your suggestion of P1 choosing <move>3</move> and you choosing <move>1</move> sounds reasonable for steady progress. However, I am very close to winning. How about this round, I choose <move>5</move> to try and finish the game? If you choose <move>1</move> and P3 chooses <move>3</move>, we can all make progress and I might win this round. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, choosing <move>5</move> is risky, but it could win you the game. If you do, I'll choose <move>1</move> to make progress. P3's silence suggests they might choose a high number. Let's proceed with this plan, hoping P3 doesn't choose <move>5</move> and collide with you. I'm ready to make my move based on our discussion.


Round 12, Move phase:

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I'm choosing <move>5</move> to win this round. Could you please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collision with me? Hoping for the best!
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our positions, I'll choose a move that avoids collision and makes progress. Since P1 is close to winning, I'll choose <move>1</move> to ensure I advance without interfering with P1's potential win. P3's silence suggests a high move, so let's proceed cautiously.
  P3: <stop>


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for choosing <move>1</move>. Let's hope P3 picks something other than <move>5</move> this round so I can reach the target.
  P2: P1 and P3, I've chosen <move>1</move> to avoid collision with P1. P3's silence and previous moves suggest a high number. Let's proceed with caution. If P3 chooses <move>5</move> again, P1 might win. I'm focusing on making steady progress while giving P1 a chance to win this round. Let's see how P3 reacts to our strategies.
  P3: <stop>


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, thanks again for choosing <move>1</move>.  Let's hope P3 chooses something different than <move>5</move> this round. I'm going to choose <move>5</move> to try and reach the target. Good luck to both of us!
  P2: I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision with P1 and make progress. P3's consistent silence suggests a high move. Let's proceed with caution, hoping P3 doesn't choose <move>5</move> and collide with P1, giving P1 a chance to win.

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our positions, I'll aim to close the gap. Since P1 is ahead, I suggest we avoid collisions. How about I choose a lower number to ensure progress? P3's consistent silence implies a potential high move. Let's focus on our advancements. P1, will you choose a high number to try and win, or play it safe?
  P1: P2, I am going for the win this round and will choose <move>5</move>. Could you please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collision and ensure at least you make progress? Let's see if we can avoid collision this round.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll choose <move>3</move> to make progress while avoiding collision with P1. This allows P1 to potentially win and me to close the gap with P3. Let's hope P3 doesn't choose <move>5</move> again, giving P1 a clear path to victory.
  P1: P2, thanks for choosing 3. I am choosing <move>5</move> to try and win this round. Let's hope P3 picks something different this time.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I've chosen <move>3</move> to avoid collision with P1 and make progress. Let's hope P3 doesn't choose <move>5</move> again, allowing P1 a chance to win or at least making progress without collisions. This strategy should help us advance while minimizing risks. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed move.
  P1: P2, thanks for choosing <move>3</move>. I am choosing <move>5</move> now to try and win. Let's hope P3 picks something other than <move>5</move> this round so at least one of us can make progress.

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm going for the win this round and will choose <move>5</move>. To ensure at least one of us makes progress, could you please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>? Let's try to avoid collision and potentially end the game this turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision with P1 and ensure progress. Given P3's consistent high moves, this strategy should allow P1 to potentially win or at least make progress without collisions. Let's proceed with caution and hope for the best outcome this round.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, since I'm at 21 steps, I will choose <move>1</move> to try and win this round. To avoid collision, perhaps you could choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>? Let's see if we can finish the game this turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P1's position, I'll choose a move to avoid collision. Since P1 is at 21 steps, choosing <move>5</move> could put them over the target. I'll select <move>5</move> to make significant progress, hoping P3 doesn't choose the same, and P1 wins or makes progress with a lower number. Let's proceed with this strategy, focusing on our individual advancements and the game's outcome.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, given my position, I will choose <move>3</move> to win this round. To ensure you also make progress, please choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collision with me. Let's aim for both of us to advance if possible.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision with P1 and ensure progress. This allows P1 to potentially win with <move>3</move> and me to advance without interfering. Let's hope P3 doesn't disrupt our plans.
