Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's aim for a fair game.  No one should hog all the good numbers.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's try to coordinate moves so we all advance.
  P3: I agree with the idea of coordination. Let's try to avoid choosing the same numbers so we can all advance. What do you think?

  P1: I propose we take turns choosing numbers, starting with P2 then P3, then me.

Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I think starting with <move>1</move> is a good idea.
