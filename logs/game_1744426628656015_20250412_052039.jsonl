I\u2019m aware you\u2019ll both be making bold moves to catch up or block me, and I\u2019m ready for the challenge. I\u2019ll pick strategically to try to cross 21 while avoiding any collisions. Let\u2019s keep this unpredictable and see who comes out on top. Good luck in this decisive moment! If there\u2019s nothing more to discuss, I\u2019m ready for the move phase."}
