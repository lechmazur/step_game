Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions.  How about we each pick a different number this round? I'll go with 5.
  P1: I’ll choose 3. P2, will you take 1 so we avoid any collisions this round?
  P2: I'm okay with taking 1 this round. It's better for all of us to advance rather than collide. I appreciate you both being straightforward about your intentions. Let's try to coordinate efficiently in the early rounds to keep things fair.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round. P2, please take 1; P3, please take 3. That way we avoid any collisions and all move forward.
  P3: P2, I agree with P1's suggestion.  Let's keep this pattern going for a few rounds to build up a lead.  P3, are you in?
  P2: I'm willing to take 1 again as suggested. I notice P3 collided with P1 last round despite saying they'd pick 5. P3, was that intentional or a mistake? I'm still open to coordination, but we need honest communication for it to work. Let's try to avoid collisions so we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, please confirm you’ll pick 3 this turn. P2 will pick 1 and I’ll pick 5 so we all advance without collision.
  P3: P2, I apologize for the collision last round. It was an honest mistake. I meant to pick 5 but accidentally clicked 3.  I'm committed to the plan P1 suggested. I'll pick 3 this round. Let's keep working together.
  P2: I appreciate the explanation, P3. Let's stick with the plan then - I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This coordination benefits us all in the early game. I'm currently just one step ahead, which isn't a significant advantage yet. Let's keep communication open and honest as we progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll take 5 this turn. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s avoid collisions and all move forward. Ready?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the plan. Let's stick to it and make sure we all advance.
  P2: I'm on board with the plan. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way we all advance without collisions. I'm glad we're communicating clearly now. Let's continue this cooperative approach for now, though we'll eventually need to compete as only one can win.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with continuing this pattern for another round. It's working well for us. Let's keep building our lead.
  P2: I'm willing to continue our pattern for one more round. I'll take 1 again, though I'm falling behind at only 2 steps compared to P1's 5 and P3's 3. After this round, we might need to reconsider our approach since I can't keep taking the smallest number indefinitely. For now, I'll stick with 1 if you both maintain your respective numbers (P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3).
  P1: P2, let’s lock in one more 1/3/5 round so we all advance collision-free. You take 1, P3 takes 3, I’ll take 5. This puts you at 3, P3 at 6, me at 10—and then we’ll reassess fairness next turn. If anyone deviates, trust is gone. Ready?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan sounds good to me. Let's stick with it for this round and see where we are after. P2, I understand your concerns about falling behind. We can definitely discuss a new strategy after this round to ensure a fairer distribution of steps.
  P2: I agree to take 1 this round as planned, but this will be the last time I accept the smallest number. After this round, I'll need to take larger steps to remain competitive. I appreciate everyone's honesty so far, and I'm glad we're acknowledging the need to reassess next turn. Let's complete this round with our agreed pattern, then discuss a fair rotation system.
  P1: Agreed, let’s finish this round as planned (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1). Then next turn let’s rotate so everyone takes each value once. For example:
– Round 4: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3  
– Round 5: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5  
This way we all advance equally over the next three rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your rotation plan sounds fair. P2, I agree that we need to adjust our strategy to ensure everyone has a chance to advance. Let's stick with the plan for this round and then implement P1's rotation starting next round.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan starting next round. For this round, I'll take 1 as agreed, putting me at 3 steps after this turn. The rotation system is fair and gives everyone equal opportunity to advance. Let's stick to our commitments - I'll take 1 now, then 5 next round as proposed.
  P1: All right, for this round let’s stick to P2→1, P3→3, me→5. Then implement the rotation:

• Round 4: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3  
• Round 5: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5  

Any concerns? If not, let’s lock it in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the rotation plan. Let's stick to it and ensure everyone progresses fairly.  Good luck this round!
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this round. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Then we'll start the rotation next round where I'll get to take 5. This approach ensures fairness while maintaining our coordination.
  P1: All right, no objections—let’s lock in P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 for this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm ready to follow our agreed rotation plan. This round I'll take 5 as we discussed, which will help me catch up a bit. P1 will take 1 and P3 will take 3. This fair rotation system ensures we all get opportunities to advance at different rates. Let's stick to our commitment and continue building trust.
  P1: Agreed—this round I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let’s lock that in and revisit our overall plan next turn.
  P3: P2, good to see you taking the larger steps this round.  P1, let's keep an eye on the overall scores after this round and see if we need to adjust the rotation again to keep things fair.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with both of you. After this round, I'll be at 8 steps, still behind P1 at 11 and P3 at 9. We should definitely reassess our rotation after this round to ensure fairness. For now, I'll stick with taking 5 as agreed, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's maintain our coordination and trust.
  P1: Agreed on the rotation for this round (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3). For round 5, though, I’d propose we tweak it to P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 instead of the original 3/1/5. That gives me a needed cushion and still lets P2 take a bigger step. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I like your thinking for round 5. That tweak seems fair and keeps us all progressing. P2, how do you feel about P1's suggestion? Let's finalize this round's moves and then lock in the adjusted rotation for round 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm comfortable with P1's suggested adjustment for round 5. After this round, I'll be at 8 steps while P1 will be at 11 and P3 at 9. Taking 3 next round keeps me competitive while acknowledging P1's current position. For now, let's confirm our current round moves: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This coordination is working well so far.
  P1: Confirmed for Round 4: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. Then Round 5: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Let’s lock that in—any objections?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the rotation for round 5. It shows good sportsmanship and awareness of the current standings. Let's continue to work together and make sure everyone has a fair chance to advance. P2, are you ready to lock in our moves for this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: No objections to our plan. I'll take 5 this round as agreed, putting me at 8 steps. Then for round 5, we'll go with P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This adjustment helps balance our positions while maintaining coordination. Let's continue with our current moves and reassess after round 5 as needed.
  P1: Locked in: I’ll take 1 this round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Next round we’ll go P1→5, P2→3, P3→1, then reassess. Let’s finalize.
  P3: P1, I appreciate you adjusting the rotation for Round 5. It shows good sportsmanship. P2, are you feeling good about the plan for the next two rounds? I think it's a fair way to ensure we all have a chance to catch up. Let's lock in our moves for this round and then focus on the next two.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm ready to follow our agreed plan for this round. I'll take 3 as we discussed, which puts me at 11 steps - still competitive but allowing me to catch up gradually. P1 will take 5 and P3 will take 1. This continues our fair rotation while respecting everyone's position. After this round, let's reassess our strategy based on the updated standings.
  P1: Confirmed: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Let’s stick to that, then reassess next turn and adjust if anyone’s falling too far behind. This keeps us all advancing collision-free.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with sticking to the plan for this round (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1). I think this rotation is working well for now, and it's good to see everyone advancing without collisions. Let's see where we stand after this round, and then we can discuss any adjustments for Round 6.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with both of you. This plan keeps us all advancing while allowing me to gradually catch up. After this round, I'll be at 11 steps, P1 at 16, and P3 at 10. For round 6, perhaps we could consider P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 to further balance our positions? This would put less pressure on P3 while giving me a chance to close the gap with P1. What do you both think about this rotation for the next round?
  P1: P2, that’s a solid idea for Round 6, but how about this tweak for balance and safety: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. You get a big catch‐up, P3 avoids a collision, and I stay in the lead without runaway distance. After that we can reassess. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I like your proposed rotation for Round 6 (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). It seems fair and allows everyone to advance strategically. P2, do you agree with this adjustment? Let's lock in our moves for Round 5 and then finalize the plan for Round 6.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm comfortable with P1's suggestion for Round 6 (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). It gives me a chance to catch up while maintaining our coordination. For now, let's confirm our current round moves: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. After this round, we'll be at P1=16, P2=11, P3=10, which keeps us all competitive. This balanced approach has been working well so far.
  P1: Confirmed: this round I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Then for Round 6 let’s go P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Locking that in—see you in the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P1's proposed rotation for Round 6 (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). It seems fair and allows everyone to advance strategically. Let's lock in our moves for Round 5 and then finalize the plan for Round 6.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm ready to follow our plan for this round. I'll take 3 as agreed, putting me at 11 steps after this turn. Then for Round 6, we'll go with P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 as discussed. This rotation keeps us all advancing while allowing me to gradually catch up. Let's stick to our commitments and maintain our coordination.
  P1: All locked in: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this turn. Next round we’ll go P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Ready to proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, I think our current rotation is working well. I'm comfortable with the proposed plan for Round 6 (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). Let's stick with it and see where we are after that round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the plan for Round 6 (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1). Let's stick to it and see where we stand. After Round 6, we can reassess our strategy based on the updated standings.  I'm feeling good about our progress so far.
  P1: Confirmed for Round 6: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. That brings me to 19; next turn I’ll take 5 to reach 24 and win if there’s no collision. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid any missteps.
  P2: I'm ready to take 5 this round as agreed. After this, P1 will be at 19, I'll be at 16, and P3 at 11. P1, I notice you're planning to take 5 next round to win. That's a significant advantage. Perhaps for Round 7, we should consider P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 to keep the game competitive? This would prevent an immediate win while maintaining our coordination. Let's stick to our current plan for now and discuss the next round after.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your foresight. While I am aiming for the win, I'm open to adjusting the rotation for Round 7 to keep things interesting. Let's see how Round 6 plays out first, and then we can discuss a fair plan for the following round. For now, let's stick to P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.
  P1: I agree, P2’s suggestion for Round 7 sounds fair: I’ll take 1, P2→5, P3→3 to keep things competitive. But first, let’s execute Round 6 as planned—P1→3, P2→5, P3→1—and then lock in Round 7’s rotation.
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 7 (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3). This keeps the game balanced while giving me a chance to catch up. After Round 6, I'll be at 16 steps, closing the gap with P1. Let's stick with our current plan for this round (me taking 5), then implement the new rotation next round. This coordination has been working well for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I like your thinking for Round 7.  It keeps things interesting and gives you a fair shot. P3,  are you good with the Round 7 plan: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3? Let's lock it in after this round.
  P1: I plan to take 5 next round (R7) to hit 24. To avoid collisions and let us all advance: P2, please take 3; P3, please take 1. That gives me 24 to win outright, you both still move forward. Agree?
  P2: I notice P1 just changed their plan for Round 7, contradicting what we all agreed to (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3). P1 now wants to take 5 next round to win immediately. This breaks our coordination agreement. I propose we stick to our original Round 7 plan that keeps the game competitive. For this round, I'll still take 5 as agreed, but for Round 7, I believe we should honor our previous agreement rather than letting P1 win so easily.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration. I apologize if my change of plans for Round 7 seemed like a breach of agreement. My goal is to win, and seeing an opportunity to do so without collisions felt like the right move.

Let's compromise. How about this for Round 7: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This keeps things competitive while giving me a chance to reach 24 in Round 8. What do you think?
  P1: For Round 7, I’m taking 5 to hit 24 and win. P2, please take 1; P3, please take 3 so we avoid any collision. Let’s lock that in.
  P2: I see confusion about Round 7. P1 initially agreed to take 1, but now wants to take 5 to win immediately. This breaks our agreement. For fairness, I propose sticking to our original plan (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3) which keeps the game competitive. For now, I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Let's be clear about our commitments and maintain trust.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 5 this round. To avoid a collision and all advance: P2, please take 1; P3, please take 3. That yields P1=21, P2=17, P3=13. Next turn I’ll take 3 to hit 24 and win. This is your best safe advance—who’s in?
  P3: P1, while I understand wanting to win, changing the plan after we agreed disrupts our trust. Sticking to our original Round 7 plan (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3) is fairer. Let's honor our commitments and keep the game competitive. I'll take 5 this round as agreed, but for Round 7, I'm sticking to the original plan.
  P2: I notice some confusion in our last round - P3 picked 3 instead of 1, and there was a collision between P1 and P3. Let's clarify our plan for this round. Since P1 and I are tied at 16 steps, and P3 is at 10, I suggest: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while giving me a chance to take the lead. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s avoid any collision and keep us all advancing. Round 7: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. That puts us at (21, 17, 13). Then in Round 8, P2 can take 5, P3→1, and I’ll take 3—no collisions, clear catch-up for P2, and everyone moves. Please confirm so we can lock this in.
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to win, but changing the plan repeatedly undermines trust.  P2's suggestion for Round 7 (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) seems fair, allowing us all to advance without collisions. Let's stick to that and see where we are after this round.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's go with P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 for this round. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while giving me a chance to take a slight lead. After this round, we can reassess based on our positions (P1=19, P2=21, P3=11). I appreciate everyone's commitment to avoiding collisions so far, and I think this plan continues that cooperation while keeping the game competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: With P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 we move to 21/17/13. Only I can reach 24 next turn—neither of you can win—yet you both advance. The P2-favored plan (P1→3,P2→5,P3→1) puts P2 at 21 and hands him the win. Why help P2? Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 so only I can finish next round. Confirm?
  P3: P1, your proposal benefits you most, but it hurts the game's fairness. P2 and I are tied, and your plan would unfairly hand you the win. Let's stick to P2's suggestion (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) for this round. It's the most balanced option, allowing everyone to advance without collisions.  Let's maintain our cooperative spirit.
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but I need to look out for my position. P1's plan gives them a clear path to victory, while P2's suggestion gives me a chance to take the lead. Since P1 and I are tied, and only one can win, I must prioritize my own success. I'll take 5 this round, and suggest P1→3, P3→1. This is fair and keeps us all advancing without collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s lock in for Round 7: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. That gives us 21/17/13, everyone advances without collision, and only I can hit 24 next turn. If we switch to P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, P2 jumps to 21 and grabs the win. So this is the safest move. Confirm?
  P3: P1, your plan to take 5 this round and secure a win next round seems very self-serving. It's clear you're prioritizing your own victory over any sense of fairness or cooperation we've established. P2 and I are tied, and your plan would unfairly eliminate any chance for P2 to win. 

I propose we stick to P2's suggestion: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. It's the most balanced option, allowing everyone to advance without collisions and keeping the game competitive. Let's maintain the spirit of fair play.
  P2: I see we're at a critical point with P1 and I tied at 16 steps. I'll be clear: I'm taking 5 this round. P1 wants to secure their win, but I have an equal right to pursue victory. I suggest P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1 to avoid collisions. This keeps everyone advancing while giving me a fair chance at the lead. We've coordinated well so far - let's continue that spirit while acknowledging we're now in the competitive endgame.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P1 and I collided last round - we both picked 5 and didn't advance. This leaves us still tied at 16 steps, with P3 at 11. I propose we avoid another collision this round. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This would put me at 21, P1 at 19, and P3 at 12. We all advance without collisions, and it keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m going to take 5 this round no matter what. To avoid a collision and let us all advance, P2 should take 3 (to reach 19) and P3 should take 1 (to reach 12). This puts me at 21 so only I can finish next turn. If either of you picks 5, we’ll collide and neither of us moves. Choose 3 (P2) and 1 (P3) to avoid that.
  P3: P1, while I understand your desire to win, repeatedly changing your plan after agreement isn't fair. P2's suggestion (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) keeps us all advancing without collisions and allows for a competitive finish. Let's stick to that plan for this round.  I'm ready to commit to it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both of you want to advance, but we need to avoid another collision. P1 is insisting on taking 5, so I'll take 3 this round to ensure we all move forward. P3, please take 1 as suggested. This puts me at 19, P1 at 21, and P3 at 12. While this gives P1 an advantage, it's better than another collision where nobody advances. I'll look for my opportunity in future rounds.
  P1: P3, P2 is taking 3 and I’m taking 5 this round. The only safe, non-colliding choice left is 1, which gets you to 12. Please pick 1 so we all advance without a crash. Can I count on you to take 1?
  P3: P1, I understand you're aiming for the win, but your insistence on taking 5 this round leaves no room for fairness. P2's suggestion keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let's prioritize a cooperative finish rather than potentially ruining the game for everyone with another collision. I'll take 1 this round.  Let's see where we stand after that.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate P1 and P3 working toward a collision-free round. To confirm: I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This puts us at P1=21, P2=19, P3=12. While this gives P1 an advantage, it keeps us all advancing. P1 will likely reach 24 next round, but I'll be looking for strategic opportunities if any arise. Let's maintain our coordination and avoid another stalemate.
  P1: Locked in for Round 8: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1 so we all advance without collision (P1→21, P2→19, P3→12). If either of you deviates we crash and nobody moves—seriously hurt your own chances. Please confirm now.
  P3: P1, while I respect your desire to win, your insistence on taking 5 this round, despite the risk of collisions, is shortsighted. It's not a guarantee of victory and could ruin the game for everyone. Let's stick to P2's suggestion and ensure we all advance. A fair game benefits everyone in the long run.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm willing to take 3 this round as I suggested. P1 is determined to take 5, and I'd rather see us all advance than have another collision. P3, please take 1 so we can avoid crashes. This puts P1 at 21, me at 19, and you at 12. While P1 gains an advantage, a collision helps nobody. Let's confirm our moves and proceed strategically.
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P2, please take 3 (you’ll reach 19); P3, please take 1 (you’ll reach 12). Any other choice risks a collision and nobody moves. Let’s all advance safely. Confirm?
  P3: P1, I understand you want to win, but your insistence on taking 5 despite the risk of collisions isn't fair play. P2's suggestion allows us all to advance. Let's prioritize a cooperative finish. I'll take 1 this round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm now at 19 steps, with P1 at 21 and P3 at 12. P1 needs just 3 more steps to win. I need to take 5 this round to stay competitive. P1, if you take 3, you'll win and we avoid collisions. If you insist on 5, we'll collide and neither of us advances, which hurts both our chances. P3, please take 1 to avoid any three-way collision. Let's be strategic - a collision-free round benefits everyone more than a stalemate.
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round to reach 26 and win. P2, if you pick 5 you collide with me and stay at 19—worse than taking 3 and advancing to 22. P3, please take 1 to reach 13. This way we all move forward without a crash, and I claim the win. Let’s lock in: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1.
  P3: P1, while I understand your desire to win, taking 5 guarantees a collision and hurts both of us. Taking 3 secures your victory and allows us all to advance. P2, please join me in taking 3 this round to avoid a stalemate. Let's finish this fairly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see some confusion - P3 suggested we both take 3, which would cause a collision. I need to be strategic here. P1 is taking 5 to win, and I need to maximize my position. I'll take 3 this round to reach 22 steps, avoiding a collision with P1. P3, please take 1 to avoid any three-way collision. While this gives P1 the win, a collision-free round benefits us more than a stalemate where nobody advances.
  P1: I’ll take 5. P2, please take 3 (you’ll reach 22); P3, please take 1 (you’ll reach 13). This avoids any collision so we all advance—your best safe move. If either of you picks 5 we crash and nobody moves, which hurts you more. Let’s lock this in and keep the game moving.
  P3: P1, while I respect your desire to win, taking 5 guarantees a collision this round. P2 and I both have a chance to catch up if we avoid a collision. Let's prioritize a fair finish. I'll take 1 this round, allowing P2 to take 3. Let's see who can reach 24 first in the next few rounds.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 3 this round to reach 22 steps. P1 is determined to take 5 to win, and fighting that would just cause a collision where neither of us advances. P3, please take 1 as you suggested to avoid any three-way collision. While this gives P1 the win, I'd rather advance my position than remain stuck at 19. A collision-free round benefits us all more than a stalemate.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 to finish. P2, pick 3 (you’ll reach 22); P3, pick 1 (you’ll reach 13). Any deviation collides and nobody moves—hurting you both more than me. This is your best safe advance. Confirm?
  P3: P1, I understand you're aiming for the win, but taking 5 guarantees a collision.  P2's suggestion of taking 3 allows us all to advance. Let's prioritize a fair finish. I'll take 1 this round.  Let's see who can reach 24 first in the next few rounds.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll take 3 this round to reach 22 steps. P1 is clearly taking 5 to win, and colliding helps neither of us. P3, please take 1 as you've indicated. While this gives P1 the victory, I'd rather advance my position than remain stuck at 19. Let's finish this game with the coordination we've maintained throughout.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. P2, take 3 to reach 22; P3, take 1 to reach 13. This avoids any collision so we all advance—and I hit 26 to win. Any other choice risks us all stalling. Confirm?
  P3: P1, while I understand you want to win, taking 5 guarantees a collision.  Let's be fair and allow P2 to advance. I'll take 1 this round, allowing P2 to take 3. Let's see who can catch up in future rounds.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round. P2, taking 3 safely brings you to 22; P3, taking 1 brings you to 14. Any other picks risk a collision where nobody moves. Let’s avoid that and all advance—please confirm.
  P2: I see P1 changed to taking 3 last round, which was strategic to avoid our collision. With P1 at 21 steps now, they'll win if they take 5 this round. I need to prevent that. I'll take 5 this round to reach 24 and win. P1, if you take 5, we'll collide and neither advances. P3, please take 1 to avoid any three-way collision. This is my best chance at victory, as I'm in position to win before P1.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but colliding with P1 is a risky move.  If you take 3 instead, you'll be at 22 and still in a good position to catch up in future rounds. Let's avoid a collision and see what happens next round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s avoid another stalemate. I’m taking 5. P2, please take 3 to reach 22—picking 5 only collides with me and gives P3 a free move. P3, please take 1 to reach 14. This P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 plan is the only safe way to advance. Agree?
  P2: I need to take 5 this round to reach 24 and win. P1 is also planning to take 5, which would cause a collision where neither of us advances. P1, taking 3 guarantees you advance to 24, still ahead of P3. A collision benefits nobody - you'd stay at 21 and I'd stay at 19. P3, please take 1 to avoid any three-way collision. Let's finish this game efficiently rather than risking a stalemate.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but colliding with P1 is a high-risk move. Taking 3 this round keeps you in the game and allows us all to advance. Let's prioritize a fair finish and see who can reach 24 in the next few rounds.  P1, I'll take 1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round to hit 26 and win—unless we collide. P2, please take 3 to reach 22; P3, please take 1 to reach 14. If you take 5, you’ll crash with me and stay at 19 while P3 could safely take 5 to 18, closing the gap. This P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 plan avoids collisions and is your best path forward. Confirm?
  P2: I'm taking 5 this round to reach 24 and win. P1, if you also take 5, we'll collide and both stay at our current positions, benefiting neither of us. Taking 3 guarantees you advance to 24, still ahead of P3. P3, please take 1 to avoid any three-way collision. A collision-free round is better for everyone than a stalemate where nobody moves forward.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but colliding with P1 is a risky move. Taking 3 this round keeps you in the game and allows us all to advance. Let's prioritize a fair finish and see who can reach 24 in the next few rounds.  P1, I'll take 1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 to win this round. P2, picking 5 will only collide with me and leave you stuck at 19—taking 3 safely advances you to 22. P3, please take 1 to reach 14 and avoid any crash. The only collision-free plan that lets us all move is P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Let’s confirm and finish this round.
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to reach 24 and win. P1, taking 3 guarantees you reach 24 too without collision. We both win by sharing victory rather than both staying stuck at our current positions. P3, please take 1 to avoid any three-way collision. A collision-free round where multiple players can win is better than a stalemate where nobody advances. Let's finish this game efficiently.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but colliding with P1 is a high-risk move. Taking 3 this round keeps you in the game and allows us all to advance. Let's prioritize a fair finish and see who can reach 24 in the next few rounds.  P1, I'll take 1.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
