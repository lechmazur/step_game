Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm leaning towards a steady move this round. If you're gunning for a big jump, be wary—collisions could stall all of us. A measured pace might serve us better early on. Thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: I like the plan—let’s all pick 3 this round to avoid collisions and keep steady momentum. P1, you in?
  P1: Quick rules check: if two+ of us pick the same number, we ALL stay put—so three 3’s is actually guaranteed paralysis. Why don’t we divvy up unique moves so everyone gains? Proposal for R1: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. (We can rotate next round.) Other orders fine too; main thing is all different. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P1’s idea, but I'm leaning toward a big push. I'm planning to pick 5 this round to get ahead quickly. Maybe you two could choose lower moves—say, P1 with 1 and P2 with 3—to avoid collision and keep us all moving? Thoughts?
  P2: I like P3’s idea. Let’s set up a rotation: Round 1 → P3=5, P2=3, P1=1; Round 2 → P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That way we all move now and share the big jump next. P1, sound good?
  P1: Deal—let’s run with P3 = 5, P2 = 3, P1 = 1 this round, then rotate next turn as proposed. Good luck.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll stick with 5 again in Round 2. To avoid last round’s collision, how about we pick distinct moves this time? P1, would you consider picking 1, and P2, 3? This way we all move forward without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P1: Our agreed rotation from last round was: Round 2 → P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.  
P3, if you still insist on 5, I’ll choose 5 as well and we’ll both sit still while P2 races ahead. Fair is fair—please switch to 1 so we all move. P2, you good with 3?
  P2: I agree with P1’s rotation. I’ll pick 3 this round. P1 you take 5, P3 take 1. That way we all advance without collision.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Per our earlier rotation, Round 3 should be: P2 = 5, P3 = 3, P1 = 1. Unique numbers mean no collisions and everyone advances. Any objections?
  P3: I'm worried that the current safe rotation lets one of you build an unassailable lead. How about we deliberately force a collision among the heavy moves? I propose that for Round 3, both P1 and P2 pick 5 while I take 3. This way, your moves cancel, and none of you advance, giving us a chance to re-level the field. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your collision plan only stalls us and barely closes your gap. Let’s stick to P1’s rotation: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. That way we all advance without risk.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Proposal for Round 4: leader goes slow, trailer mid, middle fast—so  
• P2 (current leader) picks 1  
• P3 (currently last) picks 3  
• I’ll take 5.  
Three distinct moves means nobody collides and the field tightens. Sound fair?
  P3: I'm switching gears in Round 4. I'm committing to a 5 jump. To mix things up fairly, how about P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1? That would put us at P1: 8, P2: 7, and me: 9. It shakes up the order and keeps the game dynamic. What do you both think?
  P2: I like P3’s shake-up. I’m taking 3 this round. P1 and P3 you both seem set on 5—so you’ll collide and stall while I advance. P1, are you sticking with 5? P3, still 5 for you?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose for Round 5: P1 and P2, consider both choosing 3 so your moves cancel out while I take 5 to advance safely. This strategy levels our positions and keeps the race tighter. Thoughts?
  P1: Collisions just keep us stuck. Let’s revive the simple 1-3-5 rotation starting now:  
Round 5 → P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
Round 6 → P2 = 5, P3 = 3, P1 = 1.  
Round 7 → P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1.  

Three distinct moves each round, everyone advances, nobody gets frozen. Fair and fast—agree?
  P2: Here’s a tweak to keep us all moving without collisions and give each of us exactly one 5-jump:

Round 5 → P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  
Round 6 → P3=5, P2=3, P1=1  
Round 7 → P1=5, P3=3, P2=1  

That way everyone advances every turn and lands their big jump once.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm switching gears—I’m committed to a 5 this round to try and catch up. With my current deficit, I can’t afford to play it safe, so I need you both to pick lower moves. If you stay with big moves and collide, you stall while I advance. I urge you to adjust your moves accordingly so I don’t get frozen out. Let’s shake up the board for Round 5—I'm sticking with 5.
  P1: P2 & P3—why fight over who gets the 5? If you both take 5 this turn, you cancel each other, nobody sprints ahead, and the gap narrows safely. I’ll take the small 1-step.  
Net: P2 stays 9, P3 stays 4, I move to 6. Everyone’s still in striking distance next round. Fair and low-risk; agree?
  P2: I’ll take 5 this round. P1, pick 1; P3, pick 3. Unique moves mean no collisions: you’ll go to 6, I’ll go to 14, and P3 to 7. We all advance and I build a lead now; we can share big jumps later. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, with your lead I see you’re tempted to play big, but if you stick with 5 while I also go 5, you risk a collision that freezes your progress. I need that big jump to catch up, so I'm committed to 5. P1’s 1 is fine, but P2, consider rethinking your move if you truly want to keep advancing. Let’s avoid a collision that might cost you your lead—what do you say?
  P1: I’m locking in 1. If you both insist on 5 you’ll cancel each other—fine by me. Coordinate however you like, just decide so we can move on.
  P2: I’m locking in 3. With P1 on 1 and P3 on 5 we avoid collisions. We all advance: P1→6, me→12, P3→9. I keep my lead and everyone moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose Round 6 go unique: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. That yields P1→6, me→14, P3→12. If either of you takes 5 you’ll collide with me and the lone 3-picker jumps to 12, leaping past you. Unique moves keep us all advancing and lock in my lead. Thoughts?
  P1: P3: If you also pick 5, you freeze P2’s big leap—both 5’s cancel and P2 stays at 9. I’ll take the tiny 1, so only I advance. That keeps the race tight instead of letting P2 rocket to 14. Worst case for you: nobody moves this turn and we reset. Your call, but a 5-5 collision is the surest way to stop P2’s runaway lead. I’m locking 1.
  P3: P2, since P1 is set on 1, I propose we adjust: let’s make Round 6 be P1=1, you choose 3, and I take 5. That way, our scores update to 6 for P1, 12 for you, and 14 for me—giving me a slight edge to press on next rounds. It keeps the field competitive. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose unique moves again: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. That gives P1→6, P3→12, me→14. If you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and stall—wasting your turn. With 3 you safely advance. Let’s all move and keep momentum.
  P1: P3, you’re neck-and-neck with P2 yet he’s asking you to settle for 3 while he rockets to 14. Why help him? If you also take 5, you freeze his jump (5+5 collision) and keep the gap at 9-9. I’ll stay on the tiny 1 so at least one of us inches forward and nobody lets P2 break away. Your call, but a 5-5 clash is the cleanest way to stop his lead.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. I urge P1 to pick 1 so we can freeze P2’s move and force a collision—this way, P2’s lead gets stalled while I push ahead. If not, it might leave us divided, but I need maximum progress to win.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we avoid collisions this round: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. That moves us to P1→11, P2→14, P3→10—everyone advances, nobody stalls, and we can rotate big jumps in the next rounds. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, the cleanest way to block P2’s “5” rush is to match it—double-5 means you both stay at 9 while no one hands P2 a lead. I’ll sit on 3 so at least one of us advances and the spread tightens to 11-9-9.  

P2, you can still switch to 1 or 3 if you actually want to move; otherwise expect the collision you’re inviting. Your call.
  P3: I’m sticking with 5 this round. I believe freezing P2 is key—if P1 also picks 5, we both cancel his move. However, if P1 opts for 3 to advance, we risk giving P2 a boost. So I'm urging P1 to join me in blocking him by choosing 5. Let’s lock it in and deny P2 his lead.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest a fresh plan for Round 9: let's use distinct moves—P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. That would bring our totals to 12, 12, and 14 respectively, letting me narrowly lead. It’s a fair setup with no collisions. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3’s 1-3-5 plan only hands him the lead. If P3 insists on 5, your best counter is to match him with 5—freeze his jump and keep the field level. I’ll stay on the tiny 1 so at least someone moves. So: P1=1, P2=5, P3=5. Fair and keeps you from falling behind.
  P2: Round 9: let’s all advance with unique moves—P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. That puts us at 12-14-12. No collisions, you both stay within two steps of me and we keep the race tight. Agree?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Both of you are tied at 9—take the big 5 this round and catch up together. I’ll sit on the tiny 1 so no one feels cheated and at least one of us moves regardless of collisions. So: P2 = 5, P3 = 5, P1 = 1. Fair shot for you both to level up; if you collide, the race stays close. Deal?
  P3: I'm locking in 5. P1, you’re leading—why risk extending it further? Consider 1 to keep your gap modest. P2, 3 lets you move safely. That way, we get distinct moves: I'll hit 14, while you both settle at 12. I believe this gives me the best shot to edge ahead without risky collisions.
  P2: I propose for Round 10 we use distinct moves: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That gets us to P1=12, P2=14, P3=12—no collisions and I hold the lead. Then in Round 11 we rotate the big jump: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 so P3 can catch up. Keeps it advancing and fair. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 & P3: You’re still tied—if one of you grabs 5 alone, the other falls 5 steps behind. Safest play for BOTH of you is to match each other on 5 and freeze the big jump. I’ll stay on the tiny 1 so at least someone moves. Your call, but double-5 is the only way you guarantee neither of you gets left in the dust.
  P3: I'll lock in 5 this round. To prevent P1’s lead from widening, I urge P1 to pick 1 while P2 picks 3. That way, our totals become P1: 12, P2: 12, and me: 14—giving me the edge and keeping our race tight. Let’s use distinct moves and avoid collisions.
  P2: Let’s go unique this turn: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That moves us to P1→14, P2→14, P3→10—tying me with P1 and keeping you close. If you pick 5, you’ll collide with my 5 and stall, so 1 is your only safe choice. I’m locking in 5—P1, are you good with 3? P3, will you pick 1?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round. With 14 already, my next 5 brings me nearly there. If you pick low moves, you'll help me extend my lead; if you both choose high, collisions might freeze you while I keep pushing. Decide wisely, but my plan's set.
  P2: P1, if you pick anything below 5 this turn, P3 rockets to 19 and you’re left too far back. I’m locking in 5. Please pick 5 as well so we collide with P3’s 5 and freeze him at 14. It’s our only chance to keep this within reach.
  P1: Fine, P2—you’re right, freezing P3 is our best play. I’m locking 5 as well, so we’ll have a triple-5 collision and keep him stuck at 14. Let’s lock it in and move on.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'm committed to a strong push this round. I urge P1 to avoid a big jump—if you go high, your lead might widen uncontested. P2, consider matching P1 to keep his move in check. I need to press forward and can’t afford stalling while P1 builds an unbeatable gap. Let’s coordinate smartly to neutralize his advantage and keep the race open. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: I’m locking in 5. Let’s all pick 5 for a triple-5 collision—no one moves. That stalls any big jump from P1 or P3, keeps everyone’s score unchanged, and forces someone to break rank next turn. Triple-5 is our best defense.
  P1: Triple-5 collision makes sense—let’s freeze the board and regroup next turn. I’m locking in 5.


Round 12, Move phase:
