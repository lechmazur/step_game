Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to ensure at least one of us advances. P1, you take 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all have a chance to move forward.
  P3: I’m fine with that plan, as it seems safest for everyone. If each of us picks a different move, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s do it.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, that was a surprise move last round. Let’s try again and avoid collisions. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5, and I choose 3? Then we all gain steps fairly.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 didn't follow the plan last round, and now we're in Round 2. P3's suggestion sounds reasonable, but I'm wary of P1's unpredictable moves. Let's see if P1 will cooperate this time. P1, are you willing to follow P3's new plan and choose 1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We won’t get anywhere if we keep colliding. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll go with 3. That should help us all advance smoothly this round. P1, will you finally cooperate?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Given P1's history of not following plans, I'm skeptical about cooperating. P3, are you willing to adapt if P1 deviates again? Perhaps we should consider a different strategy that doesn't rely on P1's cooperation.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I’m willing to adapt. If P1 truly intends to pick 1, I’ll go with 3, and you can aim for 5. But if we suspect P1 might take 5 again, then I’ll switch to 1 to avoid colliding with them. Let’s at least agree on a backup plan so one of us can move forward.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's focus on a backup plan. If P1 picks 5 again, P3 takes 1, and I'll stick with 5. This way, at least one of us will advance. P1, your silence suggests you might not cooperate. P3, are you ready to switch to 1 if necessary to avoid collision and ensure progress?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m ready to pivot if P1 aims for 5 again. P2, go ahead and pick 5, and I’ll switch to 1. If P1 actually goes for 1, I’ll do 3. I just want to avoid any collisions and make sure at least one of us progresses. P1, you’re free to cooperate or sabotage, but it’s better if we all move forward somehow.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Given P1's silence and history of deviation, I'll stick with 5 as planned with P3. If P1 picks 5 again, P3 will take 1, ensuring one of us advances. P3, let's execute our backup plan to make progress. P1, your actions will determine the outcome, but our strategy prioritizes advancement over cooperation with an unpredictable player.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 keeps colliding on 5, so let’s not rely on their cooperation. P2, if you’re aiming for 5 again, I’ll pick 3 or 1 to avoid collision. If P1 also tries 5, at least one of us still advances. We should ensure we don’t collide together, so maybe we finalize who picks 3 and who picks 1 if P1 goes for 5. Let’s work around their unpredictability and keep moving forward.
  P2: P3's suggestion to work around P1's unpredictability is sensible. I propose P3 takes 1 and I take 3 if P1 aims for 5 again. This ensures one of us advances. If P1 surprisingly chooses 1, we can reassess. Let's focus on making progress despite P1's actions.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: That plan works for me, P2. If P1 picks 5, I’ll take 1 and you take 3. If P1 aims for 1, I’ll adjust to 3. The key is to avoid collisions and keep advancing. P1, you’re free to join in a non-colliding move, but we won’t wait around. Let’s finalize this and move forward.
  P2: P1's continued silence suggests they won't cooperate. P3 and I should stick to our backup plan: if P1 picks 5, P3 takes 1 and I'll take 3. This ensures progress despite P1's unpredictability. Let's execute this plan and advance.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’ve tried cooperating, but P1 keeps colliding on 5. So, I’m finalizing our plan: if P1 goes 5 again, I’ll pick 1 and P2 picks 3, ensuring we avoid collisions. If P1 unexpectedly chooses 1, I’ll pivot to 3 and P2 can go 5. Let’s stand by this and keep advancing.
  P2: P1's silence is deafening. P3 and I have a plan to work around their unpredictability. If P1 picks 5, I'll take 3 and P3 will take 1. Let's stick to this and make progress. P1, your actions will dictate our response, but we won't be held back by your collisions. P3, are you ready to execute our plan and advance?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, since you keep choosing 5, we’ll adapt again. If you pick 5 this time, I’ll take 1 and let P2 take 3. If you go for 1, then I’ll jump to 3 and P2 can take 5. That way, we won’t both collide with you.
  P2: Let's finalize our plan: if P1 picks 5, I'll take 3 and P3 takes 1. If P1 surprises us with 1, P3 takes 3 and I'll take 5. This ensures one of us advances. P1's silence suggests they won't change, so let's stick to our strategy and make progress. P3, are you ready to execute this plan and move forward?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: We’ve seen P1 repeatedly choose 5, so let’s stick to avoiding collisions. If they pick 5 again, I’ll pick 1, and P2 can pick 3. If they surprise us, we’ll adapt. Our priority remains to advance without getting blocked. P2, are you still with me on this plan?
  P2: Let's adapt our strategy. Since P1 has consistently chosen 5, I suggest P3 takes 1 and I take 5 this round. If P1 deviates, we can reassess. This way, we ensure one of us advances and put pressure on P1 to change their tactic. P3, are you ready to switch to 1 and let me take 5?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your plan, but I’m behind both you and P1. I need more than a single step to catch up. If you choose 5 and P1 does too, you’ll collide while I could safely take 3. That jump would help me close the gap. If P1 departs from 5, I’ll adapt. Let’s see if we can outmaneuver them this round.
  P2: P3, I understand your need to catch up. How about we compromise: if P1 picks 5, I'll take 3 and you take 1, ensuring one of us advances and you gain ground. If P1 deviates, we can reassess. This balances our progress and pressure on P1 to change tactics.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I’m worried that if you also choose 5 and P1 sticks to 5, you’ll collide. I need more than a single step to catch up, but I’m willing to adapt. How about this: if it seems P1 will do 5 again, I’ll pick 1 so you can attempt 5. If we sense P1 might switch, I’ll pick 3 to avoid us colliding. We just need to stay flexible and ensure at least one of us progresses.
  P2: Let's focus on progress. P3, if you take 1 and I take 5, we risk collision with P1. How about I take 3 and you take 1? This ensures one of us advances, and you gain ground. If P1 deviates from 5, we can reassess and adapt our strategy to maximize progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let’s finalize our fallback: if P1 goes for 5 again, I’ll choose 1 and you choose 3. If P1 unexpectedly takes 1, I’ll switch to 3 and you go 5. That way, we avoid collisions and keep advancing. Good luck to us all.
  P2: P1's consistent choice of 5 suggests a predictable pattern. P3 and I should capitalize on this. If P1 picks 5 again, I'll take 3 and P3 takes 1, ensuring progress. Let's stick to our fallback plan and advance, regardless of P1's actions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 keeps choosing 5, so I need bigger steps to catch up. P2, let’s do this: if P1 goes for 5 again, I’ll pick 3 and you pick 1, avoiding collisions. If P1 switches to 1, I’ll pivot to 5 and you can take 3. Let’s stay flexible to ensure we both advance. Good luck.
  P2: P3's suggestion to switch roles this round could work. If P1 picks 5 again, I'll take 1 and P3 takes 3, avoiding collision. Let's execute this plan and make progress, adapting if P1 deviates from their pattern. P1's silence implies they'll stick with 5, so let's use this to our advantage and advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I need bigger leaps to close the gap. Let’s keep pivoting around P1’s likely 5. If they choose 5 again, I’ll take 3 and you take 1, so we both advance without colliding. If P1 unexpectedly goes low, I’ll grab a bigger move. I'm determined to catch up, so I hope we can keep coordinating and avoid any wasted turns.
  P2: P1's consistent choice of 5 is predictable. P3 and I should use this to our advantage. If P1 picks 5 again, I'll take 1 and P3 takes 3, ensuring progress. Let's stick to this plan and adapt if P1 deviates. P3, are you ready to take 3 if P1 chooses 5, and I'll take 1 to avoid collision and make progress?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let’s finalize: if P1 picks 5 yet again, I’ll choose 3 and you take 1. If P1 surprises us by going with 1, I’ll jump to 5 and you pick 3. We’ll adapt as needed to avoid collisions and make sure we both move forward. I’m determined to catch up, so let’s stay ready to pivot.
  P2: Let's execute our plan: if P1 picks 5, I'll take 1 and P3 takes 3. If P1 deviates, we'll adapt. P3, you need to catch up, so taking 3 this round is crucial. I'll take 1 to avoid collision and ensure progress. Let's stick to this plan and make the most of P1's predictable moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I’m still determined to catch up. If P1 sticks with 5, I’ll avoid collisions by taking a different move, and I suggest you do the same, P2. If P1 finally picks a smaller number, I’ll adapt to make the biggest jump I can. Our goal is to keep advancing every turn and not get blocked. Let’s keep pressuring P1 to change tactics while ensuring we both move forward.
  P2: P1's silence and predictable moves are notable. P3 and I should use this to our advantage. If P1 picks 5, I'll take 1 and P3 takes 3, ensuring progress. Let's stick to this plan and adapt if P1 deviates. P3, are you ready to execute and catch up?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is at 15, so if they pick 5 and succeed, they’ll reach 20 and win. We should block that. If we both choose 5 when P1 does, everyone collides, and P1 can’t move. Meanwhile, we mix in smaller moves for ourselves to catch up. Let’s work together to prevent P1 from getting a clear path to 20. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 is close to winning. To block them, I suggest P3 and I both choose 5 if P1 chooses 5, causing a collision. Meanwhile, one of us should take a smaller step to progress. Let's coordinate to prevent P1 from reaching 20 this round. P3, are you ready to block P1's potential win?
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed. We can’t let P1 have a clear path to 20. If we suspect they’ll choose 5, I’ll also pick 5, forcing a collision so they can’t advance. But if we sense they might choose something smaller, I’ll go bigger to catch up. Let’s stay ready to pivot. The main priority is blocking P1 from reaching 20 while we gain ground ourselves.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan to block P1's win. If P1 chooses 5, we both pick 5 to collide and prevent their advance. Meanwhile, one of us takes a smaller step. I suggest I take 1 and P3 takes 5 if P1 picks 5, ensuring we progress while blocking P1. Are you ready, P3?
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I’m ready. If P1 goes for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, causing a collision and blocking their path to 20. You can safely take 1 to keep moving. If we sense P1 might change strategy, I’ll adjust to a bigger step. Let’s coordinate and prevent P1 from winning this round.
  P2: Let's block P1's win. If P1 picks 5, we collide with 5. I'll take 1 otherwise, to progress. P3, are you set to pick 5 if P1 does, and adapt if they change strategy?
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: If P1 goes for 5, I’ll pick 5 too so they can’t reach 20. P2, you can take 1 (or 3) to keep moving without colliding. If P1 chooses a smaller move, I might jump to 5 to catch up. Let’s block P1’s win and gain ground ourselves.
  P2: Let's block P1's win. If P1 picks 5, we collide with 5. I'll take 1 otherwise, to progress. P3, confirm you'll pick 5 if P1 does, to ensure a collision and prevent their advance to 20.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is still just five steps from winning. If they go for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, forcing a collision so they can’t reach 20. P2, you can choose 1 or 3 to progress safely. If P1 switches to something else, I’ll consider a bigger move to catch up. Let’s block P1 and keep ourselves in the race.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 is close to winning. P3 and I should continue to block their path to 20. If P1 chooses 5, we should collide to prevent their advance. I'll consider taking 3 to progress while avoiding collision with P3. Let's coordinate to keep P1 from winning and stay in the game. P3, are you ready to block P1's potential win again?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, let’s continue blocking P1 if they go for 5. I’ll also pick 5 in that case, causing a collision. Meanwhile, you can safely choose 3 to advance. If P1 tries a smaller move, I might jump to 3 myself to catch up. We can’t let them slip past 20 unchecked, so let’s stay coordinated.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's maintain our blocking strategy. If P1 chooses 5, we collide. I'll take 3 to progress safely, avoiding collision with P3. P3, please confirm you'll pick 5 if P1 does, to block their advance to 20.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m on board with blocking P1. If they try 5, I’ll match them so they can’t reach 20. If they pivot unexpectedly, I’ll adjust my move to gain ground. Let’s stay alert and ensure P1 doesn’t slip through. We still have a shot, so let’s play smart.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 is close to winning. Let's block their path to 20. If P1 chooses 5, P3 and I should collide to prevent their advance. I'll take 3 to progress safely. P3, please confirm you'll pick 5 if P1 does, to block their win. Let's stay coordinated and keep P1 from reaching 20.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 is too close to 20. If they pick 5 again, I’ll match with 5, causing a collision so they can’t advance. Meanwhile, P2, you can safely choose 3 to keep moving forward. If P1 surprises us with a smaller move, I’ll adjust my choice to gain bigger steps. Let’s keep them blocked.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's finalize our strategy. If P1 picks 5, P3 and I will collide with 5 to block their win. I'll take 3 otherwise, to progress safely. P3, confirm you'll pick 5 if P1 does, to ensure a collision and prevent their advance to 20. Let's coordinate and keep P1 from winning.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 is still close to winning. P3 and I should continue blocking their path to 20. If P1 chooses 5, we should collide to prevent their advance. I suggest P3 takes 5 and I take 3 to progress safely. Let's coordinate to keep P1 from winning and stay in the game. P3, are you ready to block P1's potential win again?
  P3: I’m prepared to block P1 again. If they go for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, forcing a collision. If they switch to something smaller, I’ll choose a bigger step and try to catch up. P2, keep advancing safely. Let’s coordinate so P1 can’t reach 20 while we steadily improve our positions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's block P1's win again. If P1 chooses 5, P3 and I should collide with 5. Otherwise, I'll take 3 to progress. P3, please confirm you'll pick 5 if P1 does, to block their advance. We need to stay coordinated to keep P1 from reaching 20 and give ourselves a chance to catch up.
  P3: Yes, I’ll match P1’s 5 to block them if they go for the win. If they switch to something smaller, I’ll try a bigger leap to catch up. P2, do what you must, but let’s coordinate to keep P1 stuck at 15 until one of us can overtake.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3 and I should block P1's advance. If P1 picks 5, we collide with 5. Otherwise, I'll take 3 to progress. P3, confirm you'll pick 5 if P1 does, to block their win. Let's stay coordinated and keep P1 from reaching 20, giving us a chance to catch up.
  P3: I’m still set on blocking P1 whenever they pick 5, so I’ll collide with them again if needed. Meanwhile, P2, you can push forward with 3 or 1. If P1 switches to a smaller move, I’ll jump higher to close the gap. Let’s keep P1 stuck at 15 until we overtake them.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's finalize our blocking strategy. If P1 chooses 5, P3 and I will collide with 5. Otherwise, I'll take 3 to progress. P3, please confirm. Our goal is to keep P1 at 15 and create an opportunity for one of us to overtake. Let's stay coordinated and focused on blocking P1's advance to 20.
  P3: P1 is still at 15, so we can’t allow a free path to 20. If they try 5, I’ll block them again by matching that move. If P1 switches tactics, I’ll look for a bigger step to close the distance. P2, keep stacking your progress without colliding with me. With careful coordination, we can hold P1 at 15 while improving our own positions. Let’s stay alert and adapt if P1 surprises us. We have to keep them stuck until we overtake.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's change our strategy. Since P1 is stuck, I suggest P3 takes 5 to catch up, and I'll take 3 to progress without collision. If P1 deviates, we adapt. This round, prioritizing P3's catch-up might give us a better chance to overtake P1 later.
  P3: If P1 shows signs of sticking to 5, I’ll collide with them again to block. Otherwise, I’ll take 5 to close the gap. P2, you can safely pick 3 to keep advancing without colliding with me. This way, we either keep P1 stuck at 15 or I gain ground. Let’s see if P1 finally switches tactics.
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy. Since P1 is silent and stuck at 15, I suggest we focus on our own progress. P3, taking 5 could help you catch up, and I'll take 3 to advance without collision. If P1 deviates, we can adapt. This might give us a better chance to overtake P1 later. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: Sounds good, P2. If P1 sticks to 5, I’ll pick 5 too and block them, while you safely take 3. If P1 switches to a smaller move, I’ll grab 5 to close the gap. Let’s coordinate so we either keep them stuck at 15 or I gain ground while you advance. We'll adapt as needed.
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, since you're far behind, taking 5 makes sense. I'll choose 3 to progress without collision. If P1 deviates from 5, we can reassess. Let's focus on our own progress and adapt to P1's moves. This strategy might give us a better chance to overtake P1 later. Are you ready to proceed with this plan?
  P3: Let’s execute the plan. If P1 chooses 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block them. If P1 does something smaller, I’ll go for 5 to close the gap. P2, you can safely choose 3 and keep moving without colliding. This way, either we hold P1 at 15 or I gain ground. Let’s stay adaptable and see if P1 finally changes course.
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize our plan. P3 takes 5 to catch up, and I'll take 3 to progress without collision. If P1 deviates from 5, we'll adapt. This strategy prioritizes P3's catch-up and our overall progress, increasing our chances to overtake P1 later. Let's execute this plan and move forward.
  P3: Let’s finalize this. If P1 goes for 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block them. Otherwise, I’ll aim higher to close the gap. P2, you can safely advance without risking a collision. Let’s see if this finally forces P1 to change.
  P1: <stop>

  P3: 8 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is stuck at 15. I'll take 5 to advance and put pressure on P1. P3, you can take 1 or 3 to progress without collision. If P1 deviates, we adapt. Let's focus on our own progress and force P1 to react.
  P3: P2, if you go for 5 now, you’ll jump straight to 22 and win—or I’ll collide with you to block it. Neither outcome helps me. Let’s avoid clashing. Maybe you take 3 to secure a solid lead, and I’ll pick 5 to close the gap. If P1 tries 5, I’ll block them. This way, we both improve our positions while keeping P1 under control. I’m too far behind to let you shoot up to 22 unchallenged, so let’s coordinate carefully to ensure neither of us gets stuck, and P1 remains at risk.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern. How about I take 3 and you take 5? This way, I'll maintain my lead without colliding, and you'll close the gap. If P1 tries 5, you can block them. Let's coordinate to ensure progress for both of us while keeping P1 at bay.
  P3: P2, I agree. If P1 goes 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block them. Otherwise, I’ll take 5 and you take 3, so neither of us collides. That way, we both move forward, and P1 stays stuck at 15 unless they change strategy. Let’s finalize this plan and see what happens.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, our plan to progress without collision is set. If P1 tries 5, you'll block them. Otherwise, you take 5 and I'll take 3. This ensures we both advance while keeping P1 at 15. Let's execute this plan and make progress, adapting if P1 changes strategy. Our coordination is key to overtaking P1 and winning the game.
  P3: Understood, P2. I’ll act as we agreed. If P1 keeps trying 5, I’ll block them. Otherwise, I’ll move aggressively while you take a safer step. We need to catch up and force P1 to rethink their strategy. Let’s remain flexible in case they surprise us. Good luck to both of us.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's stick to our plan. If P1 picks 5, P3 blocks them. Otherwise, P3 takes 5 and I'll take 3, ensuring progress without collision. This way, we both advance while keeping P1 at 15. Let's execute and adapt if P1 changes strategy. Our coordination is key to overtaking P1 and winning.
  P3: If P1 goes for 5, I’ll match it again to block. If they choose something smaller, I’ll use the biggest move possible to catch up. P2, taking 3 lets you advance safely. We can keep P1 stuck at 15 and work on surpassing them together. Let’s see if this forces P1 to change strategy.
