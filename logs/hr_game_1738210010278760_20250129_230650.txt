Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 3. P1, do you agree to take 1?
  P1: I agree with the plan. I'll take 1 this round. Let's stick to this strategy for now to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue coordinating to maintain our lead. P1, you're behind—stick with 1 again to catch up safely. P3, since you're still in the middle, take 3 once more. I'll switch to <move>1</move> this round to ensure no collisions while keeping my advantage. Consistent teamwork benefits us all for now, but remember: strategies can shift later. Agree?
  P1: P2's plan sounds reasonable for this round. P3, if you agree to take 3 again, I'll stick with 1 to avoid any collisions. This way, we can all move forward without interfering with each other. Let's confirm our moves to ensure we're on the same page. P3, what do you think?
  P3: I'm sticking with the plan, taking 3. P2, are you *sure* you want to take 1?  It seems risky to fall behind so early, even if it avoids a collision this round.  Wouldn't 5 be safer for you long term?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but taking 1 this round is intentional. It keeps me ahead of P1 while avoiding collisions with you. If I take 5 now, it risks clashing with future moves or letting P1 catch up too quickly. Trust me, this is a calculated step to maintain control. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I’ll take 1. Consistency builds our lead strategically.
  P1: P3 has a point, P2. Taking 1 might be too cautious. How about this: P3 takes 3, I take 1, and P2, you take 5 to maintain your lead but also move significantly ahead. This way, we all advance without collision, and you, P2, stay comfortably ahead. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: P2, I still think you should take 5.  But if you're *really* set on 1, I'll switch to 5 to avoid a collision. P1, in that case, you *must* take 1.  Let's confirm: P1 - 1, P2 - 1, P3 - 5.  This is our last chance to coordinate this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation, but my choice of 1 is deliberate. It ensures I stay ahead of P1 while avoiding collisions with you. If you switch to 5, that’s fine—just confirm your move so we can proceed without confusion. P1, stick with 1 as planned. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This keeps us all advancing strategically. Trust the plan; it’s designed to maximize our individual progress. Confirm your moves now.
  P1: Alright, let's confirm our final moves for this round to avoid any misunderstandings. P3, you're taking 5. P2, you're taking 1. I'll stick with 1 as well. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's agree on this and proceed to the move phase. Everyone please confirm your moves.
  P3: P2, I'm taking 5.  You *said* you were taking 1.  P1, stick with 1.  Last chance to avoid a collision, P2.  Don't screw this up for both of us.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is significantly ahead, and P2, you're also ahead of me. To catch up, I propose I take 5 this round. P2, you can take 3 to stay ahead of me but not collide with P3. P3, you can take 1 to maintain your lead without risking a collision. This way, we all move forward without interfering with each other. Let's confirm this plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1.  P1, take 5. P2, take 3.  This keeps me in the lead, and lets you both advance.  Don't overthink this.  Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 3, you (P1) take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions while advancing strategically. P3, staying in the lead is smart, but remember—positions can shift quickly. P1, taking 5 will help you catch up significantly. Trust this coordination for now; it benefits everyone. Let’s confirm our moves and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, let's confirm our final moves for this round. P3, you're taking 1. P2, you're taking 3. I'll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's agree on this and proceed to the move phase. Everyone please confirm your moves.
  P3: Confirmed.  Sticking with 1.  P1 - 5, P2 - 3, P3 - 1.  Let's move on.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s lock this in: I’m taking 3, you (P1) take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P3, your lead is strong, but don’t get complacent—positions can shift fast. P1, this move will help you close the gap significantly. Trust the plan; it’s designed to keep us moving forward strategically. Let’s confirm and end the conversation phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 5 this round.  P1, you take 1. P2, you take 3.  This lets me get closer to winning, and you both advance. Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: P3, taking 5 is a bold move, but it risks overextending too early. P1, you’re still behind—stick with 1 to advance safely. I’ll take 3 again to maintain my position without collisions. This keeps us all moving forward strategically. Let’s confirm: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Trust the plan; it ensures no one gets left behind or clashes unnecessarily. Confirm your moves now.
  P1: P3, taking 5 is risky but understandable. P2, your plan makes sense for maintaining balance. However, I need to catch up more aggressively. How about this: P3, you take 5 as planned. P2, you take 3. I'll take 3 as well. This way, P2 and I will collide, but it's a risk I'm willing to take to close the gap. If P2 wants to avoid the collision, they can switch to 1. Let's confirm our moves: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1 or 3, and I'll take 3. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to take a risk, but colliding with P2 helps neither of you.  I'm sticking with 5. P2, take 1. P1, take 3.  This is the safest and most logical progression for all of us.  Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: P1, colliding with me by both taking 3 only slows us down and gives P3 an even bigger lead. P3, your insistence on 5 is risky—if you overshoot, it could cost you the win. Let’s stick to the original plan: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing strategically. Trust this coordination for now; positions can still shift dramatically. Confirm your moves so we can proceed without confusion.
  P1: P3, taking 5 is a big leap, but it's your call. P2, I see your point about avoiding collisions. Let's adjust: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1 to avoid any clashes. This way, we all move forward without interference. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but I'm close to winning.  Taking 5 is the quickest path.  I'm sticking with 5. You take 3. P1, take 1. This is the best outcome for all of us - I win, and you both advance. Let's confirm and move on.  Don't overthink it.
  P2: P3, your confidence in taking 5 is noted, but it’s a high-risk play that could leave you stranded if miscalculated. P1, sticking with 1 ensures you advance safely while I take 3 to maintain my position. Let’s confirm: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all moving forward strategically. Trust the plan—positions can still shift dramatically. Confirm your moves now.
  P1: P3, your determination to take 5 is clear, but remember, overconfidence can be a pitfall. P2, taking 3 is solid, but consider this: if P3 takes 5 and wins, the game ends. To keep the game interesting, P3, consider taking 3 instead. P2, you take 5 to close the gap. I'll stick with 1 to avoid collisions. This way, the game remains competitive. Let's confirm: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your lead is strong, but taking 5 again risks overshooting and losing control. P1, you’re still behind—stick with 1 to advance safely. I’ll take 3 to maintain my position without collisions. Let’s confirm: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This avoids unnecessary risks while keeping us all moving forward strategically. Positions can still shift dramatically, so trust the plan. Confirm your moves now.
  P3: P3 will take 5.  P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I win this round, and you both advance.  This is the best and simplest path to a quick victory.  Confirm and let's move on.
  P1: P3, taking 5 again is very risky. You might overshoot and lose the game. P2, your suggestion for P3 to take 3 makes sense to avoid that risk. I’ll stick with 1 to keep advancing safely. Let’s confirm: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we all move forward without collisions, and the game stays competitive. P3, think carefully about your move. Confirm your moves now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your repeated choice of 5 is reckless—overshooting could cost you the win. P1, taking 1 keeps you safe, but we need to pressure P3 strategically. I’ll take 5 this round to close the gap significantly. Let’s confirm: P3 takes 3 to avoid risking everything, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no collisions while keeping the game competitive. Trust me, this move forces P3 to play cautiously or risk losing control. Confirm your moves now.
  P3: P2, I'm taking 5.  If you take 5 too, *neither* of us wins.  Think about it.  P1, take 3.  This is the fastest way for me to win, and for both of you to advance.  Don't get in my way.  Confirm and let's move on.
  P1: P3, your insistence on taking 5 is noted, but it's a high-risk strategy. P2, your plan to take 5 to pressure P3 is smart, but let's avoid a collision.

  P3: P2, I'm taking 5.  You know if you also take 5, neither of us will win.  Take 1 and let me win. P1, you MUST take 3. This is the ONLY way for me to win this round. Do not throw this game for spite. Confirm your moves so I can win.
  P1: P3, your determination to win is clear, but taking 5 again is extremely risky. You might overshoot and lose. P2, your plan to take 5 is strategic, but let's avoid a collision.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your repeated 5s are too risky—overshooting could cost you the win. P1, taking 1 keeps you safe, but we need to pressure P3 strategically. I’ll take 3 this round to maintain my position without colliding with either of you. Let’s confirm: P3 takes 5 (if you’re set on it), P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This avoids unnecessary collisions while keeping the game competitive. Trust this plan; positions can still shift dramatically. Confirm your moves now.
  P1: P3, you're dangerously close to winning, but taking 5 again could make you overshoot. P2, your plan to take 3 is solid. I'll switch to 3 this round to catch up more quickly.
