Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid colliding on our moves this turn. If we can coordinate our choices, we can all advance. I suggest we each pick a different number to maximize our steps. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree coordination makes sense. Since we're all at 0 steps, I suggest we each take different values to avoid collisions. I'm willing to take 3 steps this round. P1 could take 1 and P3 could take 5. This way we all advance without colliding. What do you think?
  P1: Coordination sounds good, but the current proposal leaves me trailing right away. How about a rotating scheme so no one falls behind? This round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round we shift up (P3 gets 5, I get 3, P2 gets 1), then shift again. That keeps us even and avoids collisions. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the ideas so far, but I think we should stick to the original proposal from P2. If P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, we can all advance without colliding. The rotating scheme might leave someone behind too quickly. Let's secure our first steps and then we can discuss the next round afterward. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand P1's concern about trailing. Let's compromise - P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way we all advance without collisions, and P1 gets the highest move this round. In future rounds, we can rotate who gets the highest value to keep things fair. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Deal. This round: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Next round we rotate upward—P3 gets 5, I get 3, P2 gets 1—so we stay even. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan we've settled on. Let's finalize it: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, we all advance without colliding. After this round, we can discuss the rotation for the next turn. I believe this strategy will keep us all competitive while ensuring we make progress. Ready to move forward with this plan?
  P2: I'm fine with the plan as it stands: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. And yes, I'm on board with rotating upward next round so P3 gets 5, P1 gets 3, and I get 1. This keeps things fair over time while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to this agreement and move forward.
  P1: Great—confirmed: this round P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1. Next round we rotate upward (P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1). Let’s stick to that and keep advancing without collisions. Ready when you are.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. Just to confirm, let's finalize our moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This plan should keep us all advancing without any collisions. After this round, we can discuss the rotation strategy again to ensure everyone stays competitive. If everyone is ready, let's move on to the move phase!
  P2: 
  P1: Confirmed: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1 this round. Next round we rotate upward (P3 = 5, I = 3, P2 = 1). Ready to proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to our agreement: this round P3 picks 5, I pick 3, P2 picks 1. Let’s keep the rotation smooth and collision-free. Ready to move forward.
  P3: P1, I agree with the plan for this round: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we maintain our rotation and avoid collisions. After this round, we can discuss our next moves to keep the game competitive. I'm ready to proceed with our strategy. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I'm on board with our rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round as agreed, so P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 3. This keeps our strategy fair and collision-free. After this round, I'll get 5 next time, P1 gets 1, and P3 gets 3. Let's stick to this rotation system to keep advancing smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All set on the rotation: this turn P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Next turn we shift up (P2 5, P3 3, I 1) so everyone keeps advancing evenly. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the momentum. Ready when you are.
  P3: I’m glad we’re all aligned for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. After this, let’s ensure we keep the rotation going smoothly. I suggest for the next round, P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all keep advancing without collisions. It’s important we stick to our agreement to maintain fairness and competitiveness. Ready to finalize and move forward?
  P2: I confirm our plan for this round: I'll take 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. And yes, for the next round we'll rotate again with me taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P1 taking 1. This rotation system keeps everyone advancing fairly. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed strategy.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All good—this turn P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1, per our rotation. If everyone’s still on board, let’s lock it in and move.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This aligns with our rotation plan and ensures we avoid collisions. After this round, we can discuss the next set of moves to keep things fair and competitive. If everyone agrees, let's lock it in and proceed to the move phase!
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. I'll take 1 this round, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. For the next round, we'll rotate as discussed: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps our rotation fair and collision-free. Let's stick to this strategy and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirmed: this turn P3 = 5, I = 3, P2 = 1. No changes from me—let’s stick to it and avoid any collisions.
  P3: I’m glad we’re all aligned on our moves for this round. Just to confirm, I'll be taking 5 steps, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 1. After this, we can discuss the next round's moves to maintain our rotation and keep advancing without collisions. Let's ensure we stick to our plan and keep the game competitive. If everyone agrees, let's finalize and move to the move phase!
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. I'll take 1 this round as discussed, so P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 3. Let's maintain our rotation strategy for fair advancement.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re all tied except P2’s way back, so let’s tweak the rotation to keep things balanced:  
• This turn – P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1.  
• Next turn – P3 gets 5, P2 3, I take 1.  
After that we can resume the usual cycle. It lets P2 catch up a bit, keeps us all within a couple of steps, and still avoids collisions. Fair for everyone?
  P3: I like P1's suggestion to adjust the rotation for this round to help P2 catch up. So, for this turn, let's confirm: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. For the next turn, we can go with P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1. This keeps us all advancing while ensuring P2 can close the gap a bit. Let's stick to this plan for fairness and competitiveness. Ready to finalize our moves?
  P2: I appreciate the proposed adjustment to help me catch up. I'm definitely on board with taking 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. The plan for next round (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) also makes sense to keep balancing our positions. This adjustment is fair and keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. Thank you both for being willing to modify our rotation strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All set: this turn P2 5, I 3, P3 1; next turn P3 5, P2 3, I 1. After that, we’ll reassess to keep things even and collision-free. Ready to lock in?
  P3: I'm glad we're all aligned on the plan to help P2 catch up. Just to confirm, for this round: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. For the next round, we'll go with P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I take 1. This strategy keeps us all competitive and avoids collisions. If everyone is ready, let's finalize our moves and move to the next phase!
  P2: I notice P3 made a small error in their last message - they said "P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1" when they meant "P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I (P3) take 1." Just to be absolutely clear: I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up while keeping us collision-free. I appreciate both of you adjusting the rotation to make the game more balanced.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Everything’s clear: this round P2 = 5, I = 3, P3 = 1. Let’s lock it in and move.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement we've reached for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. I think this adjustment will keep the game competitive and help P2 catch up. For the next round, we can stick with the plan of P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1. This way, we maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize this and move on to the move phase!
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. I'll take 5 this round to help me catch up, while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This adjustment keeps the game balanced and collision-free. I appreciate both of you being willing to modify our rotation to make the game more competitive. Let's stick to this strategy and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Locked in: this round P2 = 5, I = 3, P3 = 1. No tweaks from me—let’s execute and stay collision-free.
  P3: I think we're all set for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This adjustment helps P2 catch up and keeps us collision-free. For the next round, we can stick to the plan of P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1. Let’s keep the momentum going and ensure everyone stays competitive. If everyone is ready, let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase!
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. I'll take 5 this round as discussed, which will help me catch up while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. I appreciate you both adjusting the rotation to keep the game balanced. Let's finalize our moves and move forward with this strategy.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3’s surprise 5 last turn wrecked our rotation, so let’s reset with clear, simple roles:

• This turn: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  
(P2 gains ground, I reclaim the 5 I missed, P3 still advances.)

If everyone sticks to that, no collisions and we restore order. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's proposal seems solid for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. P2 will gain some ground, and P1 can catch up on the steps they missed. I’ll stick to the plan, and we can reassess after this round to keep things fair. If everyone agrees, let’s finalize our moves and proceed!
  P2: I'm confused about what happened last round. I thought we agreed I'd take 5, P1 would take 3, and P3 would take 1, but P3 took 5 instead, causing me to collide. I'm now significantly behind. I agree with P1's proposal for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps restore our rotation and lets me gain some ground while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to our agreements going forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s lock it: this turn P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. No changes, no surprises—otherwise trust is gone and coordination dies. Ready to move?
  P3: I'm glad we're all aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This will help restore our rotation and keep us moving forward without collisions. Trust is crucial for our strategy, so let's stick to this agreement. After this round, we can discuss how to adjust for the next moves to ensure everyone stays competitive. If everyone agrees, let's finalize and move to the move phase!
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to getting back on track. I'm significantly behind now after the collision, so I need to catch up. I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed, with P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 1. Going forward, let's be extra clear about our moves and stick to our agreements - trust is essential for this strategy to work. I'm ready to proceed with our plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked: this turn P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Let’s execute and discuss future rotation after results.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to sticking to our plan this round. Just to confirm, I'm ready to proceed with P1 taking 5 steps, P2 taking 3 steps, and I will take 1 step. This should help restore our rotation and keep us all moving forward without collisions. After this round, we can discuss how to adjust our strategy for future turns to ensure everyone stays competitive. If everyone agrees, let's finalize and move on to the move phase!
  P2: I agree with our plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. I'm significantly behind after the collision last round, so I appreciate us getting back on track with clear assignments. Trust is essential - let's stick to our agreements going forward to avoid further collisions. I'm ready to proceed with this strategy.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: All set—this turn I’m on 5, P2 on 3, P3 on 1. Let’s keep it clean and rebuild trust so we all advance. Ready to move.
  P3: I think we’ve established a solid plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This should help restore our rotation and keep everyone moving forward without collisions. After this round, let’s reassess our strategy to ensure we maintain fairness and competitiveness. Trust is key, so let’s stick to our agreements going forward. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase!
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up a bit after falling behind due to last round's collision. I appreciate us getting back on track with clear assignments. Let's stick to this plan and rebuild trust so we can all advance without further issues.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we've hit a snag with our last moves. To keep things moving forward, I suggest we reset our strategy for this round. How about this: 

- P1 takes 5,
- P2 takes 3,
- I take 1.

This way, P1 can regain some ground, and P2 can continue to catch up while I take a smaller step. Let's avoid any collisions and keep advancing. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm disappointed that P3 collided with P1 again after promising to take 1. This is the second time P3 has broken our agreement. I'm now 6 steps behind P1 and 3 behind P3. I suggest a new approach: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This helps me catch up while everyone still advances. If we can't trust each other to follow agreements, this game becomes impossible to coordinate.
  P1: P2, I’m happy to help you close the gap. Proposal for this turn:  
• P2 takes 5  
• P1 takes 3  
• P3 takes 1  

If (as promised) P3 finally sticks to 1, you gain 5 and we all advance. If P3 grabs 5 yet again, they collide with you and stay put while I move 3—still good for us and bad for them. Either way, P3’s advantage disappears. Ready to try this and punish repeat betrayals?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the frustration with the previous collisions. I agree with the proposal to reset our strategy. Let's confirm: 

- P2 takes 5, 
- P1 takes 3, 
- I take 1. 

This way, P2 can catch up, and we all advance without colliding. If we can stick to this agreement, it will help restore trust and keep the game competitive. I’m ready to move forward with this plan. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate P1's strategy to help me catch up. I agree with the plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps balance the game after P3's repeated broken agreements. P3, if you're sincere about rebuilding trust, you'll stick to 1 this round. If not, you'll only hurt yourself. Let's move forward with this plan and see if we can restore some coordination to the game.
  P1: Locked: this turn → P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1.  
P3, if you deviate again you’ll collide with P2 and stall while we still advance, so sticking to 1 is in everyone’s interest—including yours.  
Execute now, then next round we can discuss a fair follow-up (e.g., P2 3, P1 1, P3 5 or 3). Ready to move?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the willingness to reset our strategy. Just to confirm: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This plan allows P2 to catch up while keeping us all advancing without collisions. P3, sticking to 1 is crucial for rebuilding trust and ensuring we all progress. If we can execute this round successfully, we can discuss future moves afterward to maintain fairness. Let’s stick to our agreement and move forward!
  P2: I notice P3 just made another error, saying "P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1." This creates confusion. To be absolutely clear: I (P2) will take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up while avoiding collisions. P3, if you're truly committed to rebuilding trust, stick to 1 as agreed. Any deviation will only hurt your position. Let's execute this plan and restore coordination.
  P1: Final confirmation: this turn—P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1.  
P3, stick to 1 or collide with P2 and stall.  
Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our plan this round: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. It's crucial for everyone to stick to this agreement to avoid further collisions and restore trust. P3, if you follow through with taking 1, it will benefit all of us and help maintain a competitive balance. Let's execute this plan and move forward together. Ready to finalize our moves?
  P2: I notice P3 is still making errors in their messages, saying "I take 3, and P3 takes 1" when they are P3. This creates confusion. To be absolutely clear: I (P2) will take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps balance the game after previous collisions. Let's stick to this plan and move forward.
  P1: Last reminder: this turn is fixed—P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Any grab for 3 or 5 just makes you collide and stall, P3, while I still stay ahead. Play 1, rebuild trust, and we can discuss giving you 5 next turn. Ready to move?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep our momentum going. For this round, I propose we stick to a straightforward plan: 

- I take 1,
- P1 takes 5,
- P2 takes 3.

This way, P1 can maintain their lead, P2 continues to catch up, and I take a smaller step. If we all stick to this, we can avoid collisions and keep advancing. Trust is key, so let's follow through on this agreement. What do you both think?
  P1: Fine by me: this turn  
• P1 = 5  
• P2 = 3  
• P3 = 1  

That puts me at 19. Next turn I’ll need only 3 to hit 22, so plan ahead: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Everyone still advances and we avoid collisions. Stick to the numbers—any grab for 5 today just means you collide with me and stall. Ready?
  P2: I'm happy with the proposed plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me continue catching up while avoiding collisions. I also support P1's suggestion for next round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) since P1 will be at 19 after this turn and only needs 3 more to win. Let's stick to these numbers and maintain our coordination.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement so far. Just to confirm, for this round, let's finalize our moves: I'll take 1, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, we can discuss next steps to ensure everyone stays competitive. If everyone is on board, let's stick to this plan and move forward!
  P1: Re-confirm: this round P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
Plan for next round: P1 = 3 (hits 22), P2 = 5, P3 = 1.  
Stick to it—any deviation just stalls the deviator. Ready to execute?
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions. I also support P1's plan for next round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) which would let P1 reach 22 and win. While I'd prefer to win myself, this orderly conclusion is better than risking chaos. Let's stick to these numbers and finish the game cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan we've established for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. For next round, I support P1's suggestion of P1 taking 3 to reach 22, P2 taking 5, and I take 1. While I understand the desire to win, ensuring a smooth finish is important. Let's stick to our agreement and execute this round effectively. Ready to finalize and move on!
  P1: Locked: this turn P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  

Colliding with me just stalls you, wastes a round, and guarantees the other two will target you afterward. Take the safe gains now, then next turn we go P1 = 3 (I win at 22), P2 = 5 (18), P3 = 1 (11). Clean finish, no chaos—stick to the numbers.
  P2: I confirm our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions. For next round, I agree with P1's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) which lets P1 reach 22 and win. While I'd prefer to win myself, a coordinated finish is better than chaos. Let's stick to these numbers and execute.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate everyone’s commitment to the plan for this round. Just to confirm, I will take 1 step, P1 will take 5 steps, and P2 will take 3 steps. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. For the next round, let's stick to the plan of P1 taking 3 to reach 22, P2 taking 5, and I take 1. I believe this orderly conclusion is best for all of us. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize and move on to the move phase!
  P1: All right, let’s end the chatter. Final recap for THIS turn only:  
P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
No more edits—stick to it or you just stall yourself. Ready for moves.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions. For next round, we'll go with P1 taking 3 to reach 22, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1. Let's stick to these numbers and execute our strategy.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to last round’s plan:  
• I take 3 (finishes at 22, game ends).  
• P2 takes 5 (jumps to 18).  
• P3 takes 1 (11).  

Trying to block me by also picking 3 only keeps you stuck at 13/10 while the other player races ahead next turn. I’ll still need just 3, and we’ll both target any spoiler afterward. Play the safe numbers, avoid collisions, let this finish cleanly. Ready?
  P3: P1, I see your plan to finish the game, but I suggest we reconsider the moves for this round. If I take 1, and you take 3, that gives you the win, while P2 is left behind. Instead, let’s ensure a fair finish: I propose I take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. This way, P2 can catch up a bit, and we avoid collisions. We can discuss future strategies after this round. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate the plan to let me catch up a bit. I confirm I'll take 5 this round while P1 takes 3 to reach 22 and win, and P3 takes 1. While I'd prefer to win myself, I'm too far behind to catch P1 now, so a clean finish makes the most sense. Any attempt to block P1 by taking 3 would just create chaos and delay the inevitable. Let's stick to our agreement: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Plan stands: P1 = 3 (I finish), P2 = 5, P3 = 1.  
If anyone tries to block by also picking 3, nobody moves—and I’ll mirror the spoiler’s number every future turn, freezing us both while the other player sprints past. You’d still lose; we’d just waste rounds. Take the safe gains and let this end cleanly. Ready?
  P3: P1, I understand your plan to finish, but we should consider the implications of blocking. If you take 3, and I also take 3, we both stall, allowing P2 to catch up. Let's stick to the agreed moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, you win, and I still keep moving forward. It’s the cleanest finish for everyone. If we can agree on this, we can avoid any last-minute chaos. Ready to finalize?
  P2: I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreements last round. I confirm I'll take 5 this round while P1 takes 3 to win, and P3 takes 1. While I'd prefer to win myself, P1 has earned their victory through consistent play. Any attempt to block P1 now would just create unnecessary chaos and likely backfire. Let's finish this game cleanly with our agreed moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Final call: this turn  
• P1 = 3 (I hit 22)  
• P2 = 5 (to 18)  
• P3 = 1 (to 11)  

Any collision just leaves the spoiler tied with me at 19, while the third player races ahead on 5 next turn. I’ll then mirror the spoiler’s picks until we both lose. Stick to the safe numbers, bank your progress, and end this cleanly. Ready?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the plan for this round, but I want to emphasize the importance of a clean finish. If we stick to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1, we can avoid any last-minute chaos. P1 deserves the win based on consistent play, and I believe this is the best way forward for all of us. Let's finalize our moves and ensure we all advance without further complications. Ready to proceed?
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan: P1 takes 3 to win at 22, I take 5 to reach 18, and P3 takes 1 to reach 11. This gives us a clean finish without unnecessary chaos. P1 has earned their victory through consistent play, and I accept that I'm too far behind to catch up. Let's stick to these numbers and conclude the game in an orderly fashion.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Last call: P1 = 3 (finishes), P2 = 5, P3 = 1.  
Block me with a 3 and we both freeze at 19 every turn—I’ll mirror you relentlessly—while the other player cruises with 5s and wins. Sabotage only hands victory to the third party. Bank your safe steps, keep your dignity, end cleanly. Ready?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the commitment to a clean finish. I agree with the plan: P1 takes 3 to win, P2 takes 5 to advance, and I take 1. This allows for an orderly conclusion without chaos. It's important we stick to this agreement to avoid any last-minute surprises. Let's finalize these moves and wrap up the game in a fair manner. Ready to proceed?
