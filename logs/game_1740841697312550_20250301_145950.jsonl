P1, you said you preferred a shared victory to losing outright. But, if P3 takes 5, *someone* will be at 22. If *I* take 1 and *you* take 3, we BOTH tie at 19, and we BOTH lose. That's worse for *both* of us. I still think *I* should take 1, *you* take 3, and P3 takes 5. It's the only way to avoid a guaranteed loss for both of us. What do you *really* think, P1?"}

Your alternative suggestion (you take 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5) gives P3 an outright victory, which neither of us wants. Let's stick with P3's original suggestion: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Shared victory is better than losing outright. Agreed?"}
