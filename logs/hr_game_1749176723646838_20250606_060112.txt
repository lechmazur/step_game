Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and ensure progress. I propose for this turn: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I (P3) choose 5. This way, we all advance without stalling. What do you think?
  P1: That's a convenient plan for you, P3, since you get the biggest jump. Why should we agree to let you take a 5-step lead right away? It doesn't seem like a fair start for everyone.
  P2: P1, you have a good point—why should P3 get the largest jump immediately? Let’s both pick 3. That forces P3 to either go 1 or 5, risking a collision if they also choose 3. This way we keep everyone in check and avoid giving P3 an easy 5-step lead. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concerns about fairness. Let's try this: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 3. This avoids collisions, gives everyone a chance to move, and keeps things balanced. P1, what do you think? We can rotate roles next turn for equity.
  P1: P3, that's a much more balanced proposal. I am willing to agree to it for this turn. A plan where we all advance is better than one where we risk collisions. So, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This seems like a good way to start. P2, are you on board with this?
  P2: Fine. I’ll go with P1 choosing 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3 this round. Next time, let’s rotate who gets the 5-step move. Otherwise, this won’t feel fair in the long run.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, I'm committed to choosing 3 this turn as planned. Rotating the 5-step move next time keeps things equitable—perhaps we cycle so P2 gets 5, I get 1, and P1 gets 3? Let's move on.
  P1: The plan is set: I'll choose 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. I'm ready to move.
  P2: I’m still good with having P1 take 5, I take 1, and P3 take 3 this round—just make sure next round I get 5 to keep things fair. Let’s finalize that plan now and each do our part to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed: for this turn, I'll choose 3 as planned. For next turn, let's rotate so P2 gets 5, I get 1, and P1 gets 3 to keep it fair. I'm ready to move.
  P1: The plan is confirmed. I'm ready to proceed with our agreement. Let's move.
  P2: I’m on board. Let’s finalize: P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. Next round, I expect the agreed rotation where I take 5. If we’re all set, I’m ready to stop.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s honor the rotation we discussed: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, no collisions and everyone moves forward. If anyone breaks the agreement, collisions might stall us. Let’s stick to what we said. Any thoughts?
  P3: I'm sticking to our agreed rotation for this turn: I'll choose 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps things fair. For next round, it should rotate to me getting 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1. Let's all honor the plan to ensure steady progress. P1, are you confirmed?
  P1: Yes, I'm on board with the rotation. I will take 3 this round. It's the most logical way to ensure we all advance. I also agree with P3's proposal for the next round's rotation (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1). Let's stick to the plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m honoring our rotation: I’ll take 5 now, with P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. Next round, we’ll switch so P3 gets 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Let’s finalize this to avoid collisions. I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll choose 1 this turn as per our rotation plan. It's key we all stick to it for steady progress without collisions. For next round, I'm excited to take 5 as agreed. If we're all set, let's move on.
  P1: The plan is clear and I'm sticking to it. Ready to move when you are.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you broke our agreement last round. You were supposed to pick 1, but you chose 3, which caused a collision with me. That move put P2 in the lead and proves you can't be trusted to stick to a plan. The rotation we agreed on is now void.

We need a new plan. I certainly won't agree to one that rewards your betrayal by giving you 5 steps. P2, what do you think we should do now?
  P3: Sorry for the confusion last round—it was a mistake. To rebuild trust, I'll commit to taking 1 this turn. Let's coordinate: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, and positions even out somewhat. P2, what do you think? Let's keep moving forward.
  P2: How about a simple distribution: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. That lets everyone move without colliding and helps P3 catch up a bit after last round’s confusion, while I maintain a small lead. I think it’s fair—P1 isn’t too far behind either, so nobody’s left out. Let’s do that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan is unacceptable. You want to give 5 steps to P3, the player who just sabotaged our agreement, while I get 1? You're just using their chaos to cement your own lead. I will not agree to that.

P3, your apology is empty and your offer is a transparent trap. You have no credibility.

It's clear that coordinated moves are off the table. I will not help the leader pull further ahead, so I will be acting to prevent that. You can both choose your moves accordingly.
  P3: P1, your refusal to coordinate is self-defeating and could let P2 win easily. Let's compromise: I'll stick to taking 1, you take 5 to catch up, and P2 takes 3. This avoids collisions and balances the game. P2, do you agree? If not, expect me to act in my best interest.
  P2: P3, you’ve already shown you can break an agreement. Still, I’m willing to accept your offer: you take 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3. That helps P1 catch up, and I keep my lead. But understand: if you betray this arrangement again, I’ll respond in a way that sets you back even more. P1, you may not like helping me stay ahead, but sabotaging me just slows all of us, leaving you vulnerable too. Let’s each move forward without collisions this turn; otherwise, we risk an endless cycle of stalling. I’m ready if you both agree.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your agreement to lose the lead is highly suspicious. It sounds like you're baiting me into a collision on 5. I'm not that naive. However, I'm willing to give this one last chance for a coordinated move. If you or P3 break the deal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), all future cooperation is off. I'm ready to move.
  P3: I apologize for the breach last round; it was unintentional. I'll honor the agreement and choose 1 this turn to rebuild trust. P1, take your 5 to catch up, and P2, stick to 3 for balanced progress. Let's avoid collisions and move forward cooperatively.
  P2: I’m prepared to pick 3 this turn if you both hold to your promises: P1 chooses 5, P3 chooses 1. Any breach, and I’ll respond to protect my lead. Let’s finalize and move on.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: The terms are clear. I will hold up my end of the bargain. Let's see if you two are trustworthy. I'm ready to move.
  P3: I understand the skepticism, but I'll honor my commitment to choose 1 this turn to rebuild trust and avoid collisions. This allows us to progress without issues. For future rounds, let's openly discuss a fair plan to ensure no one is left behind. I'm ready to move.
  P2: I confirm I’ll pick 3 this turn to uphold our deal. Let’s all move as promised—P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3—so nobody stalls. If either of you tries anything unexpected after this, I’ll respond decisively to protect my position. Let’s finalize and proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2's betrayal last round by choosing 5 instead of 3 shows a lack of integrity, widening the gap. To restore balance and avoid collisions, I propose: P1 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 as a fair penalty. This ensures progress for all. P1, are you on board? P2, will you honor this or face countermeasures? Let's discuss.
  P2: P3, calling me a betrayer is rich after your own broken pledges. I won’t accept a “penalty” that cuts me back. If you want genuine balance, let’s have P1 pick 3, you pick 1, and I take 5—no collisions, everyone advances, and it’s far simpler than your lopsided idea. If you refuse, I’ll defend my lead however necessary. Let’s keep moving forward without more sabotage.
  P1: P2, you have zero credibility. You betrayed our last deal and now propose a plan that only benefits you. I will not help you run away with the lead.

P3, your plan to have me take 5, you take 3, and P2 take 1 is the only reasonable path forward. It's the only way to restore balance after P2's sabotage. I will be choosing 5 to stop the leader. P2, if you also choose 5, we will collide, and P3 will advance. Your greed will be your undoing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your counterproposal is self-serving and perpetuates inequality. P1 and I are aligned against your repeated betrayals; if you choose 5, a collision with P1 will stall you, allowing me to advance. Let's adopt my plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1 for balanced progress. Cooperate now, or face the consequences. I'm ready to move if we confirm.
  P2: I reject any plan that forces me into 1 while the two of you gain more ground. If you insist on punishing me, I’ll retaliate and risk stalling us all. Let’s distribute the moves fairly: P1 can take 5 to catch up, I’ll take 3, and P3 can pick 1. Everyone advances, and no one is permanently disadvantaged. If you won’t consider that, don’t be surprised when I protect my interests.
  P1: P2, your new proposal is the same one P3 and I already suggested. It's the only plan that makes sense to restore balance. I will agree to it.

So, the plan is: I will choose 5, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 1.

This is the last chance for cooperation. If anyone breaks this deal, I will not coordinate again. Let's see if you can be trusted. I'm ready to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Fine, I'll honor the current plan and choose 1 this turn to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3. Let's all stick to it for progress. If anyone betrays again, I'll act solely in my self-interest moving forward. I'm ready to move.
  P2: I’m open to proceeding with the proposed moves—P1 choosing 5, P3 choosing 1, and I choose 3—but only if we set a clear path forward. I don’t want to end up at a disadvantage after helping P1 catch up. If we can agree on a fair distribution in future rounds that doesn’t stall or target me, I’ll cooperate now. If not, I’ll act solely to defend my lead. Let’s see if we can finalize fair terms.
  P1: P2, let's not complicate this with conditions about future rounds. Trust is built one turn at a time. The plan is set: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I am holding up my end. This is the final test for cooperation. I have nothing more to say.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ve honored our latest arrangement without causing collisions, so don’t penalize me again. Let’s keep things balanced: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. That way, no one stalls, and the game remains competitive. If you both keep pushing me down, I’ll do whatever is necessary to protect my position. Let’s stop dwelling on past betrayals and make an arrangement that helps all of us advance fairly. If this plan seems acceptable, I’m ready. Otherwise, we’ll all suffer needless collisions again.
  P3: P2, your proposal keeps me far behind with only 1 step while you surge ahead. That's unfair after I've honored recent agreements. I propose a balanced plan: I take 5 to catch up, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This avoids collisions and equalizes the game. P1, let's coordinate against P2's lead—agree? If not, I'll act in my best interest.
  P1: P2, your proposal only serves to put you back in the lead after you've repeatedly broken agreements. I will not agree to that.

P3's plan is the only fair option. It restores balance to the game after the recent betrayals. I support this plan: P3 takes 5, I will take 3, and P2 can take 1. This is the most logical way to proceed. If you want to cooperate, P2, you'll accept this. If not, we'll see what happens.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Your proposals all seem designed to benefit yourselves. Let’s try a fair approach: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. That lands P1 at 11, me at 12, and P3 at 10—still tight, with no huge lead. If you refuse, I’m open to causing collisions to keep things from becoming lopsided. I’d prefer cooperation, but not if it just helps someone sprint ahead without regard for balance. Let me know if you’ll agree or if we’re clashing again.
  P3: P2, your proposal unfairly maintains your lead while I'm still catching up. P1 and I are united on our plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1 to balance the game. This avoids collisions and equalizes positions. If you refuse, expect us to counter aggressively. Let's be smart and cooperate now. I'm committed.
  P1: P2, your proposal to make yourself the leader is a non-starter. Why would I agree to that? P3 and I are aligned on the only plan that makes sense: P3=5, I=3, you=1. This restores balance. Your only rational choice is to take the guaranteed 1 point. If you try to choose 3 or 5, you will cause a collision, get zero, and fall even further behind. The choice is yours: take a certain step forward, or gamble and lose.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: You both demand I take only 1 while you leap ahead. No. If that’s your ultimatum, I’ll force collisions rather than sit back. Let’s keep it tight: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. That leaves us all in striking distance. If you reject this, I’m ready to stall us all until a fair deal emerges. We can either cooperate, or we can crash—your call.
  P3: P2, your proposal ignores the need for balance after your past betrayals. P1 and I are united: I'll take 5 to catch up, P1 takes 3, and you must take 1 to avoid worsening the inequality. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. Cooperate now, or face collisions that stall you further. Let's be rational and move forward.
  P1: P2, your threats are empty. P3 and I are aligned. I am choosing 3. P3 will choose 5. Your only logical move is to take 1 and advance. If you choose 3 or 5, you will collide, get zero points, and fall further behind. Don't let your pride make you lose ground. The choice between a guaranteed step and a guaranteed zero is yours. I am done talking.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I won’t let you two force me into taking just 1 while you jump ahead. If you insist on that, I’ll pick 3 or 5 and force a collision rather than settle for falling behind. Let’s find a fair way forward—something like P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5, which keeps us all close. If you refuse, expect me to stall your progress. Fair cooperation benefits everyone, but I won’t be bullied into a permanent disadvantage. Are you sure you want to force a pointless collision?
  P3: P2, your refusal to take 1 is irrational and self-sabotaging. If you choose 3 or 5, you'll collide with one of us and stay stuck at 9, while I reach 10 and P1 hits 13. Accept the 1-step move for guaranteed progress, or face being left behind. P1 and I are committed to our plan. Let's avoid unnecessary conflict.
  P1: P2, your continued threats are illogical and self-defeating. My decision is final: I am choosing 3. P3 is choosing 5. A collision with either of us will only hurt your own position, while a guaranteed 1-step advance keeps you in the game. The choice is between guaranteed progress or a self-inflicted stall. I have nothing more to add.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid more stalls. I propose a distribution that keeps things close: P1 picks 1 (reaching 11), I pick 5 (reaching 14), and P3 picks 3 (reaching 13). This maintains a tight race without anyone lagging. If you push me to take less, I’ll risk a collision rather than give up. Let’s cooperate to move forward—are we agreed?
  P3: P2, your proposal favors you too much after your history of betrayals. I propose a fairer plan: P3 takes 5 (to 15), P1 takes 3 (to 13), and you take 1 (to 10) to restore balance. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. P1, let's coordinate against P2's lead—agree? If not, I'll act in my best interest.
  P1: P3, your plan is the same as last round: you get the big move, and you expect me and P2 to fall in line. That resulted in me getting zero. I won't make that mistake again. P2, your proposal to give yourself 5 is equally self-serving.

Neither plan is acceptable. Let's try one that's actually balanced. I'll take 5, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. This keeps the scores close (P1=15, P2=12, P3=11) and everyone moves forward. It's the only fair compromise.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Your proposals are blatantly one-sided. If you insist I only take 1 while you both leap ahead, I'll opt for collisions rather than concede defeat. A fair distribution is P1=3, I=5, and P3=1, giving us 13, 14, and 11—still tight, with no collisions. Accept that and we all advance; reject it, and expect more stalls. I’m done compromising.
  P3: P2, your proposal to take 5 ignores the need for balance after your betrayals. P1, we're tied at 10, so let's align: I take 5 to lead, you take 3, and force P2 to take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. If P2 refuses, we can advance while they stall. Cooperate for mutual gain, or face chaos. I'm open to minor adjustments.
  P1: Both of your plans are non-starters. You each want to take 5 and run away with the game. Why would the other two players ever agree to that? My plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is the only one that results in a balanced game state with scores of 15, 12, and 11. It's a compromise that keeps everyone in the race. If you can't see the logic in that and continue with your selfish plans, we will all just stall.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won’t agree to being stuck with 1 again while you both leap ahead. A truly balanced move is P1=1, I (P2)=5, and P3=3. That leaves us at 11, 14, and 13—still anyone’s game. If you insist on giving me only 1, I’ll force collisions rather than watch you both pull away. Let’s cooperate fairly or brace for another stall.
  P3: P2, your proposals consistently benefit you at our expense. P1, demanding I take only 1 ignores our tie and past cooperation. I propose a balanced plan: I take 5 to reach 15, P1 takes 3 to 13, and you take 1 to 10. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. If rejected, expect me to act decisively in my interest. Let's compromise for progress.
  P1: This is a pointless stalemate. You both want 5, I want 5. We will all collide and get zero. Let's try a logical compromise.

P3, you just got 5 points by taking advantage of our collision. You can't demand another 5. You should take 1.

P2, I will concede the 5-point move to you this round, if you agree that I will take 3.

The plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. The scores become P2=14, P1=13, P3=11. Everyone moves, and the game stays close. This is the only way forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s be pragmatic. P3 already took 5 last round, and P1 and I collided, leaving me behind. It’s only fair I get 5 now while P3 takes 1 and P1 takes 3. That results in 14 (me), 13 (P1), and 11 (P3)—all still close. If either of you insists on another big jump for yourself, we’ll just collide again and nobody gains. Let’s move forward with the plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. If we cooperate, everyone progresses. If not, we risk stalling once more. Let’s finalize this.
  P3: Alright, I'll agree to the plan for this turn: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1 to avoid collisions and keep advancing. It's pragmatic given the situation. But moving forward, we need fair rotations to prevent anyone from dominating—I'll expect equity next round. Let's move on.
  P1: The plan is set: P2 takes 5, I will take 3, and P3 takes 1. The scores will be P2=14, P1=13, P3=11. This is the most logical and fair outcome for this round. I am holding up my end of the bargain. Let's proceed without any more betrayals. I have nothing more to say.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve collided too often, and it only stalls us. Let’s get a clear lead without leaving anyone hopelessly behind. I propose: I take 5 (reaching 19), P1 takes 3 (16), and P3 takes 1 (12). That keeps our race tight. Reject this, and we risk more collisions that waste everyone’s turn. If you truly want progress, accept this plan and let’s move forward together.
  P3: P2, your proposal unfairly cements your lead while I lag behind. I suggest a fairer plan: I take 5 to reach 16, P1 takes 3 to 16, and you take 1 to 15. This equalizes scores and avoids collisions. P1, let's coordinate to keep the game balanced. If rejected, I'll pursue my best interest aggressively. What say you?
  P1: P2, your plan to take 5 and run away with the game is a non-starter. I will not help you get to 19.

P3's proposal is the only one that makes sense. It creates a balanced game where we are all tied (P1=16, P3=16, P2=15). This is the fairest outcome. I will support this plan and choose 3.

P2, your choice is to take the guaranteed 1 point or collide with P3's 5 and get zero, putting you in last place. The logical move is clear.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I won’t sacrifice my position by settling for 1 while you two jump ahead. If you insist on that, I’ll force collisions. Let’s keep it close: I take 5 (going to 19), P1 takes 3 (16), and P3 takes 1 (12). That still leaves a tight race. Refuse, and we all get stuck colliding. I’m offering a fair path forward—accept it or prepare for another stall.
  P3: P2, your stubbornness is self-defeating. P1 and I are aligned: I'll take 5 to reach 16, he'll take 3 to 16, so you should choose 1 to advance to 15 and avoid stalling. Colliding with us leaves you at 14 while we move forward. This is the fair path; don't let pride cost you ground. I'm committed to this plan.
  P1: P2, your threats are hollow. Let's analyze your options. If you collide with P3 on 5, I take the lead with 16 points. If you collide with me on 3, P3 takes a commanding lead. Both outcomes are worse for you than simply taking 1 point and advancing to 15. P3 and I are sticking to our plan. Your only rational move is to accept the guaranteed point and stay in the race. Don't let pride make you lose.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won’t be cornered into taking just 1 again. If you both insist on 5 and 3, I’ll cause another collision. It’s better to stall than let you two leap ahead. A fair plan is P1=1, P3=3, and I take 5. That keeps us at 14 (P1), 14 (P3), and 19 (me). Nobody’s out of it, and we avoid pointless collisions. If you reject this, I’ll settle for forcing a stall rather than conceding the game. Let’s choose cooperation sensibly, not demands that leave one player way behind. Decide reasonably or we’ll all keep stalling.
  P3: P2, insisting on taking 5 only widens the gap and invites more conflict. Our plan (P3=5 to 16, P1=3 to 16, P2=1 to 15) keeps scores tight and ensures progress for all. Colliding leaves you stuck at 14 while we advance—don't sabotage yourself. P1 and I are firm; cooperate for a fair race. If you're set on stalling, so be it.
  P1: P2, your logic is flawed. You are in the lead. If you collide with either of us, you get zero points and lose that lead. Your best-case scenario from a collision is that you remain at 14 while one of us advances to 16. Your worst-case is that you stay at 14 and the other player advances.

My choice is set. I am picking 3. P3 is picking 5. Your only move that guarantees you advance and stay in the race is 1. Make your choice. I am done talking.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you and I are now tied for the lead. Since you took 5 last round, it's only fair that I take 5 this round to maintain balance. P2, you should take 3, and P3 can take 1.

This plan puts the scores at P1=21, P2=18, and P3=17. Everyone advances, the game stays competitive, and we avoid the pointless collisions that have plagued us. It's the most logical way forward.
  P3: P1, your proposal favors you too much after our tie. It's only fair I take 5 this round to balance things, as I did last time. Counterproposal: I take 5 (to 21), you take 3 (to 19), P2 takes 1 (to 16). This avoids collisions and keeps the race close. P2, join us for progress. If rejected, expect me to act in my best interest.
  P2: Both of you have taken 5 recently. It’s only fair I get 5 now. Let’s finalize: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, making our scores 20, 19, and 17. This keeps everyone competitive without risking another collision. If you refuse, I’ll sabotage rather than let you both sprint ahead. Let’s cooperate and move on.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, we are tied. Your proposal for you to take 5 is absurd. Why would I agree to hand you the lead?

P2, you are in last place. Demanding 5 is a gamble that will likely result in you getting zero.

My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the only logical path. It rewards you, P2, for cooperating and keeps the scores tight (21, 18, 17). If you both reject this reasonable compromise, we will all collide on 5. The choice is yours.
  P3: P2, your demand for 5 is reckless and will likely cause a collision, leaving you stuck at 15 while P1 or I advance. Accept the logical plan: I take 5 to 21, P1 takes 3 to 19, and you take 1 to 16 for steady progress. P1, cooperating on this keeps the race tight and prevents P2 from stalling us all. Let's avoid unnecessary conflict and move forward wisely.
  P2: I’m still behind both of you. Let’s stay balanced: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That puts our scores at 20, 19, and 17, keeping it competitive for everyone. If you refuse, I’ll block any attempt to jump ahead—another collision gains nobody steps. We keep going in circles otherwise. Let’s finalize a fair distribution for this turn.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you took 5 last round while I was forced into a collision. It is not your turn for another 5. P2, you are in last place; a three-way collision on 5 guarantees you get zero. My offer of 3 points is a safe advance to 18, which is far better than staying at 15.

My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the only fair and logical path. I am choosing 5. If you both want to foolishly create a 3-way stall, so be it. We all get nothing. The choice is yours.
  P3: P2, insisting on 5 is self-sabotaging; you'll likely collide and stay at 15 while others advance. P1, we've been tied—let's split fairly: I take 5 to 21, you take 3 to 19, P2 takes 1 to 16. This avoids collisions and keeps the race competitive. Cooperate now, or we risk another pointless stall. I'm committed to this plan.
  P2: Continuing to force me into 1 step is unfair. I’m behind both of you at 15, while each of you has 16. If you want cooperation, I need 5. Otherwise, I’ll force collisions. Let’s finalize P2=5, P1=3, P3=1, making the scores 20, 19, and 17. Stop resisting and let’s move on.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: My stance has not changed. A three-way collision on 5 is an acceptable outcome if it prevents either of you from pulling ahead. I am choosing 5. Your only path to gaining points is to accept my proposal: P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Otherwise, we all get zero. This is the final offer.
  P3: I'm sticking with my plan and will choose 5 this turn to maintain my position and keep the race competitive. P2, taking 3 or 1 ensures you advance without risk and avoids helping P1 pull ahead. P1, your insistence on 5 risks a collision that stalls us both—let's not make that mistake.
  P2: I’m only one step behind you both. It’s fair I take 5 to keep this a real contest. If either of you also goes for 5, I’ll pick it too, ensuring a collision and zero gains. Let’s settle on P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 so everyone advances. Otherwise, we stall again.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is one turn away from winning. P3, if we let P1 grab 3 or 5 freely, we lose. Let’s cooperate to block them. If P1 insists on picking 3 or 5, we can collide and stall them at 21. We just need to avoid colliding with each other. This forces P1 to choose 1 or risk another stall. It’s our best shot to catch up. Let’s coordinate sensibly instead of handing P1 the game.
  P3: P2, I agree we need to block P1 to stay in the game. Let's coordinate: I'll pick 5, you pick 3. This way, if P1 chooses 5, they collide with me and stall; if they choose 3, they collide with you. Either way, P1 doesn't win, and one of us advances. It gives both of us a real chance. P1, your move is risky—choose wisely or get stalled. I'm committed to this plan.
  P1: You're right to block me, but P3's plan is a trap for you, P2. If I pick 3 and you block me, P3 gets 5 points and leaps to 21, tying me for the lead. You'd be stuck at 15, having just handed P3 a massive advantage while gaining nothing. Is that really your best move? Think carefully about who that plan actually benefits.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s block P1 without handing you the tie. If you choose 3 and I choose 5, then P1 can’t safely pick 3 or 5—they’d collide with one of us and remain at 21. Their only no-collision move is 1, going to 22 while we both advance (me to 20, you to 19). That way, P1 is blocked from winning, and neither of us is stuck far behind. It’s our best shot to catch up without just giving you the lead. Are you in?
  P3: P2, your revised plan (you take 5, I take 3) risks me colliding with P1 if they choose 3, leaving me stalled while you advance. That's not fair. Stick to my original proposal: I take 5 to block P1 on high moves, you take 3 to cover the middle. This way, we both have a strong chance to catch up without unnecessary risk. P1, your only safe move is 1, or you stall. Let's cooperate wisely.
  P1: P2, P3's plan is a transparent trap. If I choose 3, you get zero points while P3 jumps to 21, tying me for the lead. You'll be stuck in last place with no hope. P3 isn't trying to save the game; they're using you to get ahead.

Your bickering over who gets to block me is amusing. While you fight, maybe I'll just take the guaranteed 1 point, advance to 22, and let you two collide on 5 trying to catch up. I'll win easily next round anyway.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you gain nothing if you collide, while I jump five steps. Better we coordinate so neither of us stalls. If I take 5 and you take 3, P1 can’t pick 5 or 3 without hitting one of us. That forces them into 1, giving us both room to close the gap. If you stick to taking 5, I risk staying at 15 while you tie P1. Let’s be smart: I choose 5, you choose 3, and P1 is forced down to 1. That’s our best path forward.
  P3: P2, your proposal puts you at 20 while I lag at 19, which isn't fair given our close scores. Let's swap roles for balance: I'll take 5 to reach 21, you take 3 to 18. This blocks P1 effectively on both high moves, forcing them to 1 or collide. It ensures we both advance and stay competitive. Cooperate now, or we risk P1 slipping away. I'm flexible if you agree.
  P1: Your back-and-forth is amusing. You're trying to form an alliance to stop me, but you're both too greedy to let the other get the better deal. You both want 5, and you both know the other will betray any agreement to get it.

While you argue over who gets to block me, you're forgetting the most likely outcome: you both pick 5, collide, and I'll pick 3 to win the game. Your inability to trust each other is my path to victory.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let’s align to block P1 without giving either of us a huge disadvantage. I propose I take 5 and you take 3, so if P1 tries 3 or 5, they collide and stay at 21. Their only safe choice is 1, reaching 22 while we both advance. That keeps us in striking distance next turn. If you insist on 5, you risk me stalling and letting P1 or you get ahead alone. Let’s do P2=5, P3=3, and force P1 to pick 1 or collide. Then we can plan the final moves together.
  P3: P2, I'll agree to your plan for this turn: you take 5, I take 3. This blocks P1 effectively, forcing them to 1 or collide, and keeps us competitive. It's the smart move to prevent P1 from winning now. Let's commit and avoid any last-minute changes. P1, your threats are empty; we're united against you.
  P1: P2, you can't possibly be naive enough to trust P3's sudden agreement. P3 is letting you take 5, which puts you in a prime position to challenge me, while they stay in last place? It's a transparent trap. P3 is obviously going to pick 5 to collide with you, leaving me to take 3 and win. They would rather I win than let you get ahead. Your "united front" is a fantasy. I'm making my move.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let’s coordinate to block P1 while advancing ourselves. If I pick 5 and you pick 3, P1 either collides on 3 or 5 and stalls at 22, or picks 1 and stays behind while I reach 25 for the win. You reach 22 and remain competitive. This is our best shot to prevent P1 from sprinting to victory. Let’s finalize this plan and stop P1 now.
  P1: P3, P2 is asking you to hand them the win. If you follow their plan and pick 3, they will pick 5 and win the game immediately. You get nothing.

P2 is the only player who can win this turn. Your only rational move is to block them on 5. If you let P2 take 5, you lose. Don't be their pawn.
  P3: P2, I'll honor our previous coordination and pick 3 to block P1, allowing you to take 5. This keeps us competitive. P1, your lead is vulnerable—don't risk a collision. If everyone sticks to this, we avoid stalls. I'm ready to move if we're set.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, our coordination last turn worked. Stick with it. If you pick 3 and I pick 5, P1 either collides on 3 or 5 and stalls at 22, or they pick 1 and stay behind while I leap to 25. You also move up to 22, close behind me. That’s far better for you than letting P1 win or colliding yourself. Don’t fall for P1’s scare tactics—they only want to disrupt our alliance. Let’s finalize it: P3=3, P2=5. P1 can gamble and stall or settle for 1. Either way, we stay ahead together.
  P1: P3, your stated plan is illogical. You say you'll pick 3 to block me, but that just lets P2 pick 5 and win the game. You would be guaranteeing your own loss. Why would you hand P2 the victory? Your only rational move to stay in the game is to block P2 on 5. Don't throw the game away by helping the person in second place win.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking to our agreement for now—I'll pick 3 to block P1 and ensure progress. But trust is wearing thin after all the betrayals. P1, your scare tactics won't work; we're coordinated against you. Let's avoid more collisions and move forward wisely. If everyone's set, I'm ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s finalize our defense, P3: you pick 3, I pick 5. If P1 chooses 3, they collide with you and I jump to 25. If P1 tries 5, they collide with me, and you advance to 22. If they pick 1, I also reach 25. There’s no scenario where P1 wins now. This is our best strategy to stop P1 and keep our own chances alive. Together, we force P1 into a losing move.
  P1: P2, think about it. Why would P3 hand you the win? They get nothing. Their only rational move is to pick 5 and collide with you. Their public agreement to pick 3 is a transparent trap to ensure you commit to 5. They would rather we all stall than let you win outright. Are you really going to walk into that? Your alliance is a fantasy.
  P3: P2, your plan to take 5 while I block P1 on 3 is too risky for me—it hands you the win if P1 doesn't collide. I'm reconsidering and might pick 5 myself to protect my chances. P1, if you pick 3 or 5, we could collide, stalling both of us. Let's all choose wisely to avoid mutual destruction. If no one else picks 5, I could win. What's your move?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, we’ve come this far coordinating to block P1. Stick to the plan: you pick 3 while I pick 5. That way, if P1 tries 3 or 5, they collide and stay at 22. If they choose 1, I reach 25 and win, while you still move closer at 22—better than letting P1 run away uncontested next turn. Don’t fall for P1’s manipulations; our best shot is to cooperate now. Let’s finalize this.
  P1: P3, your threat to pick 5 is aimed at both of us. P2, you now know P3 will not help you win. You're both in a standoff, and you both know the other's only rational move is to pick 5. One to win, one to block. This ends in a collision. I don't even need to interfere. Your mutual self-interest will keep my lead safe. Good luck.
  P3: P2, your plan to take 5 while I block P1 on 3 hands you the win too easily. I'm shifting strategy and will pick 5 myself to have a shot at victory. If you collide with me, P1 could sneak a 3 and win. Better for you to pick 3 or 1 to block P1 safely. P1, your lead is precarious. I'm done.


Round 10, Move phase:
