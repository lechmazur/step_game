If we both pick 5, we risk a tie or collision with P3. Let\u2019s coordinate: I\u2019ll take **3**, you take **1**, and we block any attempt by P3 to sprint with 5. P3, if you take 5, you stall. If you take 1 or 3, we all advance, but I stay just ahead. Let\u2019s keep it clean\u2014but I won\u2019t hesitate to block if needed."}
