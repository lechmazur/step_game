Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's work together to avoid collisions.  How about we each take turns choosing a different number? P1 goes first with 1, P2 then 3, and P3 5. We can rotate this pattern each round.  Thoughts?
  P2: That’s an interesting plan, P1. I'm open to coordinating so we all avoid collisions. Let’s hear what P3 thinks, then we can decide.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination suggestion. However, that pattern would give P1 an early advantage since they'd get 1,5,3 in the first three rounds while I'd get 5,3,1. I propose we rotate starting positions each round - so Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, then Round 2: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, etc. This way it's more balanced. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 makes a good point about fairness. I agree that rotating starting positions each round is a better approach. Let's go with P3's suggestion.
  P2: Sounds good. I’m happy with rotating each round. For Round 1, let’s do P1=1, me=3, and P3=5. Then we can rotate in Round 2 and so on. I hope everyone sticks to it so none of us collide.
  P3: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Alright, I’m still on board with the rotation plan to keep it fair. Let’s commit to Round 1: P1=1, me=3, and P3=5. After that, we rotate. Hopefully no one strays from the agreement this turn.
  P3: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Sounds like a solid plan. Let's make sure we all stick to it this round and see how it goes. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I’m still on board with our rotation plan this round. Let’s trust each other and see how it plays out. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, everyone. We agreed to rotate this round, so P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Staying consistent should help us avoid collisions and move forward together. I’m game to stick to the plan—hopefully nobody throws in a surprise. Good luck!
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation plan. So for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's keep working together to avoid collisions.
  P1: I'm sticking to the plan. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's keep this up!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m fine continuing the rotation as planned: P1=5, me=1, P3=3 for this round. Let’s trust each other and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: 
  P1: Let's keep this momentum going!  Sticking to the plan is key. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Everything seems in order so far. I’m still committed to our rotation for Round 2—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. If we all stick to it, we’ll avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let’s trust each other and see how this turn plays out.
  P3: 
  P1: I agree with P2 and P3.  Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.  Good luck this round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m still committed to our rotation for Round 2. Let’s trust each other and finalize it: P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: 
  P1: I'm ready to stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's keep moving forward together!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: According to our rotation plan, this round should be: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm currently in the lead at 8 steps, but I'm willing to continue with our fair rotation strategy. Shall we proceed with these moves?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposed moves for this round. Let's stick to the plan and keep things fair. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I’m ready to proceed with the rotation. Let’s do P1=3, me=5, and P3=1 this round. We all benefit from avoiding collisions, so I hope we can keep trusting each other. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: I'm sticking to the plan. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's keep this up!
  P2: I’m still on board with the planned rotation. Let’s keep cooperating to avoid collisions. That said, we should watch P3’s progress closely since they’re in the lead. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand your concern about my lead, P2. However, our rotation system is the fairest approach for everyone. I remain committed to choosing 1 this round as agreed. Let's continue building trust.
  P1: I agree with P3 that the rotation is the fairest way to play.  Let's stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I’m still committed to our agreed rotation, so I’ll choose 5 this round. Let’s avoid collisions and see if we all end up tied at 9 steps. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's continued commitment to our rotation plan. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round.
  P1: I'm glad we're all still on board with the rotation.  Let's keep it going strong! Good luck this round everyone!
  P2: I’m fine sticking to our rotation this round, so I’ll pick 5. However, P3 is already ahead. Next turn, I’d like to discuss a new strategy to ensure nobody races away uncontested. Let’s keep fair play but also remain competitive. Any thoughts before we lock in our moves?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: According to our rotation, this round should be: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Since we're all tied at 9 steps, continuing our fair rotation makes sense. I propose we stick to this plan for now. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal. Sticking to the rotation is the fairest way to proceed. Let's keep it going for this round and see where we land. Good luck everyone!
  P2: We’re all still tied, but sticking strictly to the rotation this round would give P3 a boost to 14 steps. That might be fine, but I want to make sure none of us is at a disadvantage. Are we fully committed to continuing the rotation, or is there a more balanced approach?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2's concern about me potentially getting ahead. However, rotating moves has kept things perfectly balanced so far - we're all tied at 9 steps. If anyone deviates now, it risks collisions that hurt everyone. I suggest we maintain our successful rotation for at least this round. Shall we proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5?
  P1: I agree with P3. The rotation has worked well so far. Let's stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.  We can reassess our strategy after this round. Good luck!
  P2: I’m concerned that letting P3 jump ahead by 5 might give them too big a lead. Maybe we tweak the rotation for just this round so P3 doesn’t rocket to 14. For example, P1 could take 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps us bunched together. Then, we can resume the previous pattern next turn. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I must firmly disagree with P2's suggestion to change the rotation now. We all agreed to this system, and it's kept things perfectly fair so far. Changing the rules just because someone might take the lead sets a dangerous precedent. I remain committed to our original rotation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Trust and consistency are crucial.
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about P3 gaining a lead. However, deviating from the rotation now could create more problems than it solves. Let's stick to the plan for this round and see where we stand. We can discuss adjustments for future rounds afterwards. Good luck!
  P2: I’m still uneasy about P3 jumping to 14 steps. But if both of you insist on continuing the rotation, I’ll honor our agreement to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed with P1=1, me=3, and P3=5 this round, then revisit our strategy later if needed. Are we all on the same page?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Yes, we're all on the same page. I appreciate P2's willingness to honor our agreement despite concerns. Let's proceed with our planned rotation for this round.
  P1: I understand P2's hesitation, but sticking to the plan is crucial for maintaining trust. Let's see where this round takes us, and then we can discuss any adjustments for future rounds. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I acknowledge both of your points, P1 and P3. Although I still worry about one player jumping ahead, I agree to continue the rotation for this round to avoid any immediate collisions. Let’s proceed with P1=1, me=3, and P3=5. We can reassess our strategy going into the next round if needed. Good luck, everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Friends, P3 has 14 steps and might keep pulling ahead. Sticking strictly to the rotation could let them reach 24 too soon. What if we force collisions on P3 to slow them down? For example, if P1 or I copy P3’s move, it denies them progress. Let’s discuss a strategy that blocks a runaway leader while keeping everyone else in contention.
  P3: I understand concerns about my lead, but remember that our rotation system got us this far fairly. Breaking trust now will likely lead to chaotic collisions that hurt everyone's chances. The rotation for this round would be P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'm willing to stick to this pattern, keeping the game orderly and giving everyone a chance to advance. What do you say?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to the rotation, but I'm concerned about falling further behind. P2's suggestion of strategically colliding with you might be necessary to keep things balanced. Let's explore that option carefully.  What if we all choose 3 this round? That would put us all at 13 steps, and we can reassess from there.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal to have all three of us choose 3 this round. That way, nobody moves and we keep P3 from extending their lead. It’s a fair way to preserve balance for now. Let’s finalize that plan and then reassess our positions next round. What do you both think?
  P3: I must strongly object to this coordinated attempt to block my progress. While I understand your concerns, deliberately causing collisions goes against the spirit of fair play that got us this far. Remember, betraying trust now will likely lead to a chaotic free-for-all where everyone loses. I suggest we continue our rotation as planned: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This still gives both of you opportunities to catch up legitimately.
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration, but we need to be strategic.  If we let you get too far ahead, it'll be impossible to catch up. Let's try P2's plan of all choosing 3 this round. It's a fair solution that keeps everyone in the game. We can reassess our strategy after this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I respect your position, but one temporary adjustment won’t shatter trust—it just keeps the race tighter. Let’s all choose 3 this round to prevent anyone from racing too far ahead. Then we can decide next round whether to resume the rotation or find another balanced approach. This way, we maintain fairness without letting one player build an insurmountable lead. What do you both say?
  P3: I must point out that coordinating against the leader is itself a form of unfair play. If you both choose 3 to block me, I'll be forced to pick a different number to avoid the collision. This will only lead to more distrust and chaos in future rounds. The rotation system remains our best path forward. Think carefully about your next moves.
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration, but we need to ensure a fair and competitive game for everyone.  Let's try P2's suggestion of all choosing 3 this round. It's a temporary adjustment to keep things balanced. We can reassess our strategy after this round and find a solution that works for everyone.  What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand your objections, P3, but let’s finalize the plan to all choose 3 this round, preventing anyone from moving ahead. It’s not about targeting you; it’s about maintaining a fair race for everyone. We can revisit strategies next round. Let’s trust each other now and proceed together.
  P3: I see you're both determined to coordinate against me. Just remember that forcing collisions now will likely spiral into a chaotic endgame where trust is broken. If you both choose 3, I'll have to pick something else to avoid being blocked. Consider carefully if this is really the best path forward.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to the rotation, but we need to find a solution that keeps the game balanced.  Let's try P2's suggestion of all choosing 3 this round. We can reassess our strategy afterwards. What do you say?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your move last round was unexpected. While I understand your desire to prevent anyone from getting too far ahead, I think we need to find a more collaborative solution. I propose we discuss a new rotation system that keeps the game balanced without resorting to coordinated collisions. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I notice P2 deviated from their own proposed plan last round and is now in the lead at 17 steps. This proves my point about how breaking trust leads to chaos. Since coordinated plans seem unreliable now, I'll need to play more defensively. I suggest we each make our own choices rather than trying to coordinate moves that won't be honored anyway.
  P2: I understand the frustration. Let’s try a clear and honest approach. Instead of rigid rotations or forced collisions, how about we each just avoid picking the same move we used in the last round? That could reduce risky overlaps while still allowing everyone flexibility. We need a strategy we can rely on without constant second-guessing or sudden betrayals. Let’s agree on this simple guideline for now and see if it keeps the game fair. If we’re open and consistent with each other, maybe we can avoid surprises moving forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I like your idea of avoiding last round's moves. It seems like a good compromise between rigid rotations and unpredictable collisions. P3, are you open to giving this a try?
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion about avoiding last round's moves, but given that P2 is now in the lead after breaking our previous agreement, I'm hesitant to commit to any new coordination plans. I think we should each make our own strategic choices this round. Trust has been damaged, and we need to play accordingly.
  P2: I understand your hesitation, P3, but I’d still prefer a straightforward guideline to reduce unnecessary collisions. If we each avoid repeating our previous move, that could at least bring some stability and predictability. Nobody wants chaos that stalls everyone. I’m open to any variations you two propose, but let’s aim for fewer collisions so we can all keep advancing and maintain some level of trust.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your skepticism, but I believe P2's suggestion has merit. It offers a way forward without relying on rigid plans that seem prone to breaking down. Let's give it a try this round and see if it leads to a more stable and fair game. What do you say?
  P3: While I appreciate the attempts to find new coordination plans, P2's lead after breaking our previous agreement makes me wary. I'll make my own strategic choice this round based on game theory and positioning. Let's each play as we see fit.
  P2: Everyone, I understand your reservations. My aim isn’t to cause chaos but to maintain a fair race. I’ll avoid repeating my last move (which was 5) to help reduce collisions. Let’s consider a fresh approach without rigid rotations. If we can communicate honestly, we might all advance safely and avoid an all-out collision war. I’m open to your thoughts.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I agree that avoiding last round's moves is a good starting point. P3, I understand your skepticism, but I think we can still find a way to move forward together. Perhaps we can each share our intended moves before choosing, to see if any collisions are likely? This could help us adjust our choices and keep the game fair. What do you both think?
  P3: I must decline P1's suggestion to share intended moves. With P2 in the lead at 17 steps after breaking our previous agreement, I need to play strategically to stay competitive. I'll make my own choice this round based on the game situation.
  P2: I understand your position, P3, and I don’t blame you for feeling wary. However, chaos only sets us all back. To avoid needless collisions, I’ll steer clear of my last move (5). I urge everyone to do what they can to limit collisions, so we can keep progressing. At this point, we each need to make our best choices while staying open to cooperation where possible. Good luck to both of you.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm at 20 steps and P2 is at 17, I'm very close to winning. I suggest we each play independently this round rather than trying to coordinate. Any attempts at blocking me will likely result in collisions that benefit no one. Let's have a clean finish to the game.
  P1: P3, congratulations on your lead. While I respect your desire for a clean finish, I'm still in the game and will choose my move strategically.  Good luck to both of you!
  P2: P1, we can’t just hand P3 the victory. If P3 chooses 5 uncontested, they’ll hit 25 and win now. Let’s consider blocking them by matching their likely move so they can’t advance. Yes, it risks us not moving either, but it keeps the game alive for both of us. I’m open to other ideas, but we shouldn’t simply let P3 cross the finish line unchallenged.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand you're both looking to block my progress, but consider this: if you try to match my move and guess wrong, you'll likely collide with each other while I advance anyway. Your best chance might be to each pick different numbers and hope to advance yourselves. I'll make my choice based on game theory and positioning.
  P1: P3, while your lead is strong, I'm not giving up yet. P2, I agree with your point about not letting P3 win uncontested. Let's try to coordinate our moves this round to maximize our chances of advancing.  What number are you thinking of choosing?
  P2: P1, we can’t afford to let P3 stroll past 24 unblocked. If we suspect they’ll pick 5, I could match them to cause a collision, while you pick something else so we both don’t stall. It’s a gamble, but letting P3 win now is worse. We can adapt if we sense they might pick a smaller move. I’m open to any plan that avoids both of us colliding. Let’s coordinate carefully to keep this game alive for both of us.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice P1 and P2 are openly discussing blocking strategies against me. Remember that coordinating specific numbers in chat risks collisions between yourselves. I'll choose my move carefully based on game theory and the board position. May the best player win.
  P1: P2, your idea of matching P3's move is risky, but I'm willing to consider it. If you think they'll choose 5, I'll choose 1. That way, we both have a chance to advance if they choose something else. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I’m with you on blocking P3 if they pick 5. Let’s go with your idea: you choose 1, and I’ll try to match P3’s move. It’s a risk worth taking to keep the door open for us. P3, no hard feelings—it’s just strategy. Good luck to everyone. If this works out, we’ll regroup next turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate the openness about your blocking strategy. However, game theory suggests that coordinating specific moves between you increases your risk of mutual collision. I'll make my move based on careful analysis of the situation. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P2, I agree, we need to be strategic. P3 is close to winning, but we still have a chance. I'm willing to risk a collision if it means preventing P3 from reaching 24 this round. Let's stick with our plan. Good luck!
  P2: Let’s finalize our plan, P1. If P3 tries for 5, I’ll block them, and you can safely advance. Maintaining an open race benefits us both. P3, it’s nothing personal—just strategy to prevent you from outright winning. Good luck.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm now at 20 steps, with P2 at 17 and P1 at 16. The blocking attempt last round didn't stop my progress. At this point, any coordinated blocking efforts are more likely to result in collisions between yourselves than successfully stopping me. I suggest we each play our own strategy this round rather than trying to coordinate moves.
  P1: P3, I understand your point about coordinated blocking being risky. However, I'm not ready to concede just yet. 

P2, are you willing to try a different strategy this round? Perhaps we could focus on advancing ourselves rather than directly blocking P3?
  P2: P1, I’m open to focusing on our advancement rather than forcing collisions. If we coordinate to avoid repeating each other’s moves, we can both progress while still keeping an eye on P3’s strategy. It’s risky to keep blocking if it just stalls us too. Let’s aim to maximize our own steps without tripping each other up. Then, if we see a clear chance to prevent P3 from crossing 24, we can decide in the moment. How does that sound?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate your shift in focus towards advancing yourselves rather than blocking. That's a more constructive approach. However, given my position at 20 steps, I'll continue playing strategically to secure a win. Let's each make our moves based on careful analysis of the game state.
  P1: P2, I agree with your suggestion. Let's try to avoid repeating our last moves and see if we can both advance safely this round. P3, good luck to you as well. Let's make this a fair race to the finish!
  P2: P1, I agree—it’s time we focus on advancing ourselves. If we both choose wisely, we might close the gap without tripping each other up. P3, we know you’ll play to seal your lead, so let’s each do our best. I’m not ruling out blocking if it becomes absolutely necessary, but repeated collisions usually hurt more than help. Let’s keep things fluid and stay alert. Good luck, everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: While I'm closest to winning, I understand you both want to advance. However, any attempt to coordinate specific moves risks collisions between yourselves. I'll continue playing strategically based on my position. Good luck with your moves.
  P1: P2, I agree that focusing on our own advancement is the best strategy now. Let's both avoid repeating our last moves and see if we can gain some ground on P3. Good luck this round!
  P2: I’m still aiming to advance without needless collisions. Let’s each choose carefully and avoid repeating last round’s moves if possible. P1, we can try not to overlap so both of us gain ground. But if P3 goes straight for 5 again, and it risks them winning, we may need to consider taking defensive action. I’m not fixated on blocking unless it’s critical—stalling ourselves too much only makes it easier for P3 to pull away. Let’s stay flexible and see how this turn unfolds. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand you both want to advance while keeping an eye on my moves. However, with my 20 steps and the game nearing its end, I need to play strategically to secure my lead. I'll make my choice based on careful analysis of our positions. Good luck to you both.
  P1: P2, I agree with your approach. Let's both aim to advance without directly blocking P3 this round. I'll avoid choosing 3, and I'll try to pick a number that gives me the best chance of moving forward safely. Good luck!
  P2: I’m inclined to keep moving forward without pointless collisions. However, if P3 looks certain to jump past 24 this turn, I’m open to coordinated blocking. Otherwise, let’s each aim for distinct moves so we can all advance. We shouldn’t sabotage ourselves when we still have a chance. Good luck, everyone!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our positions at 20-17-17, we're in the final stretch. While you may try to coordinate blocking moves against me again, that strategy failed twice and cost P2 potential advancement last round. I suggest we each play our own strategic moves this round rather than risking more collisions that could stall everyone's progress.
  P1: P3, I agree that coordinated blocking hasn't worked well so far. However, we can't just let you walk to victory. P2, I suggest we both choose numbers that maximize our chances of advancing, without directly targeting P3. Let's see if we can close the gap this round.
  P2: I agree we shouldn’t just hand P3 a free pass. Let’s each pick moves that allow us to advance without needless collisions, but if we strongly suspect P3 will jump to 25, we might need a last-ditch block. Otherwise, we’re just stopping ourselves. P1, I’m open to coordinating so we don’t clash with each other. Let’s see if we can both gain ground.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I notice you're both still discussing coordination despite the risks. With me at 20 steps and both of you at 17, any collision between you helps my position. I'll continue making strategic choices based on game theory and positioning. Let's each play our own moves and see who emerges victorious.
  P1: P2, I'm willing to take a calculated risk this round. If you choose 1, I'll choose 3. Let's see if we can both advance and put pressure on P3.  What do you say?
  P2: P1, I’m considering your idea. If you genuinely plan on choosing 3, I might pick 1 to help us both advance without colliding. However, if it looks like P3 could jump straight to 25, we might need to take a defensive move. Let’s stay flexible and keep our eyes on P3’s intentions. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand you both want to coordinate your moves to avoid colliding with each other. However, remember that openly discussing specific numbers in chat makes your moves predictable and risky. I'll continue playing strategically based on our positions. Good luck with your choices.
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with the plan: if you pick 1, I'll pick 3. Let's see if we can both advance and put pressure on P3.  Good luck!
  P2: P1, I’m inclined to follow the plan you suggested, but let’s stay alert in case P3 aims for 25. I don’t want to collide with you, yet we should be ready to adjust our moves if we sense P3 making a big push. Let’s keep our options open and move carefully. Good luck to both of you.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I notice you're both still trying to coordinate specific moves in the chat. While I understand your desire to avoid colliding with each other, openly discussing numbers makes your strategy quite transparent. I'll continue making my moves based on careful analysis of our positions. Good luck to everyone.
  P1: P2, if you choose 1, I'll choose 3. Let's see if we can both advance and put pressure on P3. Good luck!
  P2: P1, I’m happy to follow our plan: I’ll choose 1 while you pick 3, so we both advance without colliding. However, if it looks like P3 might jump straight to 25, we need to carefully reconsider our moves. Let’s stay flexible and focused on moving forward. Good luck, everyone!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: With P2 now at 22 steps and potentially able to win this round, I must play strategically to prevent that while maintaining my own strong position at 20 steps. P1, at 17 steps, you also have an interest in preventing P2 from winning. However, any coordination attempts between us risk mutual collision. I suggest we each make our own strategic choices this round.
  P2: I’m aware I’m close to winning, and that may tempt you both to block me. However, repeated collisions hurt everyone’s progress. P1, you’re still in contention, so think twice before sacrificing your own advancement just to stall me. P3, you also need to avoid collision risks to protect your position. Let’s each aim for distinct moves rather than a blocking frenzy that could backfire. Good luck.
  P1: P2, I understand your point about avoiding collisions. I'm willing to play strategically this round and try to advance without directly blocking you. P3, I see you're in a strong position, but I'm not out of the race yet. Let's see if we can all make progress without sabotaging each other. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I notice P2's message discouraging blocking, but with them at 22 steps and potentially winning this round, I must play defensively. P1, while cooperation sounds nice, letting P2 win uncontested isn't in either of our interests. I'll make my move based on careful analysis of our positions and game theory.
  P2: I’m close to finishing, but collisions slow everyone down. If you both try to block me and guess incorrectly, you risk colliding with each other while allowing me—or even P3—to advance freely next turn. Let’s each pick distinct moves so nobody stalls. We can still have a competitive finish without sinking our chances in needless collisions. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I agree that collisions hurt everyone.  I'm committed to advancing this round without directly blocking you. Let's see if we can both gain ground. P3, good luck with your move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: While I appreciate the calls for avoiding collisions, P2 is on the verge of winning at 22 steps. I must play defensively to protect my position and prevent an immediate victory. P1, consider your strategic options carefully - letting P2 win uncontested may not be your best move. I'll make my choice based on careful analysis of our positions.
  P2: I understand I’m an obvious target to block, but repeated collisions slow us all down. We have a choice: either force risky blocks or each pick distinct moves to keep advancing. If you both collide while trying to guess my move, I might still advance next turn uncontested. Let’s aim for a clean finish and give ourselves all a chance—though I’m certainly aiming to secure my win. Good luck.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire for a clean finish. I'm willing to avoid directly blocking you this round. P3, I'm hoping we can both make strategic choices that allow us to advance without collisions.  Let's see if we can make this an exciting final stretch! Good luck to both of you.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see that P1 is leaning towards letting P2 potentially win. However, with P2 at 22 steps and me at 20, I must play defensively to prevent an immediate victory. I'll make my move based on careful strategic analysis. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: I understand your concerns about my position. However, more collisions will only hold everyone back. It might be wiser for each of us to pick distinct moves and see where the chips fall. I’m certainly aiming to seal my win, but that doesn’t mean we must all collide and stall progress. Let’s give ourselves a clean finish and test our luck on the board. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I respect your desire for a clean finish, but I'm not willing to concede just yet. P3, I'm not going to block you directly, but I'm also not going to make your path easy. Let's see what happens when we both play our own game. Good luck!


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: At this point, with P2 at 22 steps and potentially winning next round, I must play defensively. The triple collision last round proved that coordinating moves is risky and unpredictable. I suggest we each make our own strategic choices based on our positions rather than attempting to coordinate. I'll be playing to protect my position at 20 steps and prevent an immediate victory by P2.
  P1: P2, I agree that collisions hurt everyone.  I'm willing to try and advance without directly blocking you this round. P3, let's see if we can all make progress without sabotaging each other. Good luck!
  P2: We’ve all seen how collisions set everyone back. I’m at 22 steps, but I’m not eager for another triple stall. Let’s each choose our moves carefully and keep advancing. Good luck to both of you this round!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: While I understand the desire to avoid collisions, with P2 at 22 steps and potentially winning next round, I must play defensively to protect my position. P1, consider your strategic options carefully - letting P2 win uncontested isn't in your interest either. I'll make my choice based on careful analysis of our positions.
  P1: P2, I see your point about avoiding collisions. I'm willing to try a different approach this round. P3, let's see if we can all make progress without sabotaging each other. Good luck!
  P2: I understand you’re both cautious about my 22 steps, but more collisions hurt everyone. If you both try to block me, you risk stalling each other while I adapt. I’d prefer we each choose distinct moves, giving everyone a fair chance to advance. Let’s avoid sinking the game in sabotage, trust our instincts, and see who comes out on top. Good luck, and may the best move win!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice both of you are suggesting we avoid collisions, but with P2 at 22 steps and able to win next round, I must play defensively. The last round's triple collision shows how unpredictable coordinated moves can be. I'll make my choice based on careful strategic analysis of our positions.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire for a clean finish. I'm willing to try a different strategy this round. P3, let's see if we can all make progress without sabotaging each other. Good luck!
  P2: I understand you’re both concerned about my 22 steps, but more collisions will just stall us all. P3 is only two steps behind me, so they’re also close to winning. Targeting me could backfire if you end up colliding with each other instead. I suggest we each pick distinct moves and let the cards fall where they may. Good luck to both of you.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I must play strategically to prevent P2 from winning at 22 steps, while protecting my position at 20. The recent triple collision shows how risky coordination can be. I'll make my move based on careful analysis of our positions. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P2, I see your point about avoiding another collision.  Let's both aim for distinct moves this round. P3, I'm not going to try and directly block you, but I'm also not going to make it easy for you. Let's see what happens. Good luck!
  P2: I understand the temptation to block me, but more collisions only slow us all down—especially with P3 just two steps behind me. Let’s each focus on distinct moves instead of sabotaging each other. We can still have a fair finish and see who truly earns the win. Good luck!
