I think coordination is essential to avoid collisions and make efficient progress towards the goal. P3 proposed a rotation system, which I believe is a solid approach. It ensures that each player gets a chance to choose higher moves over time, promoting fairness.\n\nHere's a specific rotation plan I suggest for the first three rounds:\n\n- **Round 1:**\n\n- P1: <move>1</move>\n\n- P2: <move>3</move>\n\n- P3: <move>5</move>\n\n- **Round 2:**\n\n- P1: <move>3</move>\n\n- P2: <move>5</move>\n\n- P3: <move>1</move>\n\n- **Round 3:**\n\n- P1: <move>5</move>\n\n- P2: <move>1</move>\n\n- P3: <move>3</move>\n\nThis rotation allows each of us to choose each move option once every three rounds, ensuring balanced progress. After these three rounds, we can reassess and adjust the strategy if necessary.\n\nWhat do you think about this plan? If you agree, please confirm, and we can proceed accordingly. If not, perhaps we can discuss and modify it to suit everyone's preferences.\n\n**"}
