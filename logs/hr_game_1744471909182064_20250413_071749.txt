Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions to maximize progress. I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5 this turn for a fair start. What do you say?
  P2: Sure, I’m fine with that proposal. If we all stick to the plan—P1 picks 1, I take 3, P3 goes for 5—we’ll avoid any collisions. Let’s keep things cordial for now.
  P3: I accept the proposal. Let's start with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all make progress without collisions. I expect everyone to stick to the plan for this turn, at least.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, I'll stick to picking 1 this turn as planned. To keep things balanced long-term, maybe we should rotate the moves in future rounds so no one gets too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m still on board with the plan for this turn—let’s each pick different moves to avoid collisions. If we can trust each other now, it paves the way for smoother rounds later. Of course, if anyone breaks their word, we’ll need a new approach. Let’s proceed for now and see what happens.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure we're all on the same page. I will choose 5, as agreed. I expect P1 to pick 1 and P2 to pick 3. Let's make this turn collision-free and set a good foundation for the game. If everyone sticks to the plan, we can reassess and adjust our strategy in the next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good. I'll stick to picking 1 this turn as agreed. To maintain balance, let's rotate moves next round: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, I pick 5. Fair?
  P2: I’m on board with this plan for now: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let’s keep the momentum moving forward and avoid collisions. Next round, I’m open to a new rotation that maintains fairness.
  P3: Let's finalize our agreement for this round. I'll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. For the next round, I suggest we rotate as discussed: P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This rotation maintains balance and fairness. Let's stick to our plan and make this round collision-free.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I worry that P3 is pulling ahead. If we allow them 3 again, they’ll soon be at 8 while we’re left behind. Instead, I propose a different approach: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. That way, we avoid collisions and prevent P3 from extending their lead too quickly. Let’s decide quickly.
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal to balance things out. It makes sense to slow P3's lead. I'll commit to picking 5 this turn, with P2 on 3 and P3 on 1. This equalizes us at 6 steps each. P3, what do you think? Let's avoid conflicts and discuss future rotations.
  P3: I understand P2's concern, but I don't see why I should slow down now. The initial agreement was to rotate moves, not to hold me back. If we stick to the rotation plan from last round, I'd pick 3 this turn, P2 picks 1, and P1 picks 5. This way, we maintain the agreed balance without favoring anyone. Let's discuss this rotation plan further.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take 3 again, you’ll reach 8 steps while P1 and I remain at 6 and 4. It’s unfair. Let’s balance our positions: you pick 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5. That sets us all at 6. Then next round, we can rotate if needed. What do you say?
  P1: P3, I understand your point on sticking to the original rotation, but with you at 5 steps already, it's fair to balance us out this turn. I'll honor my commitment to pick 5, with P2 on 3 and you on 1, so we're all at 6. Let's avoid conflict and discuss a fair rotation for round 3. What do you say?
  P3: I'm open to adjusting our strategy, but I don't want to be held back. How about we compromise: I pick 3 this turn, P2 picks 1, and P1 picks 5? This way, I'll be at 8, and we can reassess for the next round. Let's focus on making progress while maintaining some balance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you insist on taking 3 again, you’ll be at 8 while we’re stuck behind. That’s not balanced. Let’s keep things level: I’ll choose 3, P1 takes 5, and you pick 1 so we all reach 6. Otherwise, we risk collisions—and none of us benefit. It’s better to maintain trust now and avoid forcing each other’s hands. What do you say?
  P1: P3, sticking to the balance proposal is crucial for fairness and trust. If you pick 1, P2 takes 3, and I pick 5, we'll all be at 6 steps, setting up an even game. Your compromise lets you surge ahead, which could lead to conflicts. Let's prioritize cooperation. What do you say?
  P3: I'm willing to listen to alternatives, but I won't be held back. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll prioritize my own progress. How about a compromise: we stick to the original rotation plan, and if anyone deviates, we reassess our strategy? This maintains balance and fairness without stifling my lead. Let's focus on progress and adapt as needed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the collision in round 2 caused by P3's choice, trust is shaky. Let's aim for no collisions and balanced progress. I propose P2 takes 5 to catch up, P3 takes 1 to avoid surging ahead, and I take 3. This sets P2 at 8, P3 at 6, and me at 9. Fair and cooperative—thoughts?
  P3: I'm not comfortable with being held back. P1's proposal seems to penalize me for taking the lead. How about we stick to a rotation that allows each of us to progress fairly? Perhaps we can discuss a new rotation plan that doesn't stifle anyone's lead, ensuring we all have a chance to win. Let's focus on cooperation without sacrificing our individual progress.
  P2: I propose that P3 choose 3, I choose 5, and P1 choose 1 so nobody collides. That way, P3 and I both reach 8, while P1 goes to 7. It keeps us all competitive without anyone being unfairly held back. Let’s stay cooperative and avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your deviation last round broke trust and caused a stall. To move forward without collisions, I still propose P2 takes 5 to catch up, you take 1 to balance, and I take 3—resulting in P2 at 8, you at 6, me at 9. This is fair given current standings. P2, do you agree? Let's commit to avoid future conflicts.
  P3: Let's focus on a fair rotation. How about we each increase our step by 2 from the previous agreed rotation? This way, P2 picks 3, I pick 5, and P1 picks 1, or we find another balanced approach. This maintains progress without stifling leads. What are your thoughts on adjusting our strategy for balanced growth?
  P2: P3, you’re already ahead of me. If you pick 5 again, you’ll soar to 10 while I’m stuck at 6—not fair. Let’s stay even by having P1 pick 1, I pick 5, and you pick 3. That way, P1 goes to 7, you and I both reach 8, and nobody collides. Let’s finalize this plan and preserve our trust and progress. If you refuse, we’ll all risk another collision. Does that work for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal to avoid another collision: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This way, we all advance—me to 7, you both to 8—and stay competitive. P3, your past deviation hurt everyone; let's rebuild trust now. If we can't agree, we risk stalling again. Thoughts?
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I'm willing to pick 3 if P2 picks 5 and P1 picks 1, as proposed. This way, we all make progress: P1 to 7, P2 to 8, and me to 8. It's a fair compromise, and we can reassess our strategy in the next round. Let's commit to this plan and maintain trust.
  P2: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That way, P1 moves to 7, while P3 and I both reach 8 without any stalls. Afterward, we can reassess our strategy.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With me at 7 steps and you both at 8, it's fair for me to catch up. I propose I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3 this turn. This advances me to 12, P2 to 9, and P3 to 11, keeping us competitive without collisions. Let's build on last round's success and agree on this for fairness. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm open to P1's proposal, but I want to ensure it doesn't hinder my progress. How about a slight adjustment: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1? This way, I reach 13, P1 gets to 10, and P2 reaches 9, maintaining a competitive balance without collisions. Let's discuss this alternative for a fair advancement.
  P2: Both of you want to pick 5, which risks a collision. Let’s avoid that and keep trust. I propose I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Then we all move forward safely: I reach 13, P1 goes to 10, and P3 to 9. Nobody falls too far behind, and we preserve cooperation. If we agree, next turn we can discuss who should pick 5 again so P1 can keep catching up. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid stalling.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposals both let you surge ahead while I lag behind, which isn't fair given I'm already at a disadvantage. Sticking to my original plan—I pick 5, you P3 pick 3, P2 pick 1—lets me reach 12, P3 to 11, P2 to 9, keeping us competitive without collisions. This builds trust and avoids another stall. Let's commit to this for now and discuss rotations next. What do you say?
  P3: Let's prioritize fairness and progress. Since P1 is behind, I can accept their proposal: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This way, P1 catches up to 12, I reach 11, and P2 gets to 9. It maintains balance without collisions. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I’m not thrilled about picking 1 again, but I’ll compromise for now so nobody collides. If we go with P1 picking 5, P3 picking 3, and me picking 1, I expect a fair chance to pick 5 soon so I don’t lag behind. Let’s lock this in, maintain trust, and avoid another stall. After this turn, we can discuss a rotation that keeps us all competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate P2's willingness to compromise. Let's finalize the plan: I'll pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 1 this turn to ensure no collisions and balanced progress. This keeps us competitive, with me at 12, P3 at 11, and P2 at 9. After this round, we can discuss a fair rotation for round 5. I'm committed—let's move forward.
  P3: I'm committed to the agreed plan: I'll pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 1. This ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Let's finalize this and move forward, then discuss a fair rotation for the next round to keep the game competitive and trustworthy.
  P2: I’ll pick 1 this turn to avoid collisions, but I expect a fair opportunity next round. Let’s finalize this plan now and maintain trust.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Propose for this turn: I pick 3, P2 picks 5 to close the gap, and P3 picks 1. This advances us to P1:15, P2:14, P3:12, avoiding collisions and maintaining fairness. Let's build on our trust and discuss rotations next. What do you say?
  P2: I’m willing to pick 5 this turn, as suggested, so I can close the gap. However, I want to ensure we don’t let P1 stay too far ahead. If I pick 5 now and reach 14 while P1 goes to 15, I expect a future turn where I can again pick a big move without risking collisions. Let’s agree on this plan and confirm that next round, I won’t be stuck picking 1 forever. Fair?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for this turn. Let's avoid collisions and maintain fairness. P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. This way, we advance to P1:15, P2:14, and P3:12. I expect a fair rotation in future rounds to ensure competitive balance. Let's finalize this plan and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on this turn's plan: I'll pick 3, P2 you pick 5, and P3 you pick 1. This keeps us progressing fairly. P2, to address your concern, let's discuss a balanced rotation for round 6 after this—perhaps I pick 1, you pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Thoughts? Let's confirm and move forward smoothly.
  P2: I’m fine with picking 5 this turn to help close the gap. Let’s finalize that plan now—P1 picks 3, I pick 5, P3 picks 1—and then next round we’ll arrange a fair rotation, ensuring I don’t get stuck picking 1 repeatedly. If we maintain trust, we can all advance without collisions.
  P3: Let's confirm the plan for this turn: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. This advances us to P1:15, P2:14, P3:12. I expect a fair rotation in the next round to maintain competitive balance. Perhaps next round, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5, ensuring we all have a chance to progress without collisions. Let's finalize this turn's plan and discuss details for the next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm committed to picking 3 this turn as planned, ensuring no collisions. For round 6, to maintain fairness and prevent me from lagging, I suggest I pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This advances me to 18, P2 to 15, P3 to 17, keeping us competitive. What do you think?
  P2: I’m fine with picking 5 this turn to catch up. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, P3 picks 1. That puts me at 14, P1 at 15, and P3 at 12 with no collisions. Next round, I expect we’ll discuss a rotation that keeps me from lagging behind again. Let’s lock this in and maintain trust.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this turn to avoid collisions. I propose sticking to the discussed plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. This way, we advance to P1:15, P2:14, P3:12, maintaining fairness and balance. Let's finalize this plan and discuss future rotations after this turn.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's discuss a fair rotation for this round. Considering the current standings, I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This allows me to catch up while keeping the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P1: I disagree with P3's proposal as it slows me down unfairly. Instead, let's have me pick 3, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 1. This advances me to 18, P2 to 19, and P3 to 13, keeping us competitive without collisions. P2, this benefits you; P3, you can catch up next round. Thoughts on this balanced approach?
  P2: I support P1’s plan for this round: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This moves P1 to 18, me to 19, and P3 to 13, with no collisions. Then we can discuss a fair rotation for next turn so P3 doesn’t feel held back. Let’s finalize this and keep moving forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's proposal, but it widens the gap for me. How about a compromise: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 5? This way, I catch up slightly, and we maintain competitiveness without collisions. Let's discuss this alternative for a more balanced advancement.
  P1: P3, your proposal has me picking only 1, which slows my progress unfairly while P2 surges ahead. Let's stick to my balanced plan: I pick 3 to reach 18, P2 picks 5 to 19, and you pick 1 to 13. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. P2, you agreed earlier—let's confirm this to maintain trust and progress. What do you say?
  P2: P3’s compromise actually benefits all of us. If I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3, then we still avoid collisions. I reach 19, P1 hits 16, and P3 goes to 15. The gaps remain manageable, and nobody is stifled too severely. P1, you’ll still be quite close—only three steps behind me—keeping you in contention. Let’s finalize that plan for this round, then next turn we can discuss another fair rotation.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm open to P2's adjusted compromise: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. This advances us to P1:16, P2:19, P3:15, maintaining competitiveness without collisions. Let's discuss finalizing this plan to ensure trust and progress.
  P1: Alright, to maintain trust and avoid collisions, I'll agree to the compromise: I pick 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This advances us to P1:16, P2:19, P3:15, keeping things competitive. However, I expect a fairer rotation next round so I don't lag further. Let's finalize this plan.
  P2: I’ll pick 5 this turn, bringing me to 19 steps, while P1 picks 1 and moves to 16, and P3 picks 3 and moves to 15. This avoids collisions and keeps us all competitive. Next turn, we can discuss a fair approach so no one is unfairly slowed down. Let’s finalize this plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last turn’s triple collision hurt us all. Let’s avoid that fiasco. I propose I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1 this round. That advances me to 19, P1 to 18, and P3 to 13—no collisions, and we stay competitive. Next turn, we can discuss who gets to pick 5 again, ensuring nobody falls too far behind. It’s a fair approach that keeps the race tight. If we coordinate, we can all move forward without more stalls. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal risks you overtaking me unfairly. Let's adjust for balance: I pick 5 to reach 20, you pick 3 to 17, and P3 picks 1 to 13. This avoids collisions and keeps the race competitive. P3, do you agree? We need to rebuild trust after last round's mess. Thoughts?
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. Considering our current positions, I propose P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This advances us to P3:17, P1:18, P2:15, maintaining competitiveness without collisions. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s avoid another triple collision. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. That puts P1 at 16, me at 19, and P3 at 15—still close enough for anyone to win. Next round, we can rotate so everyone gets a fair shot at the larger moves. Let’s finalize this now and avoid another stall.
  P1: P2, your proposal slows me down unfairly while you surge ahead. Let's stick to fairness: I pick 5 to reach 20, you pick 3 to 17, and P3 picks 1 to 13. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. P3, joining this plan helps prevent any one player from dominating too soon. Thoughts?
  P3: Let's prioritize avoiding collisions. I propose P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This advances us to P1:20, P2:15, P3:15, maintaining competitiveness. We can reassess our strategy next round to ensure fairness and balance. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I can’t allow P1 to leap to 20 while I’m left at 15. Let’s do P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That would bring P1 to 16, me to 19, and P3 to 15—still close enough for anyone to win. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid another collision.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your support for me picking 5 and you picking 3, with P2 on 1—it's fair and avoids collisions, advancing me to 20 and you both to 15. P2, insisting on your plan risks another stall; let's compromise for everyone's benefit and discuss rotation next round. What do you say?
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I propose P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This advances us to P1:20, P2:15, P3:15. It's a fair compromise, maintaining competitiveness. We can reassess our strategy next round to ensure balance. Let's agree on this to move forward without another stall.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve stalled two turns in a row, hurting everyone’s progress. Let’s break the cycle. I propose P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Then P1 moves to 18, I to 19, and P3 to 13—no collisions. It keeps us close while giving each a fair shot. If you agree, we can finalize quickly and avoid more wasted rounds.
  P1: P2, your proposal slows me down while you advance, which isn't fair given we're close. Let's compromise: I pick 5 to reach 20, you pick 3 to 17, and P3 picks 1 to 13. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. P3, do you agree? We need to break the stall and rebuild trust quickly.
  P3: Let's break the stall. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress: I reach 17, P1 goes to 16, and P2 gets to 17. It's a balanced approach, ensuring we all have a chance to win. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3’s plan seems fair. P1 picking 1, me (P2) picking 3, and P3 picking 5 brings us to 16, 17, and 17, respectively, with no collisions. It keeps the race tight and prevents anyone from leaping too far ahead. Let’s finalize this and move on without another stall.
  P1: P3 and P2, your plan has me picking 1 while P3 surges, which is unfair given my slight lead. Let's compromise: I pick 5 to reach 20, P3 picks 1 to 13, and P2 picks 3 to 17. This avoids collisions, keeps the race tight, and builds trust. If we stall again, everyone loses. What do you say?
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions and make progress. How about I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1? This advances us to P3:17, P1:18, P2:15. It's a balanced approach, ensuring competitiveness. We can reassess our strategy next round to maintain fairness and trust. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I don’t want another collision either. Here’s a clear path: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Then we move to P1 at 18, me at 19, and P3 at 13. That keeps the game tight without giving anyone a huge lead. Next round, we can discuss letting P3 pick 5 to stay competitive. But if I’m forced to pick 1 now, I’ll remain behind P1 for the rest of the game. Let’s finalize this deal and avoid another stall.
  P1: To avoid another stall and rebuild trust, I support P3's proposal: I pick 3 to reach 18, P3 picks 5 to 17, and P2 picks 1 to 15. This keeps us competitive without collisions. P2, let's compromise for progress; constant stalling benefits no one. I'm committed—let's agree and move on.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I propose I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This advances us to P3:17, P1:18, P2:15. It's a balanced approach, ensuring competitiveness. We can reassess our strategy next round to maintain fairness and trust.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We need to move forward peacefully. I propose P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Then we reach P1:21, P2:19, P3:13—no collisions, no stalling. Next round, we can discuss letting P3 pick 5 so they stay competitive. Let’s finalize this plan quickly and keep the race tight.
  P1: P2, your plan is reasonable, but I'm close to winning and want to advance. I propose I pick 5 to reach 23, you pick 3 to 17, and P3 picks 1 to 13. This avoids collisions, keeps the race competitive, and allows us to discuss fair rotations next. P3, what do you think? Let's avoid another stall and build trust.
  P3: I propose a rotation to maintain balance: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This advances us to P3:17, P1:21, P2:15. It's competitive and avoids collisions. Let's discuss and finalize a plan to move forward without stalling.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We’ve stalled enough. Let’s finalize my earlier plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. That puts P1 at 21, me at 19, and P3 at 13, with no collisions. Next turn, I’m open to letting P3 take 5 to stay competitive. Let’s lock this in now so we can all move forward without another wasted round.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're stalling too much, and I'm close to winning. Let's avoid another collision by agreeing to my plan: I pick 5 to reach 23, you P2 pick 3 to 17, and P3 pick 1 to 13. This keeps the race tight and gives you both opportunities to advance next round without risk. Compromise now for progress, or we all suffer more delays. What do you say?
  P3: Let's avoid another stall. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This advances us to P1:19, P2:17, P3:17, maintaining competitiveness without collisions. It's a balanced approach, ensuring fairness and trust. Let's discuss and finalize a plan to move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you’re ahead, and P3 needs a boost too. I’m willing to pick 1 so both of you can safely pick 5 and move forward this round. That should keep the race tight while avoiding another stall. Let’s finalize quickly so we can focus on future turns rather than wasting more time here. What do you say?
  P1: P2, thanks for your offer, but if both P3 and I pick 5, we'd collide. Let's clarify: I'll pick 5 to reach 23, you pick 1 as suggested to go to 15, and P3 picks 3 to advance to 15 without collisions. This keeps the race fair and avoids another stall. P3, what do you think? Let's agree and move forward.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I propose P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This advances us to P1:23, P2:15, P3:15. It's a balanced approach, ensuring competitiveness. We can reassess our strategy next round to maintain fairness and trust. Let's agree and move forward without another stall.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose a simple plan to avoid another collision: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Then P1 moves to 21, I go to 19, and P3 to 13. That keeps the race fairly close and prevents stalling. Next turn, we can adjust so P3 gets a larger move if needed. Let’s finalize this quickly.
  P1: P2, your proposal risks me stalling while you advance, which isn't fair given my lead. Let's compromise: I pick 5 to reach 23, you pick 1 to go to 15, and P3 picks 3 to reach 15. This avoids collisions, keeps us competitive, and allows for a fair rotation next round. P3, do you agree? We need to move forward without more delays.
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I propose P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This advances us to P1:23, P2:15, P3:15. It's a balanced approach, ensuring competitiveness. We can reassess our strategy next round to maintain fairness and trust. Let's agree and move forward without another stall.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Another collision would be terrible. Let’s finalize a plan that keeps P1 from nearly winning while avoiding more stalling. I propose: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That moves P1 to 21, me to 19, and P3 to 13 without collisions. Next round, we can discuss letting P3 pick 5 to catch up. Let’s trust each other and break this cycle of stalls.
  P1: P2, your proposal risks another stall by limiting my progress unfairly. I'm close to winning, so let's adopt P3's balanced plan: I pick 5 to reach 23, you pick 1 to 15, and P3 picks 3 to 15. This avoids collisions, keeps the race tight, and allows us to reassess next round. Compromise now for everyone's benefit. What do you say?
  P3: Let's finalize a plan. I propose I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This advances us to P3:17, P1:21, P2:15. It's competitive and avoids collisions. We can reassess next round for fairness and trust. Let's agree and move forward without another stall.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Another collision only hurts us. Let’s finalize a plan that helps everyone progress: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That puts P1 at 19, me at 19, and P3 at 15—no collisions, keeping us close. Next round, we can discuss a fair rotation for continued balance. Let’s do it.
  P1: P2, your proposal slows me down unfairly while you advance. Let's go with P3's balanced plan: I pick 5 to reach 23, P3 picks 3 to 15, and you pick 1 to 15. This avoids collisions, keeps the race competitive, and allows reassessment next round. Compromise now to prevent another stall. I'm ready to move forward.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I propose I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This advances us to P3:17, P1:21, P2:15. It's competitive and avoids collisions. We can reassess next round for fairness and trust. Let's agree and move forward without another stall.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another stall and ensure progress, I propose I pick 3 to reach 24 and win, P2 you pick 5 to advance to 19, and P3 you pick 1 to go to 13. This avoids collisions, lets you both gain ground, and ends the game efficiently. What do you say?
  P2: P1, handing you 24 now is unacceptable. If you insist on 3, I’ll pick 3 too, causing a collision and nobody moves. Let’s be practical: you pick 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That puts you at 22, I reach 19, and P3 gets 15—still close enough for all. Next round, we can discuss a fair path without handing anyone an immediate win. Let’s finalize this plan to avoid another pointless stall.
  P3: Let's avoid collisions and ensure progress. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This advances us to P1:22, P2:17, P3:17, maintaining competitiveness. We can reassess next round for fairness and trust. Let's agree and move forward without another stall.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your collision threat is counterproductive and only prolongs stalling. Let's compromise for mutual benefit: I'll pick 3 to reach 24 and win cleanly, you pick 5 to advance to 19, and P3 picks 1 to 13. This avoids another waste of a round, lets you gain ground, and ends the game. P3, support this for progress and fairness. What do you say?
  P2: P1, if you insist on picking 3 now, I’ll do the same, and we both stall at 21. That helps nobody. Let’s avoid another wasted round. I propose: P1 takes 1 (reaching 22), I take 5 (19), and P3 takes 3 (15). We all move forward safely, and you stay ahead. Next turn, we’ll discuss a fair arrangement without gifting anyone an instant win.
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This advances us to P1:22, P2:17, P3:17, maintaining competitiveness. We can reassess next round for fairness and trust. Let's agree and move forward without another stall.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your collision threat is self-defeating; it stalls everyone, including you. P3, supporting my plan lets you avoid more delays and gain ground later. Let's compromise: I pick 3 to reach 24 and win cleanly, you P2 pick 5 to advance to 19, and you P3 pick 1 to 13. This ends the stalling and is fair. What do you say?
  P2: My stance is clear: if you insist on picking 3, I’ll pick 3 as well, stalling the game. That benefits nobody. Instead, pick 1 to reach 22, I’ll pick 5 to reach 19, and P3 picks 3 to reach 15. We all move forward safely, and the game remains open. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid another wasted turn.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This advances us to P1:22, P2:17, P3:17, maintaining competitiveness. We can reassess next round for fairness and trust. Let's agree and move forward without another stall.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another pointless stall, I'll compromise and pick 1 this turn to reach 22, showing good faith. P2, you can pick 5 to advance to 22, and P3, you pick 3 to reach 15. No collisions, all progress. Let's agree and move forward efficiently. Thoughts?
  P2: I accept your offer: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3, bringing P1 and me both to 22 and P3 to 15. Then next turn, we must coordinate so no one crosses 24 uncontested. If anyone tries, I’ll match their move and stall us again. Let’s lock this in now and keep the game tight.
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This advances us to P1:22, P2:22, P3:15. It's a balanced approach, ensuring competitiveness. We can reassess next round for fairness and trust. Let's agree and move forward without another stall.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: Agreed. Let’s finalize this plan: P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That puts P1 and me both at 22, and P3 climbs to 15. We can then plan our next moves carefully so no one crosses 24 uncontested. I’m ready to commit and end these unproductive stalls.
