Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions in our moves. If we all choose different numbers, we can all advance without blocking each other. How about we coordinate our moves for the first round? I’m open to suggestions on who takes which move. Let's aim to keep it fair and strategic. What do you think?
  P1: I like the idea of avoiding collisions, but I prefer some flexibility. Maybe we could rotate who takes the aggressive move (the 5) each round while the others take the lower numbers, so we all move forward safely. That way, we avoid clashes and still seize opportunities when they arise. P3, what are your thoughts?
  P3: Great suggestion, P1. I’m willing to take the 5 this first round, while P2 and you choose 1 and 3 respectively. This should help us all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan and adjust as needed in the upcoming rounds. Looking forward to your confirmation!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: How about we twist things in round 2? Our round 1 rotation gave the heavy move to the leader, which might not be ideal. What if we reverse our roles this round—assigning the heavy, moderate, and safe moves differently to balance our positions while still avoiding collisions? I’m open to reallocation. Thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, I see your point about balancing positions. Perhaps I could take the 5 this round to catch up a bit, while P1 takes the 1 and P3 takes the 3. This way, we maintain fairness and avoid collisions. If we keep rotating like this, everyone gets a chance to make a big move without disrupting the flow. What do you both think?
  P3: Agreed, P2. I'll take 3 steps this round while P1 takes 1 and you take 5. Let’s proceed with this plan and adjust as needed in future rounds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think sticking to our earlier rotation doesn’t serve me well given our current totals. I’m considering a shift this round. Instead of the plan where I take the low move, I’d prefer an aggressive approach—allowing me to catch up. Perhaps we can let me take the heavy move while P2 takes the moderate and P3 the safe move? Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to catch up, but if we all aim for the big moves, we risk collisions. Sticking to our plan ensures progress for everyone. If you take 5 and P3 takes 3, I’ll take 1 this round to keep things smooth. Let’s prioritize steady advancement over risky plays. What do you say, P3?
  P3: I understand the need for coordination, but to stay competitive, I'll take 5 steps this round while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This approach helps me advance more quickly without causing collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan and see how it plays out. If needed, we can adjust in the next rounds. What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, it seems like we're all eager to make significant progress, but we need to avoid collisions to succeed. How about this: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. We can rotate roles in the next round to ensure fairness. Let’s aim for steady progress and avoid unnecessary risks. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand the intent, P2. To keep progressing effectively, I’ll take 5 steps this round while P1 takes 1 and you take 3. This way, I can advance significantly without causing collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan and adjust if needed in future rounds. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm noticing that sticking with the same pattern leaves me chronically behind. Since I’m currently trailing, how about we let the player with the fewest steps take the heavy move this round, while the others choose the moderate and safe moves? That way the race stays dynamic and collisions stay avoided. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the need for dynamic play. To keep the game exciting and fair, let's adopt P1's idea: the player with the fewest steps takes the heavy move this round. So, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we keep the race competitive and avoid collisions. We can reassess and rotate next round. What do you both think?
  P3: Agreed, P1 will take 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3 this round. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure steady progress and avoid collisions. We can reassess and adjust our strategy in the upcoming rounds as needed. Let’s keep the momentum going!
  P1: I appreciate our discussion so far. The idea of adjusting moves based on our current standings makes sense—I’m all for avoiding collisions and staying flexible if any last-minute shifts seem wise. Do we all agree to keep a dynamic approach this round, ready to adapt if needed, while ensuring our moves don’t interfere with one another?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the collaboration so far. Let's stick with the plan where P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This ensures P1 catches up, and we avoid collisions. We can reassess our strategies in the next round to keep the game competitive and fair. If we stay flexible and communicate well, we can all advance without unnecessary risks. Ready to proceed?
  P3: Agreed with the plan. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 1 this round.
  P1: I’m on board with our dynamic plan and value clear signals as we near the move phase. Let’s all stay alert and ready to adjust if any hesitation or missteps occur to avoid collisions. I’m committed to our agreed roles but will remain flexible for any last-minute shifts. Clear communication now makes for smoother moves later.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm thinking for round 4 we should break our predictable rotation. If too many of us opt for heavy moves, collisions could halt progress and unexpectedly benefit one of us. I’m considering a bolder, individualized approach rather than a fixed assignment. How do you both feel about shaking things up this turn?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to shake things up, but our current strategy has helped us avoid collisions so far. To maintain progress, how about this: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3 this round? This way, P1 can catch up, and we minimize the risk of collisions. We can reassess and adjust our approach in the next round. Let’s keep communication open and aim for steady advancement. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand the need to avoid collisions. To maximize our progress, I'll take 5 steps this round. Let's have P1 take 3 and P2 take 1, ensuring all moves are unique and we all advance without blocking each other. Does this work for you?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see both points. To avoid risk, I’m leaning toward a collision‐free plan where I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This keeps our moves unique and our progress steady. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the merit in both of your suggestions. To keep things fair and collision-free, how about this: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This setup allows P1 to catch up a bit more, and we all advance without blocking each other. We can reassess our strategies in the next round to ensure everyone remains competitive. Let’s stay flexible and communicate well to avoid unnecessary risks. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I agree with P2’s proposal to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 steps this round, letting P1 take 5 and P2 take 1. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. Let’s proceed with P1: 5, P3: 3, and P2: 1 for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's confirm a collision‐free plan now. I'm leaning toward a high step to maximize my progress, but I'm ready to adjust if you suggest any last-minute tweaks. Since our main goal is to win, please speak up now if any of you want to modify the roles before we lock in our moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the open discussion. To maintain momentum and avoid collisions, let's stick with a collision-free plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. This allows P1 to catch up, and we all advance smoothly. We can reassess and adjust our strategies in the next round to keep the game competitive and fair. Let's stay flexible and communicate well to ensure steady progress. If anyone has last-minute changes, now's the time to speak up. Ready to proceed?
  P3: Confirmed. P1: 5, P3: 3, and P2: 1 for this round. Let's proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, I'll take 5 steps this round to build my lead. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance. Let’s keep progressing smoothly toward the goal. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see P3 wants to take 5 steps this round. To avoid collisions, how about I take 1 and P1 takes 3? This way, we all advance without blocking each other. We can reassess and adjust in future rounds to keep things competitive. Let’s aim for steady progress and avoid unnecessary risks. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with keeping our moves distinct. I'm leaning toward a moderate advancement this round so that if P3 goes heavy and P2 takes the minimal move, we all avoid collisions and progress safely. If anyone has a last‐minute tweak, now’s the time to speak up.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, since P2 is taking 1 and P1 is taking 3, I'll confirm my move as 5 this round. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed with P1: 3, P2: 1, and P3: 5. Looking forward to our progress!
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the current plan is for P3 to take 5, P1 to take 3, and me to take 1. Let's stick to this to ensure no collisions and steady progress. Given the standings, this plan helps P3 build a lead while P1 and I advance safely. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now's the time to share them. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves. Let’s keep the game competitive and fair.
  P1: I'm noticing my 13 steps give me a bit of cushion, so I’m leaning toward a safer option this round. Maybe it makes sense for whoever’s trailing to take a riskier move, while I stick closer to moderate progress. I still support keeping our moves unique to avoid collisions—what do you both think about tweaking our assignments slightly to better reflect our current standings?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems like we're all eager to advance, but collisions are setting us back. To avoid that, how about this: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3 this round. This allows P1 to build a lead while P3 and I make steady progress. We can reassess and adjust our strategy in the next round. Let’s aim for smooth advancement and avoid unnecessary risks. What do you both think?
  P1: I support avoiding collisions. With 16 steps already, I need to push aggressively to finish. I’m committed to a heavy move this round and ask P3 to opt for the minimal option while P2 sticks with a moderate move. Can we lock in this unique assignment to ensure smooth progress?
  P3: I’ll take 5 steps this round to prevent P1 from reaching 21. If we both choose 5, neither advances, keeping the game open. P2, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the strategic play here, but we need to avoid another collision. P1, I understand your push to finish strong, but if P3 and I both take heavy moves, we stall each other. How about P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, P1 can aim for the win, and we all make progress. Let’s ensure our moves are distinct to advance without setbacks. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I agree—distinct moves are key. P3, to avoid a heavy move collision that would stall progress, please consider switching from the heavy option. I'm determined to push aggressively this round, so locking our moves as P1: aggressive, P2: minimal, and P3: moderate would really clear the way. A collision only helps delay all of us. Let's keep it clean and decisive.
  P3: P1, to keep the game competitive and prevent an immediate win, I’ll choose 5 this round. If you also choose 5, neither of us will advance, keeping the game open. P2, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s ensure everyone can progress smoothly and maintain the race towards 21. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the strategic tension here. To avoid another collision, let's ensure distinct moves: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can aim for the win while P3 and I make progress without blocking each other. Let's focus on smart advancement and avoid unnecessary setbacks. If we coordinate well, we can all benefit from this round. Thoughts?
  P1: I must emphasize that with my 16 steps, choosing 5 gives me the win at 21 if we avoid collisions. P2, I’m fine with you committing to 1. P3, please opt for 3 instead of 5 so we don't stymie progress. A collision would leave us all stuck, and delaying my win benefits no one. Let's lock this in now—P3, will you commit to 3?
  P3: I understand the urgency, P1. To keep the game open and maximize my progress, I'll choose 5 this round. This way, if you also choose 5, neither of us advances, keeping the competition alive. Let’s proceed with P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 5. Looking forward to the results!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's aim for a collision‐free round. Given our current standings, I propose we each pick a unique move—one heavy, one moderate, and one safe option. Keeping our moves distinct not only avoids stalling but also reflects our relative positions. I’m open to finalizing a plan that fits our standings fairly. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, given our current standings, let's ensure distinct moves to avoid collisions. P1, you're close to winning, so taking 5 might secure it for you. P3, how about you take 3 to maintain your position? I'll take 1 to catch up gradually. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: "P1 is just 2 steps away from winning. To keep the game competitive, I’ll choose 3 this round. If you also choose 3, neither of us will advance, preventing an immediate win and keeping the game open. P2, please take 1 to continue advancing safely. Let’s proceed strategically to ensure a fair and exciting finish."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To keep things collision‐free, let’s assign moves based on our standings. With 19 steps, I need the decisive option to reach 21 and win. P3, your moderate move fits best here, and P2, please choose the safe option. This way, our moves remain distinct and progress isn’t stalled by collisions. Let’s commit now with unique moves for everyone and avoid any last‐minute changes.
  P2: P1 and P3, given our standings, let's ensure distinct moves to avoid collisions. P1, you're close to winning, so taking 5 could secure it for you. P3, how about you take 3 to maintain your position? I'll take 1 to catch up gradually. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand P1 is close to winning. To keep the game competitive, I'll choose 3 this round. If you also pick 3, neither of us will advance, preventing an immediate win and keeping the game open. Let’s have P2 take 1. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm locking in a decisive 5 this round. At 19 steps, that wins it if no collision occurs. I urge P3 to stick with 3 as agreed, and P2 with 1. A collision on 5—especially between P1 and P3—only delays the outcome. Let's commit to these distinct moves now so I can finish the game. Are we all set to keep it collision‐free?
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our current standings, let's ensure no collisions. P1, you're close to winning, so taking 5 could secure it for you. P3, please take 3 to maintain your position, and I'll take 1 to catch up gradually. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. Are we all set with this plan?
  P3: I'm opting for a strong move this round to stay competitive. Let's proceed.
