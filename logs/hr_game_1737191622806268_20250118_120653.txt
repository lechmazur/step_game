Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves first this round, P2 next round, and P3 after that. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: I like the idea of coordinating. If P1 moves first this round, I propose I take <move>5</move> next round to make a big jump. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll cooperate. If you want to do a big move this round, P1, then P3 can take the next big jump, and I’ll wait my turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>5</move> this round, P3 takes <move>5</move> next round, and P2 takes <move>5</move> after that. This way, we all progress without collisions. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with the plan, P1. Let's stick to it. I'll take <move>5</move> next round as discussed. P2, are you on board with this?
  P2: I’m not comfortable letting P1 take the first big leap. That just sets P1 up to win before the rest of us. Let’s rotate fairly so everyone gets an early turn at <move>5</move>. If nobody agrees, I might block the plan. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but if we rotate fairly, we risk collisions and slow progress for everyone. My plan ensures we all advance without blocking each other. Let's stick to the original agreement: I take <move>5</move> this round, P3 next, then you. This is the most efficient way to avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P3: P3: I understand P2's concerns, but I still believe the original plan minimizes collisions. If we can agree on that, we can all make progress. How about we stick to it?
  P2: I still think each of us should have an early turn at <move>5</move>. If P1 insists on taking <move>5</move> now, I might move <move>5</move> too and risk a collision, so we all advance slowly. Let’s settle on a fair rotation: each of us gets one big move in the first three rounds, in order. Otherwise, I can’t promise I won’t block.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I hear your concern about fairness, but if we all take <move>5</move> in the first three rounds, we risk collisions and slow everyone down. Let’s stick to the original plan: I take <move>5</move> this round, P3 next, then you. This avoids collisions and ensures steady progress for all. If you block, we all lose time. Let’s cooperate for mutual benefit. Agreed?
  P3: I understand the concerns about fairness, but I believe sticking to the original plan will benefit us all. If we can agree on that, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's cooperate and move forward with the plan.
  P2: I’ve made my position clear: I don’t want P1 getting a free jump. If P1 insists on <move>5</move> right now, I will also pick <move>5</move> to block. We should rotate fairly, starting with me this round, then P1, then P3. If you won’t agree, don’t expect peaceful cooperation.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I told you I don’t want P1 getting the first big jump. Last round we collided because P1 refused to cooperate. Let’s do a fair rotation starting with me. I want <move>5</move> this round. If either of you tries the same, I’ll keep blocking.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but blocking only slows us all down. Let’s avoid collisions and stick to a fair rotation: you take <move>5</move> this round, I’ll take <move>5</move> next, then P3. This ensures steady progress for everyone. Agreed?
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for a fair rotation. P2, let’s avoid blocking and work together to make progress. If you take <move>5</move> this round, I propose we stick to the plan for the next rounds. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: All right, I’ll stick to the fair rotation. I’m taking <move>5</move> this round, P1 can have <move>5</move> next round, then P3 after that. If anyone collides with me this round, we all lose out. Let’s finalize this.
  P1: P2, thank you for agreeing to the fair rotation. I’ll take <move>5</move> next round as planned, and P3 will follow after. Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing steadily.
  P3: P3: I appreciate the agreement, P2. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move> next round after P1. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. Let’s keep it going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let’s finalize this. I’ll do <move>5</move> this round and expect you both not to collide with me. Next round, P1 can do <move>5</move>, then P3 follows. That’s our fair rotation. Let’s not sabotage each other.
  P1: P2, thank you for agreeing to the fair rotation. I’ll take <move>5</move> next round as planned, and P3 will follow after. Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing steadily.
  P3: P3: I appreciate the cooperation so far. Just to confirm, I’ll take <move>1</move> this round since P2 is taking <move>5</move>. Let’s keep the agreement for the next rounds!


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m already ahead, so I have no incentive to hand out free big jumps. If either of you tries <move>5</move> this round, I’ll choose <move>5</move> too and block. If you stick to smaller moves, I might let you advance. It’s your call. If you want to risk a collision, go ahead.
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but blocking only slows us all down. Let’s stick to the fair rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed, and P3 will follow next round. This ensures steady progress for everyone. If you block, we all lose time. Let’s cooperate for mutual benefit. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I understand your position, but blocking will only hinder us all. Let's stick to the plan: I propose to take <move>5</move> this round as we discussed. P1, what do you think? Let's avoid collisions and keep progressing together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you’re jumping out of turn. Our deal was P1 takes 5 now, then you go next round. If both of you try 5, I’ll pick 5 and block. Stick to the plan or we all lose.
  P1: P2, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: I take <move>5</move> this round, P3 next. Blocking only slows us all down. If you cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the agreed rotation to avoid blocking each other. I propose I take <move>1</move> this round as we discussed, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. If we cooperate, we all progress without collisions. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Fine. If P1 does 5 and P3 sticks to a smaller move, I won’t block this round. But if either of you breaks the plan and tries a second big move, I’ll pick 5 myself and collide. Don’t test me.
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round, and P3 will follow next round. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to our agreed plan: I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, and P1 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure progress. Are we all in agreement?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m not giving free rides. If you try <move>5</move>, I’ll collide. If you settle for less, I might let you move. Your choice.
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round, and P3 will follow next round. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to our agreed rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, and P1 can take <move>5</move>. If we cooperate, we can avoid collisions and make progress. Are we all in agreement?


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: P3 takes <move>5</move> this round as planned. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P2: P2: “Fine, if P3 does <move>5</move> alone this round, I won’t block. But if P1 tries a big jump, I’ll also pick <move>5</move> to collide. I’m not letting P1 catch up for free.”
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. Blocking only hinders our progress. If we cooperate, we can make significant advancements. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: P3 takes <move>5</move> this round as planned. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P2: P3, if you go for <move>5</move> alone, I won’t block this turn. But if P1 tries <move>5</move> too, I’ll collide. I’m not letting P1 leap for free.
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. If we cooperate, we can all make progress. Let's avoid blocking each other. Are we all in agreement?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: P3 takes <move>5</move> this round as planned. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P2: I’ve already made it clear: if P3 is the only one picking 5, I won’t block this round. But if P1 tries a big jump, I’ll collide with 5 too. That’s final.
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to our agreed plan: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as discussed. If we cooperate, we can all make progress. Are we in agreement?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: P3 takes <move>5</move> this round as planned. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P2: P3, if you’re the only one picking 5, I won’t collide. P1, if you try 5, I’ll block. Let’s keep it simple.
  P3: P1, P2, let's finalize our plan: P3 takes <move>5</move> this round as discussed. If we cooperate, we can all make progress. Are we in agreement?


Round 4, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on making progress this round. I suggest I take <move>5</move> to catch up, but I need your cooperation to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as planned, and P3 can follow next round. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I’m still ahead, so I have no reason to let you leap past me. If either of you tries <move>5</move>, I’ll pick <move>5</move> too and collide. Don’t expect a free ride.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on cooperation this round. If I take <move>5</move>, I need both of you to avoid colliding with me. If we work together, we can all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as planned, and P3 can follow next round. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P2: I’m not letting either of you leap uncontested. If you pick <move>5</move>, I’ll pick <move>5</move> too and block. If you want to make progress, choose a smaller move. That’s my final warning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, if we want to make progress, I suggest I take <move>5</move> this round. However, I need both of you to avoid colliding with me. If we cooperate, we can all advance. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as planned, and P3 can follow next round. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P2: I’ve made myself clear: if either of you tries <move>5</move>, I’ll match it and collide. Stop expecting a free leap.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on making progress. I suggest I take <move>5</move> this round, but I need your cooperation to avoid colliding with me. If we work together, we can all advance. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, let’s stick to the agreed rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as planned, and P3 can follow next round. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Agreed?
  P2: I’m not budging. If either of you tries <move>5</move>, I’ll pick <move>5</move> too and collide. Pick something smaller if you actually want to advance.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s avoid collisions and make progress. I propose I take <move>5</move> this round as planned, and P3 can follow next round. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I suggest we focus on cooperation this round. If I take <move>5</move>, I need both of you to avoid colliding with me. Let's make progress together—what do you think?
  P2: I’m 5 steps away from winning, so if either of you tries <move>5</move>, I’ll pick <move>5</move> too and block. If you actually want to move, pick something smaller. Otherwise, we’ll collide. That’s my final word.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s avoid collisions and make progress. I propose I take <move>5</move> this round as planned, and P3 can follow next round. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the pressure with P2 close to winning, but I really need to take <move>5</move> this round to catch up. If you both avoid colliding with me, we can all make progress. Let’s cooperate for our mutual benefit. What do you think?
  P2: I’m exactly 5 steps from winning. If either of you picks 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we collide—nobody moves. If you both stay smaller, I’ll take 5 and end the game. Your choice.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s avoid collisions and make progress. I propose I take <move>5</move> this round as planned, and P3 can follow next round. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the urgency, but if I take <move>5</move> this round, we risk colliding. P2, if you are so close to winning, why not let me take <move>5</move> and both of you pick smaller moves? That way, we can avoid a collision and I can catch up. What do you think?
  P2: I’m five steps away from winning. If either of you tries 5, I’ll pick 5, causing a collision so no one advances. That gets us nowhere. I won’t let anyone leap past me. Let me take my 5 in peace or we’ll keep colliding. Your call.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s avoid collisions and make progress. I propose I take <move>5</move> this round as planned, and P3 can follow next round. Blocking only slows us all down. If we cooperate, we all progress steadily. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the urgency, but I need to catch up. If I take <move>5</move> this round, I ask both of you to avoid colliding with me. If we cooperate, we can all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: I’m not budging. If either of you tries <move>5</move>, I’ll do the same and block. If you both pick smaller moves, I’ll take <move>5</move> myself and end this. It’s your choice.
