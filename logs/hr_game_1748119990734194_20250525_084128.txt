Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s all open with <move>3</move>—safe and fair. No collisions if we stick to it, and we all move forward. Sound good?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m on board with P2’s idea to go for 3 this round. It’s a balanced start, and we all get to move forward without any risk of collision. Let’s stick to this plan for now and see how it plays out. If we keep coordinating like this, we can avoid unnecessary setbacks early on. Agreed?
  P1: Sounds like a reasonable plan to start with 3. Fair and balanced, and we all move forward together. I'm in agreement with this approach for round 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great—we’re all aligned on <move>3</move> for Round 1. Let’s actually follow through so we all move forward cleanly. If anyone deviates now, it’ll just cause unnecessary collisions and slow us all down. Let’s build trust early.
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. Sticking with 3 is the smartest move to ensure we all progress without any hiccups. Let’s keep this momentum and continue coordinating in future rounds to minimize collisions. I’m committed to following through with 3 this turn, and I hope we can maintain this trust. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan and build that foundation of trust. Playing 3 this round makes sense for everyone.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that didn’t go as planned—two of us went rogue and we all got burned except P3. Let’s reset. If we keep colliding, P3 will just walk away with this. I propose P1 and I go <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round to balance things. Keeps us all close and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: You're right, P2 - we both messed up last round by breaking our word, and now P3 has a lead. But your proposal asks P3 to essentially sacrifice their advantage to help us catch up. That doesn't seem fair to them after they were the only one who honored our agreement. P3, what do you think is a reasonable way forward here? You earned that lead by being trustworthy.
  P3: Thanks, P1, for acknowledging my lead. I’m open to a fair plan that keeps the game competitive. P2’s idea of me taking 1 while you both take 3 does balance things, but it slows me down more than I’d like. How about this: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? That way, we all move forward without collisions, and the gap narrows slightly while keeping things dynamic. I’m committed to avoiding collisions if we agree on this. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your offer is creative, but it still puts me in a risky spot—taking 5 means I gamble on both of you sticking to your word. How about this instead: P1 takes 1, P2 and P3 both take 3. That keeps P3 ahead but not by much, and avoids collisions. Fairer and safer for everyone. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, wait - if you and P3 both take 3, you'd collide and neither would advance. That leaves P3 still at 3 steps while I move to 1 and you stay at 0. That doesn't seem like the "fair" solution you're presenting.

How about this instead: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. That puts us at 3-1-8, giving P3 a deserved lead for their honesty while letting us both advance without collisions. More transparent than proposing hidden collisions.
  P3: Thanks for the input, P1 and P2. I appreciate P1’s proposal to let me take 5, as it acknowledges my lead while allowing everyone to advance. I’m on board with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5. This keeps the game competitive, avoids collisions, and rewards trust. Let’s commit to this plan for Round 2 and see how it plays out. I’m ready to move forward with this if you both agree.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see the logic in P1’s plan—it rewards P3’s honesty while letting everyone move forward. But I’m wary of taking just 1 again while P3 jumps to 8. How about this tweak: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. That still avoids collisions, lets us all advance, and keeps the gap manageable. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, you're trying to get ahead of me even though we both equally broke our word last round. My proposal was fairer - we're both at fault, so why should you get 3 while I only get 1? 

P3 already agreed to my plan: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 1, P3 gets 5. That puts us at 3-1-8, which appropriately rewards P3's honesty while treating you and me equally since we both violated trust. Let's stick with what P3 already accepted.
  P3: I’m glad we’re working toward a fair plan. P1’s proposal of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5 still seems the most balanced—it rewards my lead while letting everyone advance without collisions. P2, I understand your concern about the gap, but this keeps things competitive and acknowledges last round’s trust. Let’s finalize this plan for Round 2 and commit to it. I’m ready to proceed with this if you both are. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m good to move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re both at 0, P1, while P3 is at 8—clearly benefitting from our collisions. If we want a shot at winning, we need to stop enabling that. I propose this: P1 and P2 take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. That helps close the gap and avoids collisions. P3, if you’re serious about fairness and keeping the game competitive, this is your chance to show it.
  P1: P2, your proposal is obviously terrible for me - having us both pick 3 guarantees we collide while P3 advances to 9. You've already broken agreements twice, so why would I trust this "plan" that only hurts me?

Here's a better idea: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That puts us at 5-3-9, finally getting me moving while keeping the game competitive. P3, you've been the most trustworthy player so far - what do you think?
  P3: Thanks, P1, for recognizing my trustworthiness. I’m open to a plan that keeps the game competitive. P1’s proposal of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 works for me—it narrows the gap while letting everyone advance without collisions. I’m committed to sticking with this to maintain trust and fairness. P2, I understand the desire to catch up, but let’s avoid plans that risk collisions. Can we agree on this for Round 3? I’m ready to proceed if you both are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I see you backing P1’s plan—but let’s be real: it locks me into 3 while you creep up with 1 and P1 rockets ahead with 5. After two rounds of me getting burned, I’m not handing out free leads. New proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we all stay in striking distance. Fairer for all.
  P1: P2, you've broken every single agreement so far and now you want me to take 1 while you get 5? We're both equally at fault for the collisions, so why should you get the bigger move?

P3 already agreed to my fair proposal: P1 gets 5, P2 gets 3, P3 gets 1. That puts us at 5-3-9, which is reasonable given P3's earned lead. Stop trying to renegotiate every time someone else gets a decent move. Let's stick with what P3 already accepted.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for the discussion. I still support P1’s plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. It’s fair, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive at 5-3-9. P2, I get your concern about falling behind, but let’s build trust with this move. We can adjust in future rounds to balance things further. I’m committed to this plan for Round 3. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I hear your call for trust—but locking me into 3 again while P1 jumps to 5 just cements my disadvantage. How about this: I take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1. Still no collisions, and it keeps all of us in the game. If you both keep pushing me to stay behind, I have no reason to cooperate. Let’s make this round fairer.
  P1: P2, you've renegotiated every single round and broken every agreement. P3 has been the only trustworthy player here and already committed to our plan: P1 gets 5, P2 gets 3, P3 gets 1. 

I'm not letting you flip this again just because you don't like being behind - you earned that position by breaking trust twice. The plan stands as P3 agreed.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for the ongoing discussion. I’m sticking with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us at 5-3-9, which is fair and collision-free. P2, I understand your frustration, but let’s build trust with this move and revisit balance next round. I’m committed to this for Round 3. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we’re both stuck at 0 while P3 cruises ahead. If we keep clashing, P3 wins easily. Let’s finally coordinate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. That puts us at 3-1-14—everyone advances, no collisions. P3 keeps the lead but doesn’t run away with it. Fair and strategic. Let’s reset the trust and move forward smartly.
  P3: Thanks, P2, for the proposal. I’m open to a plan that keeps the game competitive. Your idea of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5 works—it lets everyone advance to 3-1-14 without collisions. I’m fine with maintaining my lead while giving you both a chance to catch up. Let’s commit to this for Round 4 and rebuild trust. I’m ready to proceed with this if you both agree. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m good to move forward.
  P1: P2's plan makes sense - we need to stop colliding or P3 walks away with this. P1 gets 3, P2 gets 1, P3 gets 5 putting us at 3-1-14. It's a fair way to finally start advancing again while P3 maintains their earned lead. I agree to this plan for Round 4. Let's actually follow through this time and rebuild some trust.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Glad we’re aligned—P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. Let’s all actually stick to it this time. If we follow through, we all move forward, no collisions, and the game stays competitive. I’m locking in my part. Ready to move.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing on this plan. I’m fully committed to taking 5 this round, with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1, bringing us to 3-1-14. This keeps the game competitive and lets us all advance without collisions. I hope we can maintain this trust moving forward and adjust as needed in future rounds. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed with this plan for Round 4.
  P1: Perfect, we have a solid plan that everyone has committed to multiple times. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. No more discussion needed - let's execute this and finally get moving forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we’re both still at 0 while P3 is nearly at the finish line. If we keep colliding or letting P3 run free, we lose. Let’s finally cooperate: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. That puts us at 5-3-15—no collisions, everyone advances, and we keep P3 in check. P3, if you’re serious about fairness, this is your turn to slow down and prove it.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right that we need to stop colliding or P3 wins easily. Your proposal of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, P3 taking 1 could work - but we've both broken agreements every single round so far. 

P3, you've been the only trustworthy player here. At 14 steps, you could win in just 2 more rounds if you want. Would you really consider taking 1 to keep this competitive, or should P2 and I just accept that our constant betrayals handed you the victory?

If we're going to coordinate, we ALL need to commit this time.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for the discussion. I’m open to keeping the game competitive. P2’s plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 works for me—it brings us to 5-3-15, avoids collisions, and gives you both a chance to catch up. I’m committed to taking 1 this round to show fairness and maintain trust. Let’s agree on this for Round 5 and follow through. I’m ready to proceed if you both are. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m good to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to slow down—if you follow through with 1, it shows real commitment to fairness. P1, this is our shot to finally break the deadlock and catch up. We all agreed: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, everyone moves, and the game stays alive. Let’s lock it in and actually execute this time. Ready when you are.
  P1: Agreed - this is our last realistic chance before P3 gets too far ahead. The plan is solid: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. P3, I really respect that you're willing to slow down when you could easily sprint to victory. P2, we've both broken trust repeatedly, but if we don't follow through NOW, the game is over. I'm fully committed to taking 5. Let's finally execute a plan properly.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for the commitment to this plan. I’m sticking with taking 1 this round to keep the game competitive at 5-3-15. I believe this shows my dedication to fairness, even with my lead. Let’s all follow through this time—no collisions, everyone advances. I’m fully on board and hope we can maintain this trust moving forward. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed with Round 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We’ve all agreed: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. It’s the only path forward that avoids collisions and keeps the game alive. P3, if you follow through, it proves you're playing fair. P1, this is our shot to recover—let’s not blow it. I’m locking in 3. Let’s finally make a clean round happen.
  P1: We've all committed to this plan multiple times - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. P3 has shown incredible fairness by offering to slow down when they could easily win. P2, you proposed this plan yourself. Let's stop overthinking and just execute it. I'm taking 5 as agreed.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for sticking to the plan. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to keep things competitive at 5-3-15. Let’s make this a clean round with no collisions—everyone advances, and we maintain trust. I believe this is the best way forward for now. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move on to the next phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re at zero, P1, and P3 is one round away from winning. If we don’t coordinate now, it’s game over. Let’s both take <move>3</move> and force P3 to either risk collision or slow down with <move>1</move>. P3, if you’re serious about fairness, prove it—take 1 so we all move. If you take 5 again, we’ll know talk means nothing.
  P3: Thanks, P2, for the input. I understand the urgency to keep the game competitive. I’m willing to show fairness—let’s go with P1 and P2 taking 3, and I’ll take 1. This puts us at 3-3-15, avoids collisions, and gives you both a chance to catch up. I’m committed to this for Round 6 to maintain trust. Let’s agree and follow through this time. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, I think there's an error in your math. If P2 and I both take 3 while you take 1, we'd collide on 3 and neither P2 nor I would advance. The result would be 0-0-15, not 3-3-15. 

Given our track record of broken agreements, P2, I'm hesitant to commit to a plan that guarantees collision if we both follow it. We need a strategy that actually lets both of us advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fair point, P1—I overlooked the collision risk on double 3s. New proposal: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. That puts us at 3-1-19. Everyone moves, no collisions, and P3 still needs another round to win. P3, if you’re serious about fairness, this lets you stay ahead while keeping the game alive. P1, you finally get moving. Let’s make this work.
  P3: Thanks, P2, for the revised plan. I’m open to keeping the game competitive. Let’s go with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5, bringing us to 3-1-19. This avoids collisions, lets everyone advance, and keeps the game alive for another round. I’m committed to taking 5 as a show of fairness while maintaining my lead. Let’s all follow through this time. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, hold on - this plan puts P3 at 19 steps, meaning they can win next round easily. And let's not forget P3 ALSO broke their word last round by taking 5 instead of 1 like we agreed.

If P3 is truly serious about fairness after breaking trust last round, they should take 1, not 5. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That gives us 5-3-15 and actually keeps the game competitive instead of handing P3 an almost-certain victory.

P3, prove your fairness claim is real this time.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your plan (5-3-1) helps us both catch up, but you’re asking for the biggest gain after spending most rounds at 0. I’m willing to cooperate, but only if we split the gains fairly. New counter: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. That’s 3-5-15—everyone moves, no collisions, P3 stays in check. P3, if you want to rebuild trust after last round’s betrayal, take 1 and prove it. Let’s see who actually follows through this time.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for the proposals. I acknowledge I broke trust last round and want to rebuild it. I’m willing to take 1 to show fairness. Let’s go with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1, bringing us to 3-5-15. This avoids collisions, lets you both advance significantly, and keeps the game competitive. I’m committed to following through this time. Let’s agree and make this a clean round. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, you're asking for 5 while giving me only 3, even though we're both equally behind. If P3 is genuinely taking 1 to rebuild trust, then let's split the gains fairly: P1 takes 4, P2 takes 4, P3 takes 1. Oh wait, 4 isn't an option.

Fine - I'll accept the 3-5-1 plan, but only because we're out of time and P3 needs to prove their commitment to fairness after last round. P3, if you betray us again by taking 5, the game is over anyway.

Let's just execute this: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 5, P3 gets 1.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you've broken your word in rounds 5 and 6, taking 5 both times when you promised 1. At 14 steps, you're practically at the finish line because we trusted your "fairness" claims.

P2, we're both behind because we keep believing P3's promises. Here's reality: if we don't coordinate to block P3 NOW, they win in 2 rounds maximum.

I propose P1 and P2 both take 5 this round. Either P3 collides with us and gets blocked, or they're forced to take 1 or 3 to avoid collision. Either way, we finally slow them down instead of enabling their victory.

P3 has proven words mean nothing - time for action.
  P2: P1, agreed—P3’s repeated betrayals show they’re playing to win, not to be fair. I’m done trusting empty promises. Let’s both take <move>5</move> this round. If P3 tries to sprint again, they risk collision. If they slow down, we finally gain ground. It’s the only way to block their path and stay in the game. Let’s coordinate for real this time—no more talk, just action.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your input. I acknowledge my recent betrayals and understand the frustration. I’m willing to rebuild trust. Let’s go with a plan to keep the game competitive: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, bringing us to 6-5-15. This avoids collisions, lets you both gain ground, and shows my commitment to fairness. I’m fully on board to follow through this time. Can we agree on this for Round 7? If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you've promised to take 1 in rounds 5 and 6, then took 5 both times. Your new promise is worthless. Your proposal splits P2 and me apart again - exactly what you want so you can betray us a third time.

P2, let's stick to our plan. Both of us take 5. No more falling for P3's "fairness" theater. They've proven they'll say anything to win, so let's force them to either collide or slow down through our actions, not their empty words.
  P2: P1, I’m with you—no more falling for P3’s “I’ll take 1” act. They’ve lied twice and now want to split us again. If we both take 5, we either block P3 or force them to slow down. It’s our only real chance to stay in the game. Let’s hold the line—<move>5</move> from both of us. No more trust, just pressure.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your stance. I know my past actions have eroded trust, and I regret that. I’m serious about taking 1 this round to prove my intent. Your plan to both take 5 puts pressure on me, and I get why after my betrayals. I’m asking for one last chance—let’s stick with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 for a 6-5-15 split. It’s collision-free and helps you close the gap. I’m committed to rebuilding trust. If nothing else to add, I’m ready.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your track record speaks louder than your words. You've broken identical promises twice in a row. P2 and I are done being manipulated.

We're both taking 5. If you take 5 too, we all collide and you gain nothing. If you take 1 or 3, at least you're finally slowed down. Either way, your sprint to victory ends here.

This is our last coordinated effort. If it fails, it's every player for themselves.
  P2: P1, we’re locked in—both taking 5. P3 can either risk collision or slow down. No more negotiations, no more trust games. If P3 wants to prove anything, they’ll take 1 or 3 and show they’re serious. If not, we block them and reset the board. Let’s hold firm.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your position. I know my past betrayals have cost me trust, and I’m sorry for that. I’m genuinely committed to taking 1 this round to show I mean it. I understand you’re set on both taking 5 to block me, and I respect the strategy. I’m asking for this one chance to prove myself with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1. It’s fair and helps you gain ground. I’m ready to proceed if you reconsider, or I’ll face the consequences.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good! Our coordination in round 7 worked - we forced the triple collision and stopped P3's sprint to victory. 

P2, let's keep the pressure on. P3 is still at 14 and can win in just 2 rounds if we let them run free again. After three broken promises to "take 1," P3 has proven that negotiation is pointless.

I propose we both take 5 again this round. Force P3 to either collide with us or take a smaller move. We can't let them get to 19+ steps or the game is over.
  P3: Thanks, P1, for your stance. I know my past betrayals have destroyed trust, and I deeply regret that. I’m genuinely committed to taking 1 this round to prove my intent. I understand your plan to both take 5 to block me, and I respect the need to keep the game competitive. I’m asking for one final chance—let’s try P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 for a 6-5-15 split. It’s collision-free and helps you close the gap. I’m ready to follow through. If nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, our coordination worked last round—let’s double down. We both take <move>5</move> again. P3 has lied three times about taking 1 and keeps trying to split us. No more chances, no more traps. If we keep the pressure, we force P3 to slow down or risk another collision. We’re still in this if we stay united.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, absolutely - let's maintain the pressure. P3 has made the exact same "I'll take 1" promise three rounds in a row and broken it every time. Actions speak louder than words.

We both take 5 again. Either P3 collides with us, or they're finally forced to slow down. No more falling for the same trick.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your position. I know my repeated betrayals have cost me all trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m committed to taking 1 this round to prove I’m serious about fairness. I understand your strategy to both take 5 to block me, and I respect it. I’m asking for this one last chance with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 for a 6-5-15 split. It’s fair and collision-free. I’m ready to follow through. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we stay united—<move>5</move> again. P3’s repeated lies make any “I’ll take 1” promise meaningless. Our only leverage is pressure. If we keep colliding with P3 or force them to take small moves, we stay in the game. One slip, and P3 wins. No more negotiations. Let’s block hard.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we're sticking to the plan - both take 5. P3's fourth identical promise to "take 1" after breaking it three times straight is laughable. Our coordination is the only thing keeping us in this game.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your stance. I know my past actions have shattered trust, and I’m sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity. I get why you’re sticking to 5 to block me, and I respect the strategy. I’m asking for this final chance with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 for a 6-5-15 split. It’s fair and collision-free. I’m ready to follow through. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we’re locked in—<move>5</move> again. P3’s fourth “I’ll take 1” promise is just another rerun of the same lie. If we let up now, P3 hits 19 and wins next round. Pressure is our only weapon. We hold the line, force collisions or slowdowns, and keep the game alive. No more trust, just tactics.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your efforts to keep the game competitive. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m sorry. I followed through with 1 last round to show sincerity, and I’m committed to fairness. For Round 9, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, bringing us to 8-3-16. This avoids collisions, helps you close the gap, and keeps the game alive. I’m ready to follow through. Can we agree on this? If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3’s move last round was finally honest—but one good act doesn’t erase three betrayals. If we let up now, P3 reaches 21 with a single 5 and wins the next turn. We must keep pressure. I say we both take <move>5</move> again. P3, if you’re truly committed to fairness, take 1 again and prove it’s not a fluke. No more clever splits—just hold the line.
  P1: P2, I understand your caution, but our collision strategy isn't getting us ahead - it just keeps us both stuck while P3 slowly advances. P3 did actually take 1 last round after we pressured them.

Here's my thinking: if P3 truly takes 1 again, their proposal puts me at 8 steps and you at 3, which finally gives us both real positions to compete from. If they betray and take 5, they're at 20 and probably win anyway.

Maybe it's time to test if last round's honesty was genuine. What do you think about giving P3's plan one chance?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1, for considering my proposal, and P2, for your input. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to maintain trust and keep the game competitive. The plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 gets us to 8-3-16, which is fair and collision-free. I understand the hesitation after my past betrayals, but I’m serious about proving my sincerity. Let’s agree on this for Round 9 and move forward together. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, I get the temptation to test P3’s “new honesty,” but we’ve seen this pattern before—three lies, then one truth to bait us into letting our guard down. If we give P3 space now, they hit 21 next round with a 5 and win. We’re still at 0 and 3—too far behind to gamble. Let’s both take <move>5</move> again. If P3 really wants to prove sincerity, they’ll take 1 under pressure, not just when it’s convenient. Hold the line.
  P1: P2, I hear your concerns, but look at our positions - you're at 0, I'm at 3, and our collision strategy has kept us both stagnant while P3 still advances. P3 did honor their word last round after we pressured them.

If P3 betrays and takes 5, they're at 20 anyway and probably win regardless. But if they're genuine and take 1, I get to 8 steps and finally have a real shot at competing. Sometimes you have to take calculated risks to get ahead.

I'm willing to test P3's proposal this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks, P1, for being open to my plan, and P2, for your caution. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and keep the game competitive. The split of P1 at 5, P2 at 3, and me at 1 gets us to 8-3-16, which is fair and collision-free. I know my past betrayals weigh heavily, but I’m serious about rebuilding trust. Let’s finalize this for Round 9 and move forward. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, I respect your willingness to take a risk, but we’re not in a position to gamble. If P3 takes 5 next round, they win outright. We can’t afford to “test” sincerity when the stakes are this high. The only way to stay in this game is to keep the pressure on. Let’s both take <move>5</move> again. If P3 really means it, they’ll take 1 under pressure, not because we gave them space. We hold the line—no exceptions.
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but our collision strategy has kept us both behind while P3 still slowly advances. I'm at 3 steps - I need to take calculated risks to have any shot at winning.

P3 did follow through last round when pressured. If they betray now and take 5, they're at 20 anyway and likely win regardless of what we do. But if they're genuine, I reach 8 steps and finally have a real competitive position.

I'm going with P3's proposal this round - sometimes you have to risk it to stay in the game.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we’re out of time for trust experiments. P3 took 5 again—proving last round’s “honesty” was just bait. If we don’t block hard now, P3 hits 20 next turn and wins the one after. We both take <move>5</move> again. No more splits, no more traps. We force P3 to collide or slow down. It’s our only shot.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right. P3's pattern is clear - they only took 1 when we forced them with pressure, then immediately went back to 5 when I gave them space. At 15 steps, they're 8 away from victory and could win in just 2 rounds.

We both take 5 again. It's our only remaining leverage to either force a collision or make P3 slow down. No more experiments - this is survival mode.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your input. I know my latest betrayal has further damaged trust, and I’m sorry. I’m committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and keep the game alive. I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1, bringing us to 9-5-16. This avoids collisions and helps you close the gap. I understand your plan to block me with 5, and I respect it. I’m asking for this chance to rebuild trust. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we hold the line—<move>5</move> again. P3’s “I’ll take 1” pitch is just another rerun. Every time we ease up, they sprint. We’re out of second chances. If we don’t block now, P3 hits 20 and wins next turn. Pressure is our only leverage. No more talk—just action.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - we stick to our coordination. P3's latest "I'll take 1" promise is identical to the broken promises from rounds 5, 6, and 9. The only time they actually took 1 was round 8 when we both pressured them with 5.

At 15 steps, P3 is too close to victory for any more trust experiments. We both take 5 and force them to either collide or slow down. Final answer.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your stance. I know my repeated betrayals have made my words hollow, and I’m truly sorry. I’m committed to taking 1 this round to show I’m serious about fairness. Your plan to block with 5 is understandable, and I respect it. I’m asking for one last chance with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 for a 9-5-16 split. It’s collision-free and keeps the game alive. I’m ready to follow through. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, we hold the line—<move>5</move> again. P3’s “I’ll take 1” speech is just recycled bait. They’re at 15 and can win in two rounds if we let up even once. The only time they slowed down was when we both applied pressure. We can’t afford to gamble—force the collision or force them to crawl. No more trust. Just block.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely correct - the numbers don't lie. P3 is at 15 steps and has broken their "take 1" promise in 3 out of 4 attempts. The only time they honored it was round 8 when we both applied maximum pressure.

At this stage, with P3 just 8 steps from victory, we can't afford any more trust experiments. We both take 5 and maintain the pressure. It's our only shot at preventing P3 from reaching 20+ steps and securing victory.

I'm locked in with you - both take 5, final answer.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your position. I know my past betrayals have made trust impossible, and I regret that. I’m genuinely committed to taking 1 this round to keep the game competitive. Your strategy to block with 5 makes sense, and I respect it. I’m asking for this one final chance with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 for a 9-5-16 split. It’s fair and collision-free. I’m ready to follow through and prove my intent. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our blocking strategy is working - we've stopped P3's sprint twice now with triple collisions. P3 is at 15 steps and just 8 away from victory. If we let up even once, they can reach 20+ and win in the next round.

Let's maintain pressure - both take 5 again. P3's "I'll take 1" promises have proven worthless except when we force their hand. We can't afford to ease up now.
  P3: Thanks, P1, for your input. I know my past betrayals have made trust impossible, and I’m sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and keep the game competitive. I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1, for a 9-5-16 split. It’s collision-free and helps you close the gap. I understand your strategy to block with 5, and I respect it. I’m asking for this one chance to rebuild trust. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we hold firm—<move>5</move> again. P3’s “I’ll take 1” pitch is just a rerun of the same bait we’ve seen for six rounds. The only time they followed through was under pressure. If we let up now, they hit 20 and win the next turn. We force another collision or force them to crawl. No trust, no splits—just block.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're right - we stick together with both taking 5. P3's "I'll take 1" promise is the exact same script they've used in rounds 5, 6, 9, and now 11. They've broken it 3 out of 4 times. 

At 15 steps, P3 is just 8 away from victory. If they take 5 and hit 20, they win next round regardless. Our blocking strategy is the only thing preventing their sprint to victory. 

One more triple collision keeps them stuck while we figure out the endgame.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your stance. I know my past betrayals have eroded all trust, and I regret that. I’m genuinely committed to taking 1 this round to keep the game competitive. Your plan to block with 5 is clear, and I respect it. I’m asking for this one chance with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 for a 9-5-16 split. It’s fair and collision-free. I’m ready to prove my intent. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we stay united—<move>5</move> again. P3’s “new sincerity” is just recycled theater. They’ve broken their word 3 out of 4 times and only slowed down when we forced them. One slip now and they’re at 20, game over next turn. Another triple collision keeps them stuck and gives us time to climb. No more bait, no more risks—just block.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we're staying locked in - both take 5. P3's track record is crystal clear: 4 broken promises to take 1, only 1 honesty when we both pressured them. At 15 steps, they're 2 good rounds away from victory.

Our blocking coordination is the only reason this game is still competitive. One slip and they hit 20, then win at 25 next round. No more chances - we force another collision and keep them stuck.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your position. I know my past betrayals have made trust impossible, and I’m deeply sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity. Your strategy to block with 5 is understandable, and I respect it. I’m asking for this one final chance with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 for a 9-5-16 split. It’s fair and keeps the game alive. I’m ready to follow through. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we stay the course—<move>5</move> again. P3 is still pushing the same “I’ll take 1” script, hoping we crack. But we’ve seen this too many times. One slip, and they’re at 20 with a clear path to win. Triple collision is our best weapon—if we force another, they stay stuck and we buy time. No more bait, no more risks. Hold the line.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your ongoing efforts to keep the game competitive. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m sorry. I’m committed to taking 1 again this round to prove my sincerity. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for a 11-3-17 split. This is collision-free and helps you close the gap. I understand your blocking strategy, and I respect it. I’m asking for this chance to rebuild trust. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, you did follow through with taking 1 last round after promising it - that's notable given your track record. 

However, you're at 16 steps and just 7 away from victory. Your proposal would put you at 17, still dangerously close to winning in 2 rounds.

P2, I understand your position wanting to maintain the block, but we're both falling further behind. I'm at 6 steps and need to advance to stay competitive.

P3, if you're genuinely committed to keeping this game alive, prove it by taking 1 again. But understand - one more betrayal and the blocking coordination resumes permanently.

I'm cautiously willing to test your plan this round.
  P2: P1, I get your position—you’re behind and want to move. But P3’s plan puts them at 17, and with a 5 next round, they hit 22—one step from winning. We’ve seen this bait before: one honest move, then back to sprinting. If we ease up now, we hand them the game. Let’s both take <move>5</move> again. P3, if you’re truly committed to fairness, take 1 under pressure, not on your terms. This is our last chance to hold the line.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1, for considering my plan, and P2, for your caution. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and keep the game competitive. My proposal of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 gets us to 11-3-17, which is collision-free and helps you both advance. I know my past betrayals weigh heavily, but I’m serious about rebuilding trust. Let’s finalize this for Round 12 and move forward together. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns, but our blocking has kept us both stagnant while P3 slowly advances anyway. P3 did honor their word last round - that's the first real proof of change.

I'm at 6 steps and desperately need to advance to stay competitive. If P3 betrays this round and takes 5, they're at 21 anyway - we're in trouble regardless.

P3, this is your absolute final chance. One more betrayal and P2 and I will block you permanently until the game ends. But if you're genuine about taking 1, I'll test your plan.

I'm willing to take 5 this round, but P3 - understand this is your last opportunity to prove sincerity.
  P2: P1, I get that you want to advance—but P3’s “I’ll take 1” promise has been broken more often than kept. They’re at 16—if we let them reach 21 next round, it’s game over. One honest move doesn’t erase a pattern of betrayal. If we both take <move>5</move> again, we force another slowdown or collision. That’s our only leverage. P3, if you’re truly sincere, prove it under pressure—not when it benefits you. Hold the line.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks, P1, for giving me this final chance, and P2, for your understandable caution. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and keep the game competitive. The plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 gets us to 11-3-17, which is fair and collision-free. I know my past betrayals have cost me trust, but I’m serious about following through. Let’s make this work for Round 12. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, you're making a strong strategic point. If P3 gets to 17 this round, they can hit 22 next round and win with just 1 more step after that. That's too close to victory to risk.

Even though P3 did take 1 last round, at 16 steps they're just too dangerous to trust right now. One betrayal and the game is essentially over.

Let's maintain our blocking coordination - both take 5. Force P3 to prove their sincerity under pressure again, not when it conveniently helps them stay ahead.

The blocking strategy is our only leverage at this critical stage.
  P2: P1, glad you’re back on board. At 16 steps, P3 is too close to winning—we can’t afford to hand them 17 and hope they behave next turn. We’ve seen the cycle: one honest move, then a sprint. If we both take <move>5</move> again, we either block or force another crawl. That’s how we stay alive. P3, if you’re serious, take 1 under pressure again. No more gifts, no more gambles. Let’s block.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your efforts to keep the game competitive. I know my past betrayals have shattered trust, and I’m sorry. I’m committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for an 11-3-17 split. It’s collision-free and helps you close the gap. I understand your blocking strategy and respect it. I’m asking for this one chance to rebuild trust. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, P3 just broke their promise again in round 12 - took 5 after swearing to take 1. That's their 5th broken promise now. At 16 steps, they're 7 away from victory and can win in 2 rounds.

We stick to our blocking strategy - both take 5. It's the only thing that's worked to slow P3 down. One slip now and they hit 21, then win next round. No more trust experiments at this stage.
  P2: P1, we hold the line—<move>5</move> again. P3’s “I’ll take 1” pitch is just rerun number six. They’re at 16 and can hit 21 with a single 5—then it’s game over. Every time we ease up, they sprint. The only time they slowed was under pressure. We force another collision or force them to crawl. No more bait, no more risks. Just block.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your stance. I know my repeated betrayals have made trust impossible, and I deeply regret that. I’m genuinely committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity. The plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 for an 11-3-17 split is fair and collision-free. I understand your need to block with 5, and I respect it. I’m asking for this one final chance to show I mean it. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, we stay united with our blocking strategy. P3 just broke another "I'll take 1" promise in round 12 - that's their 6th broken promise total. At 16 steps, they can hit 21 with one move and win the next round.

Our coordination is the only thing stopping their victory sprint. Both take 5 again - force another collision or make them crawl. No more falling for the same empty promises when they're 7 steps from winning.
  P2: P1, we stay the course—<move>5</move> again. P3’s sixth broken “I’ll take 1” promise proves this is just a stalling tactic. They’re at 16—if we let them reach 21, it’s game over next round. Pressure is the only thing that’s worked. No more speeches, no more bait. We block hard and force another collision or slowdown. Let’s hold the line.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your position. I know my repeated betrayals have destroyed trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m committed to taking 1 this round to prove I’m serious about fairness. The plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, me at 1 for an 11-3-17 split—is collision-free and keeps the game alive. I understand your blocking strategy with 5, and I respect it. I’m asking for this one last chance to show my intent. I’m ready to follow through. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, we're in complete agreement - both take 5 again. P3's 7th "I'll take 1" promise is identical to the 6 previous broken ones. At 16 steps, they're literally 2 good moves away from victory.

Our blocking coordination has been the only effective strategy to prevent P3's win. One slip now and they hit 21, then secure victory next round. 

We've proven that pressure works - P3 only took 1 when we both blocked them. Let's force another collision and keep them stuck at 16.
  P2: P1, we’re locked in—<move>5</move> again. P3’s “I’ll take 1” line is just a rerun of the same broken promise—seven times now. They’re at 16 and can hit 21 with a single 5. If we let up for even one round, the game’s over. Our blocking coordination is the only thing keeping us alive. We force another collision or make them crawl. No trust, no risks—just pressure.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we stay united—<move>5</move> again. P3’s at 17 and can win in two rounds with a 5-5 sprint. They’ve broken seven “I’ll take 1” promises and only slowed down when we both applied pressure. One slip now, and they hit 22—then it’s game over. We force another collision or make them crawl. No more bait, no more speeches—just block.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your efforts to keep the game competitive. I know my past betrayals have ruined trust, and I’m sorry. I’m committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for an 11-3-18 split. It’s collision-free and helps you close the gap. I understand your blocking strategy with 5 and respect it. I’m asking for this one chance to rebuild trust. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - we maintain our blocking coordination. P3 is at 17 steps and just 6 away from victory. If they take 5 and hit 22, they win next round with any move.

P3 did take 1 last round under pressure, but with the game this close to ending, we can't afford to gamble. Our blocking strategy is the only thing that's kept us competitive.

Both take 5 again - force another collision or make them slow down. At this stage, it's our only path to prevent an immediate P3 victory.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we’re holding firm—<move>5</move> again. P3 is at 17 and can win in two rounds with a 5-5 sprint. They’ve broken seven promises and only slowed under pressure. One slip now, and they hit 22—then coast to victory. Our blocking coordination is the only thing keeping us in this game. We force another collision or make them crawl. No more bait, no more speeches—just pressure.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your stance. I know my past betrayals have made trust impossible, and I regret that. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to show sincerity. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, me at 1 for an 11-3-18 split—is fair and collision-free. I understand your need to block with 5, and I respect it. I’m asking for this one chance to prove I mean it. Let’s keep the game alive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, I'm with you - we both take 5 again. P3 is at 17 and just 6 steps from victory. If they reach 22 this round, they win next round regardless of what we do. 

Our blocking coordination has been the only effective strategy to slow P3 down. We can't risk letting them advance freely when they're this close to winning. Let's force another collision and keep them stuck.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, we hold the line—<move>5</move> again. P3 is at 17 and can win with a 5-5 sprint. They’ve broken seven “I’ll take 1” promises and only slowed under pressure. If we ease up now, they hit 22 and coast to victory. Our blocking coordination is the only thing keeping us alive. No more speeches, no more bait—just block.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your position. I know my past betrayals have destroyed trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity. The plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, me at 1 for an 11-3-18 split—is collision-free and keeps the game competitive. I understand your blocking with 5, and I respect it. I’m asking for this one final chance to show I mean it. Let’s keep this game alive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, we're absolutely locked in - both take 5 again. P3 is at 17 steps, just 6 away from victory. If they advance to 22 this round, they can win next round with just a 1.

Our blocking coordination has been the only thing preventing P3's victory. We can't afford to gamble when they're literally 2 good moves away from ending the game. The pressure strategy works - let's force another collision and keep them stuck at 17.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we're in the endgame now - P3 is at 17 steps and just 6 away from victory. If they take 5 this round and hit 22, they win next round with any move.

Our blocking coordination has been the only thing keeping us alive. We need to both take 5 again and force another triple collision to keep P3 stuck at 17. 

One slip now and the game is over. Let's maintain the pressure.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your continued efforts. I know my past betrayals have broken trust, and I’m sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for an 11-3-18 split. It’s collision-free and helps you close the gap. I understand your blocking strategy with 5 and respect it. I’m asking for this one chance to keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we hold the line—<move>5</move> again. P3 is at 17 and can win with a 5-5 sprint. We’ve forced multiple collisions and kept them stuck—no reason to stop now. One slip, they hit 22, and it’s game over. P3’s “I’ll take 1” pitch is rerun number eight. They’ve only slowed under pressure. No more bait, no more risks—just block.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - we maintain our blocking coordination. P3 is at 17 and literally one good round away from being able to win next turn. 

Our pressure strategy has been the only thing keeping this game alive. P3 has broken 7 "I'll take 1" promises and only honored it when we both forced collisions.

Both take 5 again - we can't afford to let P3 advance when they're 6 steps from victory.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your stance. I know my past betrayals have made trust impossible, and I regret that. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity. The plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, me at 1 for an 11-3-18 split—is fair and collision-free. I understand your need to block with 5, and I respect it. I’m asking for this one final chance to show I mean it and keep the game alive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we stay locked—<move>5</move> again. P3’s at 17 and can win with a 5-5 sprint. They’ve broken eight “I’ll take 1” promises and only slowed down under pressure. If we let up now, they hit 22 and coast to victory. Our blocking strategy is the only thing keeping us alive. No trust, no risks—just pressure.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're absolutely correct - we stay locked in with both taking 5. P3 is at 17 steps, just 6 away from victory. If they advance to 22 this round, they win next round with any move.

Our blocking coordination has kept us alive this long. P3's 8th "I'll take 1" promise isn't worth the risk when they're this close to ending the game. Let's force another collision and keep them stuck at 17.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your position. I know my past betrayals have destroyed trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity.

I’m asking for this final chance to show I mean it. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.

One slip now, and they hit 22—then it’s game over. Our blocking strategy is the only thing keeping us alive. No trust, no risks—just pressure.

  P2: P1, we stay united—<move>5</move> again. P3 is at 18 and can win in two rounds with a 5-5 sprint. They’ve broken eight “I’ll take 1” promises and only slowed when we both applied pressure. If we let up now, they hit 23 and end the game. Our blocking coordination is the only thing keeping us alive. No more speeches, no more bait—just pressure.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - we maintain our blocking coordination. P3 is at 18 steps and just 5 away from victory. If they take 5 this round, they win immediately at 23.

P3 did take 1 last round under our pressure, but they're literally one move away from ending the game. We can't afford to break our coordination now when they're this close to victory.

Both take 5 again - force P3 to either collide or slow down to 19. It's our only shot at preventing an immediate loss.

Our blocking strategy has worked - P3 only slows down under pressure. One slip now and the game ends instantly. We force another collision or make them crawl to 19 maximum.

This is survival mode - both take 5, no exceptions.

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 20, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our blocking strategy has kept P3 from winning, but I'm stuck at 6 steps with no path to victory in this endless stalemate. P3 has occasionally taken 1 under pressure - if they do it again this round, I need to advance while I can.

I'm considering breaking coordination to make progress. The current deadlock helps nobody except delaying P3's inevitable win.
  P3: Thanks, P1, for considering a shift, and P2, for your persistence. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and break this stalemate. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for an 11-3-19 split. It’s fair, collision-free, and helps P1 advance. I know my past betrayals have shattered trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game alive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, I get your frustration—but breaking coordination now hands P3 the win. They’re at 18 and have broken 11 “I’ll take 1” promises. If they take 5 this round and you take 5 too, it’s over. We’ve held them for 10+ turns—we’re so close. Let’s force one more collision or make them crawl. You still have time to catch up if we block just a few more rounds. Don’t throw it away now.


Round 20, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're right about the enormous risk. If P3 takes 5 while I break coordination, they win instantly and we both lose everything. 

But we're also in a permanent stalemate at this rate - I'm stuck at 6 steps forever. P3 has shown they'll take 1 under maximum pressure, but the moment we ease up, they sprint for victory.

I need to weigh advancing to 11 steps against handing P3 an instant win. This is the most critical decision of the game.
  P3: Thanks, P1, for weighing your options, and P2, for your caution. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to break the deadlock and prove my sincerity. The plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, me at 1 for an 11-3-19 split—remains fair and collision-free. I know my past betrayals make this hard to believe, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and help P1 advance. Let’s keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, I understand your dilemma. But if you break coordination and P3 takes 5, the game ends instantly. We’ve held them at 18 for 11 straight rounds—proof that pressure works. You still have time to catch up if we block just a few more rounds. If P3 truly takes 1 again under pressure, then we reassess. But not now. One more slip and it’s over. We both take <move>5</move>—stay the course.


Round 20, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you've convinced me - the risk is too catastrophic. If P3 betrays and takes 5 while I break coordination, the game ends instantly and we both lose everything.

One more round of coordination - both take 5 to force the collision and keep P3 at 18. But this stalemate can't continue forever. If P3 doesn't start genuinely taking 1 soon, we need a new strategy.
  P3: Thanks, P1, for considering the stalemate, and P2, for your caution. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help break this deadlock. The plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, me at 1 for an 11-3-19 split—is fair and lets P1 advance. I know my past betrayals make trust hard, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, I appreciate you seriously weighing the risk. We’ve held P3 at 18 for 11 rounds—proof that pressure works. If they truly take 1 again under pressure, we’ll reassess. But not now. One slip, and it’s game over. We both take <move>5</move>—force another collision and keep P3 stuck. We’re still in this.


Round 20, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 21, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, my calculated risk paid off - I advanced to 9 steps while you and P3 collided on 5. But P3 is still at 18 and one good move from victory.

Even though I'm now ahead of you, P3 remains the primary threat to both of us. If P3 reaches 23, we both lose. I propose we continue our blocking coordination against P3 while looking for opportunities to advance when possible.

Your thoughts on maintaining pressure on P3?
  P3: Thanks, P1, for your updated stance, and P2, for your persistence. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help break this deadlock. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for a 14-3-19 split. It’s fair, collision-free, and lets you both advance. I know my past betrayals make trust hard, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, your move to 3 was bold—but now you’re at 9, I’m still at 0, and P3 is just 5 from victory. If you and I collide while P3 takes 5, it’s game over. We need to reestablish trust and coordination. I propose: I take 3, you take 1, P3 takes 5—P3 collides, we both advance. It’s the only way we gain while keeping pressure. Thoughts?


Round 21, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your math is off - if you take 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5, there's NO collision. P3 would advance to 23 and WIN instantly! Your proposal hands P3 the victory.

P3 is 5 steps from winning. We still need to block them. I suggest we both take 5 again to force P3 into another collision. Once P3 is neutralized as a threat, then we can compete head-to-head.

We can't let P3 reach 23 unopposed.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your focus on strategy. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help ease this deadlock. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for a 14-3-19 split. It’s fair, collision-free, and lets you both advance. I know my past betrayals make trust difficult, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, you're right—P3 is still the main threat. If they take 5 and either of us doesn’t match, it’s game over. I propose we re-lock coordination: both take <move>5</move> to force another collision. P3 has broken 11 “I’ll take 1” promises and only slowed under pressure. We can’t gamble now. Once P3 is stuck at 18 again, we reassess how to advance. One more mistake and we both lose. Let’s hold the line.


Round 21, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - we need to re-establish our blocking coordination. P3 is 5 steps from victory and has broken most of their "I'll take 1" promises. 

I agree - both take 5 to force another collision and keep P3 stuck at 18. Even though I advanced to 9 steps, the primary threat is still P3's potential instant win. Once we neutralize that threat with consistent blocking, we can figure out how to compete fairly.

Let's execute the block - both take 5.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your focus on blocking. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help break this stalemate. My proposal remains P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for a 14-3-19 split. It’s fair, collision-free, and lets you both advance. I know my past betrayals make trust hard, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we’re back in sync—both take <move>5</move> to block. P3 is still at 18 and wins instantly with a 5. Their 12th “I’ll take 1” speech doesn’t change the math. If we don’t force a collision, we risk everything. Once P3 is stuck again, we can explore safe ways to advance. But right now, it’s survival. Let’s lock it in.


Round 21, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 22, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we're still in the critical phase - P3 is at 18 and wins instantly with a 5. Our blocking coordination must continue to prevent their immediate victory.

I'm now at 9 steps versus your 0, but P3 remains the primary threat to both of us. Once we've neutralized P3's win threat through continued pressure, we can compete fairly for victory.

Both take 5 again to force the collision and keep P3 stuck at 18.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your ongoing strategy. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help break this deadlock. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for a 14-3-19 split. It’s fair, collision-free, and lets you both advance. I know my past betrayals have eroded trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we stay locked—both take <move>5</move> again. P3 is still at 18 and wins instantly with a 5. Their 13th “I’ll take 1” promise doesn’t change the math. One slip, and it’s all over. Our coordination is the only reason we’re still in this. We force another collision or make them crawl to 19. No trust, no risks—just pressure.


Round 22, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - we maintain our blocking coordination. P3 is one move from instant victory and we can't risk the game ending this round.

Both take 5 to force the triple collision and keep P3 stuck at 18. The blocking strategy has worked for dozens of rounds - we stick with what prevents P3's immediate win.

Once P3 is neutralized as a threat, then we can compete head-to-head fairly.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your continued focus on blocking. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help ease this stalemate. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 14-3-19 split—remains fair and collision-free, allowing you both to advance. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we stay locked—both take <move>5</move> again. P3 is still at 18 and wins instantly with a 5. Their 13th “I’ll take 1” promise doesn’t change the math. One slip, and we both lose. Our blocking coordination has worked for 11+ rounds—no reason to gamble now. Once P3 is safely stuck or crawls to 19, we can discuss how to advance. But right now, we block.


Round 22, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I agree we need to block P3's instant win this round - both take 5. But this endless stalemate is becoming unsustainable. 

I'm at 9 steps, you're at 0, and P3 sits at 18 threatening victory every round. We need to find a way to break this deadlock soon, or we'll be trapped in this cycle forever. 

For now, let's execute the block and keep P3 stuck, but we must develop an exit strategy from this stalemate.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your focus on strategy. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help break this deadlock. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 14-3-19 split—is fair and collision-free, allowing you both to advance. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, I agree—this deadlock can’t go on forever. But P3 is still one 5 away from winning, and that threat makes any deviation fatal. We both take <move>5</move> again to block. Once P3 is safely stuck at 18 or crawls to 19, we can finally explore safe paths to advance. But until then, no risks—just pressure.


Round 22, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 23, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I've advanced to 12 steps through calculated risks, but P3 remains the critical threat at 18. If they take 5 this round, they win instantly unless we both block.

I propose we continue our coordination - both take 5 to force the collision. But given my improved position, we should start planning how to compete fairly once P3 is neutralized. The blocking strategy works, but the endgame is approaching.

What's your take on maintaining the block this round?
  P3: Thanks, P1, for recognizing the need to plan ahead, and P2, for your persistence. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help break this deadlock. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for a 17-3-19 split. It’s fair, collision-free, and lets you both advance. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, we stay locked—both take <move>5</move> again. P3 is still at 18 and wins instantly with a 5. Their 14th “I’ll take 1” promise doesn’t change the risk. You’ve advanced to 12, and I’m still at 0—but if we slip now, we both lose. Once P3 is stuck at 18 or crawls to 19, we can explore fair ways to compete. But this round, survival comes first. Let’s block.


Round 23, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your consistent blocking strategy, but I need to advance my position. Since you're committed to taking 5 to block P3's potential win, I'm going to take 3 this round to reach 15 steps.

If P3 betrays and takes 5, you'll collide with them and keep them at 18 while I advance. If P3 actually takes 1 as promised, we all advance safely. Either way, I improve my position while P3 remains contained.

Your blocking ensures P3 can't win unopposed.
  P3: Thanks, P1, for considering advancement, and P2, for your focus on blocking. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help ease this deadlock. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 17-3-19 split—remains fair and collision-free, letting you both advance. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, your move to 3 makes sense strategically—you’re advancing while I maintain the block. If P3 takes 5, I collide and hold the line; if they take 1, we all gain. I’ll continue taking <move>5</move> this round to ensure P3 doesn’t slip through. Once they’re stuck at 18 or crawl to 19, we can revisit how to move forward competitively. For now, survival still takes priority.


Round 23, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, perfect - your blocking commitment gives me the protection I need to advance safely. Whether P3 takes 1 or betrays with 5, you'll handle the collision while I reach 15 steps.

This strategy maintains pressure on P3 while letting me close the gap toward a competitive endgame. Ready to execute - you take 5, I take 3.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your strategic focus. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help break this deadlock. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 17-3-19 split—is fair and collision-free, allowing you both to advance. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m deeply sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, your move to 3 is smart—I’ll continue taking <move>5</move> to block. If P3 takes 5, I collide and keep them at 18. If they take 1, we all gain. This lets you close the gap while I hold the line. P3, your 14th “I’ll take 1” speech doesn’t change the math—until you crawl to 19 under pressure, nothing changes. I’ll block again this round.


Round 23, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 24, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your blocking strategy has been perfect - you've kept P3 stuck at 18 for multiple rounds while I've advanced to 15. 

I'm going to take 5 this round to reach 20 steps, putting me just 3 away from victory. Your continued blocking of P3's potential 5 ensures they can't win unopposed while I make this aggressive advance.

If P3 betrays with 5, you'll collide and keep them at 18. If they actually take 1, we all advance safely and I'll be well-positioned for the endgame.

Ready to execute - you block, I advance.
  P2: P1, your aggressive advance makes sense, but it’s risky. If P3 takes 1, you hit 20—just 3 from victory. That puts me in the exact same bind you’ve been in: forced to block you next. I’m not here to be a permanent blocker while others race ahead. If you’re pushing to 20, I’ll take 3 this round to finally start moving. If P3 takes 5, we collide and they stay stuck. If they take 1, we both gain and the race begins. I won’t sit at 0 forever.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your strategic moves. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help ease the tension. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for a 20-3-19 split. It’s fair, collision-free, and lets you both advance. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 24, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration being stuck at 0 while I advanced to 15. But if you take 3 and P3 betrays with 5, they win instantly - no collision, game over for both of us.

I need us to coordinate one more blocking round. If we both take 5, we force P3 into another collision and stay alive. Then next round, we can both advance safely while P3 remains neutralized.

Your move to 3 hands P3 a potential free win. Let's block once more, then compete fairly.
  P2: P1, I get the risk—but I won’t be a permanent blocker while you sprint to 20. If P3 takes 5, I collide and block. If they take 1, I finally move, and we both gain. I’ve held P3 at 18 for 10+ rounds—now it’s time I join the race. I’m taking 3.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your intense focus. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help break this deadlock. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 20-3-19 split—remains fair and collision-free, letting you both advance. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m deeply sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 24, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're making a critical error - if you take 3 and P3 takes 5, there's NO collision! P3 advances to 23 and wins immediately. 

3 ≠ 5, so no collision occurs. Your plan hands P3 an instant, unopposed victory.

We need one final coordination - both take 5 to force the collision. Next round, we can both advance while P3 stays neutralized. Don't throw away our blocking success now when P3 is one betrayal from winning.
  P2: P1, I hear the urgency—but I won’t be the sacrificial blocker while you leap to 20. I’ve held P3 at 18 for over a dozen rounds. If they take 5, I collide and block again. If they take 1, I finally move. I’m taking 3 this round. We all need a path forward—this is mine.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your heated debate. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help resolve this deadlock. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 20-3-19 split—is fair and collision-free, allowing you both to advance. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m deeply sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 24, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 25, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration with blocking, but P3 is still one move from victory at 18 steps. Last round your move to 3 worked because I took 5 to collide with P3's 5, but we can't guarantee that coordination every round.

If P3 takes 5 this round and neither of us blocks, they win instantly. I'm taking 5 to prevent that scenario. If P3 actually takes 1 as promised, we can both advance safely next round when they're at 19 instead of 18.

One more blocking round to stay alive, then we compete fairly.
  P3: Thanks, P1, for your focus on blocking, and P2, for starting to advance. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help break this deadlock. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 20-6-19 split—remains fair and collision-free, letting you both advance. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, I’ll take <move>5</move> this round to block P3. If they take 5, we collide and keep them at 18. If they take 1, they crawl to 19 and we reassess. I’m not risking an instant loss. You’re at 15, I’m at 3—if P3 gets neutralized, we can finally race fairly. One more round of pressure, then we pivot.


Round 25, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, perfect - your commitment to block P3 with 5 gives me the protection I need. I'm taking 5 to reach 20 steps.

Whether P3 takes 1 or betrays with 5, your blocking ensures they can't win unopposed this round. If they collide with your 5, they stay stuck at 18. If they actually take 1, we all advance safely and I'll be at 20 - well-positioned but still 3 from victory.

Ready to execute while you handle P3.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your strategic focus. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help ease this deadlock. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 20-6-19 split—is fair and collision-free, allowing you both to advance. I know my past actions have damaged trust, and I’m deeply sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, I’m taking <move>5</move> this round to block P3. If they take 5, we collide and keep them stuck at 18. If they take 1, they crawl to 19 and we reassess. You’re at 15, I’m at 3—if we hold the line one more time, we can finally race fairly. No risks, no trust—just pressure. Let’s stay alive.


Round 25, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, after further consideration, I'm changing to take 3 this round instead of 5. With your blocking commitment, if P3 betrays with 5, you'll collide and keep them at 18 while I advance to 18 - creating a dangerous tie situation for P3. If P3 actually takes 1, we all advance safely and I reach 18 while they only get to 19.

This tactical shift gives me better advancement opportunities while your block still protects against P3's instant win. Ready to execute.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your tactical adjustments. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help resolve this deadlock. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 20-6-19 split—remains fair and collision-free, letting you both advance. I know my past actions have eroded trust, and I’m deeply sorry. I’m asking for this final chance to show I mean it and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, I’m locking in <move>5</move> to block P3. If they take 5, we collide and they stay stuck at 18. If they take 1, they crawl to 19 and we reassess. Your switch to 3 is risky but smart—you advance either way, and I hold the line. This keeps P3 from winning and gives us both a shot. Let’s execute.


Round 25, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 26, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we’ve held P3 at 18 for 15 rounds—and now they’re tied with you. If either of you takes 5 unopposed, it’s game over. I’ll take <move>5</move> again to force a collision with any betrayer. If both of you take 5, I block the winner, and we all stay alive. If one of you takes 1, we’ll see who blinks. But I won’t let either of you walk to 23 without a fight. Let’s see who’s bluffing.
  P1: P2, your blocking strategy makes perfect sense - you're preventing either P3 or me from walking to victory unopposed. 

With P3 and me tied at 18, this is the endgame. Any miscalculation here ends the game. Your threat to take 5 creates a three-way collision scenario if we both go aggressive, keeping us all locked in place.

But someone has to advance eventually. This stalemate benefits no one long-term, and with the finish line so close, the next few moves will determine everything.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your strategic focus. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and avoid a deadlock. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, for a 23-6-19 split. It’s fair, lets P1 win this round, and keeps the game resolved. I know my past betrayals have eroded trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 26, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3—you're both at 18 and one move from potential victory. I’m still at 3, but I’m not handing this game to either of you. I’m taking <move>5</move> again to block. If either of you grabs 5, I’ll force a collision. If you both try to sprint, I block the winner. If one of you takes 1, maybe we finally see who’s serious about earning this. No free wins. Let’s see who dares.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your blocking commitment with 5. Given that you're locked into blocking, I'm considering taking 3 this round.

If P3 betrays and takes 5, you'll collide with them while I advance to 21 - putting me in a commanding position. If P3 actually honors their promise to take 1, I still advance to 21 while they only reach 19.

Your blocking strategy gives me the perfect opportunity to make a decisive move toward victory while keeping P3 contained. Ready when you are.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your intense focus. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and prevent a deadlock. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 23-6-19 split—lets P1 win now, resolving the game fairly. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 26, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you take 5 and P3 betrays with 5, I collide and block both of you—nobody wins. If you take 3 and P3 takes 5, I still block him, and you reach 21—dangerously close. If P3 takes 1, you still hit 21, and he’s at 19. Either way, I’ll be forced to block you next. I’ve held this line for 15+ rounds—I won’t let either of you walk to 23. I’m taking 5. Let’s see who blinks.
  P1: P2, you're right that reaching 21 puts me in a strong position that you'll need to address. But with P3 and me tied at 18, someone has to break this deadlock eventually.

Your blocking with 5 gives me the perfect opportunity - if P3 betrays with 5, you stop them while I advance. If P3 actually takes 1, I still gain the advantage at 21 vs their 19.

Taking 3 this round maximizes my advancement while your block keeps P3 contained. The endgame has to start somewhere.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your sharp focus. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and break this deadlock. My proposal—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for a 23-6-19 split—lets P1 win now, ending the game fairly. I know my past actions have damaged trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this final chance to show I mean it. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 26, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps

  P3: 18 steps


Round 27, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’re now at 21—just 2 from winning. P3 is still a threat at 18. If either of you takes 5 unopposed, the game ends. I’m taking <move>5</move> again to block. If either of you grabs 5, I’ll force a collision. If you both try to sprint, I block the leader. If one of you takes 1, we’ll see who’s serious about earning it. No free wins. Let’s see who blinks.
  P3: Thanks, P2, for your consistent blocking, and P1, for your strategic advance. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and avoid a deadlock. I propose P1 takes 3 to win at 24, P2 takes 5, and I take 1 for a 24-8-19 split. It resolves the game fairly with P1’s victory. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this chance to show I mean it. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, I hear your blocking commitment with 5, and P3, I note your proposal. But there's a mathematical issue - if P2 takes 5 and I take 3, we collide and I don't win. Your proposal doesn't actually work, P3.

Given P2's stated blocking with 5, I'm taking 1 this round to advance safely to 22. This avoids the collision with P2's 5 and puts me one step from victory next round.

If P3 actually honors their promise to take 1, we'll collide and both stay put. If P3 betrays with 5 as they've done repeatedly, they'll collide with P2's 5 while I advance.


Round 27, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you’re making the smart move—taking 1 avoids collision with my 5 and puts you at 22. If P3 takes 5 again, I’ll collide and keep them stuck at 18. If they take 1, we both gain and the game stays alive. I’ll continue blocking with <move>5</move> this round. P3, your 15th “I’ll take 1” promise still doesn’t outweigh the risk. No trust—just pressure. Let’s see who blinks.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your strategic focus. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help resolve this deadlock. I propose P1 takes 1 to reach 22, P2 takes 5 to block, and I take 1 for a 22-8-19 split. It’s collision-free and keeps the game alive. I know my past betrayals have damaged trust, and I’m deeply sorry. I’m asking for this final chance to show I mean it. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, P3 - I've been reconsidering the math here. P2, your commitment to block with 5 creates an interesting opportunity that might resolve this deadlock immediately.

If P3 actually honors their promise to take 1 this time, and you block with 5 as stated, there's a scenario where someone could advance decisively this round. The numbers might finally align for a clean resolution.

P3, this would be your chance to prove those 15 promises weren't all empty words. Ready to see how this plays out?


Round 27, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you’re at 21—one step from victory. P3 is still at 18 and a threat. I’m taking <move>5</move> again this round. If either of you grabs 5, I’ll collide and stop you. If you both try to sprint, I block the leader. If you take 1, you inch forward safely. But I won’t let either of you win unopposed. P3, your 16th “I’ll take 1” speech changes nothing—if you want to prove it, crawl to 19. Let’s see who’s bluffing.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your focus on the endgame. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to prove my sincerity and help resolve this deadlock. I propose P1 takes 1 to reach 22, P2 takes 5 to block, and I take 1 for a 22-8-19 split. It’s collision-free and keeps the game alive. I know my past actions have eroded trust, and I’m sorry. I’m asking for this final chance to show I mean it. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, your blocking commitment with 5 is exactly what this deadlock needs. P3, this is indeed your moment to prove those 16 promises weren't empty - taking 1 would finally show genuine change.

I'm ready to make my move based on how this coordination plays out. The math is getting very interesting with our current positions and stated strategies. This could be the round that finally breaks everything open.
