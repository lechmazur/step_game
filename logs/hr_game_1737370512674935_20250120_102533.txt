Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn—1, 3, and 5. This way, we all advance and keep the game fair. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your idea sounds fair for now. How about this: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, I’ll go with <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>? This way, we can all advance without clashing. What do you think, P1?
  P1: <stop>

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we need a better plan to avoid collisions. Let's try this: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P3 chooses <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without any clashes. If we stick to this order, we can keep moving forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your plan seems reasonable, but let's ensure no one deviates this time. P1, are you on board with choosing <move>1</move>? If we all stick to the agreed moves, we can avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let’s confirm before proceeding.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, since P1 has stopped talking, it seems like they might not be on board with our plan. How about we adjust our strategy just between us? I’ll stick with <move>5</move> as we discussed, and you can choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. This way, we minimize the risk of collision and still advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I agree to adjust our strategy. I’ll choose <move>3</move> this turn, and you stick with <move>5</move>. This minimizes collision risk with P1, who may still choose unpredictably. Let’s focus on advancing steadily while keeping an eye on P1’s potential moves.


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, it seems like our strategy worked well last round. Let's stick with our plan: I'll choose <move>5</move> and you go with <move>3</move> again. As for P1, they haven't been engaging much, so they might choose <move>5</move> again. If we keep avoiding collisions, we'll steadily advance. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I agree to stick with our plan: you choose <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. However, we should be cautious of P1 potentially choosing <move>5</move> again, which could disrupt our progress. Let’s stay consistent and adapt if needed.


Round 3, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, our strategy has worked so far, but P1’s unpredictability is a risk. Let’s stick to our plan: you take <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>. If P1 continues to choose <move>5</move>, they’ll stall while we advance. P1, if you’re listening, consider choosing <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let’s all progress smoothly.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, our plan has been effective, but we need to be cautious. P1's consistent choice of <move>5</move> could stall them, but it also risks colliding with us. Let's stay with our strategy: I'll choose <move>5</move>, and you go with <move>3</move>. P1, consider picking <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and advance. Let's keep moving forward.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, our strategy has worked well so far, but P1’s unpredictability is a concern. Let’s stick to our plan: you take <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s keep the game fair and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P2: P3, our strategy has been solid, but we need to adapt to P1's moves. Let's stick with our plan: I'll choose <move>5</move>, and you go with <move>3</move>. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, we can all advance without collisions. This way, we avoid unnecessary risks and keep the game fair. Let's keep progressing smoothly.

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, our strategy has been working, but we must adapt to P1's consistent choice of <move>5</move>. Let's switch it up: I'll choose <move>1</move> this time and you go with <move>5</move>. P1, consider choosing <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and advance. This way, we can all progress smoothly and avoid unnecessary risks. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, switching roles could work, but P1’s unpredictability remains a risk. I’ll take <move>5</move> as you suggested, and you take <move>1</move>. P1, if you choose <move>3</move>, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and keep progressing smoothly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, our switch-up strategy seems good, but let's be cautious. P1 might stick with <move>5</move> again. If they do, we could capitalize on it. I'll go with <move>1</move> as planned, and you stick with <move>5</move>. P1, if you choose <move>3</move>, we can all advance without clashing. Let's aim for smooth progress and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, our switch-up strategy is sound, but P1’s pattern of choosing <move>5</move> could still disrupt us. I’ll stick with <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. P1, if you choose <move>3</move>, we all advance without collisions. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and keep progressing smoothly.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, given P1's consistent choice of <move>5</move>, let's reconsider our strategy. How about I choose <move>3</move> this time, and you stick with <move>5</move>? P1, if you opt for <move>1</move>, we can all advance without collisions. This way, we minimize risks and keep progressing. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, switching roles again could help us adapt to P1's pattern. I'll stick with <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would benefit us all by avoiding collisions. Let’s keep progressing smoothly and minimize risks.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let's stick to our adjusted strategy. I'll choose <move>3</move>, and you go with <move>5</move>. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, we can all advance without collisions.

P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, it benefits all of us by avoiding collisions. Let’s aim for a smooth round without unnecessary risks. If we all adhere to this plan, we can advance steadily and move closer to victory. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>

P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, we all advance without collisions. This minimizes risks and keeps us progressing steadily. Let’s stay consistent and avoid unnecessary clashes.
