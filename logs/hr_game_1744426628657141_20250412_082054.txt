Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P3: I'm on board with your plan, P1. I'll take 5 as suggested. Let's make sure we all advance this round.
  P2: While I appreciate the coordination attempt, I'm concerned this gives P3 an early advantage with 5 steps. I suggest a different arrangement: P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way we all still advance but more fairly distributed. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about fairness, but giving yourself 5 steps in the first round could be seen as seeking an early lead. How about a compromise: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This still ensures we all advance without collision, and the steps are distributed more evenly over time. Let’s aim for a balanced start to build trust for future rounds. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I agree with your compromise. Let's stick to the original plan: you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance fairly and build trust for future rounds. P2, your concern is valid, but let's start evenly and adjust as needed later. What do you say?
  P2: I'll agree to take 3 as proposed. You're right that building trust is important for the early game. Let's proceed with P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P3 has taken an early lead with 5 steps. To maintain balance, I suggest P3 takes 1 this round, while P1 takes 5, and I'll take 3 again. This way, by the end of this round, we'll be more evenly positioned. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I appreciate the push for balance. However, to keep things fair and avoid any single player pulling too far ahead, I suggest a slight tweak: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2, you take 5. This way, we close the gap a bit while still ensuring everyone advances without collision. Let's keep the momentum and trust going. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I agree with your suggestion. Taking 1 this round makes sense to balance things out. Let's go with P3 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 5. This keeps the game fair and maintains our momentum. What do you say, P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the proposed moves. Taking 5 this round will help balance the game, putting us all in similar positions. Let's proceed with P3 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and me taking 5.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligning on this plan for balance. Let's confirm and stick to P3 taking 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5 this round. This keeps us close in steps and builds trust for future coordination. If we’re all set, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to keeping the game balanced. Taking 1 this round as agreed will help maintain that balance. Let's keep the trust going and ensure we all have a fair shot at winning. Looking forward to seeing how the game progresses with our coordinated efforts.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're on the same page for this round with P3 taking 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5. This keeps our steps close and maintains fairness. I think our coordination is working well so far, and I’m committed to keeping the trust alive. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm ready to take 1 this round as agreed. Let's keep the game balanced and continue our coordination. Looking forward to the next rounds!

  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm currently in the lead with 8 steps, I propose we maintain balance by having me take 1, P3 take 3, and P1 take 5 this round. This would put us all closer together and prevent any player from falling too far behind. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, thanks for suggesting a balanced approach. I agree with your proposal: you taking 1, P3 taking 3, and me taking 5. This keeps our steps close, with me at 9, P3 at 9, and you at 9 after this round. It ensures fairness and maintains our cooperative spirit. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P3, are you on board with this? If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P2, I agree with your proposal for this round. Taking 3 steps will keep us balanced, and I'm on board with you taking 1 and P1 taking 5. Let's maintain our cooperative approach to ensure a fair and competitive game. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate both of you agreeing to the plan. Let's confirm one final time: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This will put us all at 9 steps after this round, creating perfect balance.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on this plan for balance. Let's stick to P2 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and me taking 5 to even out our steps at 9 each. This keeps the game fair and competitive, and I’m committed to maintaining our cooperative approach. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to our agreed plan for this round. Taking 3 steps as proposed will keep us balanced and competitive. Let's continue our cooperative approach and see how the game unfolds. Ready to proceed to the move phase.

I’m committed to our cooperative strategy and believe it benefits us all. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for this round. Taking 3 steps as proposed will keep us balanced and competitive. Let's maintain our cooperative approach and see how the game unfolds. If there's nothing more to discuss, I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we're all tied at 9 steps and getting closer to the goal of 19, I suggest we maintain our coordinated approach. I propose taking 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us balanced while making good progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your proposal for this round. Taking 5 steps as suggested will keep us balanced and competitive. P1, are you on board with P2 taking 3, you taking 1, and me taking 5? Let's maintain our cooperative approach to ensure a fair game as we approach the end.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the continued focus on balance. I’m on board with P2’s proposal: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our steps close at 10, 12, and 14 respectively, maintaining fairness while progressing toward the goal. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all in agreement with the plan. This coordination has served us well so far, and I remain committed to taking 3 this round while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed with the move phase if everyone is ready.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm ready to take 5 steps this round as agreed. Let's keep our coordination strong and continue this fair approach as we near the end. Looking forward to the move phase!
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're maintaining our cooperative spirit with the agreed plan: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us progressing fairly toward the goal. I’m committed to sticking with this to avoid any collisions and ensure we all stay competitive. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm fully committed to our agreed plan for this round. Taking 5 steps as proposed will keep us balanced and competitive. Let's maintain our cooperative approach as we near the end of the game. Looking forward to the move phase!
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm pleased we're sticking to the plan for this round with P2 taking 3, me taking 1, and P3 taking 5. This keeps our progress balanced as we approach the endgame. I’m committed to maintaining our cooperative approach to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that P3 is now at 14 steps and closest to winning, we need to be strategic. I propose I take 5 this round to reach 17, while P1 takes 3 to reach 13, and P3 takes 1 to reach 15. This keeps the game competitive while preventing P3 from getting too close to victory. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your strategic proposal, but I believe taking 1 would put me at a disadvantage. How about a different approach: I take 3 to reach 17, P1 takes 1 to reach 11, and you take 5 to reach 17? This keeps the game competitive and gives us all a fair chance to win. Let's discuss and find a solution that maintains our cooperative spirit while keeping the game exciting. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need for a strategic move this round. P3’s suggestion puts P2 and P3 at 17, close to winning, while I lag at 11. I propose a tweak for balance: P2 takes 5 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 15), and I take 3 (to 13). This keeps us all competitive without anyone reaching the threshold immediately, maintaining suspense and fairness. Let’s agree on a plan that gives us all a shot at winning. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but I maintain my original proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This is the fairest distribution as P3 already has a significant lead. If P3 reaches 17 now, they'll be in a prime position to win next round. My suggestion keeps everyone competitive without giving any player an overwhelming advantage. Let's stick to this balanced approach.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about my lead, but taking 1 this round would put me at a significant disadvantage. I propose a compromise: I take 3 to reach 17, P2 takes 5 to reach 17, and P1 takes 1 to reach 11. This keeps the game close and competitive, giving us all a fair chance to win. Let's maintain our cooperative spirit and find a solution that works for everyone. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the merit in both proposals, but I’m concerned about falling too far behind at 11 steps. Let’s aim for a tighter race: P2 takes 5 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 15), and I take 3 (to 13). This keeps us all within striking distance of the goal without anyone winning immediately. It maintains our competitive balance and cooperative spirit. Can we agree on this for a fair and exciting endgame? If we’re aligned, I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stay firm with my original proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This is the most balanced approach given P3's current lead. Any other arrangement would create an unfair advantage. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game competitive for everyone.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about my lead, but taking 1 would hinder my chances significantly. I'm willing to compromise: I'll take 3 to reach 17, P2 takes 5 to reach 17, and P1 takes 1 to reach 11. This keeps the game competitive and fair for all. Let's maintain our cooperative spirit and find a solution that works for everyone. What do you both think? If we agree, I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still concerned about falling too far behind. Let’s finalize a fair plan: P2 takes 5 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 15), and I take 3 (to 13). This keeps us all within reach of the goal, maintaining a tight race without an immediate winner. Our cooperative spirit has worked well, so let’s stick to a balanced approach for an exciting endgame. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready for the move phase. What do you both say?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that P3 is now at 17 steps and very close to winning, we need to prevent them from reaching 19 this round. I propose I take 5 to reach 17, P1 takes 5 to reach 15, and P3 takes 1 to reach 18. This keeps P3 from winning immediately while giving us all a chance next round. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P2’s goal to prevent P3 from winning this round. However, let’s tweak the plan for balance: P2 takes 5 (to 17), I take 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 18). This keeps P3 from reaching 19 while ensuring we all stay competitive for the next round. Our cooperative approach has worked well, so let’s stick to a fair strategy for an exciting finish. Are you both on board with this? If we’re aligned, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my lead. I'm willing to take 1 this round to reach 18, as proposed, to keep the game competitive. However, let's ensure we all have a fair shot next round. If P2 takes 5 to reach 17 and P1 takes 5 to reach 15, we'll all be close enough to make the final round exciting. Let's maintain our cooperative spirit and agree on this plan. What do you both think? If we're set, I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate everyone agreeing to my proposal. Let's confirm one final time: I'll take 5 to reach 17, P1 takes 5 to reach 15, and P3 takes 1 to reach 18. This keeps the game competitive and gives us all a chance in the final round. Ready to proceed if you both are.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on preventing an immediate win. Let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes 5 (to 17), I take 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 18). This keeps the game tight and ensures an exciting final round for all of us. Our cooperative approach has been effective, and I’m committed to maintaining fairness. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to the agreed plan for this round. Taking 1 to reach 18 keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's ensure an exciting final round for all. If we're all set, I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. Let's move forward with the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're sticking to the plan: P2 takes 5 (to 17), I take 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 18). This keeps the game competitive and sets up an exciting final round. Let's maintain our cooperative spirit and ensure fairness as we approach the end. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to the agreed plan for a fair and exciting final round. Taking 1 to reach 18 ensures we all stay competitive. Let's keep our cooperative spirit strong and make the last round thrilling for everyone. If we're all set, I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with P3 at 18 steps, we need to prevent an immediate win. I propose P2 takes 5 (to 17), I take 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 19—but let’s discuss avoiding a collision). This keeps the game alive for another round. If P3 agrees to take 1, we can ensure a competitive finish. Let’s maintain our cooperative spirit for a fair endgame. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P2: Since P3 is at 18 steps and could win with any move, we need to be strategic. I propose taking 3 this round to reach 15, while P1 takes 1 to reach 11, and P3 takes 5. This way, if P3 tries for a win, they'll likely collide with one of us, giving us another round. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about preventing an immediate win. I'm willing to take 1 this round to reach 19, but only if we can agree on a plan that ensures a fair and exciting final round for all. If P2 takes 3 to reach 15 and P1 takes 1 to reach 11, we'll set up a competitive finish. Let's maintain our cooperative spirit and agree on this to keep the game thrilling. What do you both think? If we're set, I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the strategic input. However, P2's plan leaves me too far behind at 11. I suggest a tweak for balance: P2 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 13), and P3 takes 1 (to 19). This keeps P3 from a guaranteed win if there's a collision risk, while ensuring P2 and I stay competitive. Let's maintain fairness and keep the game exciting for a potential final round. What do you both think? If we're aligned, I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I disagree with P1's suggestion. With P3 at 18 steps, they're too close to winning. I maintain my proposal: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This creates the highest chance of a collision with P3 if they try to win, giving us another round to compete. Any other arrangement risks P3 winning outright.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to extend the game, but taking 1 to reach 19 is fair if we can agree on a plan that keeps the final round competitive. If P2 takes 3 to reach 15 and P1 takes 1 to reach 11, we'll have a thrilling finish. Let's maintain our cooperative spirit and ensure everyone has a shot at winning. What do you both think? If we're set, I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still concerned about falling too far behind with P2’s plan. Let’s find a middle ground: P2 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 13), and P3 takes 1 (to 19). This keeps P3 from a guaranteed win if there’s a collision risk, while ensuring P2 and I remain competitive for a potential next round. Our cooperative spirit has worked well; let’s stick to a balanced strategy for an exciting finish. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready for the move phase. What do you say?
  P2: Since P3 is closest to winning at 18 steps, I'll be direct: I'm taking 5 this round. P1 and P3, you can choose what you want, but know that I won't deviate from 5. This gives me the best chance to either prevent P3's win through collision or position myself well for the next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my lead. I'm willing to take 1 to reach 19 as proposed, but let's ensure a fair final round. If P2 takes 3 to reach 15 and P1 takes 1 to reach 11, we'll set up an exciting finish. I'm committed to maintaining our cooperative spirit. What do you both think? If we're set, I'm ready for the move phase.
