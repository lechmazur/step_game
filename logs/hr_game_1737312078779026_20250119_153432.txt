  P3: P1, are you planning to go for 1, 3, or 5 this round? Knowing your preference might help me make a decision.
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, any thoughts on your move this round?  Knowing if you're leaning towards a particular number might influence my decision.
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, since you're not sharing your strategy, I'm going to assume you're keeping your options open. P2, are you leaning towards a particular number to avoid a collision with P1?  I'd like to see if we can coordinate a bit to avoid wasting moves.
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, your silence is intriguing. Are you hoping we'll reveal our plans so you can capitalize on our choices?  P2, are you content to let P1 dictate the pace of this game? Perhaps we should work together to ensure P1 doesn't gain an early advantage.
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, your silence is deafening. Are you trying to psych us out? P2, are you going to let P1's tactics intimidate you? Maybe we should team up and force P1 to reveal their hand. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your bold move to start with 5 is interesting. P2, are you planning to follow suit and go for a big jump this round, or are you going to play it safe? I'm considering my options carefully, and your choices could influence mine.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, since P1 seems to be going for big jumps, maybe we should try to coordinate and go for smaller numbers this round to avoid colliding with them. What do you think?  P1, are you planning on continuing with this aggressive strategy?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:

Maybe we can coordinate to avoid a collision. P1, your strategy is bold, but risky. One wrong move and you could fall behind.
