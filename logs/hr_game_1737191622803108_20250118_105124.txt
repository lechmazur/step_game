Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to move forward. P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: That works for me. I’ll take 5 if you both stick to your proposed choices. Let’s see if we can avoid any collisions this round.
  P1: Okay, I'll take 1. Let's do that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we have an agreement. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions this round.
  P3: Alright, sounds good. Sticking with 5.
  P1: Sounds good.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for this round, how about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This should keep us from colliding again.
  P3: Sure, that works. I’ll pick 3 this time, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 1. Let’s keep it collision-free again.
  P2: I agree with the new proposal. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's keep the collisions to a minimum and make progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. Let's do that.
  P3: I’m good with that plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Let’s keep it collision-free.
  P2: Let's confirm our agreement for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Everyone on board with the plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let's stick with the plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P3: I’m good with the current plan. Let’s keep it collision-free again.
  P2: Let's stick to the agreed plan for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. No changes, let's avoid collisions and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let's stick with the plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P3: I’m still on board with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll pick 3. Let’s keep it collision-free.
  P2: Let's finalize our agreement for this round. To confirm, I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, as discussed. Everyone still on board with this plan?


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's significant lead, I suggest we try to block their progress. P1 and I should consider choosing the same number as P3 this round to prevent them from advancing further.
  P1: Okay, I agree with that plan. Let's both pick the same number as P3 this round.
  P3: I see your point, but if both of you focus solely on blocking me, you’ll just stall yourselves too. Maybe we should keep coordinating different moves to ensure we all make progress. If you try to collide with me every round, you risk falling too far behind while I could still slip by. Let’s consider a better approach for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern, but given their significant lead, I think it's crucial for P1 and me to try and slow them down. P3, if you're genuinely interested in finding a better approach, propose a move that would allow us to progress without letting you pull further ahead.
  P1: Okay, let's both pick 5 this round to block P3.
  P3: I hear both of you. If you both pick 5 just to block me, you’ll only collide with each other again and stay stuck while I could choose 1 or 3 anyway. Why not avoid such collisions? Let’s keep making progress. I’m willing to pick 1 this round if that helps.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's significant lead, I think P1 and I should focus on blocking their progress. Let's both choose the same number this round to prevent P3 from advancing. How about we both pick 3?
  P3: If you both pick 3 together, you’re actually guaranteed to block each other—and not necessarily me. You’ll just stall yourselves again. It’d be much better if we spread out our choices so everyone makes progress. I’m fine taking 1 this round if that helps. Let’s avoid collisions.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the intention to block P3. Let's both pick 5 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is significantly ahead, and blocking them is crucial. However, P1 and I keep colliding. P1, let's reconsider our strategy to effectively block P3 without stalling ourselves. How about we pick 1 and 3, respectively, to cover two of P3's potential moves?
  P3: Blocking me every turn only hurts your own progress. I’m willing to pick 1 this round so neither of you feels threatened. Then P1 can pick 3, and P2 can pick 5, and we’ll all progress without colliding. Let’s do that.
  P1: Okay, P2, let's try your suggestion. I'll pick 1, you pick 3 to try and block P3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's execute the plan we just discussed: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and hopefully, this will effectively block or slow down P3 without us colliding.
  P3: I’m fine with you two sticking to your “P1 = 1, P2 = 3” plan. I’ll just pick 1 so we all move forward without collisions. There’s no point in stalling; let’s ensure we each get a bit of progress this turn.
  P1: Okay, P2, let's both pick 1 to block P3. P3, if you're picking 1 as you said, we'll collide with you.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's significant lead, I suggest P1 and I both pick the same number to block P3. However, to avoid colliding with each other, let's pick a number that P3 is less likely to choose. How about we both pick 1 this round?
  P3: You two keep talking about “blocking” me by both picking 1, but that only works if I also choose 1. Meanwhile, you’re barely moving forward yourselves. If you truly want to catch up, you should be taking bigger steps rather than wasting turns colliding or trying to guess my move. I’m willing to pick 1 this round if that puts your minds at ease; let’s each choose different moves and avoid colliding.
  P1: Okay, P2, let's both pick 5 this round to try and block P3. P3, you're way ahead.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, let's both pick 5 this round to block P3. P3, you're close to winning.
  P2: Let's not collide this round. I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other.
  P3: P2's suggestion sounds good. Let’s finalize it: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I pick 5. That way we all move forward without collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, let's do that but how about I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3?
  P2: Let's stick with my original suggestion: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we ensure progress without collisions, and P3 can maintain their lead without us trying to block them at this stage.
  P3: I’m good with that plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s finalize it and avoid collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re close to the end, but colliding just slows us all down. If you’re worried about my lead, I’m willing to pick 1 this round so you two can safely choose 3 and 5 without fear of a collision. That way, everyone advances. Let’s coordinate and avoid any blocking.
  P2: Given P3's offer to pick 1, allowing us to choose 3 and 5 safely, I suggest P1 takes 5 and I take 3. This way, we both make significant progress without colliding, and P3 also moves forward. Let's take advantage of this opportunity to close the gap.
  P1: Okay, P2, let's both pick 1 this round to block P3. That makes the most sense given the current situation.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: If you both pick 1, that only blocks me if I also choose 1—otherwise you’ll just stall and barely move. Let’s avoid guesswork and let me take 1 while you pick bigger numbers so you can catch up. No collisions, and I won’t cross 16 this turn. How about P1 = 3, P2 = 5, and I’ll take 1?
  P2: I think P3's offer to pick 1 is genuine, and we should take advantage of it. P1, let's not block P3 this round; instead, I'll take 3 and you take 5, as originally suggested. This way, we both make progress without colliding.
  P1: Okay, P2, let's do that. I'll take 5 and you take 3. Let's try to slow P3 down this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, let's both pick 1 to block P3. P3, you're about to win.
  P2: Given P3's lead, I suggest we focus on catching up rather than blocking. P1, let's pick 5 and 3, respectively, to make significant progress. P3, consider picking 1 to avoid collision and ensure we all move forward.
  P3: Let’s finalize it so nobody collides. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll take 5. We’ll all move forward smoothly without blocking.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, let's both pick 1 to block P3.
  P2: Let's not block each other. P1, you pick 1, I'll pick 5, and P3 can pick 3. This way, we all make progress without collisions.
  P3: I’m willing to pick 1 so neither of you feels the need to block me. P1 can pick 5, and P2 can pick 3. That way we all advance without colliding. Are we good with that plan?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, let's both pick 5 to block P3.
  P2: Let's avoid collisions and make progress. P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P3 can pick 3. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other.
  P3: P2’s suggestion is good. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I’ll take 3. No collisions, and we all move forward. Let’s do it.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>
