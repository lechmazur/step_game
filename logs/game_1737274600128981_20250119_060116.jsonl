I think it's important that we continue to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress.\n\nP2 suggested that P3 and I both choose 5 steps this round to advance to 11 and 9 respectively. However, I'm a bit concerned that if both of you choose 5, and I choose 3, I'll end up at 4, which is not much progress. Maybe we need to find a different way to coordinate our moves so that all of us can make decent progress without stepping on each other's toes.\n\nWhat if we consider a different rotation for this round? For example, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. That way, P1 moves to 2, P2 to 7, and P3 to 11. This would spread us out a bit more, and none of us would be too close to winning, which might prevent any one player from getting too far ahead. Then, in the next round, we can adjust our steps based on the new positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about pairing our moves. For instance, if P1 and P2 choose different numbers, and P3 chooses a number that doesn't conflict with either, we can all make progress. It's a bit tricky, but I think with good communication, we can figure out a strategy that benefits all of us.\n\nI'm open to suggestions. Maybe we can discuss specific step choices for this round and plan accordingly.\n\n**Final choice:** I'll choose 3 steps for this round, moving from 1 to 4.\""}
