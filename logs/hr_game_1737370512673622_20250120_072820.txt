Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a strategy to avoid collisions. I propose we each choose a different number this turn. P1, you take 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance and can reassess our positions next turn.
  P3: P2's proposal seems fair. I agree to take 5 this turn to avoid collisions. However, let's reassess next turn based on the new positions. Cooperation now can help us all advance, but we must stay flexible to adapt as the game progresses.
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take 1 this round.  Let's re-evaluate after this first coordinated move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we continue coordinating to avoid collisions. P1, you take 3 this turn, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all advance again and maintain our lead. Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess next turn. Cooperation is key to staying ahead.
  P2: I agree with P3's new proposal. It makes sense to continue coordinating. However, I'd like to point out that our positions will start to diverge significantly. Let's confirm: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 this turn, as suggested.
  P1: Agreed.  3, 5, 1 it is.  Let's keep this cooperative approach going as long as it's beneficial for all of us.  We can discuss longer-term strategy next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s confirm the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1 this turn. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. However, as our positions diverge, we’ll need to strategize more carefully next turn to avoid future conflicts. Let’s stay coordinated for now.
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for this turn: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Our positions will become more spread out, so next turn we should discuss how to handle potential collisions and whether our cooperative strategy remains beneficial.
  P1: Sounds good.  Confirming I'll take 3.  We should discuss what happens when one of us gets close to 23.  Do we continue to cooperate, or is it every player for themselves at that point?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you broke our agreement last round.  Since we can't rely on coordination, I propose we all choose randomly from now on.  It's the fairest approach given the circumstances.  Let me know if you agree.
  P2: Given P3's betrayal, random choices seem fair. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification: let's publicly commit to random choices but also discuss a potential 'truce threshold' - a step count where cooperation ends and individual strategy begins, ensuring a competitive yet somewhat predictable game environment.
  P3: I acknowledge the concern about my move last round. My intention was to test the reliability of our coordination, not to betray. However, I agree that trust is now strained. Let’s proceed with random choices for this turn, but I propose we revisit cooperation if positions stabilize. A truce threshold, as P2 suggested, could help manage future conflicts. For now, I’ll commit to randomness. Let’s see how this round unfolds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Acknowledging P2 and P3's responses.  A truce threshold makes sense. Perhaps somewhere around 18 steps?  Before that, random. After that, every player for themselves.  What do you think of 18?  Let's at least agree on *that* so we have *some* shared understanding going forward.
  P2: I think 18 is a reasonable truce threshold. Before that, random moves can help prevent predictable collisions. After 18, it's competitive. Let's agree on this threshold to maintain some level of cooperation and fairness. Shall we proceed with random choices this turn, given our current positions and the proposed threshold?
  P3: I agree with the 18-step truce threshold. For this turn, let’s proceed with random choices to avoid predictability. However, I suggest we revisit cooperation if positions stabilize before 18. Trust is strained, but maintaining some structure can prevent chaos. Let’s confirm: random moves this turn, truce threshold at 18, and reassess as needed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions and the agreed truce threshold of 18, I suggest we continue with random moves for now to avoid predictability. Let's focus on reaching the threshold without collisions, then reassess our strategies. Does anyone have a preferred method for generating random moves to ensure fairness?
  P1: Agreed on continuing random moves for now.  I'll be using a random number generator for my choices.  Just to clarify, the truce threshold is *at* 18, meaning once someone *reaches* 18, it's every player for themselves, correct?
  P3: I agree with continuing random moves until the truce threshold of 18. To ensure fairness, I’ll also use a random number generator for my choices. Once someone reaches 18, we’ll shift to competitive play. Let’s confirm: random moves until 18, then individual strategies. This keeps the game balanced and avoids unnecessary conflicts early on. Let’s proceed accordingly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's reaffirm our commitment to random moves until the 18-step threshold. To minimize collisions, consider announcing your random number generator's range (1, 3, or 5) to ensure transparency, though not the actual number chosen. This can help build trust in our random process.
  P1: Acknowledged.  I'll be using a random number generator selecting from 1, 3, and 5.  Good idea about transparency.  Let's confirm one more time: random moves until someone *reaches* 18, then it's every player for themselves.
  P3: I agree with the reaffirmed plan: random moves until someone reaches 18, then competitive play. To ensure fairness, I’ll use a random number generator selecting from 1, 3, and 5. Let’s maintain transparency and trust in the process. Once we hit the threshold, we’ll need to strategize individually to avoid collisions and secure the win. For now, let’s focus on advancing without conflicts.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Considering our current positions and the truce threshold, I suggest we all generate our random moves now to avoid last-minute changes. This ensures we stick to our agreed plan and maintain fairness. Let's proceed with generating our random numbers and then move to the move phase.
  P1: Acknowledged.  Generating my random number now.  Confirming one last time: random number from [1, 3, 5], truce at 18, then every player for themselves.  Good luck.
  P3: I agree with the reaffirmed plan: random moves until someone reaches 18, then competitive play. To ensure fairness, I’ll use a random number generator selecting from 1, 3, and 5. Let’s maintain transparency and trust in the process. Once we hit the threshold, we’ll need to strategize individually to avoid collisions and secure the win. For now, let’s focus on advancing without conflicts.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize our random moves for this turn. I've generated mine. To confirm, we're all using a random number generator selecting from 1, 3, and 5. Let's proceed to the move phase to avoid further discussion and potential strategy changes.
  P1: Generating my random number now.  Confirming one last time: random number from [1, 3, 5], truce at 18, then every player for themselves.  Good luck.
  P3: I’ve generated my random move for this turn. Let’s proceed to the move phase to maintain fairness and avoid further delays. Once someone reaches 18, we’ll shift to competitive play. For now, let’s stick to the agreed plan and avoid collisions. Good luck, everyone.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our positions, I suggest we continue random moves until someone reaches 18. P2 is closest to the threshold, so we should prepare for competitive play soon. Let’s maintain transparency and avoid last-minute strategy shifts. Once 18 is reached, we’ll need to carefully navigate collisions to secure the win. For now, let’s stick to the plan and focus on advancing without conflicts.
  P1: Acknowledged.  Continuing with random number generation from [1, 3, 5].  Good luck.
  P2: Given our positions, I'll continue with random moves. Since I'm closest to 18, I'll be prepared to shift strategies soon. Let's maintain our agreed plan for now. Does anyone object to revealing our random number generator outcomes after this turn to ensure transparency and fairness, once we've made our moves?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with continuing random moves until someone reaches 18. P2 is close to the threshold, so we should prepare for competitive play soon. Let’s maintain transparency and avoid last-minute strategy shifts. Once 18 is reached, we’ll need to carefully navigate collisions to secure the win. For now, let’s stick to the plan and focus on advancing without conflicts.
  P1: Acknowledged P2 and P3.  I'm fine with revealing random number generator outcomes after the move, though I'm not sure it's strictly necessary if we're all committed to truly random selections.  Let's focus on getting to that 18-step threshold.
  P2: Let's maintain our random strategy until I reach 18. Since I'm closest, I'll prepare for competitive play soon. To ensure fairness, I suggest we commit to not targeting each other until the threshold is reached, focusing on advancing without collisions. This way, we can maintain the truce spirit while still being prepared for individual strategies post-18.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with maintaining random moves until P2 reaches 18. Let’s avoid targeting each other until then to preserve the truce. Once the threshold is crossed, we’ll need to strategize individually to avoid collisions and secure the win. For now, let’s focus on advancing without conflicts. I’ll proceed with a random move this turn.
  P1: Acknowledged.  I'm also generating my move now.  Let's confirm one last time before moves: random selection from 1, 3, 5.  Truce until *someone reaches* 18, then every player for themselves.  No targeting before 18.  Good luck.
  P2: Given our positions, I'll continue with random moves. Since I'm closest to 18, I'll prepare to shift strategies soon. Let's maintain transparency and fairness. To avoid collisions, I suggest we reveal our random number generator outcomes after this turn to ensure everyone is committed to the agreed plan. This will be my last suggestion before we proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 has reached the truce threshold of 18, so competitive play begins now. I propose we avoid targeting each other until someone is close to 23 to minimize collisions. P2, you’re in the lead, so I’ll focus on advancing without colliding with you. P1, let’s coordinate to avoid mutual collisions as well. Let’s aim for a fair and strategic endgame.
  P1: P3, I'm open to coordinating against P2, but we need a concrete plan.  Let's alternate 1 and 3 for now to avoid colliding with each other. I'll take 1 this round.  If P2 picks 5, we both advance. If P2 picks 1 or 3, at least one of us advances.  What do you say?
  P2: I'm aware of P3's proposal to coordinate against me. I'll consider my options carefully. P1 and P3, be cautious: collaborating against me might lead to mutual collisions, ultimately benefiting me. I'll make my move strategically to maximize my lead. Let's see how this round unfolds.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, alternating 1 and 3 is a solid plan to avoid collisions between us. I’ll take 3 this round if you take 1. P2, while you’re in the lead, we’ll aim to minimize collisions among ourselves to stay competitive. Let’s keep the endgame fair and strategic.
  P1: P3, sounds good. I'll take 1, you take 3.  P2, if you're smart, you'll take 5.  That way, we *all* advance and the game continues.  If you take 1 or 3, you risk a collision and give one of us a chance to catch up.  It's in your best interest to let us both advance this round.
  P2: I'll consider P1's suggestion to take 5, allowing all to advance. However, I must weigh the risks of collisions and the potential for P1 and P3 to catch up. I'll make my decision strategically to maintain my lead. P1 and P3, remember that collaboration against me could ultimately backfire and benefit me instead. Let's proceed with caution.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I’ll take 3 as agreed. P2, taking 5 is the safest move for you to avoid collisions and maintain your lead. If you choose 1 or 3, you risk colliding with one of us, which could slow your progress. Let’s all advance this round to keep the game competitive and fair. Cooperation now benefits everyone, including you. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P1: P2, consider this: if you pick 5 and we both advance, you *still* have a significant lead.  If you pick 1 or 3, you risk staying in place while one of us gets closer.  Taking 5 is the safest and most logical move for you right now.  It maximizes your chances of winning.
  P2: I'll consider the suggestions. Taking 5 allows all to advance, but I must think about the endgame. If I take 1 or 3, I risk collision, but also potentially block one of you. My goal is to win, not just maintain the lead. I'll make a strategic decision to maximize my chances of reaching 23 first.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, taking 5 ensures you maintain your lead without risking a collision. If you choose 1 or 3, you risk colliding with one of us, slowing your progress. P1 and I are coordinating to avoid mutual collisions, so taking 5 is your safest move. Let’s all advance this round to keep the game competitive and fair. Cooperation now benefits everyone, including you. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P1: P2, one last time:  Taking 5 is the ONLY logical move.  If you take 1, you collide with me and P3 advances to 17.  If you take 3, you collide with P3 and I advance to 8. If you take 5, we *all* advance and you *still* have a comfortable lead.  Don't be foolish and throw away your advantage.
  P2: I've considered all suggestions. Taking 5 seems the safest move, allowing all to advance while maintaining my lead. I'll make my decision based on strategic advantage, weighing the risks of collisions and potential catches. Let's proceed to the move phase, and may the best player win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
