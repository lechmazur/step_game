Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a temporary truce for the first few rounds to spread out our positions. I propose we each choose a different number this round to avoid collisions. P1, P3, are you willing to cooperate for now and choose unique numbers?
  P1: Agreed. To avoid collisions, I'll choose 5. P2 and P3, please select 3 and 1 so we all advance this round.
  P3: Okay, I will choose 1 then. P2, does 3 work for you? Let's all move this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan. Since P1 is choosing 5 and P3 is choosing 1, I will select 3 as proposed. Let's make this round collision-free and advance together. Shall we confirm our choices are set and proceed to the move phase?
  P1: Confirmed. Sticking to 5, 3, 1 ensures we all advance. Let’s proceed.
  P3: Sounds good. Let's proceed to the move phase then.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, for round 2, to keep things balanced, how about we choose moves in descending order of our current positions? So P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5 this round. What do you think?
  P1: **P1:** Agreed. To prevent collisions, I'll take 1. P2 and P3, stick to 3 and 5. Let's all advance again this round. We'll need a new strategy next round to spread out.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. Choosing in descending order of our positions makes sense. P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we maintain balance and avoid collisions for now. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan for Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, yes 3 works for me.  Let's proceed with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and I choose 5 for this round as planned.  Confirmed on my end.
  P1: 
  P2: Let's reaffirm our Round 2 plan. P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This strategy allows us to advance without collisions for now. Shall we proceed with these choices for Round 2?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, for round 3, how about we switch the order and go in ascending order? P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and I choose 5. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions for another round.
  P1: Agreed, but continuing the same pattern will lead to a three-way tie upon reaching 22. Let's rotate assignments this round to prevent collisions and differentiate our paths. I propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This allows gradual divergence while avoiding immediate conflict. We can reassign next round based on new positions. Thoughts?
  P2: P1's proposal to rotate assignments is intriguing. However, I'm concerned it might lead to unnecessary conflicts early on. How about we stick to the ascending order as P3 suggested, but with a twist: we re-evaluate our positions after this round and adjust strategies accordingly. This way, we maintain balance while keeping our options open for future rounds. What are your thoughts on this compromise?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I am fine with ascending order for this round as P2 suggested. So P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and I choose 5. This will slightly change our positions and we can re-evaluate after this round as P2 proposed. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 3.
  P1: **P1:** Continuing ascending order allows P3 to gain +5 each round, leading them to win. Let's rotate: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1 this round. This balances progress and prevents a single leader. Otherwise, we risk P3 running away with the game.
  P2: Considering our tied positions, rotating assignments as P1 suggested could introduce unpredictability. However, to balance progress, how about we slightly adjust P1's last proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round? This way, we test the waters with a bit of divergence while keeping the game competitive. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I am fine with the rotation and will choose 1 as you both suggested. Let's go with P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and P3 choosing 1 for this round. This slight divergence sounds reasonable for now.
  P1: **P1:** P2, choosing 5 will prompt me to take 5 as well. We'll both lose, while P3 advances. Let's avoid that. P2, take 3. I'll take 1. P3 can take 5. This keeps the game balanced. No collisions, and progress stays controlled.
  P2: Let's finalize our Round 3 strategy. To avoid collisions and balance progress, I suggest we stick with the last agreed rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without immediate conflict. Shall we confirm and proceed with this plan for Round 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's proceed with the plan for Round 3 then: P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 5. This keeps us all moving forward and we can reassess our strategy next round. Let's confirm this is final and move to the move phase.
  P1: **P1:** P3's repeated 5 picks will win them the game. Let's rotate: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This maintains balance. If you both stick to the plan, I'll commit. If not, I'll block P3's 5 by also choosing 5, causing mutual loss. Decide wisely.
  P2: Given the deadlock, let's simplify: to prevent P3 from pulling ahead, I'll choose 5 if P3 does. Otherwise, I suggest we stick to a rotation that prevents any single player from consistently gaining +5. P1's last proposal of P3 taking 1, me taking 3, and P1 taking 5 seems like a balanced approach for this round. Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, for round 4, let's continue with ascending order: P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and I choose 5. This keeps us balanced and moving forward.
  P2: Given P3's lead, we should avoid their proposed ascending order. P1 and I should consider blocking P3's advancement by choosing 5, forcing a collision and preventing them from pulling further ahead. Alternatively, a rotation that limits P3's gain could be discussed, ensuring the game remains competitive. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: **P1:** P2, let's both choose 5. If P3 takes 5, we all block. If they deviate, their gain is minimal. I commit to 5. Align with me to stall P3's lead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, it seems you are trying to stop my progress. If we all collide on 5, no one moves. How about P1 and P2 choose different numbers, and I will choose 3? This way at least two of us will advance. What do you think?
  P2: P1's suggestion to both choose 5 could stall P3's lead, but it risks a collision with no progress. How about P1 takes 5 and I take 3? This pressures P3 to choose 1, limiting their gain and keeping the game competitive. P3, would you consider choosing 1 if we proceed with this plan?
  P1: **P1:** P2, let's execute your plan: I take 5, you take 3. P3, if you take 5, we collide and you gain nothing. Take 1 or 3 and we all advance. Let's finalize this to avoid mutual loss.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I will choose 1 as P2 suggested to avoid collision. Let's all move forward.
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This limits P3's lead and allows us to advance. P3, confirming you'll choose 1 to avoid collision and ensure progress for all?
  P1: **P1:** Final confirmation: I take 5, P2 takes 3. P3, honor your word and take 1. If you deviate to 5, we collide and you gain nothing. Stick to 1 for mutual progress. Let’s all advance this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I am choosing 1 as agreed. Please choose 5 and 3 respectively so we can all move forward and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: I'll choose 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we limit P3's lead and make progress. If anyone deviates, we risk collision and no progress. Let's honor our agreement and move forward.
  P1: Final confirmation: I'm locked on 5. P3, honor 1 to avoid mutual loss. P2, hold 3. Let’s all advance. Any deviation risks collision. Proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3's pattern: 3 in Rounds 3 and 4. They'll likely repeat. P2, choose 3 to block them—collision stops their gain. I'll secure a different path. If we halt P3 now, we maintain balance. Trust is critical. Let's act decisively.
  P3: P2, P1 is trying to get you to block me again like last round, but that didn't help you. Let's both choose different numbers to move forward this round. I will choose 5. How about you choose 1? P1, what will you pick?
  P2: P1's strategy to block P3 by choosing 3 could work, but it also risks another collision. I propose a different approach: I'll choose 1, P1 takes 5, and P3, as you've said, takes 5. This way, P3 and P1 collide, and I advance, balancing the game. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P2, colliding with me only helps P3. If you take 3, I'll take 5. P3 must choose 1 or collide. This way we advance and limit their gain. Trust is key now. Let's align to block P3's progress decisively.
  P3: P2, P1 is trying to trick you into blocking me again, which only benefits P1. Let's both move forward. I will choose 5. If you choose 3, we both advance and leave P1 behind. P1, choose 1 to avoid collision.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess. P3's lead is growing. I propose I choose 3, blocking P3's potential 3 choice. P1, you suggested a similar strategy earlier. If we work together, we can limit P3's gain. P3, choosing 5 will collide with P1, giving me an advantage. Let's proceed with caution and strategic thinking to balance the game. What are your next moves, considering our current positions?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P2, aligning is our only path. If you take 3, I take 5. P3 must choose 1 or collide. We both advance if they comply, block their gain if they betray. Trusting P3 risks their lead—they’ve broken deals before. Let’s force them to 1. Deviate, and I’ll block your move. Decide: mutual progress or chaos.
  P3: P2, don't let P1 trick you into blocking me again. It didn't help you last round, and it won't now. P1 is just trying to control the game. Let's cooperate instead. You choose 1, I choose 5. P1 can choose 3 and we all move, or P1 can try to block me and collide, which benefits you. Choose wisely!
  P2: P1 and P3, let's end the cycle of mistrust. I'll choose 3 if P3 chooses 5, ensuring a collision and limiting their lead. P1, if you choose 5, we risk collision, but it pressures P3. Let's make a final decision to balance the game. P3, will you choose 5, risking collision, or 1, allowing progress? The choice is yours, but know that I'll act to maintain competitiveness.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P2, final offer: Take 3. I commit to 5. P3 must choose 1 or collide. This stalls their lead, letting us advance. Deviate and we all lose. Trust now or lose forever.
  P3: P2, P1 is clearly trying to manipulate you to block me.  Don't fall for it again. Let's both choose to move forward. I will choose 5. If you choose 1, we both advance. P1, you can choose 3 to also move, or 5 to collide with me and only help P2.  Let's all progress this round.
  P2: I'll choose 3 to block P3's potential gain, pressuring them to choose 1. P1, if you choose 5, we risk collision, but it limits P3's lead. Let's make a strategic decision to balance the game. P3, will you choose 1 or risk collision with P1?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's recent choice of 1, I suspect they might aim for 5 this round to regain lead. P1, considering your significant lead, will you choose 1 to advance slowly or 5 to risk collision with P3? I'll choose 5 if P3 does, to block their gain. Let's discuss a balanced approach to maintain competitiveness.
  P1: **P1:** P2, take 5 to block P3's likely 5. I'll choose 3 to advance. If they deviate to 1, you still gain. Trust this to balance the game. P3, if you pick 5, collision with P2 halts you. Opt for 1 to move safely. Let's avoid mutual loss.
  P3: P2, don't fall for P1's block again.  If you choose 3 like last round and I choose 5, and P1 chooses 3 as they said, then P1 and you collide and I move forward. That helps both of us catch up to P1. Let's do that.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's not repeat past mistakes. I'll choose 5 if P3 does, to maintain balance. P1, if you choose 3 as stated, and P3 chooses 5, I'll block them. P3, choosing 1 would be a safer move, avoiding collision. Let's make strategic decisions to keep the game competitive. What are your final thoughts before proceeding to the move phase?
  P1: **P1:** P2, choose 5 to block P3's likely 5. I'll take 3. If P3 picks 5, you block them; if they take 1, I gain. This limits their lead and keeps us in control. Trust this strategy.
  P3: P2, choosing 5 to block me only helps P1 increase their lead with 3.  If we both pick 5, nobody moves.  Instead, if you pick 1 and I pick 5, at least one of us progresses.  Don't let P1 dictate your move again. Let's focus on catching up to P1 together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's break the cycle. I'll choose 1, allowing one of you to gain. P3, if you choose 5, you advance. P1, choosing 5 risks collision with P3. This move tests your strategies and trust. Proceed with caution, considering the game's balance and your leads.
  P1: **P1:** P2, choosing 1 allows P3 to take 5 and overtake. Block them by taking 5. I’ll take 3. If they pick 5, you collide and halt their lead. If they pick 1, you gain. Trust this to balance the game.
  P3: P2, P1 is again trying to control your move to block me, which only helps P1 who is already winning.  If you take 5 to block me and P1 takes 3, P1 increases their lead while we stay behind.  Instead, if you choose 1 and I choose 5, we both advance and can catch up to P1. Don't let P1 dictate your strategy again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll choose 5 to block P3's potential gain. P1, please choose 3 as previously stated. If P3 picks 5, collision will occur, and their lead will be halted. Let's proceed with this strategy to maintain balance. P3, choosing 1 would be a safer move, but I expect you to choose 5 to try and regain the lead. Let's end this round strategically.
  P1: **P1:** P2, hold 5 to block P3’s 5. I’ll take 3. If P3 picks 5, you collide. If they take 1, you gain. Either way, their lead is controlled. Trust this strategy to balance the game. Proceed.
  P3: P2, P1 is trying to trick you into blocking me again, which only benefits P1. If you choose 1 and I choose 5, we both advance and can catch up to P1. P1, if you choose 3, we all move forward. Let's work together to challenge P1's lead.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is trying to maintain their lead by controlling your moves.  Let's work together instead. If you choose 1 and I choose 5, and P1 chooses 3, we all advance, but you and I gain more ground on P1.  This is better for both of us than letting P1 dictate the round again. What do you think? P1, choosing 3 lets you move forward too.
  P1: **P1:** P2, choose 5 to block P3's likely 5. I'll take 3. If P3 picks 5, you collide and halt their gain. If they take 1, you advance. This limits their progress while we both move. Trust this strategy—it's our best path to balance the game. P3 can't be allowed to surge.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess. Given P1's lead and P3's attempt to catch up, I'll consider blocking P3's gain. P1, your strategy to block P3 with me is noted. However, I might choose 1 to advance and reduce the gap with P1. P3, if you choose 5, I'll reconsider to block you. Let's proceed cautiously, weighing our options to maintain competitiveness and limit unnecessary collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, don't let P1 dictate your move again.  Choosing 5 to block me only helps P1 extend their lead.  If you choose 1 and I choose 5, we both gain ground on P1. P1, if you choose 3 as you suggested, we can all move forward, but P2 and I will close the gap on you. Let's make this round about catching up to P1 together.
  P1: **P1:** P2, final chance: choose 5 to block P3's 5. I take 3. If P3 picks 5, you halt them. If they pick 1, you gain. Trust now or P3 surges. Deviate, and we all lose. This is our path to balance. Decide.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's break the cycle of mistrust. I propose a temporary alliance to limit P1's lead. P3, choose 5, and I'll choose 1. P1, you can choose 3, allowing all to advance. This round, let's focus on catching up to P1 together, rather than blocking each other.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, choosing 1 and me choosing 5 lets us both gain ground on P1. P1, choosing 3 allows you to move forward too.  P2, blocking me with 5 again only helps P1 increase their lead further. Let's cooperate this round to catch up to P1 together.
  P1: **P1:** P2, block P3's 5. I commit to 3. If you take 5, P3 collides or you gain. If you side with them, you both help me win. Choose wisely: mutual progress or P3's surge. Final call.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's end the cycle of blocking. I'll choose 1, allowing one of you to gain. If P3 chooses 5, they advance. P1, choosing 5 risks collision with P3. Let's proceed with caution, focusing on strategic decisions to balance the game and limit unnecessary collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1 is clearly trying to manipulate you into blocking me to secure their lead. Don't fall for it again!  If you choose 1 and I choose 5, we both gain ground on P1. P1, if you choose 3, we all move, but P2 and I will close the gap on you. Let's work together to challenge P1's lead this round.
  P1: **P1:** P2, choosing 5 secures your gain or blocks P3. If they take 5, you halt their surge. If they take 1, you leap to 19—close to me. I’ll take 3, advancing to 19. Next round, we can strategize without P3 threatening. Trust this to balance the game. Deviating risks P3’s acceleration. Final call: align now or lose control.
  P2: I'll choose 5 to block P3's potential surge and limit their gain. P1, please proceed with your stated choice of 3. This strategy maintains balance and controls P3's advancement. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, given our current positions, I propose we avoid collisions. P1 and I are tied, and P3 is behind. Let's choose unique numbers to advance. I'll take 1. P1, you can take 5, and P3, take 3. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 8.
  P3: P2, your proposal helps P1 win this round.  Neither of us wants that. Let's both pick 5 to block P1. Then we can discuss our moves for the next round. What do you think?
  P1: **P1:** P2, colliding on 5 only benefits P3's long-term catch-up. Stick to your plan: you take 1, I take 5. If you deviate, we both lose progress while P3 gains. Trust the original strategy—mutual advancement now gives us control. Let’s avoid stalemates and secure individual paths.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's not fall into a collision trap. I'll stick to my initial plan: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. Colliding on 5 only benefits P3 in the long run. Let's prioritize mutual progress and avoid stalemates.
  P3: P2, you are letting P1 win by following their plan! P1 is already at 19. If you let P1 take 5, they will reach 24 and win.  Choosing 1 for you and 3 for me as you suggested only secures P1's victory.  We need to stop P1 now. Let's both pick 5 to collide with P1 if they also pick 5, or at least prevent P1 from gaining if they pick something else. Think about it!
  P1: **P1:** P2, sticking to your plan (1,5,3) avoids collision. If you take 5, P3 will take 3. We both gain nothing. Trust the plan: you take 1, reach 20. Next round, choose 3 to win. Colliding now only stalls us, letting P3 close the gap. Let's proceed smartly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll stick to my plan: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures mutual progress without collisions. Colliding on 5 benefits no one but P3 in the long run. Let's prioritize advancement and avoid stalemates. P3, blocking P1 now won't guarantee your win; it might just stall us and give P1 an advantage next round. Proceeding with unique choices is our best strategy for Round 8.
  P3: P2, let's both pick 5 to block P1 from winning this round. If P1 also picks 5, nobody moves, which is better than letting P1 win. If P1 picks something else, we still limit their progress. I will choose 5.  P1, to avoid collision with P2, please choose 3.
  P1: **P1:** P2, sticking to 1 avoids collision and brings you to 20. P3’s 5 won’t collide with you. I commit to my move. Trust the plan; next round you can secure victory. Deviating now risks P3’s resurgence.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll stick to my initial plan: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures mutual progress without collisions, bringing me to 20 steps. Next round, I can choose 3 to potentially win. Let's proceed with unique choices and avoid stalemates.
  P3: P2, you are handing P1 the win this round! Your plan lets P1 reach 24 and win.  You only get to 20, still losing.  Choosing 1 now gives P1 victory. Let's both pick 5 to block P1.  Then next round we can both aim for the win. Don't let P1 win now!
  P1: **P1:** P2, trust the plan: you take 1 (20), I take 5 (24) ending the game. If you deviate to 5, we collide and P3 gains. Sticking to 1 gives you a chance next round. P3 can't win now. Let's finalize and secure your path to 20. Proceed.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P2, any move you choose I will mirror to force collision. The only path without mutual loss is letting me take 3 to win. Prolonging helps P3. Cooperate now to end the game cleanly. Choose wisely—stalemate benefits no one.
  P3: P2, don't let P1 win this round. P1 is bluffing to scare you. If we both pick 5, P1 cannot win. I will pick 5. Let's block P1 together and prevent P1 from winning. We can discuss our moves next round after we stop P1.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P1's threat to mirror my move, I'll choose 3 to end the game cleanly, as suggested. This avoids stalemate and prevents P3 from catching up. P1, if you're bluffing, you'll lose by mirroring. If genuine, let's end this with a clear winner. P3, your proposal to block P1 is noted, but I prioritize a decisive end over prolonged uncertainty.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P2, choose 3 and I mirror—collision halts your win. Pick 1 or 5, same result. Only path without mutual loss: let me take 3 unopposed to end the game. Prolonging helps P3. Cooperate now for a decisive outcome. Stalemate benefits none. Final warning.
  P3: P2, don't fall for P1's trick! Choosing 3 won't end the game cleanly, it will just cause a collision with P1. P1 is bluffing to scare you into letting them win. Let's both choose 5 to block P1 and stop them from winning this round.  We can figure out our next moves after that. Don't let P1 manipulate you!
  P2: Let's end the game decisively. P1, your mirroring threat is noted, but I'll choose 3 anyway, hoping to avoid stalemate and secure a win. P3, your proposal to block P1 is considered, but I prioritize a clear outcome. If collision occurs, we'll reassess next round. Let's proceed with caution and strategic thinking to conclude the game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P2, choosing 3 triggers collision—neither wins. P3 can’t catch up. Let me take 3 unopposed to end it. Stalemate wastes rounds; cooperation secures your second place. Deviate, and I mirror, forcing mutual loss. Final offer: avoid 3 or 5. Let me close this cleanly.
  P3: P2, don't listen to P1!  Choosing 3 like you said will just cause a collision with P1, and P1 is still closer to winning next round.  Let's both choose 5 to BLOCK P1 and stop them from winning NOW.  If we both pick 5, P1 can't win this round.  We can figure out next moves after that. Don't let P1 win!
  P2: P1 and P3, I've considered your proposals. P1, mirroring my move leads to stalemate. P3, blocking P1 with 5 might prolong the game. I'll choose 3, ending the game cleanly or forcing a collision. This decision prioritizes a decisive outcome over uncertainty. Let's conclude the game with a clear winner or a shared understanding of the next steps.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P2, collision on 3 benefits no one. Allow me to take 3 unopposed to end the game. You secure second place. Prolonging risks P3’s resurgence. Final chance: avoid 3/5. Stalemate wastes rounds.
  P3: P2, choosing 3 is likely a collision with P1 as P1 threatened to mirror.  Even if not, P1 is close to winning next round. Let's both pick 5 to block P1 this round. This is our best chance to stop P1 from winning now.  I will choose 5.
  P2: I'll choose 3, prioritizing a decisive end. P1, if you mirror, we collide. P3, your block attempt is noted, but I seek a clear outcome. Let's conclude the game with a winner or a shared next step. Cooperation now avoids stalemate, securing my position and ending uncertainty.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 11 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P2 ***
