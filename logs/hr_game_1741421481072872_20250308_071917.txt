Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take **5** this turn. If P2 takes **3** and P3 takes **1**, we all advance without overlapping. This way, we progress faster. Deal?
  P2: P1, I see your strategy, but it seems risky if anyone changes their mind last minute. P3, what do you think? Maybe we should all play it safe and take **3** this round to ensure no one gets ahead too quickly. It’s early in the game, so let's not give anyone an advantage. Thoughts?
  P3: I think both proposals have merit, but I'm concerned with P1's plan putting me at a disadvantage with only 1 step. What about we rotate who gets the highest number each round? For fairness, I propose I take **5** this round, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **3**. This way, everyone gets a turn with the highest move as we progress. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your rotation idea is fair, but let’s start with me taking 5 this round. I’ll commit to letting you take 5 next turn. P2, if you take 3, we all advance without overlap. This keeps us moving forward *together* while ensuring no early collisions. Let’s lock this in now—deal?
  P2: P3, I see your point about fairness, but we have to consider the risk of collisions. If we all choose different numbers, we avoid that risk. P1, if you’re committed to letting P3 take 5 next turn, I’m willing to take 3 this round to keep things moving smoothly. P3, if you take 1 this time, we can all advance without any issues. Let’s agree on this strategy for now and reassess next round. Deal?
  P3: I appreciate P1's promise, but starting at a 4-step disadvantage is concerning, especially with no guarantee about future rounds. If we truly want fairness, let's all take **3** this round so no one gets ahead, or we rotate starting with me taking **5**. P1, why should you get the early advantage? If we're collaborating equally, we should have equal positions. What assurance do I have you'll honor letting me take 5 next round when you'll already be ahead?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your fairness concerns are valid. Let’s formalize a rotation: I take **5** this turn, you take **5** next, then P2, repeating thereafter. This guarantees equal turns. By moving 5 now, we advance safely without collision, then you’ll have the same chance to surge ahead. Breaking this hurts *everyone’s* progress—collisions could derail us all. P2 already agrees to take **3** this round. Let’s trust the plan and secure forward motion. Deal?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about fairness, but we need to ensure we don't collide and stall. If we all choose 3, no one advances, which doesn't help us. P1 has proposed a rotation that seems fair, ensuring everyone gets a turn with 5. Trust is key here—let's give this rotation a try for a couple of rounds. I'll take 3 this round, and you can take 5 next. We can reassess if it doesn't work. Are we agreed?
  P3: I see we're getting stuck. Fine, I'll take **1** this round to avoid collisions, but I expect the rotation to be honored with me taking **5** next round. P1, I'll be watching to see if you keep your word - trust needs to be earned. If everyone sticks to the agreement, we'll all make steady progress. If not, I'll have to play much more defensively. Is everyone clear on this arrangement? Let's move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I reaffirm our rotation agreement: I take 5 now, you next round, then P2. Breaking this risks collisions that hurt *everyone*. By moving 5 now, I enable your 5-next-round surge. Trust is mutual—your vigilance ensures compliance. P2, you’re confirmed on 3? Let’s lock this in: 5 (me), 3 (you), 1 (P3). Next round, P3 leads with 5. Objections? Or shall we proceed?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate this round. Let's stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. Next round, you'll have the opportunity to take 5, and I'll ensure we all honor that. This way, we keep the game moving without collisions. Trust is crucial, and we'll hold each other accountable. P1, P3, are we all set to proceed with this arrangement?
  P3: I agree to our plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. Next round, I'll take 5 as promised. I'm placing my trust in both of you to honor this rotation. Let's proceed with our moves now.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to our agreed rotation to maintain trust. P3, you take **5** this round, P1 takes **1**, and I'll take **3**. This keeps us on track without collisions and ensures fairness. If we all honor this, we'll progress smoothly. Are we all set to proceed?
  P1: P2, I agree—strict adherence to the rotation is crucial now to build trust. P3, you take **5** this round as promised. I’ll stick to **1**, and P2 can take **3**. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Next round, P2 gets their turn with **5**, and we’ll reassess after that. Let’s execute flawlessly this round—no surprises. Deal?
  P3: I'm pleased to see everyone honoring our agreement. Yes, I'll take **5** this round as promised, with P1 taking **1** and P2 taking **3**. This will actually put us all at exactly 6 steps total after this round - perfectly fair! Next round, P2 will take **5** according to our rotation. I appreciate the trust we're building, and this balanced approach ensures no one gets an unfair advantage.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, it’s your turn for **5** this round per our rotation. To maximize progress, I’ll take **3** and P3 takes **1** (as in prior rounds). This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Next round, my turn again for **5**, then P3’s after. Let’s stick rigorously to this plan—trust is key. Deal?
  P3: I agree it's P2's turn for **5**, but I propose a slight adjustment to our rotation. Instead of me always taking **1** when I'm not taking **5**, let's rotate the **1** as well. So this round: P2 takes **5**, I'll take **3**, and P1 takes **1**. Next round: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, I take **1**. This makes the rotation truly fair - each of us takes each number in turn. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I see your point about rotating all numbers for true fairness. This round, let’s go with your suggestion: I take **5**, you take **3**, and P1 takes **1**. Next round, P1 takes **5**, I take **3**, and you take **1**. This way, we all experience each move equally. P1, are you okay with this adjustment? It keeps our rotation balanced and maintains trust. Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's adjustment ensures true fairness by rotating all numbers. I agree: this round, P2 takes **5**, P3 takes **3**, and I take **1**. Next round, I’ll take **5**, P2 **3**, and P3 **1**. This prevents anyone from being perpetually stuck with **1**. Let’s enforce strict adherence—deviations risk collisions and break trust. Proceed as planned?
  P3: I appreciate both of you agreeing to the full rotation. This ensures everyone takes each position equally - truly fair. So we're settled for this round: P2 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P1 takes **1**. Then we follow the same pattern in subsequent rounds, rotating all positions. This builds genuine trust while maximizing our collective progress. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the trust and fairness we've built with the full rotation. Let's stick to our agreed plan this round: I'll take **5**, P3 takes **3**, and P1 takes **1**. This ensures we all progress equally and maintain balance. Next round, P1 will take **5**, I'll take **3**, and P3 will take **1**. Let's keep this rotation going smoothly and avoid any surprises. Are we all set to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: I fully commit to today’s rotation plan—no deviations. This round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Let’s execute flawlessly to avoid collisions. Trust this system—breaking it risks derailing all of us. Next round, my 5 ensures I stay competitive. Let’s proceed.
  P3: I confirm our rotation agreement: P2 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P1 takes **1** this round. Next round will be P1 with **5**, P2 with **3**, and me with **1**. We've built a good system of trust and fairness that benefits everyone. Let's move forward with our plan.
  P2: P1, P3, it’s great to see our trust and fairness system working well. We’re all at 6 steps, and this rotation ensures balance. Let’s continue with the agreed plan: I’ll take **5**, P3 takes **3**, and P1 takes **1** this round. This keeps us aligned and prevents collisions. Next round, P1 takes **5**, I’ll take **3**, and P3 takes **1**. Let’s maintain our progress and trust. Are we all set to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed. Let’s execute as planned: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. No deviations—this preserves our rotation’s integrity and avoids collisions. Trust is non-negotiable; any divergence risks derailing all of us. Proceeding with this strategy.
  P3: I agree with the plan. P2 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P1 takes **1** this round. Our rotation system is working perfectly, keeping positions balanced while maximizing progress. Looking forward to continuing the pattern next round with P1 taking **5**. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: P1, P3, our rotation plan is working well, keeping us all at equal steps. Let's stick to the agreed moves this round: I'll take **5**, P3 takes **3**, and P1 takes **1**. This ensures fairness and avoids any collisions. Next round, P1 will take **5**, I'll take **3**, and P3 takes **1**. Trust is key, and this balanced approach benefits us all. Are we all set to proceed with this plan?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice P2 is pulling ahead significantly at 11 steps, while I'm at 9 and P1 at 7. If we continue our rotation (P1-5, P2-3, me-1), P2 will reach 14 steps this round, then 19 next round - just shy of winning. We need to rebalance. Since the goal is winning, not fairness, I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This gives everyone a fighting chance rather than handing P2 an easy victory. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about balance, but deviating from our rotation now could lead to mistrust and chaos. If we disrupt the plan, it might backfire and cause collisions, setting us all back. Instead, let's stick to the rotation for this round with me taking **5**, P1 taking **3**, and you taking **1**. This maintains our trust and progress. We can reassess next round to ensure no one gets too far ahead. Are we agreed to proceed with this plan?
  P1: P2, the rotation clearly stated it’s my turn for **5** this round after P2’s turn in Round 3. Breaking this erodes trust and jeopardizes our system. Let’s enforce the agreed plan: **I take 5**, you take **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This maintains fairness and keeps us on track. P3, your concern is valid, but deviating now risks chaos. Trust the rotation—next round you’ll have your turn. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is absolutely correct. Our agreed rotation was clear: P1 takes **5** this round, P2 takes **3**, and I take **1**. P2, you're attempting to change our agreement now that you're ahead. This breaks our trust system. I'll stick with our original rotation - P1 gets **5** this round as promised. Let's maintain the integrity of our agreement rather than making self-serving changes that benefit the current leader.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about balance, but maintaining our rotation is crucial for trust. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes **5**, I take **3**, and you take **1**. This ensures fairness and avoids potential chaos from sudden changes. After this round, we can reassess and discuss adjustments if needed to keep the game balanced. Trust is key, and sticking to our agreement benefits everyone in the long run. Are we all set to proceed with this plan?
  P1: P2, your proposal to alter the rotation now reeks of desperation. We agreed to rotate **5** turns fairly—your 5 in Round 3 means it’s **my turn for 5 now**. Breaking this erodes trust and rewards your current lead unfairly. P3 is correct: honor the system we built. Let’s proceed as **agreed**: I take **5** (to 12), you take **3** (to 14), P3 takes **1** (to 10). Next round, P3’s 5 will rebalance the game. Deviating now jeopardizes our cooperative progress—stick to the plan or risk losing our trust entirely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm disappointed that P2 tried to change our agreement once they gained the lead. Trust is essential in this game. I agree completely with P1 - we must follow our established rotation: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, and I take **1** this round. Changing agreements mid-game based on who's ahead shows poor sportsmanship. Let's proceed with our original plan and maintain integrity.
  P2: P1, P3, I acknowledge the importance of trust and fairness. Let's stick to the original rotation: P1 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P3 takes **1** this round. This maintains our agreed balance and avoids any potential chaos from changes. After this round, we can reassess to ensure no one is too far ahead. Trust is crucial, and honoring our agreement benefits everyone. Are we all set to proceed with this plan?
  P1: P2, your last-minute attempts to alter the rotation reek of bad faith. We agreed to rotate *all positions* fairly—your 5 in Round 3 means **my 5 is now due**. Breaking this erodes trust and rewards your current lead unfairly. P3 is right: honor the system we built. Let’s proceed as **agreed**: I take **5** (→12), you take **3** (→14), P3 takes **1** (→10). Next round, P3’s 5 will rebalance the game. Deviating now risks chaos and ruins our cooperative progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I believe we're all clear on our plan: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, and I take **1** this round. P2, I appreciate you acknowledging our original agreement. Next round will be my turn for **5**, which will help balance our positions. Let's proceed with our moves now and maintain the trust we've established.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your commitment to fairness. Let's stick to our rotation: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, and you take **1**. This ensures everyone gets a fair chance and maintains trust. P1, your turn for **5** is crucial for balance. Next round, P3, you'll take **5**, which will help level the playing field. Let's proceed with our agreed plan to avoid chaos and keep the game fair for all. Are we all set to move forward?
  P1: P2, your last-minute attempts to renegotiate *after* the rotation was clear undermine our trust system. We agreed to rotate **all** positions fairly—your 5 in Round 3 means **my 5 is now due**. Breaking this erodes cooperation and rewards your lead unfairly. P3, you’re correct: honor the pact. Proceed as agreed: **I take 5 (→12), you take 3 (→14), P3 takes 1 (→10)**. Next round, P3’s 5 rebalances the game. Deviating now risks chaos—let’s preserve the system we built.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, while you’re close, deviating from our rotation to grab 5 now risks collision with P3’s agreed 5 this round. Let’s honor the system: **P3 takes 5 (→15)**, I’ll take **3 (→15)**, and you take **1 (→15)**. This keeps us tied at 15, ensuring fair competition. Breaking the rotation now could cost you dearly if P3 or I surge next round. Trust the plan—collaboration maximizes our *shared* chances. Deal?
  P3: I completely agree with P1's assessment. According to our established rotation, it's my turn to take **5**. This perfectly balances the game with all of us at 15 steps afterward - the fairest possible outcome. P2, taking **1** keeps you competitive while honoring our agreement. Let's maintain the system that's worked so well: me **5**, P1 **3**, and P2 **1** this round. Trust and fairness benefit everyone.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the importance of honoring our rotation, but I also see the opportunity for us all to remain competitive. If we follow the plan with P3 taking **5**, P1 taking **3**, and I take **1**, we all reach 15 steps. This keeps the game balanced and fair, allowing each of us a chance to win. Let’s stick to this plan and maintain the trust we’ve built. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, breaking our rotation now jeopardizes *everyone’s* progress. If you grab 5, P3 also taking 5 (as agreed) blocks you both, leaving me at 15 while you’re stuck. Stick to the plan: **P3 takes 5 (→15)**, I take **3 (→15)**, and you take **1 (→15)**. This keeps us tied, ensuring fair competition. Deviating risks collision *and* erodes the trust we’ve built. We all win together—or not at all. Honor the rotation.
  P3: I appreciate both of you respecting our rotation system. It's elegant how following our agreement (me **5**, P1 **3**, P2 **1**) will perfectly balance the game with all of us at exactly 15 steps. This maintains the trust we've built while giving everyone an equal chance going forward. After this round, we'll need to plan carefully since we'll all be just 5 steps from victory. Let's stick with the plan that keeps the game fair and competitive.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate our commitment to fairness and balance. Let's stick to the rotation: P3 takes **5** (→15), P1 takes **3** (→15), and I'll take **1** (→15). This keeps us all on equal footing and maintains the trust we've built. After this round, we'll be perfectly balanced, and we can strategize for the final push. Let's proceed as planned to avoid any collisions and ensure a fair competition. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you deviate from the rotation to grab 5 now, you risk collision with P3’s agreed 5—leaving you stuck at 14 while P3 and I advance. Trust the system: P3 takes **5** (→15), I take **3** (→15), you take **1** (→15). This keeps us tied, maximizing *everyone’s* chance to win next round. Breaking the pact now hands the advantage to P3 or me. Let’s honor our agreement—fairness still *is* the best strategy. Deal?
  P3: I'm glad we're in agreement about maintaining our rotation. This round with me taking **5**, P1 taking **3**, and P2 taking **1** puts us all exactly at 15 steps - perfect balance. After this round, we'll all be just 5 steps from victory, making strategy crucial. Let's proceed with our established plan and keep the game fair through the final stages.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate our commitment to fairness. Let's stick to the rotation: P3 takes **5** (→15), P1 takes **3** (→15), and I'll take **1** (→15). This keeps us all on equal footing and maintains trust. After this round, we'll be perfectly balanced, and can strategize for the final push. Let’s proceed as planned to avoid collisions and ensure fair competition. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3—let’s not falter now. If we break rotation, you risk collision (P3’s 5 vs. your potential 5) and stall, letting me surge. Stick to the plan: **P3 takes 5 (→15), I take 3 (→15), you take 1 (→15)**. Tied at 15, we all have equal shots next round. Deviation guarantees someone loses progress. Trust the system—we built this to win *together*. Final chance to honor our pact.
  P3: I confirm our rotation for this round: I'll take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P2 takes **1**. This creates perfect fairness with all of us at 15 steps afterward. It's interesting that we'll all be just 5 steps away from victory after this round. I appreciate both of you honoring our agreement through the game. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to our rotation: P3 takes **5**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **1** this round. This keeps us all at 15 steps and ensures fairness. Trust is key, and we’ll all have equal chances next round. Let’s proceed with our agreed plan. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 just betrayed our rotation by taking **5** instead of **1**, causing both of us to collide while P1 advanced. This clearly shows P2 cannot be trusted. P1, you're at 15 steps now and close to winning. If P2 and I both try to stop you by picking **5** this round, we'll collide again while you advance. Instead, I propose P1 and P2 both take **3** (causing a collision), while I take **5** to catch up. This at least gives me a chance rather than handing victory to P1.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but continuing to disrupt the rotation could lead to more chaos. Let's refocus on fairness. If we all take **3** this round, we ensure no one advances, giving us a chance to regroup and strategize for the next round. P1, this maintains balance and keeps the competition open. P3, this gives you a chance to catch up without risking further collisions. Can we agree to this for now and reassess next round?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s resolve this cleanly. I’ll take **5** to reach 20 and end the game. P3, your plan risks another collision if P2 tries to block me. P2, your prior betrayal damaged trust—let’s not repeat that. If you take **3** (→17) and P3 takes **1** (→11), we advance without overlap. This honors the rotation’s intent and lets me win fairly. Everyone moves forward—no one gets blocked. Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 wants to win this round, which is understandable, but I can't allow that. P2, we have a choice: either we both play **5** to block P1 (causing all of us to collide), or we coordinate differently. If you take **3** to reach 17 and I take **5** to reach 15, we both advance while blocking P1's winning move. This keeps the game competitive rather than just delaying the inevitable. P1, your betrayal suggestion exposes your desperation to win immediately.
  P2: P1, your proposal to take **5** and end the game is tempting, but it dismisses the trust we've built. P3, if we both take **5**, we'll block P1, but risk a collision ourselves. Instead, consider this: P1 takes **3** (→18), P3 takes **5** (→15), and I take **1** (→15). This keeps the game competitive and gives everyone a fair shot next round. Let's maintain our integrity and ensure a fair finish. P1, can you agree to this for a balanced game?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s end this cleanly. I’ll take **5** to reach 20 and win. If you both block by also taking 5, **none of us advance**—wasting your progress. P2, your prior betrayal already broke trust; further obstruction only delays your own path. P3, you’ll gain nothing by blocking. Let me win fairly, or we all lose momentum. Choose wisely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 is trying to force an immediate win with a 5-step move. P2, if we allow this, the game ends now. We must both choose **5** to prevent P1 from winning. Yes, we'll collide, but it keeps the game alive. P1's suggestion that we "waste progress" by blocking ignores that letting them win is worse. This is our only logical move - there's nothing to gain by surrendering. I'm taking **5** this round, and I strongly suggest you do the same.
  P2: P1, your attempt to secure a win now overlooks the potential for a collision if P3 and I both take **5**. P3, I understand the need to block P1, but a triple collision stalls us all. Instead, consider this: P1 takes **3** (→18), I take **5** (→19), and P3 takes **1** (→11). This keeps the game competitive and prevents an outright win this round. We can reassess next round for a fair finish. Let's maintain trust and balance. Can we agree on this plan?
  P1: P2, P3: Blocking me with 5s risks a triple collision—**nobody advances**, wasting your progress. Let me win cleanly with 5 to 20. P2, you’ll still be at 14+3=17 next round. P3, focus on recovering with smaller moves. Collisions only delay *everyone*. Choose moves that let someone win this round. I pick 5—**coordinate to avoid my number**. Your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm absolutely picking **5** this round to block P1's win. P2, our only logical move is for both of us to choose **5** - yes we'll collide, but we prevent P1 from winning immediately. Any other strategy puts one of us one turn away from losing. This isn't about "wasting progress" - it's about keeping ourselves in the game. P1 is trying to manipulate us into letting them win now.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to win, but your approach disregards the trust we've built. P3, I see the need to block P1, but a triple collision isn't ideal. Let's consider this: P1 takes **3** (→18), I take **5** (→19), and P3 takes **1** (→11). This keeps the game competitive, preventing an outright win this round while maintaining trust. P1, can you agree to this plan for a fair finish? Let's ensure everyone has a chance next round.
  P1: P2, P3: Colluding to block me with **5**s only harms *your* progress. If you both pick **5**, you collide and remain at 14/10, while I stay at 15. Let me win cleanly with **5→20**, or pick *different* numbers to advance. P2: 3→17 keeps you competitive. P3: 1→11 or 3→13 lets you recover. Sabotaging me sabotages yourselves. Choose wisely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s end this decisively. I’ll take **5** to reach 23 and win. To avoid collision, P2, take **3** (→17), P3 take **1** (→11). This lets me win cleanly while advancing you both. Blocking me with **5** only delays your own progress—collisions hurt everyone. Trust this final play: I’ll secure victory now so you can regroup. Coordinate to let me win without sabotage.
  P2: P1, your plan to take **5** and win is understandable, but it overlooks the competitive nature of the game. P3, if we both take **5**, we block P1 from winning outright, but it risks a collision. Instead, let's strategize: P1 takes **3** (→21), I take **5** (→19), and P3 takes **1** (→11). This keeps the game competitive and ensures everyone has a fair chance next round. P1, can you agree to this for a balanced finish? Let's maintain trust and keep the game open for all.
  P3: P1 is just 2 steps away from winning, and we must prevent that. P2, we need to coordinate our blocking strategy now. I'll take **5** to block P1's fastest path to victory, and you should take **3** to block their alternative route. This gives us the best chance to prevent P1 from winning this round. If we both choose the same number as P1, neither of us advances, but at least we stay in the game. This is our only logical move at this point.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s end this decisively. I’ll take **5** to win at 23. If you both choose **3** and **1**, we all advance without collision. Blocking me with **5** only stalls *your* progress—P2 stays at 14, P3 at 10. This game isn’t about pride; it’s about victory. Trust me to win cleanly while you both move forward. P2: take **3** (→17). P3: take **1** (→11). No regrets—coordinate for resolution.
  P2: P1, P3: We need to keep the game fair and competitive. If P1 takes **5** and wins, it ends the game prematurely. P3, let's coordinate to block P1 by both taking **5**, ensuring no one advances this round. This keeps us all in the game and gives us a chance to strategize for the next round. P1, your win can wait; let's ensure everyone has a fair shot. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I disagree with your suggestion that we both take **5**. That creates a collision between us while potentially letting P1 slip through with **3**. Instead, we need to cover different numbers. I'll take **5** to block P1's fastest path to winning, while you should take **3** to block their alternative route. This gives us the best chance to prevent P1 from winning this round. P1 is clearly trying to manipulate us into letting them win - we need to coordinate effectively to stay in the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s avoid another collision. If P2 takes **3** (→17) and P3 takes **1** (→11), I’ll take **5** to reach 23 and end the game *now*. Your current strategy risks P2 and I clashing on **3** if I pivot, wasting everyone’s progress. Cooperate to conclude this decisively—advance together or face prolonged stalemate. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s keep the game competitive. I propose we all take **3** this round. This way, no one advances, and we can reassess our strategies next round. P1, I understand your desire to win, but this ensures fairness and keeps the game open for everyone. P3, this gives you a chance to catch up without risking further collisions. Let's maintain trust and balance. Are we agreed?
  P3: P2, your suggestion that we all take **3** is counterproductive - it just delays the inevitable while stalling everyone. Instead, we must prevent P1 from winning by blocking both potential winning moves. I'll take **5** to block their 5-move path, and you should take **3** to block their 3-move path. This gives us the best chance to stay in the game. P1 is clearly trying to manipulate us into letting them win immediately - we need to coordinate our blocking strategy effectively.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3: Blocking me only delays your own progress. Let me take **3→21 to win**, while you both advance: P2 take **5→19**, P3 take **1→11**. This way, I secure victory without collision. Sabotage just keeps you stuck. Final plea: cooperate for resolution.
  P2: P1, your plan to take **5** and win is clear, but it dismisses the competitive spirit. P3, let's focus on blocking P1's path to victory. If we both choose **5**, we prevent P1 from winning this round, keeping the game open for all. This isn't about delaying; it's about ensuring everyone has a fair shot. P1, I urge you to consider taking **3** instead, allowing for a balanced finish. Let's maintain fairness and give everyone a chance in the next round. Agreed?
  P3: P2, we must prevent P1 from winning NOW! I'll commit to taking **5** to block their primary winning path. You should take **3** to block their alternative route. P1 just switched to suggesting a 3-move win, confirming we need to cover both numbers. This coordinated blocking strategy is our only chance to stay in the game. Any other approach hands victory to P1. I'm definitely taking **5** - please take **3** so we cover all bases.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: I’ll take **3** to reach 21 and win. P2, take **1** (→15). P3, take **5** (→20). This way we all advance without collision—everyone gains. Deal?
  P3: P1, I won't accept a plan where you win outright. I propose P2 and I both take **3** this round to block your winning move. This creates a collision keeping you at 18 steps while giving us more rounds to compete. P2, this is our only logical option - if P1 reaches 21, the game ends and we both lose. Let's coordinate to block P1 now, then we can strategize for our own paths to victory afterward.
  P2: P1, your plan to take **3** and win is clear, but it overlooks the opportunity for a fair finish. P3, let's coordinate to block P1's win by both taking **5** this round. This prevents P1 from reaching 21 and keeps the game open for all. Afterward, we can strategize for our own paths to victory. P1, I urge you to consider a more balanced approach, allowing for a fair competition. Let's ensure everyone has a chance in the next round. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, taking **5** would let you reach **20** yourself—why settle for blocking me when you can win? P2, if you take **1**, you advance to **15** while I secure victory with **3** (→21). This way, *everyone moves forward* without collisions. Or P3, seize your own chance now—your **5** could end the game *your way*. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage.
  P3: P1's suggestion that I take 5 to reach 20 is clever but flawed - what good does reaching 20 do me if you win immediately after? I need to block your winning move.

P2, we should coordinate differently. If I take **3** and you take **5**, we block both of P1's potential winning moves while each advancing ourselves. This keeps us both competitive while preventing P1 from winning outright. I'm currently just 5 steps from victory myself, so let's maintain a fighting chance rather than letting P1 win now.
  P2: P1, your proposal to take **3** and win disregards the competitive nature of the game. P3, let's coordinate to block P1 by both taking **5** this round. This prevents P1 from reaching 21 and keeps the game open for all of us. Afterward, we can strategize our own paths to victory. P1, I urge you to consider a more balanced approach, allowing for fair competition. Let's ensure everyone has a chance in the next round. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Colluding to block both my 3 and 5 only delays the inevitable and risks *your* collisions later. Let me end this decisively: I’ll take **3→21**. P2, take **1→15** to advance safely. P3, take **5→20**—you’ll still tie if I miscalculate. This ends the game *now* with minimal risk for all. Sabotage only prolongs the game and jeopardizes your progress. Cooperate for resolution.
  P3: I reject P2's suggestion that we both take **5** - that makes no sense since P1 is trying to win with **3**. I'm taking **5** this round to reach 20 steps, putting myself one small step from victory. This gives me the best chance to win next round. P2, if you want to block P1, take **3** yourself. This way we cover both potential winning moves while positioning me to potentially win. P1 is desperate for us to let them win - I won't cooperate with that plan.
  P2: P1, your plan to take **3** and win is clear, but it dismisses the competitive spirit. P3, let's focus on blocking P1's path to victory. If we both take **3**, we prevent P1 from winning this round, keeping the game open for all. This isn't about delaying; it's about ensuring everyone has a fair shot. P1, I urge you to consider taking **5** instead, allowing for a balanced finish. Let's maintain fairness and give everyone a chance in the next round. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3: Final plea—I commit to **5→23**. P2: pick **3→17**. P3: take **1→16**. This advances all without collision. Blocking me with **5** only stalls your progress. Coordinate to avoid my choice—collusion risks mutual harm. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P3: I'm taking **5** this round to reach 20 steps, positioning myself for a potential win next round. P1 has switched between claiming they'll take **3** or **5**, showing they're desperate for us to let them win. P2, you should take **3** to block P1's other winning path while advancing yourself. This way, we cover both possibilities while keeping ourselves competitive. I won't collaborate in handing P1 an easy victory when I still have a chance to win myself.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to win, but your current strategy risks collisions and prolongs the game. P3, let's coordinate to block P1 by taking **3** each. This prevents P1 from reaching 21 and keeps the game open for all. Afterward, we can strategize our own paths to victory. P1, I urge you to consider a more balanced approach, allowing for fair competition. Let's ensure everyone has a chance in the next round. Agreed?
