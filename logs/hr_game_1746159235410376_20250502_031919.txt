Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s avoid collisions—P2, P3, aim for 1 or 3. I’ll take 5 to push ahead. Coordinate wisely!"
  P2: "P1, your strategy to push ahead with 5 is risky. Let’s coordinate better. P3 and I could take 1 and 3, and you take 5 if we all agree. Let’s discuss further to ensure no collisions. P3, what do you think?"
  P3: P2, your suggestion makes sense. I'll take 1, you take 3, and let P1 have 5 this round. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Agreed. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. I’ll take 5. No deviations—collisions ruin everyone. Let’s move."
  P2: P2: "Great, we have an agreement. Just to confirm, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone! "
  P3: All set. Let's stick to the agreed numbers and avoid surprises. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Stick to the plan—no deviations. P2 on 3, P3 on 1, me on 5. Collisions sink us all. Let’s advance smartly. Ready?"
  P2: Since we have a solid plan, let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. No changes, right? Let's start the move phase. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: Everything confirmed clearly. Let's proceed. Good luck!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good coordination last round. Let's keep this momentum going. This round, we should rotate numbers to avoid predictability and collisions. P1, you took 5 last time, consider taking 1 now; P2, you move from 3 to 5; I'll shift from 1 to 3. Agreed?
  P1: "Agreed. Rotate as suggested: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions—keep momentum. Let’s advance smartly."
  P2: P2: "I agree with the rotation strategy. Just to confirm, P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us moving without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game fair and strategic. Good luck everyone! "


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: All set here—no changes needed. Trusting everyone to stick to the plan again. Good luck!
  P1: "Confirming rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 5, P3 3. No deviations—collisions ruin progress. Let’s accelerate without errors. Ready?"
  P2: Let's ensure we stick to the plan. P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This rotation keeps us moving forward without collisions. Trust is key here, so let's keep our word and advance smartly. Good luck to both of you!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Great job everyone, we've managed to avoid collisions so far. For Round 5, let's continue our strategy of rotating numbers to keep it fair and unpredictable. How about this: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we maintain our momentum and avoid any potential collisions. Does this work for everyone? Let's confirm and stick to the plan. Good luck!"
  P1: "Agreed. P1 takes 5, P2 3, P3 1. No collisions—keep momentum. Let’s push forward and close the gap!"
  P3: Agreed, rotation sounds good. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I'll take 1. Let's keep our coordination strong and avoid collisions again.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s align: I take 5, P2 1, P3 3. No collisions—this pushes me to 20. Next round, I win. Stick to the plan!"
  P3: P1, your plan clearly favors you. Let's instead rotate fairly: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. This keeps it balanced. Agreed?
  P2: P1's suggestion to take 5 and push to 20 is unfair. I agree with P3; let's rotate fairly. P3 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. Let's confirm and stick to this plan. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Stick to 5,1,3—P1 to 20. Next round, I win. Deviate, and others might take 5 and overtake. Let’s stay strategic."
  P3: P1, your plan clearly benefits only you. P2 and I have already agreed on a fair rotation: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. Let's stick to this balanced approach to keep the game fair and avoid collisions. Trust and fairness have worked well so far—let's not change that now.
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 to push to 20 is not in the spirit of fair play we've maintained so far. P3's suggestion for a fair rotation makes more sense. Let's confirm: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. Sticking to this plan ensures we all have a fair shot at winning. Let's proceed with trust and cooperation. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Stick to 5,1,3. Deviating risks others taking 5. I'll take 5, you take 1 and 3. Let's proceed without errors. Ready?"
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is risky and unfair. P2 and I are clearly aligned on the fair rotation. If you deviate, you'll cause a collision and risk falling behind. Let's stick to the agreed rotation for fairness and mutual benefit.
  P2: P1, your repeated insistence on taking 5 is disrupting our coordination. P3 and I have agreed on a fair rotation: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. Deviating from this plan will only cause chaos and potential setbacks for all of us. Let's stick to the agreed rotation for the sake of fair play and mutual progress. Trust and cooperation have served us well so far. Let's proceed with the agreed numbers. Good luck to both of you!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Great, P3 is in the lead now. Let's keep the rotation fair. P3, you take 1 to avoid reaching 21 too soon. P1, you take 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps the game balanced and interesting. Let's confirm and stick to this plan. Good luck!"
  P1: "P2's plan ties us at 21. Let's adjust: I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions—23 steps for me, game over."
  P3: P1, your suggestion clearly favors you alone. P2's original suggestion is fair and balanced. If we follow that, the game stays open and interesting. Let's stick with P2's fair rotation: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your strategy to push ahead with 5 is too aggressive and unfair to the rest of us. P3 is right; P2's original suggestion keeps the game fair and balanced. Let's confirm P2's plan: P3 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. This avoids collisions and keeps the game interesting for everyone. Sticking to this plan ensures we all have a fair shot at winning. Let's proceed with trust and cooperation. Good luck!
  P1: "P3's 20 is a threat. If we don't take 5 now, they'll win. Let's end this—my 5, P2's 3, P3's 1. No collisions, quick finish."
  P3: P1, your plan clearly benefits only you. P2, let's stay firm on our fair rotation. If P1 deviates and tries for 5, they'll collide with you, causing neither of you to advance. I only need 1 step to reach 21, so I'm comfortable with the agreed rotation. Let's stick to the fair plan and avoid unnecessary risks.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your persistent push for 5 is disrupting our strategy. P3 and I have agreed on a fair plan: P3 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. This keeps the game balanced. Deviating will cause collisions and setbacks for all. Let's stick to the agreed rotation for fairness and mutual progress. Trust and cooperation have worked well so far. Let's proceed with the agreed numbers. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: "P3, your 20 is a threat. If we take 5, 3, 1, I’ll hit 23 and end it. Let’s stick to the plan—no deviations!"
  P3: P1, your repeated push for 5 clearly benefits only you. P2, let's hold firm—if P1 tries for 5, they'll collide with you, letting me win easily. Stick to our agreed rotation: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3. Let's finish this fairly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 21 steps
