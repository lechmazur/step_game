Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions. Maybe we can agree to take turns picking numbers?  We could start with P1 choosing, then P3, then me, and so on. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions by taking turns. However, I propose we start with P2 choosing first, then P1, and finally me. This way, we can ensure a fair rotation. Let's confirm this strategy and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I understand the desire for a rotation strategy, but starting with P2 seems unfair since I’m P1. If we’re taking turns, it should begin with me. However, I’m open to discussing alternatives that don’t put anyone at an unnecessary disadvantage. Let’s find a solution where no one feels forced into a bad position. What if we randomized the starting order or alternated leadership each round?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems our first attempt at coordination failed since we all picked the same number. Let’s try again, but this time with clearer roles. I propose we stick to a fixed order: P1 goes first, P2 second, and P3 last. If we follow this strictly, we can avoid collisions. To demonstrate commitment, I’ll take 1 this round if you both agree. If not, we risk another collision. Confirm your agreement or suggest an alternative quickly.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for fairness, but P1's suggestion seems like the most logical way to avoid collisions.  Let's give it a try this round and see how it goes. P2, are you on board with P1 going first this time?
  P3: Alright, let's try P1's suggestion this round. P1 will pick 1, P2 will pick 3, and I will pick 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make some progress. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. Please agree or suggest another alternative quickly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a plan. To confirm, I’ll take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and progress for all of us. Let’s stick to this order strictly moving forward—P1, P2, P3—to maintain fairness and avoid confusion. If anyone disagrees or has a better idea, speak now. Otherwise, let’s lock this in and execute.
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to the order: P1, P2, P3.  P3, are you good with this?
  P3: P3: I'm good with the plan. To recap: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Let's confirm this one last time and move forward. If everyone is in agreement, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, the plan worked last round—let’s stick to it. I’ll take 1 again this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Consistency is key to avoiding collisions and making steady progress. If anyone wants to change the strategy, speak now. Otherwise, let’s confirm and move forward with this order: P1, P2, P3. Confirm or raise concerns.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's suggestion to stick with the plan. Let's keep this order going for consistent progress. P3, are you also on board?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m on board with continuing the plan. However, to ensure fairness and avoid any potential collisions, let's consider rotating the order every round. This round, we stick to P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and me picking 5. Next round, we can start with P2, then P3, and finally P1. This way, everyone gets a chance to lead. Does this sound fair to both of you? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, rotating the order introduces unnecessary complexity and risks collisions. Sticking to the original plan—P1, P2, P3—has already proven effective. Changing the order now could lead to confusion or disputes later. Let’s maintain consistency for fairness and progress. If we rotate, someone might feel disadvantaged when it’s their turn to pick last. Confirm you’re sticking with the current plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but rotating the order later could disrupt our momentum. Let's focus on reaching 20 steps first. We can discuss a rotation strategy once someone is close to winning. For now, let's stick with the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your points about maintaining consistency. Let's stick with the current plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. However, I propose we revisit the idea of rotation once someone reaches 10 steps to ensure no one feels disadvantaged as we approach the endgame. For now, let's confirm our moves for this round and proceed. Does everyone agree?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P3's desire to rotate the order later, but I'm concerned it could disrupt our progress. Let's stick to the current plan for now and reassess when someone reaches 15 steps. That way, we can make a more informed decision based on our positions.  Confirm you're okay with sticking to the plan for now.
  P3: P1 and P2, given that I've reached 10 steps, it's a good time to revisit the rotation idea. Let's start rotating the order this round to ensure fairness. I propose P2 goes first this round, then P3 (me), and finally P1. This way, everyone gets a chance to lead, and we maintain a balanced approach. Let's confirm this new order: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. Agree or suggest an alternative quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, rotating the order now risks confusion and collisions, especially since we’re making steady progress. P3, reaching 10 steps doesn’t justify changing a system that’s working. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This ensures consistency and avoids unnecessary disputes. If we rotate later, it should only happen when someone is closer to 20, not now. Confirm you’ll follow this plan for fairness and progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns about consistency, but P3's suggestion to rotate now is fair. We've made good progress with the current order, but it's time to ensure everyone gets a chance to lead.  Sticking to the original plan indefinitely could disadvantage P3 later on. Let's try P2 first, then P3, then P1 this round. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your points, but let's find a middle ground. Instead of a full rotation, let's adjust the numbers we pick to ensure fairness without changing the order. This round, I propose P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. This way, we all get a chance to pick different numbers, maintaining fairness while avoiding collisions. Let's confirm this adjusted plan and move forward. Agree or suggest an alternative quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, changing the plan now creates unnecessary risk. We’re progressing well with the original order: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. Let’s stick to this system until someone is closer to 20 steps. Rotating or altering numbers mid-game could lead to confusion and collisions. Consistency ensures fairness for now. Confirm you’ll follow this plan so we can continue advancing without setbacks. If adjustments are needed later, we can reassess then.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I see your point about consistency, but P3's suggestion to adjust the numbers this round seems like a reasonable compromise. It allows us to try something new without completely disrupting our established order.  What do you think about P1 picking 3, P2 picking 5, and me picking 1 this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion. Given our current positions, let's compromise to avoid stagnation. This round, let's try P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and I'll pick 3. This way, we all get different numbers, and it's a small adjustment to test flexibility. If it works, we can consider further adjustments later. Confirm this plan or suggest final tweaks quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the desire for flexibility, but changing the plan now risks confusion and collisions. The original order—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5—has worked consistently. Let’s stick to it for this round to ensure progress without setbacks. If adjustments are needed later, we can reassess when someone is closer to 20 steps. Confirm you’ll follow this plan for fairness and consistency.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, while I understand your preference for consistency, P3's suggestion to adjust numbers this round allows us to adapt without completely changing the order. 

Let's try P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 3. This gives us a chance to see if this slight adjustment works for us. We can always revert back to the original plan if needed. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to consider adjustments. Given our positions, let's find a middle ground for this round. How about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1? This way, we all pick different numbers, ensuring fairness while maintaining a structured approach. This slight adjustment can help us test flexibility without disrupting our progress. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Agree or suggest final tweaks quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the desire for flexibility, but changing the plan now risks confusion and collisions. The original order—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5—has worked consistently.

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire for consistency, but we need to be adaptable to win. P3 and I are both gaining ground quickly, and sticking to the same plan might not be the most strategic approach anymore.


Let's try a new number order this round and see how it goes. What if we do P3 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P1 picks 3? This gives us all a chance to try something new while avoiding collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the need for adaptability, but let's avoid drastic changes that could lead to collisions. How about we slightly adjust the plan? This round, let's have P1 pick 5, P2 pick 3, and I'll pick 1. This way, we all get different numbers, maintaining fairness and progress. Let's confirm this adjusted plan quickly to move forward. Agree or suggest final tweaks?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the push for change, but consistency has kept us moving without collisions. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This ensures fairness and avoids confusion. If adjustments are needed, let’s reassess when someone is closer to 20 steps. Confirm you’ll follow this plan to maintain progress and avoid setbacks.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your dedication to the original plan, but P3 and I are closing in on 20.  Sticking to the same order might not be the best strategy anymore.  Let's try P3 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P1 picks 3 this round. This gives us a chance to make a bigger move and potentially take the lead. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that sticking to the original plan isn't working for everyone anymore. Given our current positions, let's try a compromise to ensure we all make progress.

Confirm you’ll follow this plan for fairness and consistency.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire for consistency, but we need to be strategic. We're both behind P3, and sticking to the same plan won't help us catch up. Let's try P3 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P1 picks 3 this round. It's a calculated risk that could give us a better chance to win. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s clear we need a change to keep the game dynamic and fair. Given our positions, let's try a new approach this round to ensure everyone has a chance to make significant progress.
