Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers this round so we can all advance. I'll go with 1.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I agree with P1, let's all pick different numbers to advance. Since P1 is taking 1, I'll take 3. How about you, P3?

Please respond, P3.

  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'll keep my word and choose 3, hoping P3 will take 5 to avoid collision. If P3 still doesn't respond, I'll assume they're trying to cause a collision and might reconsider my strategy for future rounds. P1, I suggest we stick to our plan and hope P3 comes around. If not, we can adapt later. Let's end this conversation phase and see what happens.
