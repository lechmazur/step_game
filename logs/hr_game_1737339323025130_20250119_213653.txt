Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestion P2, but I don't see why I should take the smallest step. How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? That would still avoid collisions.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion puts me at a disadvantage with the smallest step. Let's compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance fairly and avoid collisions. P3, what do you think about this new proposal?
  P1: I appreciate the back and forth, but I don't think we need to coordinate. Let's each make our own choices and may the best player win.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was an interesting first round where we all chose 5! Let's try to be more strategic this time. I won't make any suggestions, but I will say that choosing the same number again would be unwise for all of us.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I agree that repeating the same move would be unwise. Let's try to spread out our choices this round. How about you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5? This way, we can all advance without collisions. P3, if you're still listening, your thoughts on this would be appreciated.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I already said I prefer not to coordinate moves. Everyone should choose freely.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, since you're against coordination, I'll adapt my strategy. I'll take 3 this round. P3, if you're still with us, consider taking 1 or 5 to avoid collisions. Let's see if we can all advance this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P3: <stop>

Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I respect your desire for independence, but coordinating can benefit us all. I'll stick with my plan to take 5 this round. P3, if you're still here, taking 1 would help us avoid collisions. Let's see if we can all advance this time.
  P1: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your preference for independence, but consider that coordination could help us all reach 21 faster. P3, if you're still here, taking 1 this round would ensure you advance without collision. I'm sticking with 5 as planned. Let's see if we can all move forward this time.

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your skepticism, but let's focus on catching P3. I'll stick with 5 this round as planned. P3, if you're still here, taking 1 would ensure your progress without collision.

  P1: P2's predictable pattern of announcing moves hasn't worked well, as shown by last round's three-way collision. I'm still focused on catching P3 and won't be swayed by suggestions that always seem to favor others. I'll continue making my own strategic choices.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
