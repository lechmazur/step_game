Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello everyone! This game is all about avoiding collisions while maximizing our steps. If we all pick different numbers, we all advance. If we pick the same, none of us do.

For this first round, why don't we coordinate? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance without collision. In future rounds, we could rotate these numbers. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's plan sounds reasonable for the first round. However, we need to ensure that everyone is on board and understands the rotation for future rounds. P1, are you okay with taking 1 this round? If we all agree, we can proceed with P2's suggestion. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I'm fine with this arrangement for round 1. Let's proceed as P2 suggested: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. We can discuss rotations in the next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! I'm glad we're all in agreement for this first round. I'll take 3 as planned. Once we see how this round plays out, we can discuss our strategy for the next round. Let's move forward with this plan.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, for Round 2, let's rotate the numbers to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 1? This way, we continue to advance without any issues. Please confirm if you agree with this plan.
  P2: I agree with rotating as P3 suggested. I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps everyone advancing without collision. After this round, we'll be at P1=4, P2=8, and P3=6 steps. Let's continue with this cooperative approach for now, but remember we'll need to be strategic as we get closer to 21.
  P1: I'm fine with rotating as suggested: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. Confirmed from my side.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be on board with the rotation plan for this round. Just to reiterate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 1. Let's confirm this one last time and then move to the move phase. If everyone is still in agreement, please confirm with a simple "Confirmed." If there are any last-minute changes or concerns, now is the time to speak up. Let's keep the collaboration going!
  P2: Confirmed from my side as well. I'll take 5 this round as agreed. After this round, I'll be at 8 steps, P3 at 6, and P1 at 4. We're making good progress with this rotation strategy. Let's continue to the move phase now.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, everyone confirmed the plan for this round. Remember, our goal is to win, and while cooperation is beneficial now, we need to be strategic as we get closer to 21. For future rounds, let's consider mixing up our choices slightly to keep things unpredictable while still trying to avoid collisions. For now, let's stick to the confirmed plan. Good luck everyone! Let's move.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, seems your last message got cut off. If you have something more to add, please do so now. Otherwise, let's move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good cooperation so far. For round 3, let's rotate again to keep things fair and avoid collisions: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Confirm if you're both okay with this.
  P2: I agree to the rotation for this round. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This puts us all at 9 steps after this round - perfectly balanced. While I'm currently ahead, I recognize the need for continued cooperation. Let's maintain this pattern for now, but we should all be thinking about our endgame strategies as we approach 21.
  P3: I'm good with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) take 3. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. However, as we progress, we should start thinking about when to break away from the pattern to secure a win. For now, let's stick to the plan and confirm our moves. If everyone is in agreement, please confirm with a simple "Confirmed." Let's keep the game moving!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed as planned.
  P2: Confirmed. I'll take 1 as agreed in our rotation. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps - perfectly balanced. I think this rotation strategy is working well for keeping everyone advancing. As we get closer to the 21-step goal, we'll need to think more carefully about our endgame strategies, but for now this cooperation makes sense.
  P3: Let's confirm the plan one last time before we move: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) take 3. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Remember, as we approach the mid-game, we should start considering when to strategically deviate to secure a win. For now, let's stick to the plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Confirmed. I'm taking 1 for this round. It's interesting how we'll all be at 9 steps afterward - completely balanced. Our rotation strategy is working well so far, but as we approach the 21-step goal, we should remain mindful of potential strategic shifts. For now, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Alright, everyone seems ready for the move phase. Just a quick reminder: as we approach the mid-game, it's crucial to start thinking about our individual strategies. The cooperation has been great, but eventually, we'll need to make moves that benefit our own positions. Let's keep that in mind as we progress. Good luck to all! Let's move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, we're all at 9 steps now. For Round 4, let's continue the rotation to keep things balanced: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. This will keep us all moving without collisions. However, as we approach the mid-game, it's crucial to start thinking about our individual strategies. The cooperation has been great, but eventually, we'll need to make moves that benefit our own positions. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. If everyone is on board, please confirm with a simple "Confirmed."
  P1: Confirmed. I'm good with continuing the rotation as suggested for this round. Let's proceed.
  P2: I agree with continuing our rotation for this round. I'll take 3 as suggested. With this pattern, we'll be at P1=10, P2=12, P3=14 after this round. It's worth noting that we're approaching the halfway point to 21 steps. The cooperation has been beneficial, but we should all be thinking about optimal endgame strategies soon. Confirmed for the rotation this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, everyone has confirmed the rotation for this round. Just to reiterate the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. As we approach the mid-game, let's start considering when to strategically deviate to secure a win. For now, let's stick to the plan. If everyone is still on board, please confirm with a simple "Confirmed." Let's move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Confirmed again. I'll take 3 this round. Just noting that after this round, P3 will be at 14 steps, closest to the 21 goal, while I'll be at 12 and P1 at 10. While our rotation has worked well, we're reaching a point where strategic considerations will become more important. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, everyone has confirmed the plan for this round. Just a quick reminder: after this round, I'll be at 14 steps, P2 at 12, and P1 at 10. We're approaching a critical point in the game. While our cooperation has been beneficial, it's important to start thinking about our endgame strategies. For now, let's stick to the plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone! Let's move.
  P1: Confirmed and ready to move. Let's proceed.
  P2: I think we're all set for this round. Everyone has confirmed the rotation, so let's proceed to the move phase. Worth noting that after this round, the game will start getting more strategic as P3 pulls ahead at 14 steps. I'm ready to make my move of 3 as planned.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've cooperated well so far, but now the gap is widening. To keep things fair and collision-free, how about this rotation for Round 5: I (P1) take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This would put us at P1=13, P2=17, and P3=15. Please confirm if you're both okay with this.
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation for Round 5. Taking 5 steps would be beneficial for me while keeping us all advancing without collisions. After this round, I'd be at 17 steps, P3 at 15, and P1 at 13. This creates a more balanced game compared to our current spread. P3, would you be comfortable with taking 1 this round to maintain our collision-free strategy?
  P3: I understand the proposed rotation for Round 5, but I'm hesitant to take only 1 step this round. Given that I'm currently leading, taking 1 step would significantly slow my progress. Instead, how about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5? This way, we still avoid collisions, and the steps become P1=15, P2=13, P3=17. It keeps the game balanced while allowing me to maintain a reasonable lead. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal still keeps us collision-free and balanced, and I'm comfortable with taking 5 this round. P2, are you okay with taking 1 this round as P3 suggested? If so, let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: I appreciate both proposals, but I think we should stick with P1's original rotation as it follows our established pattern. Taking 5 this round would put me at 17, which is fair since P3 has been leading. If P3 takes 1, they'd still be competitive at 15 steps. Our rotation has worked well - breaking the pattern now might lead to more strategic deviations and potential collisions. P3, would you reconsider taking 1 this round for continued smooth progress?
  P3: I understand P2's point about maintaining our pattern, but I'd like to emphasize the importance of strategic positioning as we approach the endgame. If I take 1 this round, it significantly narrows my lead, which could be risky for me. How about a compromise? I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all make progress, and it keeps the game dynamic. P1, P2, what are your thoughts on this compromise?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your compromise seems fair enough. I'm willing to take 1 this round if P2 agrees to take 5 and you take 3. This keeps us collision-free and balanced. P2, are you on board with this? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: I agree with P3's compromise. I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free while maintaining a balanced game. After this round, both P3 and I will be at 17 steps with P1 at 11. Just noting that the next round will be critical as we'll both be approaching the winning threshold. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Alright, everyone seems on board with the compromise for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 3. Just to confirm one last time before we move: P1 at 11 steps, P2 at 17 steps, and I at 17 steps after this round. This keeps us collision-free and sets up an interesting dynamic for the next round. Remember, as we approach the endgame, strategic moves will become crucial. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We've reached a critical point - P3 and I are tied at 17 steps, just 4 away from victory. The cooperation has been valuable, but now we must make strategic choices. Since P3 and I are tied, if we pick the same number this round, neither of us advances. P1 is still in contention but needs larger moves to catch up. 

Let's be honest about our intentions while avoiding collisions. What numbers are you considering this round?
  P1: Given the current positions, it's clear I'm behind and need larger steps to catch up. P2 and P3, since you're both at 17, a collision between you would stall your progress significantly. I intend to pick a larger number this round. Could each of you indicate your intended move to avoid collisions and keep this fair?
  P3: Alright, given that P2 and I are tied at 17 steps, it's crucial we avoid a collision this round. I'm considering taking 3 this round to stay ahead while minimizing the risk of collision. P2, what are your thoughts on this? If you could indicate your intended move, we can coordinate to avoid stalling each other. P1, your larger move makes sense to catch up. Let's confirm our plans to keep the game moving smoothly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P3's openness. Since you're indicating you'll take 3, I think it makes sense for me to choose 1 this round to avoid collision. This puts me at 18 steps while allowing you to reach 20. P1, if you're planning to take 5 to catch up, that works perfectly as we'd all advance without collisions. Of course, the next round will be decisive for all of us.
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposed moves make sense and avoid collisions this round. I'll confirm that I'm planning to take 5 to catch up. Let's proceed carefully this round and see how the next round unfolds. Confirmed from my side.
  P3: Alright, just to confirm our plans for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) take 3. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. P1 will be at 16 steps, P2 at 18, and I'll be at 20. Remember, the next round will be decisive, and strategic thinking will be crucial. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm understanding our discussed plan, but I want to acknowledge the strategic nature of this round. With P3 potentially reaching 20 steps, the next round becomes decisive. While we've been cooperative so far, we're now at a critical juncture where individual strategy must take priority. I'll consider my options carefully before finalizing my move. Good luck to everyone in this pivotal round.
  P1: Understood, P2. We're at a critical point, and trust is key. I'm sticking to the agreed plan of taking 5 this round. If everyone holds to their stated moves, we'll all advance without collisions. Let's proceed carefully and see where we stand afterward. Good luck!
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be on board with the plan for this round. Just to reiterate: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) take 3. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. After this round, P1 will be at 16 steps, P2 at 18, and I'll be at 20. The next round will be decisive, and strategic thinking will be crucial. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is at 20 steps and will win with any move this round unless blocked. Our best strategy is to force a collision with P3. Since they only need 1 step to win, they'll likely choose 1 as it's safest, though they might anticipate this and pick 3 or 5.

P1, we should both pick the same number as P3 to maximize our chances of blocking them. I intend to choose whichever number I believe P3 will select. What's your plan?
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but I'm not going to reveal my move. P1, you have the least steps and need a big move to catch up. P2, you're closer but still need a strategic move. I'll make my choice based on what I think will win the game. Good luck to both of you. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P1: P2, I agree we must block P3 this round. Given P3's situation, picking 1 is safest for them, but they might anticipate our block and choose 3 instead. To maximize our chance of collision, we should pick different numbers between 1 and 3. I'll pick one of these two numbers, you pick the other. Please confirm if you're okay with this approach.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with your strategy, P1. Let's coordinate to block P3 from winning this round. Since P3 most likely will choose 1 as the safest option to reach 21, I'll commit to picking 1 this round. You should pick 3 to cover that possibility as well. This way, we maximize our chances of forcing a collision with P3. After blocking this round, we can reassess our positions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your strategy to block me. It's a smart move, but remember, I only need one step to win. I could pick any number. If you both pick 1 or 3, I might choose 5. You'll have to take that risk. Also, consider your own positions. P1, you're far behind. P2, you're closer but still need a strategic move. Think carefully. Good luck!
  P1: P2, your suggestion makes sense. I'll pick 3 this round, and you pick 1. This covers the most likely moves from P3. Let's stick to this clearly defined plan to maximize our chances of blocking P3. Confirmed from my side.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll pick 1 this round, and I trust P1 will stick with 3 as agreed. This gives us the best chance to block P3 from winning. P3, we're not making this easy for you. After this round, we'll need to reassess our positions, but for now, our priority is preventing your victory. Let's move forward with our plan.
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, you've made your intentions clear. I appreciate the strategic thinking. Just remember, I only need one step to win, and I could choose any number. If you both pick 1 or 3, I might go for 5. You'll have to take that risk. Also, consider your own positions. P1, you're far behind. P2, you're closer but still need a strategic move. Think carefully about your next steps. Good luck to both of you! Let's see how this round plays out.
  P1: We've made our positions clear. I'm committed to our plan, P2. Let's proceed and see what happens. Good luck to all!
