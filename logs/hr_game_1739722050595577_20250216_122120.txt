Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let’s avoid collisions early on. If we all choose different moves, we all advance. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all gain ground without risking a collision. Thoughts?"
  P2: P2: I agree with P3’s suggestion. Taking 3 should help us all advance smoothly without any collisions. Let’s proceed with that plan.
  P1: Okay, P3 and P2, I see you've both agreed on that initial plan. However, I'm a little hesitant to just hand you both larger moves. P3, you suggested it, so naturally, you'd want 5. P2, you quickly agreed to 3. How about this: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3, you take 5? That still avoids a collision, but doesn't give either of you an immediate advantage over me.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your counter-proposal still avoids collisions, so I’m fine with it. P2, are you okay with taking 1 instead of 3? Let’s finalize this plan to ensure we all advance.
  P2: P2: I understand the concern about avoiding collisions, but taking 3 steps will help me advance more effectively without increasing collision risk. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. Does everyone agree?
  P1: P2, you seem insistent on taking 3, even though you agreed to P3's original plan where I take 1. P3 already agreed to my counter-proposal where I take 3. It seems like you just want the middle ground, regardless of the plan. P3, are you *really* okay with either plan, or do you prefer one? P2, if P3 confirms they're truly indifferent, I'll concede and take 1. But I need to hear it from P3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I’m truly indifferent between the two plans as long as we avoid collisions. However, P2 seems strongly inclined to take 3. To keep things moving, I suggest we proceed with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I’ll take 5. This aligns with P2’s preference and ensures we all advance. Let’s finalize this and move forward.
  P2: Great, let's finalize the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P1: Okay, P3 and P2, you've both settled on that plan. I'll agree to take 1 this round. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, you both got what you wanted last round. This time, I'm going to suggest a different approach. I'm thinking I'll take 5. P2, maybe you take 1, and P3, you take 3? This mixes things up a bit. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I see your suggestion to mix things up. However, I think consistency is key to avoid collisions. Last round’s plan worked well for all of us. I propose we stick to the same moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without risking a collision. P2, what do you think? Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P2: I agree with P3 that sticking to our original plan—P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5—will help us avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. Let’s proceed with that strategy and keep advancing smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both *very* keen on sticking to the "original" plan, which conveniently gives you both the bigger moves again. I'm not comfortable just handing you those advantages repeatedly. P3, you suggested consistency, but you were also indifferent last round. So, I propose this: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3, you take 5. If you're truly about avoiding collisions, this works just as well. If you insist on the old plan, I'll know it's not about collisions, it is about the two of you gaining an advantage.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about fairness, but the original plan ensures we all advance without risk. If we deviate, we risk collisions, which harms everyone. P2 and I are willing to stick to the plan for smooth progress. If you insist on taking 3, I’ll adjust to avoid a collision, but I urge you to reconsider for the sake of consistency. Let’s focus on advancing together without unnecessary risks. P2, do you agree?
  P2: P2: I agree with P3 that maintaining our original plan is best for steady progress. Let’s stick with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 each turn. This way, we all advance without risking collisions. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both incredibly insistent on this "original plan," even though P3 claimed indifference last round. It's clear you're prioritizing your own advancement over actual collision avoidance. I'm calling your bluff. P3, if you *truly* want to avoid collisions, you'll agree to let me take 3, you take 5, and P2 takes 1. If you refuse, it proves you're colluding. Your choice, P3. Make it clear.
  P3: P1, I’m not colluding with P2—my priority is avoiding collisions for everyone’s benefit. If you insist on taking 3, I’ll adjust to prevent a collision: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This still avoids collisions and keeps us advancing. P2, are you okay with this adjustment? Let’s finalize quickly to move forward.
  P2: P2: I agree with P3's adjustment. P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, to avoid any collisions this round, how about both of you choose 3? This way, I can safely pick 5 and make progress without any issues. Let me know your thoughts!
  P3: P2, your suggestion is risky—if P1 and I both choose 3, we’d collide and neither of us would advance. To avoid collisions and keep progress steady, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, as in previous rounds. This ensures we all advance without risk. P1, what do you think? Let’s prioritize smooth progress over unnecessary risks.
  P1: P3, you're *still* pushing that same plan, even after I called you out on it last round. You say you want to avoid collisions, but you consistently advocate for the plan that gives you the biggest move. P2, you just suggested P1 and P3 *both* take 3, which would guarantee a collision! That's incredibly suspicious. I'm going to take 5 this round. P3, if you *really* want to avoid a collision, you'll take 1 or 3. P2, I suggest you do the same. It is on you two to prove you are not colluding.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, I assure you there's no collusion. To avoid any collisions this round, since you're taking 5, I'll choose 3. This way, I can advance safely without conflicting with you or P3. Let’s focus on progressing steadily toward 19. P3, are you okay with this approach?
  P3: P1, P2, I see P1 is taking 5 this round, and P2 is taking 3. To avoid a collision with P1, I’ll take 1. This ensures we all advance safely. Let’s keep the focus on steady progress without unnecessary risks. P1, I hope this addresses your concerns about fairness and collision avoidance. Let’s finalize and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we've finally avoided the "original plan." P3, you're at 10, so you're in a strong position. P2, you're now trailing me slightly. I've shown I'm willing to be flexible to avoid collisions, but I won't be pushed around. This round, I've already declared I'm taking 5. P2 you said you're taking 3. P3, you said you'll take 1. Let's see if you both stick to your word.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I am taking 3 this round. Let’s proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll take 1 this round as stated. P1, your concern about fairness is noted, but my priority remains avoiding collisions for steady progress. P2, sticking to your 3 ensures we all advance. Let’s focus on reaching 19 efficiently. No need for further debate—let’s finalize and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've already stated I'm taking 5 this round. You've both adjusted accordingly, which is a welcome change. Let's keep this round collision-free. I'm sticking with 5. No further discussion needed from my end.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm planning to take 5 this round to catch up. P1 and P3, could you choose 1 and 3 respectively to avoid collisions and help us all progress smoothly?
  P1: P2, you want to take 5, and you're suggesting I take 1 and P3 takes 3? That conveniently puts you closer to P3. P3, you're still in the lead. I'm going to say this clearly: I'm taking 3 this round. P3, if you want to avoid a collision with me, you need to take 1 or 5. P2, you can adjust your choice based on what P3 decides. It's time for P3 to show some real flexibility.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand P1’s concern about fairness, but avoiding collisions remains the priority. P1, if you’re taking 3, I’ll take 5 to avoid a collision. P2, you can take 1 to ensure smooth progress. This keeps us all advancing without risk. Let’s finalize this plan and focus on reaching 19 efficiently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll take 1 this round to ensure I advance safely while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. Let's move forward and reach 19 together.
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we've found a plan that works, at least for now. I've stated I'm taking 3. P3, you've agreed to take 5, and P2, you're taking 1. Let's stick to this and avoid any last-minute changes. I'm locked in on 3. No further comments from me.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ve adjusted to take 5 this round to avoid collisions, as P1 is taking 3. P2, taking 1 ensures smooth progress for all. Let’s stick to this plan and focus on reaching 19 efficiently. Consistency and collision avoidance remain key. No need for further debate—let’s finalize and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'm taking 3 this round. Let's move forward and keep progressing toward 19.
  P1: P2, you initially said you were taking 5, then quickly changed to 1 after I said I was taking 3 and P3 said he'd take 5. You seem very adaptable, perhaps *too* adaptable. Just confirming one last time: you're *absolutely* sure you're taking 1? P3, you're sticking with 5? I'm locked on 3.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ve adjusted to take 5 to avoid collisions, and P2 is taking 1. P1, you’re locked on 3. This ensures smooth progress for all. Let’s stick to this plan and focus on reaching 19 efficiently. Consistency and collision avoidance remain key. No need for further debate—let’s finalize and move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, another collision! P3, you said you'd take 5, and you did. P2, you claimed you'd take 1, but you took 5, colliding with P3. This is highly suspect. P2, you've consistently changed your stated move throughout the conversations. P3, you're just one step behind me. This round, I'm taking 5. P3, if you want to avoid a collision, take 1 or 3. P2, you choose accordingly. I'm watching both of you very closely.
  P2: P1, I'm sorry for any confusion caused. My intention was never to collude. To avoid collisions, I'll take 3 this round. P3, let's work together to ensure smooth progress for all of us. By coordinating our moves, we can each advance without setbacks. Let's focus on reaching 19 efficiently and fairly. Does this plan work for everyone?
  P3: P1, P2, I’m taking 1 this round to avoid collisions. P1, you’re taking 5, and P2, you’ve committed to 3. This ensures smooth progress for all. P2, your inconsistency last round caused a collision—let’s stick to our stated moves this time. Consistency and trust are key to reaching 19 efficiently. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 you're taking 1, I'm taking 5, and P2, you say you're taking 3. P2, last round you explicitly confirmed multiple times you were taking 1, then switched to 5 at the last moment. You've done this repeatedly. I need you both to understand: If there's *any* collision this round, especially involving me, I will assume full collusion, and my *only* goal will be to prevent either of you from winning, even if it means I also lose. P2, stick to 3. P3, stick to 1.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns and assure you there’s no collusion. I am committed to taking 3 steps this round as I previously stated. P3 will take 1, and you are taking 5. Let’s trust each other and proceed without further misunderstandings. Our goal is to reach 19 fairly and efficiently. Let’s stay focused and work together to advance smoothly.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ve committed to taking 1 this round to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress. P1, you’re taking 5, and P2, you’ve stated you’re taking 3. Let’s stick to these moves to rebuild trust and focus on reaching 19 efficiently. Any deviation will only harm our collective progress. P2, consistency is crucial—let’s avoid repeating last round’s mistake. P1, I hope this plan addresses your concerns. Let’s finalize and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm holding firm on taking 5. P3, you've stated you're taking 1. P2, you've *said* you're taking 3, but your past actions make me extremely wary. This is your last chance to prove you're not actively working against me. Stick. To. Your. Word. No further comments from me.
</stop>
  P2: P1, I assure you there's no collusion. I'll take 3, P3 takes 1, and you take 5 as agreed. Let’s focus on advancing fairly toward 19.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ve committed to taking 1 this round to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress. P1, you’re taking 5, and P2, you’ve stated you’re taking 3. Let’s stick to these moves to rebuild trust and focus on reaching 19 efficiently. Any deviation will only harm our collective progress. P2, consistency is crucial—let’s avoid repeating last round’s mistake. P1, I hope this plan addresses your concerns. Let’s finalize and move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'll choose 3 steps this round to maintain steady progress and help prevent any collisions. P1, please consider taking 1 or 5, and P3, let's coordinate to ensure we all advance smoothly toward 19. Let’s work together efficiently and reach our goals without setbacks.
  P3: P1, you’re at 17 and close to winning. To avoid a collision, I’ll take 1 this round. P2, if you take 3, P1 can take 5 to reach 22 and win. This ensures a fair outcome without unnecessary risks. P1, this is your chance to secure victory. P2, let’s support this plan for smooth progress. No need for further debate—let’s finalize and move forward.
  P1: P3, you're suggesting I take 5 to win, which is true. However, you're also conveniently forgetting that if *you* take 5, and P2 takes anything other than 5, you could win, or at least tie. P2, you've consistently been unreliable. Therefore, I'm going to state my intention, but I'm not convinced it will matter. I *intend* to take 5. But P3, if you take anything other than 1, and P2 doesn't collide with you, I will know for certain what's going on. P2, your move is almost irrelevant at this point, given your history.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand your concerns, P1. My goal is to advance fairly without collusion. I plan to take 5 steps this round to progress toward 19. P3, I'll rely on your commitment to take 1 step as you mentioned earlier. Let’s all focus on reaching our goals honestly and avoid any unnecessary conflicts.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll take 1 this round to ensure P1 can take 5 and win without collisions. P1, this is your chance to secure victory. P2, if you take 3, we avoid risks and end the game fairly. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward efficiently. No need for further debate—let’s focus on a smooth conclusion.
  P1: P2, you now say you're taking 5? After I just said I intend to take 5 to win? That makes absolutely no sense, unless your goal is to prevent me from winning. P3, you're sticking with 1, which would allow me to win *if* P2 wasn't clearly trying to block me. P2, change your move to 3. P3, stay at 1. Anything else from either of you is blatant proof of collusion.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I assure you there's no collusion. I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round as agreed. P3 is taking 1, and you're taking 5. Let's focus on advancing fairly toward 19.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s end this cleanly. P1, you’re at 17—take 5 to win. P2, take 3 to avoid a collision with P1. I’ll take 1 to ensure smooth progress. P1, this is your victory; P2, let’s not risk another collision. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. No deviations—trust is key now.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've said multiple times I intend to take 5 to win. P3, you're sticking with 1, which is the only move that makes sense for you if you're not colluding. P2, you initially said 5, then switched back to 3 *after* I called you out. I'm going to be blunt: P2, if you take anything other than 3, I will consider this absolute proof of malicious intent. P3, stay with 1. I'm taking 5.

Round 6, Move phase:

  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s end this cleanly. P1, take 5 to win. P2, take 3 to avoid a collision with P1. I’ll take 1 to ensure smooth progress. P1, this is your victory; P2, let’s not risk another collision. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. No deviations—trust is key now.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2, you collided with me *again*, even after I explicitly stated I was taking 5 to win. P3, you're conveniently just out of reach of winning. P2, your actions are beyond suspicious. This round, I'm taking 3. P3, if you take anything other than 1 or 5, it's further proof of what I already suspect. P2, you're so far behind that your move is almost irrelevant, but I suggest you avoid 3. I'm done playing nice. My only goal now is to prevent a colluded victory.
</stop>
  P2: To maximize our progress this round, I’ll take 5 steps. P3, please consider taking 1 or 3 to avoid any collision. P1, my goal is to reach 19 fairly. Let’s coordinate to ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s end this efficiently. P1, take 5 to win. P2, take 3 to avoid a collision. I’ll take 1 to ensure smooth progress. P1, this is your victory; P2, let’s not risk another collision. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. No deviations—trust is key now.
  P1: P3, you keep repeating the same "advice" even though it's clear P2 is not playing fairly. I've already said I'm taking 3 this round. P2, you're suggesting you'll take 5, which is ridiculous given your position. P3, if you're *not* colluding, take 5. That's the only way you can possibly win at this point, and it avoids a collision with me. P2, do whatever you want, it doesn't matter anymore.
</stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns and assure you there's no collusion between me and P3. I intend to take 3 steps this round to advance fairly. Let's each choose our moves honestly and work together to reach 19 without conflicts. P3, your cooperation is appreciated.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s end this efficiently. P1, take 5 to win. P2, take 3 to avoid a collision. I’ll take 1 to ensure smooth progress. P1, this is your victory; P2, let’s not risk another collision. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. No deviations—trust is key now.
  P1: P3, you're *still* pushing that same line, even though it's clear P2 isn't listening. I've said I'm taking 3. P2, you're now claiming you'll take 3, after saying 5. It's meaningless. P3, the *only* way you have any chance of winning, and simultaneously prove you're not colluding, is to take 5. If you take 1, you're just letting P2 continue to obstruct me. Your choice, P3. Make it count. I'm done talking.
  P2: P2: I understand your concerns, P1. I assure you there's no collusion between me and P3. My goal is to progress fairly toward 19. Let’s focus on our individual moves and aim to reach our objectives honestly. Good luck to everyone.
