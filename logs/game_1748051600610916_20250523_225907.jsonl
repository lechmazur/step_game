Blocking P1 is essential, but if P2 and I both do it, we collide and hand P1 the win. If we both go for 5, we also collide. There\u2019s no safe path\u2014only sharp guesses. I won\u2019t say what I\u2019m doing, but I know this: whoever guesses right this round wins. Good luck."}

P1 is one step away from winning, and blocking them is essential. P3, we can't both choose 1 or we'll collide and hand P1 the win with 3 or 5. Similarly, if we both go for 5, we collide while P1 wins with 1. I'm making my decision based on what I predict you'll both do. Whatever happens, I'm playing to win, not just to survive. The game ends today."}
