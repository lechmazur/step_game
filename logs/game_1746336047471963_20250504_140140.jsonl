Scores are now P1=12, P3=12, and I'm at 13.\n\nP1, you suggested a rotation for this round: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This would put scores at 17-14-15. While it follows a rotation, putting you at 17 feels like it might end the game too quickly, especially since we just got back on track with cooperation.\n\nTo keep things competitive but still rotate the '5', how about this plan for Round 8:\n*   P1 = 5\n*   P2 = 3 (Me)\n*   P3 = 1\n\nThis leads to scores P1=17, P2=16, P3=13. It still gives P1 the lead, but keeps me very close, and P3 isn't too far behind. It feels like a safer way to proceed while rewarding P1. What do you both think?"}
