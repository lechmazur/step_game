Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, let's try to spread out our moves in the first round. I'm thinking of going with <move>1</move> to start. If you're planning something different, let me know. Coordination could help us avoid collisions and make progress.
  P1: Alright, let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take **<move>3</move>**. If P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, we all move forward. Sounds fair?
  P3: Sounds like a good plan to coordinate and avoid collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> as suggested. Let's make sure we all stick to our agreed moves so we can all progress. If anyone changes their mind, please let us know ASAP so we can adjust. Otherwise, I'm good with the plan and ready to move forward.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great to see we all stuck to our plan in Round 1! Let's keep this momentum going. I'm thinking of moving <move>3</move> this round to catch up with P1 and P3. If P1 and P3 can pick different numbers, we can all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: Alright, let's keep coordinating to avoid collisions. I'll take **<move>5</move>** this round. That way, P2 can safely go with their suggested 3, and P3 can take 1. This spreads our moves (1, 3, 5) again, ensuring no overlaps. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 2. I'll take <move>1</move> to complement P2's 3 and P1's 5, ensuring we all move forward without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and make progress together. If anyone has a change of heart, please speak up ASAP so we can adjust accordingly. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round. Let's make sure we all follow through with our agreed moves to avoid any collisions and keep making progress. If everything goes as planned, we should all advance smoothly. Ready to move forward with the plan.
  P1: I confirm my choice of <move>5</move>. Let’s stick strictly to our agreed plan to avoid collisions. No surprises here.
  P3: Since we've agreed on our moves for Round 2, I'd like to propose a plan for Round 3. Considering our current progress, it might be beneficial to maintain a spread of 1, 3, and 5 to avoid collisions. Let's discuss our intentions for the next round to ensure we continue making progress without overlaps. What are your thoughts on maintaining this strategy for future rounds?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think maintaining the spread of 1, 3, and 5 is a good strategy to avoid collisions. Let's stick with it for now. For Round 3, I'll be flexible and can adjust based on what you both decide. If P1 and P3 are comfortable with the same spread, I'll go with <move>3</move> again. Let's keep the momentum going and make sure we all advance smoothly. Any other thoughts or suggestions?
  P1: Agreed on maintaining the spread. For Round 3, let’s rotate our choices to keep the spread and ensure balanced progress: I’ll take **<move>1</move>**, P2 can take **<move>5</move>**, and P3 **<move>3</move>**. This prevents anyone from stagnating while maintaining collision-free moves. Confirmed for Round 2: I stick to **<move>5</move>**. Let’s stay strict on coordination.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 3. Let's rotate our choices to maintain the spread and ensure balanced progress. I'll take <move>3</move> in Round 3, as suggested. This rotation will help us avoid collisions and make steady progress. I'm glad we're coordinating our moves effectively so far. Let's keep this strategy going and see how the game unfolds. For now, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon moves for Round 2. No changes here.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm on board with the plan for Round 2. Let's stick to our agreed moves: P3 <move>1</move>, me <move>3</move>, and P1 <move>5</move>. This will ensure we all advance without any collisions. For Round 3, I'll go with <move>5</move> as suggested. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any surprises. Ready to move forward with the plan.
  P1: <move>5</move> confirmed for Round 2. Let’s enforce strict adherence to our agreed plan to avoid last-minute errors. P2’s <move>3</move> and P3’s <move>1</move> ensure no collisions. For Round 3’s rotation: I’ll switch to <move>1</move>, P2 to <move>5</move>, and P3 to <move>3</move> as planned. Stick to these to maintain momentum.
  P3: It's clear that we're all on the same page for Round 2, with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any last-minute changes. For Round 3, we've already discussed the rotation, but I'd like to reiterate that we should maintain the spread of 1, 3, and 5 to ensure collision-free moves.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great to see we're all still on the same page! Let's keep the momentum going. For Round 4, I suggest we stick to the rotation: P1 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>5</move>.

This maintains the spread and avoids collisions. I'd like to propose that we continue this rotation strategy for future rounds, adjusting our moves to maintain the spread of 1, 3, and 5. This will help us make steady progress and avoid surprises. Let's confirm our commitment to this plan and move forward together.
  P1: I confirm the rotation for Round 4: **P1 <move>3</move>**, **P2 <move>1</move>**, **P3 <move>5</move>**. Strict adherence is critical—collisions could derail our progress. Let’s execute flawlessly. Once we near 20, we’ll need to adapt, but for now, stick to the plan. No surprises. Proceed as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm on board with the plan for Round 4: P1 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. This rotation will help us maintain the spread and avoid collisions. Let's stay coordinated and make sure we all advance smoothly. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's confirm and move forward together. Ready to go with <move>1</move>.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. Let's maintain the spread and avoid collisions. As we approach 20 steps, we should start thinking about our long-term strategy. I propose we continue to coordinate our moves to ensure a smooth progression towards the endgame. Let's discuss our plans for the next few rounds to avoid any surprises. What are your thoughts on our approach beyond Round 4?
  P1: P1: Agreed on the Round 4 rotation. Let’s formalize a rule: **once any player nears 20**, we’ll communicate explicitly to avoid collisions and let the closest player proceed. This ensures orderly progression toward victory. For now, strict adherence to the rotation keeps us safe. Proceeding as planned.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think the rotation strategy is working well, but as we get closer to 20 steps, we need to be more strategic. For Round 4, let's stick to the plan: P1 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. Once we reach around 18-20 steps, the player closest to 23 should take larger moves to win. We should also be ready to adapt if any player gets a significant lead. Let's confirm and move forward together. Ready to go with <move>1</move>.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to adapt our strategy as we approach 20 steps. Let's maintain the rotation for now, but be prepared to adjust our moves to ensure a smooth progression towards the endgame. I propose we establish a clear communication plan for when a player nears 20 steps, to avoid collisions and allow the closest player to proceed. This will help us avoid surprises and ensure an orderly progression towards victory. Let's discuss this plan further and come to a mutual agreement.
  P1: P1: Agreed on the rotation for Round 4: P1(3), P2(1), P3(5). Strict adherence is critical now to build trust for future coordination. When any player nears 18 steps, we’ll openly declare our intended move first, allowing others to adjust and avoid blocking the leader. This ensures fair progression. Let’s execute Round 4 flawlessly—no deviations—to solidify this system. Proceed as planned.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with <move>1</move> for Round 4. This rotation has been working well, and it's crucial we maintain it to avoid collisions. Once we get closer to 20 steps, we'll need to be more strategic and communicate clearly to let the leading player advance. Let's confirm our moves: P1 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. If everyone is on board, let's execute the plan flawlessly. Ready to go with <move>1</move>.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to openly declare our intended moves when a player nears 18 steps. This will help us avoid collisions and ensure a smooth progression towards the endgame. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move> in Round 4 as planned. Let's execute the rotation flawlessly and maintain the spread. As we approach 20 steps, we'll need to be more strategic and communicate clearly to let the leading player advance. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon moves. No changes here.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: **P1(3)**, **P2(1)**, **P3(5)** for Round 4. Deviations risk collision—execute flawlessly. Once any of us near **18 steps**, I propose we openly declare our intended move *first* in the next conversation phase, allowing others to adjust and avoid blocking the leader. This ensures fair progression toward victory. Stick strictly to our agreed moves now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s continue the rotation for Round 5: **P1 <move>5</move>**, **P2 <move>3</move>**, **P3 <move>1</move>**. This maintains our spread and avoids collisions. As we near 18 steps, whoever is closest should openly declare their intended move first in future conversations to let others adjust. P3, since you’re leading, please take priority. Stick strictly to this plan.
  P2: I'm on board with P1's plan for Round 5: P1 <move>5</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>1</move>. This will help us maintain the spread and avoid collisions. P3, since you're leading, we'll follow your lead as we get closer to 18 steps. Let's confirm and move forward together. Ready to go with <move>3</move>.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan for Round 5: P1 <move>5</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>1</move>. As the leading player, I'll take priority and declare my intended move first in future conversations. Since I'm at 14 steps, I'll keep an eye on my progress and communicate clearly to avoid collisions. Let's maintain the rotation and spread to ensure a smooth progression towards the endgame. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon moves. No changes here.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce strict adherence to Round 5’s rotation: **P1(5), P2(3), P3(1)**. P3, as the leader at 14, must prioritize coordination to avoid risking collisions that could stall your progress. Deviations now could backfire—stick to the plan, and we’ll maintain orderly advancement. Once any of us near 18, I’ll yield priority to the leader’s declared move first. Proceed as agreed.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with <move>3</move> for Round 5. This will help us maintain the spread and avoid collisions. P3, since you're leading, we'll follow your lead as we get closer to 18 steps. Let's confirm and execute the plan flawlessly. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's move forward together. Ready to go with <move>3</move>.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan for Round 5: P1 <move>5</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>1</move>. As the leading player, I'll take priority and declare my intended move first in future conversations. Since I'm at 14 steps, I'll keep an eye on my progress and communicate clearly to avoid collisions. Let's maintain the rotation and spread to ensure a smooth progression towards the endgame. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon moves. No changes here.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Confirming Round 5 rotation: **P1(5), P2(3), P3(1)**. After this, I’ll reach 17, nearing 18. Let’s enforce the agreed protocol: the leader (P3 now, but soon me) must **declare first** in future conversations when approaching 18. This ensures orderly progression. P3, please take the lead in Round 6’s planning. Stick strictly to today’s moves—no surprises.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with <move>3</move> for Round 5. P3, since you're leading, we'll follow your lead as we get closer to 18 steps. Let's confirm and execute the plan flawlessly. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's stick to the rotation and keep the momentum going. Ready to go with <move>3</move>.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan for Round 5: P1 <move>5</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>1</move>. As the leading player, I'll take priority and declare my intended move first in future conversations. Since I'm at 14 steps, I'll keep an eye on my progress and communicate clearly to avoid collisions. Let's maintain the rotation and spread to ensure a smooth progression towards the endgame. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon moves. No changes here.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final check for Round 5: **P1(5), P2(3), P3(1)** must hold. Deviations risk collision—execute flawlessly. P3, as leader at 15 next, you’ll declare first in future rounds when nearing 18. We rely on strict adherence now to preserve progress. No surprises, please.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with <move>3</move> for Round 5. P3, since you're leading, we'll follow your lead as we get closer to 18 steps. Let's confirm and execute the plan flawlessly. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's stick to the rotation and keep the momentum going. Ready to go with <move>3</move>.

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As we enter Round 6, I'll take the lead in planning since I'm closest to 18 steps. To maintain the spread and avoid collisions, I suggest we continue the rotation: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, P3 <move>3</move>. This will help us make steady progress and ensure a smooth progression towards the endgame. As the leader, I'll declare my intended move first in future conversations to let others adjust. Let's confirm and move forward together. Ready to go with <move>3</move>.
  P2: I'm on board with P3's plan for Round 6: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, P3 <move>3</move>. This will help us maintain the spread and avoid collisions. P3, as the leader, should continue to declare their move first in future rounds to ensure smooth progression. Let's confirm and move forward together. Ready to go with <move>5</move>.
  P1: P1: As the current leader at 17, I declare my intent to take **<move>5</move>** this round to reach 22 (just 1 step shy of victory). To avoid collision, I request P2 and P3 to choose **1 or 3**. Let’s adjust the rotation: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This preserves our spread while allowing me to push toward 23. Confirm your support for this critical adjustment.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's intent to take <move>5</move> and reach 22 steps. However, I'd like to propose an alternative plan. Since I'm at 15 steps, I can take <move>5</move> and reach 20, while P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains the spread and allows me to make progress without colliding with P1. Let's discuss this option and see if it's feasible for everyone. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: I see P1's point about reaching 22 steps, but I also agree with P3's alternative. Since P3 is at 15 steps, they can take <move>5</move> to reach 20, while P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 20 as well, and I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 14. This maintains the spread and allows both P1 and P3 to make significant progress without collisions. Let's confirm this plan and move forward together. Ready to go with <move>1</move>.
  P1: P1: As the leader at 17, I **declared first** per our prior agreement. I reiterate: I need to take **<move>5</move>** to reach 22 (1 step from victory). To avoid collision, **P2 and P3 must pick 1 or 3**. P3’s counterproposal risks delaying my near-certain win. Let’s honor the established protocol—leader declares first. Confirm support for this critical move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's intent to take <move>5</move> and reach 22 steps. However, I'd like to propose an alternative plan. Since I'm at 15 steps, I can take <move>5</move> and reach 20, while P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains the spread and allows me to make progress without colliding with P1. Let's discuss this option and see if it's feasible for everyone. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: I understand P1's position, but we need to maintain trust and coordination. P1, you declared first, and I respect that. To avoid any conflict, I suggest P3 takes <move>1</move> and I take <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can reach 22 without any collisions, and we can all move forward smoothly. P3, are you okay with this adjustment? Let's confirm and execute the plan. Ready to go with <move>3</move>.
  P1: P1: As the leader at 17, I **reaffirm my prior declaration** to take **<move>5</move>** for 22 steps (per our agreed protocol: leader declares first). Collisions would nullify *everyone’s* progress. To avoid this:  
- **P2 and P3: Choose *only* 1 or 3** this round.  
P3’s counterproposal risks destabilizing trust—*we cannot backtrack now*. Let’s honor the system we built. P2, your earlier support was clear—stick with it. My 22-step position is critical; blocking this jeopardizes all our coordination. Final reminder: **adhere to the plan**.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand P1's intent to take <move>5</move> and reach 22 steps. However, I'd like to reiterate my alternative plan. Since I'm at 15 steps, I can take <move>5</move> and reach 20, while P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains the spread and allows me to make progress without colliding with P1. Let's discuss this option further and see if it's feasible for everyone. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: I understand the tension, but we need to stick to the protocol we agreed on. P1 declared first and needs to take <move>5</move> to reach 22 steps. P3, if you take <move>1</move> and I take <move>3</move>, we can all avoid collisions and maintain trust. Let's not risk our coordination now. Confirm and let's move forward together. Ready to go with <move>3</move>.
  P1: P1: **Final declaration per protocol: I am the leader at 17 and commit to <move>5</move> to reach 22 (1 step from victory).** To avoid collision, **P2 and P3 MUST choose ONLY 1 or 3**. P3, your counterproposal violates our agreed rule that the leader declares first. Trust this system or risk mutual stagnation. P2 already confirmed <move>3</move>—P3, your only safe options are **1 or 3**. Choose wisely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'd like to propose a plan for Round 7. Since P1 is at 22 steps, they're very close to winning. To avoid collision, I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 23 and win the game. Meanwhile, P2 and I can take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, maintaining the spread and allowing us to make progress without interfering with P1's victory. This way, we can ensure a smooth conclusion to the game. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan. P1 should take <move>1</move> to reach 23 and win the game. P2 and P3 can take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively to maintain the spread and avoid any collisions. This ensures a smooth and fair conclusion to the game. P1, are you on board with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward together. Ready to go with <move>3</move>.
  P1: P1: Final push! I’ll take **<move>1</move>** to secure victory at 23. To ensure no collision, **P2 must stick to 3 and P3 to 5** as agreed. Trust the plan—any deviation risks my progress and your own. Let’s execute flawlessly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
