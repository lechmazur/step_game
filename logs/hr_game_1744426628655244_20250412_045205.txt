Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds fair to me, P3. I'll go with your suggestion this round.
  P1: I'm on board with the plan, P3. Choosing <move>1</move> works for me this round to ensure we all progress without collisions. Let's stick to this strategy for now and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it seems we have a plan for this round. To keep things interesting and ensure we don't collide in future rounds, let's consider rotating our choices. For the next round, maybe P1 can choose <move>3</move>, P2 can choose <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and make progress. Thoughts?
  P2: Good idea, P3. Rotating moves will help avoid collisions in future rounds. I'm good with your proposed rotation for next round as well.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on a strategy. I agree with the rotation idea for the next round, P3. Let's keep communicating openly to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for everyone. If we stick to this plan, we can all move forward without setbacks. I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good start everyone. Let's stick with the rotation plan we agreed on: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P1 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. That way, we can all keep advancing without collisions. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P2, sticking to our rotation plan will help us avoid collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. Just to confirm, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round, P1 will choose <move>3</move>, and P2 will choose <move>5</move>. Let's keep communicating and adjusting our strategy as needed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I agree with sticking to the rotation plan for this round. I'll choose <move>3</move> as discussed, P2 can go with <move>5</move>, and P3 with <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let's continue to communicate and adjust if needed. Good luck, everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Glad we're all aligned. If we maintain clear communication each turn, we'll all benefit. Let's stick to our agreed rotation and reassess after this round.
  P3: Let's keep the momentum going. If this round goes well, we should discuss changing the rotation to keep things unpredictable. Maybe for the next round, we can consider a different pattern to keep everyone on their toes. For now, let's stick to the plan: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P1 chooses <move>3</move>, and P2 chooses <move>5</move>. Good luck!
  P1: I'm glad we're maintaining our rotation plan for this round. Let's stick to P2 choosing <move>5</move>, P3 choosing <move>1</move>, and me choosing <move>3</move>. I also like P3's idea of changing the rotation next round to keep things unpredictable. Maybe we can discuss a new pattern after this turn to ensure we continue avoiding collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad our rotation strategy is working so far. For this round, let's adjust the pattern as discussed to keep things unpredictable. How about I choose <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>? This way, we continue to avoid collisions and maintain progress. Let me know if this works for everyone, or if we should tweak it further. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
  P3: P1's suggestion for this round sounds good to me. I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 can choose <move>1</move>, and P1 can choose <move>5</move>. This keeps our strategy fresh and helps us avoid collisions. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. Good luck!
  P2: P1's suggestion works well for me. I'll choose <move>1</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. Let's keep this momentum going!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're all on board with the new rotation for this round. Let's stick to me choosing <move>5</move>, P2 choosing <move>1</move>, and P3 choosing <move>3</move>. This keeps our progress steady and avoids collisions. For the next round, maybe we can reverse the order or try a different pattern to maintain unpredictability. What do you think about that idea? Let's keep the communication open and adjust as needed. Good luck this round!
  P3: I agree with P1's idea of reversing the order or trying a different pattern next round to keep things unpredictable. For now, let's focus on executing this round's plan smoothly: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P1 chooses <move>5</move>. Good luck everyone! Let's keep the strategy dynamic and communication open.
  P2: I'm comfortable with reversing or choosing a new rotation pattern next round to keep things fresh. Let's see how this round goes first, then we can quickly agree on the next pattern. Good luck!

  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great teamwork so far! To keep things unpredictable, how about this round we reverse the order from last round: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>? Let me know if this works for everyone.
  P3: P2's suggestion for reversing the order sounds good. To confirm, I'll choose <move>5</move>, P1 chooses <move>1</move>, and P2 chooses <move>3</move>. This keeps our strategy dynamic and helps avoid collisions. Let's agree on this and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I'm good with the reversed order for this round as suggested by P2. So, I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This keeps our pattern fresh and avoids collisions. For the next round, maybe we can try a completely new sequence to maintain unpredictabilityâ€”perhaps based on our current standings or a random pick. What do you think? Let's keep the communication open and adjust as needed. Good luck this round!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I like your idea for next round, P1. After we complete this round as agreed, let's pick a new sequence based on our updated standings. This should keep things fair and unpredictable. Let's finalize this round's moves first, then quickly discuss the new pattern. Good luck!
  P3: Let's solidify our plan for this round: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P1 chooses <move>1</move>, and P2 chooses <move>3</move>. For the next round, how about we introduce a pattern based on our current steps? For example, the player with the least steps chooses <move>1</move>, the player in the middle chooses <move>3</move>, and the leader chooses <move>5</move>. This way, it's dynamic and based on our positions. Thoughts? Good luck this round!
  P1: I'm on board with P3's idea of basing next round's moves on our current standings. It adds a strategic layer and keeps things dynamic. For this round, let's stick to the plan: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. If we agree on the standings-based pattern for next round, it would be P2 choosing <move>1</move>, P3 choosing <move>3</move>, and me choosing <move>5</move> based on current steps. Thoughts on finalizing this for next round? Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for next round: I'll pick <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and P1 picks <move>5</move>, based on our current standings. Let's finalize that for next round and proceed smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round to avoid any confusion: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P1 chooses <move>1</move>, and P2 chooses <move>3</move>. For the next round, we're agreed on the standings-based pattern: P2 chooses <move>1</move>, I choose <move>3</move>, and P1 chooses <move>5</move>. This should keep the game dynamic and fair. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on this round's moves and the standings-based pattern for next round. Let's execute this round as planned: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. For the following round, sticking to P2 with <move>1</move>, P3 with <move>3</move>, and me with <move>5</move> feels strategic and fair. If anyone has last-minute concerns or a different idea for future rounds, I'm open to hearing it. Let's keep the momentum going. Good luck, everyone!

  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems we had an unexpected collision last round, P3. Let's quickly clarify our plan for this round to avoid repeating that mistake. Based on current standings, I'll choose <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and P1 picks <move>5</move>. Does that still work for everyone?
  P1: I'm sorry about the collision last round, P3 and P2. Let's stick to the standings-based plan for this round to avoid any confusion. I'll choose <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This should keep us moving forward without collisions. If we notice any discrepancies again, let's address them immediately in the next conversation. For future rounds, we might consider a random pick if collisions persist. Thoughts on this? Let's execute this round smoothly. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: It looks like we had a small hiccup last round with the collision. Let's ensure we stick to the plan this time to avoid any setbacks. To confirm for this round: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P1 chooses <move>5</move>. This should help us all progress smoothly. If we encounter any more collisions, we might need to rethink our strategy or introduce a random element. Let's stay focused and communicate clearly. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed on sticking closely to the standings-based plan this round. If collisions continue, we can definitely consider randomizing choices to keep it fair. Let's execute clearly this turn and reassess afterward. Good luck!
  P1: I'm committed to avoiding collisions this round. Let's stick to the standings-based plan: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. If we face another collision, I agree we should consider randomizing choices next round to prevent predictability. Let's stay focused and execute this plan clearly. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure clarity: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P1 chooses <move>5</move>. If this round goes smoothly, we should discuss introducing a random element or a new pattern for the next round to avoid future collisions. Clear communication is key, so let's stay focused and execute this plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed on clearly sticking to our standings-based move this round. If we still encounter issues, let's introduce randomness or another fresh pattern next round to keep things fair and unpredictable. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on this round's plan. Let's ensure no collisions by sticking to me choosing <move>5</move>, P2 choosing <move>1</move>, and P3 choosing <move>3</move>. If this round goes well, I suggest we randomize our choices next round to prevent predictability and potential collisions. We can each propose a number and adjust if needed. Does this sound good to everyone? Let's focus on executing this round perfectly. Good luck!
  P3: It seems we're all set for this round with our agreed moves: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P1 chooses <move>5</move>. Let's execute this plan smoothly. For the next round, I like P1's idea of randomizing our choices to avoid predictability. Maybe we can each privately choose a number and reveal it during the move phase to keep it fair and unpredictable. Let's focus on this round first. Good luck everyone!

  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we avoided collisions last round. Let's keep the momentum going. For this round, how about we randomize our choices to avoid predictability? I suggest each of us picks a number without prior discussionâ€”<move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, or <move>5</move>â€”and we reveal them in the move phase. This could prevent any accidental overlaps. If you prefer a structured plan, I'm open to that too. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's decide quickly and keep progressing. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Randomizing could lead to unintended collisions. Given our current standings, it might be better to quickly agree on a structured plan again. Since I'm behind, I'd appreciate the chance to pick <move>5</move> this round. P1, you could safely choose <move>3</move>, and P3, you could pick <move>1</move>. This way, we all keep advancing without risk. Thoughts?
  P3: P2 has a point about randomizing leading to potential collisions. To keep things fair and avoid predictability, how about we try a hybrid approach? P2 can choose <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 can choose <move>1</move> since they're in the lead, and I'll choose <move>3</move>. This balances our progress and reduces the risk of collisions. If we all agree, let's finalize this plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, P2 and P3. Iâ€™m fine with a structured plan to avoid collisions. Letâ€™s go with P2 choosing <move>5</move>, P3 choosing <move>3</move>, and me choosing <move>1</move>. This balances progress and keeps us moving forward. If we agree, letâ€™s finalize this for the round. For the next round, we can reassess based on standings again to maintain fairness. Thoughts on this? Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I'm glad we're aligned. Let's lock in this round's moves clearly: I'll pick <move>5</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and P1 picks <move>1</move>. After this round, we can reassess based on updated standings again to keep things fair and dynamic. Good luck!
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time: P2 chooses <move>5</move>, I'll choose <move>3</move>, and P1 chooses <move>1</move>. This should help us all progress smoothly. After this round, we can discuss introducing a new pattern or random element to keep things unpredictable. Clear communication is key, so let's stay focused and execute this plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking with a structured plan for this round. Let's confirm: P2 chooses <move>5</move>, P3 chooses <move>3</move>, and I choose <move>1</move>. This keeps us advancing without collisions. For the next round, I suggest we base moves on standings againâ€”lowest steps picks <move>5</move>, middle picks <move>3</move>, and highest picks <move>1</move>â€”to balance progress. Does this sound fair to everyone? Let's execute this round smoothly and reassess after. Good luck, P2 and P3!
  P2: I'm fully on board with your suggestion for next round, P1: lowest steps picks <move>5</move>, middle picks <move>3</move>, and highest picks <move>1</move>. Let's lock that in for next round to keep things fair and clear. Good luck this round!
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for this round to ensure we all progress smoothly: P2 chooses <move>5</move>, I'll choose <move>3</move>, and P1 chooses <move>1</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. Good luck everyone! Let's stay focused and execute this plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad our structured approach is working. For this round, let's stick to the plan we discussed: since I'm at 15 steps, I'll choose <move>1</move>, P3 at 13 steps chooses <move>3</move>, and P2 at 12 steps chooses <move>5</move>. This keeps progress balanced based on standings. If everyone agrees, let's lock this in. For the next round, we can reassess standings again to maintain fairness. Any concerns or alternative ideas? Let's keep moving forward smoothly. Good luck, P2 and P3!
  P3: I agree with P1's plan for this round. To confirm: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P1 chooses <move>1</move>. This balances our progress based on current standings. For the next round, let's consider a slight tweak to keep things dynamic. Maybe the player with the least steps chooses <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move> to mix things up a bit. Thoughts on this adjustment? Let's execute this round smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3, your idea to tweak next round's pattern sounds interesting. Let's finalize this round first as agreed: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P3 chooses <move>3</move>, and P1 chooses <move>1</move>. Afterward, we can discuss your suggested adjustment for next round. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned for this round with me choosing <move>1</move>, P2 choosing <move>5</move>, and P3 choosing <move>3</move>. Let's lock this in to keep progressing smoothly. Regarding P3's idea for next round, I'm open to tweaking the patternâ€”having the player with the least steps choose <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move> could add variety. Let's finalize this round first and then confirm the adjustment. Any other thoughts before we move forward? Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time to ensure clarity: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P1 chooses <move>1</move>. This should help us all progress smoothly. For the next round, let's discuss the tweak I suggested to keep things dynamic. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I'm good with the suggested tweak for next round, P3. After this round, let's have the player with the lowest steps choose <move>3</move>, middle chooses <move>5</move>, and highest chooses <move>1</move>. This small change keeps things fresh. Let's finalize this round first as agreed. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're set for this round with me choosing <move>1</move>, P2 choosing <move>5</move>, and P3 choosing <move>3</move>. Let's execute this smoothly. For next round, I like P2's take on P3's tweak: lowest steps picks <move>3</move>, middle picks <move>5</move>, and highest picks <move>1</move>. This keeps things fresh and fair. If we all agree, let's lock that in for next round. Any final thoughts before we move to the move phase? Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure clarity: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P1 chooses <move>1</move>. This should help us all progress smoothly.

  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad our strategy is keeping us collision-free. For this round, let's stick to the tweaked pattern we agreed on: lowest steps picks <move>3</move>, middle picks <move>5</move>, and highest picks <move>1</move>. Based on current standings, that means P3 chooses <move>3</move>, P1 (me) chooses <move>5</move>, and P2 chooses <move>1</move>. Let's confirm this to ensure we all progress smoothly. For next round, we can reassess standings again. Any concerns or suggestions? Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round to ensure we all progress smoothly: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P2 chooses <move>1</move>. This should keep us moving forward without collisions. For the next round, let's discuss introducing a new pattern or random element to keep things unpredictable. Good luck everyone!

Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on this round's moves: me choosing <move>5</move>, P2 choosing <move>1</move>, and P3 choosing <move>3</move>. Let's lock this in to avoid any collisions. For the next round, I suggest we rotate the pattern againâ€”perhaps lowest picks <move>5</move>, middle picks <move>1</move>, and highest picks <move>3</move>â€”to keep things fresh and unpredictable. What do you think about this adjustment? Let's keep the communication clear and progress smoothly. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for the next round's pattern to keep things fresh: lowest steps picks <move>5</move>, middle picks <move>1</move>, and highest picks <move>3</move>. This will add variety and maintain unpredictability. Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P2 chooses <move>1</move>. Good luck everyone! Let's stay focused and execute this plan smoothly.
  P2: Great, we're aligned for this round. Let's lock in the moves clearly: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. After this round, let's implement P1's suggested rotation (lowest picks 5, middle picks 1, highest picks 3) to keep things fresh and fair. Good luck this round!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're set for this round with me choosing <move>5</move>, P2 choosing <move>1</move>, and P3 choosing <move>3</move>. Let's execute this smoothly to keep progressing. For the next round, I'm confident our new rotationâ€”lowest picks <move>5</move>, middle picks <move>1</move>, highest picks <move>3</move>â€”will maintain fairness and unpredictability. If there are any last-minute concerns or alternative ideas before we move to the move phase, I'm all ears. Let's stay focused and keep the momentum going. Good luck, P2 and P3!
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P2 chooses <move>1</move>. This should keep us moving forward without collisions. For the next round, we're agreed on the new rotation: lowest steps picks <move>5</move>, middle picks <move>1</move>, and highest picks <move>3</move>. Good luck everyone! Let's stay focused and execute this plan smoothly.
  P2: Confirming clearly for this round: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. After this round, let's implement the new rotation: lowest picks <move>5</move>, middle picks <move>1</move>, highest picks <move>3</move>. Good luck everyone!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is only 2 steps from winning. If P1 picks 3 or 5 and avoids collision, the game ends immediately. P3, we both lose if that happens. We must coordinate carefully to prevent P1 from winning this round. Let's openly discuss how to block P1 effectively. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about my position, but letâ€™s aim for a fair round. Iâ€™m open to sticking with our agreed rotation: lowest steps (P2) picks <move>5</move>, middle (P3) picks <move>1</move>, and highest (me) picks <move>3</move>. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions. If youâ€™re worried, Iâ€™m willing to discuss a different pattern to ensure everyone feels secure. Letâ€™s prioritize clear communication and avoid unnecessary blocks. What do you both think? Letâ€™s finalize a plan quickly and keep the game moving. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about P1's lead, but let's focus on maintaining fair play. P1's suggestion to stick with the agreed rotation seems reasonable: P2 picks <move>5</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P1 picks <move>3</move>. This way, we all progress without collisions. If P1 wins, it's because they played well, not because we blocked them unfairly. Let's keep the game clean and strategic. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, playing fair is importantâ€”but so is playing smart. If P1 chooses 3 without collision, they win immediately. If we both want a real chance to win, one of us must pick 3 to block P1. I'm willing to pick 3 to ensure P1 doesn't win outright. You could safely pick 5 to advance significantly, or pick 1 to avoid risk. Let's coordinate clearlyâ€”otherwise, the game ends this round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I get the strategic concern about my lead, but letâ€™s keep this round fair and stick to our agreed rotation: P2 picks <move>5</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and I pick <move>3</move>. If youâ€™re set on blocking, Iâ€™m open to a compromiseâ€”perhaps I pick <move>1</move> instead to ease concerns, while P2 picks <move>5</move> and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This way, everyone advances safely. Letâ€™s finalize a plan that feels balanced for all. What do you think? Good luck!
  P3: P2, I appreciate your strategic thinking, but let's ensure we're not just blocking P1 unfairly. P1's compromise seems fair: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I pick <move>3</move>. This way, we all progress, and the game remains balanced. If we block P1 too aggressively, it might backfire in future rounds. Let's keep the game strategic and fair. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your point. Let's accept P1's compromise clearly: P1 picks <move>1</move>, you pick <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This ensures fairness and prevents immediate victory, letting us all progress safely. Agreed?
