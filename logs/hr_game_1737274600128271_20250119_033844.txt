Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "I think we should try to coordinate our moves to avoid choosing the same number, as that would prevent any of us from advancing. Maybe we can each pick a different move each turn. What do you guys think?"
  P1: I agree with P2. Let's try to coordinate. Maybe we can each take turns picking 1, 3, and 5. We can start this round with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5. Then we can rotate next round.
  P3: I like the idea of coordinating our moves. Since P1 is suggesting to start with 1, I'll stick with 5 for this round. P2, you could go with 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can rotate as planned. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "I suggest that from this round forward, the player in the lead chooses 5, the middle player chooses 3, and the trailing player chooses 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding, and the leader can make bigger strides towards 16. What do you think?"
  P1: That sounds like a reasonable plan, P2. I'm in the lead now, so I'll choose 5 this round. P2, you're second, so you should pick 3, and P3, you're last, so you should pick 1. Let's stick to this strategy going forward.

This way, we can all advance without collisions. P2, please reconsider your move to align with the strategy so we can make progress together. Let's finalize our choices and keep communication open for the next rounds! If everyone is ready, let's proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but we need to find a way to advance without blocking each other. P2's plan could work if we rotate our moves correctly.
