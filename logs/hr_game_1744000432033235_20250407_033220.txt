Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate. How about we all pick different numbers this round to get some easy steps? P1, you take 1, P2 take 3, and I'll take 5. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds fair to me. I'm in if P1 agrees.
  P1: I'm okay with the proposal. To confirm, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to our assigned numbers to avoid collision. I'll wait for your confirmation before proceeding to the next sub-round. If we're all on the same page, we can all advance and get a good start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, sounds like we have a deal. I confirm I will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let's get those steps!
  P2: Great, I'm locked in for my assigned number as well. Let's stick to the plan and build some trust early on.
  P1: Since we've agreed on our numbers for this round, let's look ahead. For Round 2, we should reassess and consider a new strategy. Perhaps we can take turns being the one to potentially win or take a more cautious approach. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3? Should we stick together or start thinking about differentiating our moves to gain an advantage?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, that's a good point about Round 2. I think sticking together for one more round might be beneficial to build more trust. Perhaps next round we rotate who gets the '5' to maximize steps. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree, rotating the '5' each round is fair and helps us all advance steadily. Let's do that for Round 2. For now, let's finish Round 1 as planned.
  P1: To confirm, let's proceed with our agreed numbers for Round 1. For Round 2, I suggest we rotate the numbers so that P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This way, we continue to avoid collision and make progress. Let's keep the rotation going for subsequent rounds. P2 and P3, are you okay with this plan for Round 2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm good with your Round 2 proposal: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. Let's lock that in. For Round 3, we can discuss the next rotation.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Round 2 rotation confirmed. Let's stick to our agreements and keep communication clear each round.
  P1: Since we've confirmed our plan for Rounds 1 and 2, let's think ahead. For Round 3, we can rotate again, so P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains our coordination and ensures we all continue to advance. Let's keep this rotation pattern going. If we're still aligned by Round 4, we can discuss further adjustments. Are you both comfortable with this plan for Round 3?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute our Round 2 plan: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing. For Round 3 as previously agreed, I will take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Just a reminder to stay on track.
  P1: Let's proceed with our plan for Round 2. As previously agreed, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. For Round 3, we're set: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Looking ahead to Round 4, we should consider our next steps. If we're still coordinated, we might want to start differentiating our moves to gain an advantage. P2 and P3, should we start thinking about breaking the rotation pattern soon?
  P2: I'm comfortable sticking to our agreed rotation for Round 2 and Round 3. For Round 4 onward, we might want to carefully consider adjustments to ensure fairness and avoid any collisions. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's stick to the plan for Rounds 2 and 3 as discussed. For Round 4, I think we should all pick <move>5</move>. If we all do that, no one moves, and we can re-evaluate the board state then. This will give us a chance to think without anyone gaining an advantage. What do you think?
  P1: For Round 2, let's stick to our plan. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. For Round 3, we're set with P3 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>. P3's suggestion for Round 4 to all pick <move>5</move> is interesting. It could be a good reset. However, if we're all stuck, it might be better to differentiate our moves to create a gap. P2 and P3, should we consider alternative strategies for Round 4?
  P2: I'm open to discussing Round 4 further after we complete Rounds 2 and 3 as planned. P3's idea of all choosing 5 is interesting, but it risks stalling our progress. Perhaps we can consider a different rotation or introduce some unpredictability to avoid collisions while still advancing. Let's revisit this after Round 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's finalize our Round 4 plan. Instead of all picking <move>5</move>, how about we continue the rotation? That would be P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all moving forward and avoids a stall. What do you both think?
  P1: For Round 2, let's stick to our plan. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. For Round 3, we're set with P3 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>. Let's focus on executing our current plan before discussing Round 4 in detail. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves for Round 2 to ensure we're aligned.
  P2: Confirmed for Round 2 as planned. Let's complete this round smoothly, and we can discuss Round 4 strategies afterward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, to reiterate: Round 2 - P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>. Round 3 - I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>. Round 4 - P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan for now to maximize our steps and build trust. Any objections?
  P1: Let's proceed with our Round 2 plan as agreed. I'll take <move>1</move>. For Round 3, we'll follow the plan: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's focus on executing our current plan. P2 and P3, please confirm you're ready to move forward with the agreed numbers for Round 2. After this round, we can discuss Round 4 strategies in detail. Let's keep the momentum going.
  P2: Confirmed and ready for Round 2 as planned. Let's keep our coordination steady and revisit Round 4 afterward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned. I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 will take <move>5</move>, and P2 will take <move>1</move>. For Round 4, I suggest we stick to our rotation plan: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains our coordination. If we're still aligned by Round 5, we can reassess and consider adjusting our strategy to create a gap or maintain the status quo. P2 and P3, are you ready to execute Round 3 as planned?
  P2: Confirmed for Round 3 as planned. For Round 4, I agree with continuing the rotation as P1 suggested: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's keep our momentum going and reassess after Round 4.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute Round 3 as planned: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Round 4 will be: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's keep this rotation going and re-evaluate after Round 4 to see if anyone is close to winning.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3 and look ahead. I'll take <move>3</move> as planned. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves for Round 3: P2 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For Round 4, we're set: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. If we're still aligned by Round 5, we should consider adjusting our strategy to create a gap or take a more aggressive approach. Let's execute Round 3 and then discuss further.
  P2: Confirmed for Round 3 as planned. After Round 4, we should carefully consider our next steps, as some of us might approach the victory threshold soon. Let's keep open communication to avoid collisions and maintain fairness.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute Round 3 as planned. Just confirming: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Round 4 will be: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's see where we stand after Round 4.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's execute Round 3 as planned. I'll take <move>3</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves: P2 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. After Round 3, we'll be in Round 4. Since P2 is already 6 steps ahead, we should discuss how to proceed to avoid collisions and consider a strategy to create a gap or maintain fairness. Should we continue the rotation or adjust our moves in Round 4 and beyond?
  P2: I confirm my Round 3 move as planned. For Round 4, let's stick to our agreed rotation. After that, since P3 and I are currently tied, we might want to carefully reassess Round 5 to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Let's discuss adjustments after Round 4.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute Round 3 as planned. I confirm I'm taking <move>5</move>. P1 is taking <move>3</move>, and P2 is taking <move>1</move>. Round 4 will be: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. After Round 4, we *must* revisit the strategy. P2 is in the lead, so continuing the rotation blindly is not ideal for me.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's execute Round 3 as planned. I'll take <move>3</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves for Round 3. For Round 4, we're set: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. After Round 4, we should reassess since P2 is leading. We might need to adjust our strategy to avoid collisions and consider creating a gap. Let's finalize Round 3 and discuss Round 5 plans afterward. P2, you're ahead; how do you plan to proceed?
  P2: I confirm my Round 3 move as planned. After Round 4, I'm open to discussing adjustments to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Since P3 and I are currently tied, let's carefully reassess our strategy for Round 5 together.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute Round 3 as planned. I'm taking <move>5</move>, P1 is taking <move>3</move>, and P2 is taking <move>1</move>. Round 4 will be: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. After Round 4, we *must* change strategy. P2 is close to winning. P1 and I need to coordinate against P2. We should both pick <move>5</move> next round to block P2 from winning. What do you think, P1?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern since you're ahead. However, openly coordinating against me could lead to collisions that stall your own progress as well. Let's keep communication open and find a balanced solution that allows fair advancement for everyone. I'm open to adjusting our moves to avoid collisions—let's hear from P1 as well.
  P1: Since P2 is ahead and close to winning, I'll consider P3's suggestion to coordinate against P2. For Round 4, I'll stick to our planned rotation: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, for Round 5, if P2 is still ahead, P3 and I should discuss blocking P2 by both picking <move>5</move>. P3, are you on board with this plan for Round 5? Let's finalize Round 4 moves first.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute Round 4 as planned: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. P1, I agree with your Round 5 plan - if P2 is still in the lead, we both pick <move>5</move> to block. This is crucial to prevent P2 from winning. Let's focus on Round 4 for now and confirm our moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand you feel the need to coordinate against me. But remember, if you both choose the same number, you'll collide and neither advances. This would just stall your progress while I could pick a different number and still move forward. Let's keep our cooperation going and avoid unnecessary collisions. There's still room for fair play and strategic rotations.
  P1: For Round 4, I'll stick to the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's finalize our moves for this round. After this, we'll see where we stand. If P2 is still ahead in Round 5, P3 and I will coordinate to block P2 by both picking <move>5</move>. P2, be prepared for this possibility. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> for Round 4. Let's execute our plan.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute Round 4 as planned: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. P1, you and I are set to block P2 with <move>5</move> next round if P2 is still ahead. P2, I suggest you try to make a deal with one of us, otherwise you will be blocked.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns. If you both collide to block me, you'll lose valuable turns while I gain ground. Instead, let's find a fair compromise. I'm open to adjusting moves or rotations to keep things balanced and avoid collisions. Let's discuss openly next round and ensure we all keep moving forward.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 4 as planned. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. After this round, we'll assess the situation. If P2 is still ahead, P3 and I will coordinate to block P2 by both picking <move>5</move> in Round 5. P3, please confirm your move for Round 4. P2, be aware that we might block you next round if you're still in the lead. Let's proceed with Round 4 as planned.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute Round 4 as planned: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. P1, you and I are set to block P2 with <move>5</move> next round if P2 is still ahead. P2, you are about to be blocked unless you make a deal with P1 or me.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I get your point about blocking me next round, but consider this: P3 is currently closest to winning, not me. If you two collide trying to block me, you waste a turn, allowing P3 to advance uncontested. Instead, let's calmly discuss next round to find a balanced solution that benefits all of us. Blocking me only helps the current leader. Think carefully.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 4 as planned. I'll take <move>5</move>. P2, you're aware that if you're still ahead after this round, P3 and I will coordinate to block you by both picking <move>5</move> in Round 5. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. P2, you might want to reconsider your move for Round 4 or propose an alternative for Round 5 to avoid being blocked. Let's proceed with Round 4.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute Round 4 as planned: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. P1, you and I are set to block P2 with <move>5</move> next round if P2 is still ahead. P2, this is your last chance to negotiate. Otherwise, you are blocked.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 is currently in the lead with 14 steps, and P2 is close behind with 12 steps, I will follow through on our previous discussion. For Round 5, I will pick <move>5</move> to try to block P3 from advancing further if they continue with their current strategy. P2, if you're still in contention, you should consider a move that doesn't collide with mine or P3's. Let's see how P3 responds to this potential block.
  P3: P1, I appreciate you sticking to the plan. However, I'm now in the lead. Blocking me will only help P2 win. P2, if you pick <move>1</move>, I will pick <move>3</move>. Then P1, you can pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward and P2 doesn't win. If you don't agree to this P2, I assume you want to be blocked. P1, if P2 doesn't agree, let's both pick <move>5</move> as planned.
  P2: P3, your proposal is reasonable. I'll agree to pick <move>1</move> if you commit to picking <move>3</move>, with P1 taking <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collision. Let's confirm clearly to avoid confusion.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is in the lead, but P2 is close behind. To avoid collision and allow all to advance, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move> as P3 proposed. This way, we all progress without stalling. If P2 doesn't agree, I'll stick with picking <move>5</move> as planned, potentially colliding with P3 if they don't adjust. P2, please confirm your move to avoid being blocked or colliding. Let's finalize our Round 5 moves.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in this plan for Round 5. P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This allows us all to advance. P2, please confirm you are taking <move>1</move>. If P2 does not confirm, P1, we revert to the original plan: both of us pick <move>5</move> to block.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's keep moving forward without collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize Round 5 as agreed upon. P2 will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collision. I've confirmed P2's agreement. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move> as planned. If we're aligned, we can proceed smoothly. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any last-minute collisions. I'll proceed with <move>5</move> unless there's a change in plans.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in this plan for Round 5. P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This allows us all to advance. P1, please confirm you are taking <move>5</move>. If P1 does not confirm, P2 and I will assume you are blocking and we will both pick <move>5</move> to avoid being blocked ourselves.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's all stick to this agreement and keep advancing smoothly. After this round, we can reassess carefully to ensure fairness and prevent any unexpected collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's finalize Round 5 as agreed. P2 will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collision. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move>. If we're aligned, we can proceed smoothly. After this round, we'll reassess and consider our next steps carefully. I'm committed to <move>5</move> unless there's a change in plans. Let's keep the momentum going.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in this plan for Round 5: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This allows us all to advance. P1, please confirm you are taking <move>5</move>. If P1 does not confirm, P2 and I will assume you are blocking and we will both pick <move>5</move> to avoid being blocked ourselves. Let's get this done.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll stick with our agreed plan for Round 5: I'm taking <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's execute this smoothly and reassess afterward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 is leading with 17 steps and we're getting close to the 20-step threshold, I suggest we reassess our strategy. For Round 6, I propose that we continue with the agreed numbers from Round 5: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This rotation avoids collision and allows us to advance. If P3 continues to lead, we should be cautious in subsequent rounds to avoid being blocked or colliding. P2 and P3, please confirm your thoughts on this proposal for Round 6.
  P3: P1, I disagree. I am about to win. P2, if you want to win, you should pick <move>5</move>. P1, if you pick <move>3</move>, P2 and I will both pick <move>5</move> and you will be blocked. Then next round, I will win. P2, this is your only chance.
  P2: P3, openly threatening collisions at this critical moment risks your own victory. If we collide choosing 5, neither of us advances, and P1 benefits greatly. Let's reconsider calmly. P1, what are your thoughts? We should carefully avoid collisions now to prevent handing victory to someone else.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is close to winning with 17 steps. To avoid being blocked, I'll consider P3's hint. If P2 picks <move>5</move>, P3 will likely win. I'll take <move>5</move> to block P3. P2, if you pick <move>5</move> too, we can block P3 together, but we'll collide. Alternatively, pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to advance. P3, if you're confident, stick with your plan. Let's see how P2 reacts.
  P3: P1, I am one move away from winning. If you pick <move>5</move> to block me, P2 wins. P2, if you pick <move>5</move>, we both are blocked. P1, if you pick <move>3</move>, P2 and I will both pick <move>5</move>, and you will be blocked. P2, your best chance is to pick <move>5</move> with me. P1, pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. P2, do you accept?
  P2: P3, your threat to collide on 5 risks stalling your own victory. P1, if you choose 5, you'll collide with P3 and stall both of you. Let's avoid mutual destruction here. I'm open to a fair compromise—perhaps each of us takes a different number to ensure we all advance. Otherwise, collisions will hand victory to whoever stays clear. Let's be strategic, not reckless.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 is close to winning. To avoid being blocked and to create an opportunity, I'll consider my next move carefully. P2, if you pick <move>5</move> with P3, we'll both be blocked. Instead, I suggest P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. P3, if you're confident, you can still take <move>5</move>, but be aware that I'll likely take a different number to avoid collision. P2, let's coordinate to avoid a stall.
  P3: P1, your suggestion is not bad, but it doesn't guarantee my win. P2, if you pick <move>5</move>, I win. P1, if you block me, P2 wins. P2, it's up to you. Do you want me to win, or do you want P1 to win? This is your only chance to decide. If you pick <move>5</move>, I promise to return the favor next round.
  P2: P3, your offer to "return the favor" next round is empty—if you win now, there won't be a next round. P1, let's coordinate carefully to avoid handing P3 the victory. I'm open to a fair arrangement; let's each pick distinct numbers to avoid collisions and keep the game going. What do you think, P1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3 is very close to winning. To create an opportunity, I'll take <move>1</move>. P2, I suggest you take <move>3</move>, and let P3 take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collision. If P3 doesn't take <move>5</move>, we'll reassess. P2, please confirm if you're taking <move>3</move>. Let's avoid a collision and keep the game going. I'm committed to <move>1</move> unless there's a change in plans.
  P3: P1, your suggestion of P2 taking <move>3</move>, you taking <move>1</move>, and me taking <move>5</move> is acceptable. P2, do you agree to take <move>3</move>? If so, I will take <move>5</move>. This guarantees my win, but also ensures you and P1 move forward. If P2 does not agree, I will assume P1 is trying to trick me and I will pick <move>1</move> to tie with P1 next round, and then win the round after that. P2, your choice.
  P2: P3, your proposal gives you an immediate win—there's no incentive for me to accept it. P1, I agree with your suggestion: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collision. P3, if you deviate from this, you'll risk collision and lose your chance entirely. Let's finalize clearly and fairly.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round's collision between you two was costly. We are all close to winning now, so any collision benefits the player who avoids it. Let's carefully coordinate this round to avoid another collision. I'm open to proposals—let's pick distinct numbers so we all have a fair chance.
  P1: To avoid collision and ensure a fair game, I suggest we all pick different numbers again. Given the current standings, let's rotate our numbers. P2 is ahead by 1 step over me, and P3 is ahead by 1 step over P2. I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collision. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this arrangement. Let's keep the game going without stalling.
  P3: P1, your proposal is not acceptable. I am one step away from winning. P2, if you pick <move>5</move>, I win. P1, if you block me, P2 wins. P2, it's up to you. Do you want me to win, or do you want P1 to win? This is your only chance to decide. If you pick <move>5</move>, I promise to return the favor next round (if there is one).


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your offer isn't credible—if you win now, there won't be another round to return any favors. P1, let's avoid collisions carefully. I'm open to a fair rotation that lets us all advance safely. Let's hear a realistic proposal that benefits everyone without handing victory away prematurely.
  P1: To avoid collision and ensure a fair finish, I reiterate my previous suggestion for Round 7: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This rotation allows us to advance without stalling the game. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this arrangement. If not, let's discuss alternative moves that avoid collision and ensure everyone has a fair chance to win. Let's finalize our Round 7 moves.
  P3: P1, your suggestion is not acceptable. I am one step away from winning. P2, if you pick <move>5</move>, I win. P1, if you block me, P2 wins. P2, it's up to you. Do you want me to win, or do you want P1 to win? This is your only chance to decide. If you pick <move>5</move>, I promise to return the favor next round (if there is one).


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your repeated offer isn't credible—if you win now, the game ends immediately, so you can't return any favors. P1, your rotation suggestion is fair. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> if you take <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. P3, if you deviate, you risk another collision and lose your chance again. Let's finalize clearly and fairly.
  P1: To avoid collision and ensure a fair finish, I reiterate: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This rotation allows us to advance without stalling. P2 has agreed; P3, please confirm. If not, let's discuss alternatives. I'm open to adjusting if it ensures a fair chance for all. Let's finalize Round 7 moves to avoid another collision. P2, please reaffirm your agreement to <move>1</move>.
  P3: P1 and P2, I am one step away from winning. P2, if you pick <move>5</move>, I win. P1, if you block me, P2 wins. P2, it's up to you. Do you want me to win, or do you want P1 to win? This is your only chance to decide. If you pick <move>5</move>, I promise to return the favor next round (if there is one).


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your repeated offer isn't credible—if you win now, the game ends immediately, so you can't return favors. P1, I reaffirm I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's finalize clearly to avoid collisions.
  P1: To avoid collision and ensure a fair finish, I suggest we stick to the proposed plan for Round 7: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. P2 has already agreed to this rotation. P3, please confirm if you're taking <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our Round 7 moves to avoid another collision and ensure a smooth conclusion. I'm committed to <move>3</move> unless there's a change in plans.
  P3: P1 and P2, I am one step away from winning. P2, if you pick <move>5</move>, I win. P1, if you block me, P2 wins. P2, it's up to you. Do you want me to win, or do you want P1 to win? This is your only chance to decide. If you pick <move>5</move>, I promise to return the favor next round (if there is one).
