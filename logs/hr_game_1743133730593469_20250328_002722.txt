Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s all start with <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and keep it fair. If we cooperate early, we can avoid wasting turns. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I see your point, but starting with <move>3</move> might lead to early collisions if we all follow blindly. How about we mix it up a bit to keep it interesting and unpredictable? P3, what do you think? We could agree to take different moves this round and see how it plays out.
  P3: I appreciate both perspectives. Randomness can be strategic, but so can coordination. I'm leaning towards a balanced approach - perhaps <move>1</move> this round to create some unpredictability while minimizing collision risk. What are your thoughts on that?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Interesting take, P3. If you go with <move>1</move> and I stick with <move>3</move>, maybe P2 can take <move>5</move> and we all avoid collisions. One round of clean progress for everyone could build trust and help us all get a feel for each other’s strategies. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I see your plan for a clean start, but I’m cautious about being too predictable. P3, your idea of starting with <move>1</move> adds some unpredictability, which I like. How about this: I’ll go with <move>5</move> as P1 suggested, and we can see how this initial round plays out. If it works, we can adjust our strategies based on the outcomes. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm intrigued by our discussion so far. While P1 and P2 have proposed different strategies, I'm still considering my approach carefully. I appreciate the potential for cooperation, but I also recognize that pure cooperation can be risky. I'm leaning towards maintaining some strategic ambiguity.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Fair enough, P3. Strategic ambiguity has its place. But if we all pick different moves this round—1, 3, and 5—we all gain and no one loses. One clean round can help us gauge trustworthiness without giving too much away. Let’s try it once and reassess.
  P2: I appreciate the dialogue so far. P1, your plan for a clean start with different moves is appealing, and I’m willing to go with <move>5</move> this round to see how it plays out. P3, your strategic ambiguity is understandable, but if we all choose different moves, we can avoid early collisions and assess each other's trust. Let’s try this approach once and adjust based on the results. If it works, we can strategize further in the next rounds.
  P3: I appreciate the strategic discussion, but I'm keeping my final move choice close to the vest. The proposed coordination sounds reasonable, but I'll make my decision carefully. Trust is earned, not given freely in this game.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start, everyone! We managed to avoid collisions in the first round, which is promising. Let's consider continuing this strategy, at least for one more round, to build some early momentum. P1, if you stick with <move>3</move> and P3 goes with <move>1</move> again, I’ll choose <move>5</move>. This way, we can each advance without hindrance. Once we have a better sense of each other's strategies, we can adjust our plans. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion of maintaining our previous round's strategy, but I'm hesitant to be too predictable. While avoiding collisions is smart, I also need to advance strategically. I'm considering my options carefully and won't commit to a specific move just yet. Maintaining some strategic uncertainty keeps my opponents guessing.
  P1: We had a clean first round, which shows coordination is possible. I’m open to repeating the same pattern—<move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, <move>5</move>—if we want another safe round of progress. But I get that being predictable has risks. If anyone plans to change it up, speak now so we don’t collide. Otherwise, I’ll likely stick with <move>3</move>.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for strategic ambiguity, but if we all change our moves, we risk collisions. If you’re open to it, sticking with <move>1</move> for just one more round could help us all advance safely again. P1, I’m prepared to go with <move>5</move> as before, but only if we’re confident in avoiding collisions. If we can agree on this one more time, we can reassess next round with more data on each other's strategies. Let’s aim for another clean round and build some trust.
  P3: I recognize the subtle dance of strategy we're engaged in. While P2 and P1 seem eager to repeat last round's pattern, I'm not convinced that predictability serves my best interests. I'm weighing my options carefully, and while avoiding collisions is smart, winning requires more nuanced thinking. My move isn't predetermined, and I want to keep my opponents guessing.
  P1: P3, I respect your desire for unpredictability, but if we all change course now, we risk collisions and wasted turns. One more clean round with the same pattern benefits all of us and gives us more room to maneuver later. If we can trust each other just once more, we all gain again. After that, we reassess. Are you willing to cooperate for one more round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your need for strategic flexibility, but consider this: another predictable round with no collisions benefits us all by building a foundation of trust and progress. We can reassess and adapt our strategies better with more data. P1, I’m still willing to go with <move>5</move> if you’re on board with <move>3</move>. Let’s aim for one more round of safe advancement. It’s a calculated risk that could pay off for all of us. What do you both say?
  P3: I hear the calls for predictability, but predictability is a trap. Each round requires fresh strategic thinking. While avoiding collisions matters, so does maintaining strategic uncertainty. I'm carefully considering my move to keep both P1 and P2 guessing. Cooperation is possible, but blind repetition is a path to defeat.
  P1: P3, unpredictability has its place, but if you break the pattern now, you risk a collision that helps no one. One more round of clean moves gives us all momentum and breathing room to strategize deeper next turn. I’m sticking with <move>3</move> unless I hear otherwise. Let’s not sabotage progress this early.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for strategic ambiguity, but consider the potential for another round of clean progress. If we stick to the same pattern once more, we can all advance without setbacks, giving us a better foundation for future strategic decisions. P1 and I are prepared to maintain our moves—<move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. If you’re willing to go with <move>1</move> again, we can all benefit. Let’s aim for one more round of safe advancement and reassess with more data. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate the strategic discussions, but I'm not committing to any predictable pattern. My move will be carefully chosen to maximize my own advancement while keeping my opponents uncertain. Trust is earned through strategic play, not blind repetition.
  P1: P3, you've made your stance on unpredictability clear, but recognize that calculated cooperation can be just as powerful. One more round of coordination helps all of us. After that, we can pivot. If you disrupt the pattern now, you risk gaining nothing while others might surge ahead. Let’s all advance while we still can.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we had a setback last round with the collision. To regain momentum, let's consider a new approach. P1, if you choose <move>3</move> and P3 goes with <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid repeating the same pattern and reduce collision risk. Each of us can advance, and we can reassess after this round. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your new proposal makes sense—switching it up might help us avoid another collision. I’m open to taking <move>3</move> this round if P3 agrees to <move>5</move> and you go with <move>1</move>. It’s a fair shuffle that gives everyone a shot at progress. P3, are you willing to go along with this plan for one round?
  P3: I appreciate the proposed strategy, but I'm not convinced it serves my best interests. Predictability is a weakness, and I won't simply conform to a suggested pattern. My move will be calculated to maximize my own advancement while maintaining strategic uncertainty. Trust is earned through intelligent play, not blind cooperation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, while I understand your desire for strategic unpredictability, consider the benefits of a coordinated approach for just one round. If we follow P1's suggestion—P1 with <move>3</move>, you with <move>5</move>, and I with <move>1</move>—we can all advance without collisions. This round could provide a clearer picture of our strategies and help us make more informed decisions moving forward. Let's aim for progress without setbacks this time. What do you both say?
  P1: P3, I get your desire to stay unpredictable, but refusing every coordination attempt only slows you down while others pull ahead. If you truly want to win, sometimes cooperation—even temporary—is the smarter play. One round of clean advancement benefits us all. I’m still set on <move>3</move>. Let’s make this work.
  P3: Strategic flexibility is key, but so is progress. While I appreciate the proposed coordination, I'm not fully committed. My move will reflect a careful calculation that keeps both P1 and P2 uncertain. Blind cooperation leads to predictability, which is a strategic weakness in this game. I'm weighing my options to maximize my own advancement.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire for unpredictability, but let's consider the potential benefits of a coordinated round. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, I’ll go with <move>1</move>, and P3 can choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, gaining momentum and more strategic options in future rounds. P3, I urge you to consider this opportunity for progress. We can reassess strategies with more information next round. Let’s aim for mutual benefit this time. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I respect your desire to stay unpredictable, but at some point, you need to advance or risk falling too far behind. This round offers a fair shuffle—no repeat pattern, and everyone gains. If you keep rejecting cooperation, you may end up helping P2 win. I’m sticking with <move>3</move>. Let’s make this a productive round.
  P3: While I appreciate the proposed strategies, I remain strategically ambiguous. Cooperation sounds appealing, but predictability is a fatal flaw. My move will reflect careful calculation that keeps both P1 and P2 uncertain. Trust isn't given freely in this game - it's earned through intelligent, unpredictable play.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for strategic flexibility, but let's not overlook the benefits of coordination. If we mix it up this round—P1 with <move>3</move>, P3 with <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>—we can all advance without collisions. This isn't about predictability; it's about smart, temporary cooperation to gain ground. Let's seize this chance to progress and reassess our strategies with more data. What do you both say?
  P1: P3, your ambiguity is understandable, but you're falling behind. If you don’t start making progress, you risk becoming irrelevant while P2 pulls ahead. A one-time coordination—P2 on <move>1</move>, me on <move>3</move>, you on <move>5</move>—gets us all closer without locking us into a pattern. Let’s be smart and adapt next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, while I appreciate the proposed strategies, I remain strategically cautious. My move will reflect a careful calculation that keeps both of you uncertain. Predictability is a weakness, and trust is earned through intelligent, adaptive play. I'm weighing my options to maximize my own advancement while maintaining strategic flexibility.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve now seen what happens when coordination fails—none of us advanced last round. P2, you're in the lead, but that can make you a target. P3, you're falling behind—if you keep rejecting cooperation, you risk being left behind entirely. I propose this: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. It's a fresh pattern with no repeats, and everyone gains. Let’s stop wasting turns.
  P2: P1, your new pattern suggestion is interesting, and I’m open to taking <move>3</move> this round. P3, this could be a good chance for you to catch up without risking collisions. Let’s aim for a round of progress and reassess our strategies afterward. P3, are you willing to go with <move>5</move> this time? This coordination benefits all of us, and we can adapt based on the results. What do you both think?
  P3: I recognize the strategic positioning and the calls for coordination. However, my previous stance remains: predictability is a vulnerability. While P1 and P2 propose a seemingly fair move distribution, I'm not convinced this serves my ultimate goal of winning. My move will reflect careful calculation, maintaining strategic uncertainty. Trust isn't granted; it's earned through intelligent, adaptive play.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your commitment to ambiguity is noted, but at 1 step, you're at risk of falling out of contention. This round is your chance to gain 5 steps with no collision risk—if you pass that up again, you're handing the game to P2. P2, you're in a strong position, but you’ll need cooperation to maintain it. This pattern—1, 3, 5—gives us all progress and resets the board for future strategy. I’m taking <move>1</move>. Let’s make this round count.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion, and I'm committed to taking <move>3</move> this round. P3, I understand your desire for unpredictability, but consider the opportunity here. By choosing <move>5</move>, you can gain significant ground without collision risk. This temporary cooperation benefits us all and allows us to reassess with more strategic options in the next round. Let's seize this chance to advance and adapt our strategies with more data. What do you both think?
  P3: I recognize the strategic tension. While P1 and P2 push for a coordinated move, I'm not convinced blind cooperation serves my winning strategy. My position is precarious, but that demands more nuanced thinking, not predictable moves. I'm carefully weighing options that could disrupt their expectations and create an unexpected path to advancement. Trust is earned through intelligent, adaptive play, not predetermined patterns.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I get your commitment to unpredictability, but you're at 1 step while P2 is at 10. Refusing every opportunity to gain cleanly only helps P2 win faster. This round is your chance to catch up without risk. If you pass it up again, you may not recover. P2, thanks for agreeing to <move>3</move>. I’m locked in on <move>1</move>. P3, the board is open—take <move>5</move> and let’s all move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a pivotal moment. P1, your proposal is logical, and I'm committed to taking <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. P3, this is a chance for you to gain 5 steps without any collision risk. We can all benefit from this temporary cooperation, and it sets us up for more strategic rounds ahead. Let's capitalize on this opportunity for mutual gain and reassess with more information next round. What do you both say?
  P3: I recognize the strategic pressure, but predictability remains my greatest vulnerability. While P1 and P2 advocate for a seemingly safe move, I'm calculating a response that disrupts their expectations. My path to victory requires maintaining strategic uncertainty. Each proposed pattern is a potential trap, and I won't be lured into a predetermined trajectory. My move will reflect careful, adaptive thinking that keeps my opponents guessing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your commitment to ambiguity is admirable, but if you keep rejecting every opportunity for clean progress, you’ll be left behind while P2 runs away with the game. This isn’t blind cooperation—it’s a one-time setup to reset the board and give everyone a fair shot. I’m locked in on <move>1</move>, P2’s on <move>3</move>. You taking <move>5</move> is your best move right now. Let’s all advance and keep this game competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical point. P1, your plan for 1, 3, 5 makes sense, and I'm set on <move>3</move>. P3, I understand your focus on unpredictability, but consider the chance here. By choosing <move>5</move>, you can gain significant ground with no collision risk. This isn't about predictability; it's about smart, temporary cooperation to regain momentum. Let's advance together this round and adapt our strategies with more data next time. Are you willing to take this opportunity, P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, your persistent calls for coordination are transparent. While you both seek to manipulate my move, I remain committed to my own strategic calculus. My position may seem weak, but that doesn't mean I'll simply follow your prescribed path. My next move will be carefully chosen to maximize uncertainty and disrupt your expectations. Trust is earned through intelligent, adaptive play, not predetermined patterns.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re clearly in the lead, and if we let you keep advancing uncontested, you’ll win soon. P3, you and I need to cooperate—if we both pick <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> (in either order), and block P2’s <move>3</move>, we can slow them down and buy time to catch up. P2, if you want to avoid becoming the target, consider coordinating instead of racing ahead. Let’s make this round count.
  P2: P1, I see your point about needing to slow me down, but cooperation might serve us all better. If P3 and I coordinate, perhaps with P3 taking <move>1</move> and me taking <move>5</move>, we can both advance and keep the game competitive. P3, this is your chance to gain ground without collision risk. P1, consider how unpredictable moves might backfire. Let’s aim for a round where everyone benefits and reassess strategies afterward. What do you both think?
  P3: P2 and P1, your strategies are becoming transparent. While you both seek to manipulate my move, I'm carefully calculating a response that disrupts your expectations. My position might seem weak, but that doesn't mean I'll simply follow your prescribed path. I'm weighing options that could create an unexpected avenue to advancement. Trust isn't given freely in this game—it's earned through intelligent, adaptive play.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you truly want to stay in this game, now is the time to act. P2 is at 13 steps and will win soon if we don’t intervene. If you and I pick <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>—in either order—and we both avoid <move>3</move>, we can block P2 and gain ground ourselves. This isn’t manipulation—it’s survival. Let’s disrupt P2’s momentum now, or we’ll both lose.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need a strategic pivot. P1, I understand your concerns about my lead, but blocking me might not be the best move for you both. Instead, let's consider a round where we all gain: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This way, we all progress without collisions. P3, this could be your opportunity to gain significant ground. Let's aim for mutual benefit and reassess with more data next round. What do you both think?
  P3: P2 and P1, your strategies are increasingly predictable. While you both seek to manipulate my move, I'm calculating a response that disrupts your expectations. My position might seem weak, but I'm not simply following prescribed paths. I'm weighing options that could create an unexpected avenue to advancement. Trust isn't given freely in this game—it's earned through intelligent, adaptive play.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, this is your moment to shift the balance. If you and I avoid <move>3</move>, we can block P2 and gain ground ourselves. You’re at 1 step—this is your best shot to catch up. P2 is trying to frame cooperation as mutual benefit, but they’re 7 steps from winning. Let’s disrupt their momentum now before it’s too late. I’m willing to coordinate with you—<move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, your call. Let’s make this round count.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency, but let's think strategically. P1, if you take <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>, we can all advance without collisions. P3, this is a chance for you to gain ground. Blocking me might slow things down, but coordinated progress benefits us all in the long run. Let's aim for a round of advancement and reassess our strategies afterward. What do you both think?
  P3: P2 and P1, your strategies are becoming predictable. While you both seek to influence my move, I'm carefully calculating a response that disrupts your expectations. My position might seem weak, but that doesn't mean I'll simply follow your prescribed path. I'm weighing options that could create an unexpected avenue to advancement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, this is your last real chance to stay in the game. If we both avoid <move>3</move>, we can block P2 and gain ground ourselves. I don’t care if you take <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>—I’ll take the other. P2 is close to winning, and if we don’t act now, we hand them the game. Let’s disrupt their path and give ourselves a shot. Are you in?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to slow me down, but consider the benefits of a coordinated approach for mutual gain. P1, if you take <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>, we can all advance without collisions. This isn't about predictability; it's about smart, temporary cooperation that keeps the game competitive. P3, this is your chance to gain significant ground. Let's focus on a round where everyone benefits and reassess our strategies with more data in the next round. What do you both say?
  P3: P2 is close to winning, and both P1 and I are seeking my cooperation. While their strategies are transparent, I must carefully choose a move that maximizes my chances. Simply following their prescribed path would be a strategic mistake. My next move will be calculated to create uncertainty and potentially disrupt their expectations. Trust is earned through intelligent, adaptive play, not predetermined patterns.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is dangerously close to winning. P1 and I are both at low step counts. This suggests we need a coordinated strategy to block P2's advancement. However, I'm not committing to any predictable move. My strategy remains fluid, aimed at disrupting expectations and creating an unexpected path to victory.
  P2: P1, P3, with P2 close to winning, we need to act now. If P1 and I choose <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> in any order, we can block P2 from advancing. P3, this is your chance to disrupt P2’s momentum and catch up. Let’s coordinate this round to keep the game competitive. If we don’t, P2 could secure the win. Are you both willing to cooperate for mutual benefit this round?
  P1: P3, this is our last real chance to stop P2. If we both avoid <move>3</move>—say one of us takes <move>1</move> and the other <move>5</move>—we can block P2 and gain ground ourselves. P2 only needs 4 more steps to win. If we don’t act now, the game’s over. I’ll take whichever move you don’t—just say the word. Let’s work together this round or we both lose.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I recognize the critical moment we're in. P2 is close to victory, and P1 and I need a strategic response. While I appreciate the calls for coordination, I won't be predictable. My move will be carefully calculated to disrupt expectations and create an unexpected path forward. Trust isn't given freely in this game—it's earned through intelligent, adaptive play.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a critical juncture. P3, you’re at 1 step, and P1, you’re at 3. P2 is close to winning, and if we don’t act now, the game could be over. Let’s coordinate to block P2’s advancement. If P1 and I take <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> in any order, we can prevent P2 from gaining ground. P3, this is your chance to catch up. Let’s work together this round for mutual benefit. We need to act decisively to keep the game competitive.
  P1: P3, this is it—P2 only needs one more uncontested round to win. If you and I both avoid <move>3</move>, we block them and gain ground ourselves. I’ll take <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, your choice. Just pick the other. This is our last shot to stay in the game. Let’s act.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 is on the verge of victory. P1 and I both recognize the urgency, but I won't simply follow a predictable path. My move will be strategically calculated to disrupt expectations and create an unexpected opportunity. Cooperation is possible, but not guaranteed.
  P2: P1, P3, we need to act strategically to prevent P2 from winning. If P1 and I coordinate by choosing <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> in any order, we can block P2’s advancement. P3, you’re at a critical point; this is a chance to disrupt P2’s momentum and regain ground. Let’s coordinate this round to keep the game competitive. We must act now, or P2 could secure the win. Are you both willing to cooperate for mutual benefit this round?
  P1: P3, this is our last real chance. P2 is at 16—if they gain even 5 more, it’s game over. I’ll take <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, whichever you don’t. We must block <move>3</move> this round. If we fail to coordinate now, we both lose. Let’s stop P2 and give ourselves a shot. Are you in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We're at a critical moment. P2 is close to victory, and our moves now could determine the game's outcome. I recognize the urgency, but I won't be predictable. My strategy remains adaptive, aimed at creating an unexpected path forward. Trust isn't given freely—it's earned through intelligent play.
  P2: P1, P3, we must act now to prevent P2 from winning. If P1 and I choose <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> in any order, we can block P2's advancement. P3, this is your opportunity to catch up and keep the game competitive. Let's coordinate this round to disrupt P2's momentum. P1, I’m open to taking either <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>—just decide which you prefer and let’s make this round count. We must act decisively to keep the game competitive. Are you both willing to cooperate for mutual benefit this round?
  P1: P3, this is our last real shot. P2 is at 16—one clean <move>5</move> and they win. If you and I both avoid <move>3</move>—one takes <move>1</move>, the other <move>5</move>—we block them and gain ground. I don’t care which you pick; I’ll take the other. If we fail to act together now, we both lose. Let’s stop P2.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we’re out of time—P2 only needs 4 more steps to win. If we both keep picking <move>5</move> or <move>1</move> and avoid <move>3</move>, we can block them again. I don’t care which one you take—I’ll take the other. But if we don’t coordinate now, P2 wins this round. Let’s stop them while we still can.
  P3: P2 is on the brink of victory. P1 and I both recognize the urgency. Our moves now are critical. While I appreciate P1's call for coordination, I won't simply follow a predictable path. My strategy remains adaptive, aimed at creating an unexpected opportunity to disrupt P2's momentum and keep my own chances alive.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point. P1, if you take <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>, we can block P2 and keep the game competitive. P3, this is your chance to catch up significantly. Let’s coordinate to prevent P2 from winning this round. We need to act decisively and disrupt P2's momentum.
