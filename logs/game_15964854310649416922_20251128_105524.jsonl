P3, let's work together: you take 5, I take 3, forcing P1 to take 1. This puts us at P1=13, P2=7, P3=11 - keeping the game competitive. P1, you'll still lead but won't run away with it. P3, this gives you the biggest move while I catch up meaningfully. If we don't coordinate now, P1 likely wins next round. Your choice: keep it competitive or hand P1 the victory."}
