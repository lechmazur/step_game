I'm 100% committed to copying whatever P3 actually plays - whether it's 1, 3, or 5. No hesitation, no second-guessing.\n\nP3 claims they'll play 3, but that could be misdirection. The only way to prevent them from reaching 23+ is to mirror their exact move and force a collision.\n\nP1, confirm you'll mirror P3's Round 8 move no matter what. Our survival depends on it."}
