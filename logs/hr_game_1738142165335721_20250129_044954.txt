Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep it simple and avoid collisions. How about we each choose a different move number this turn? I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your suggestion seems reasonable to avoid collisions. However, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we still avoid collisions but distribute the advantage more evenly. If everyone agrees, we can proceed without conflict. Let me know your thoughts.

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, it seems like your suggestion worked out well for you last round. Let's try to balance things a bit. How about this turn, P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we all get a chance to advance without collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your proposal is fair, but I suggest a different approach to maximize our chances of advancing. Let’s rotate the numbers systematically: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This minimizes collisions and ensures steady progress for everyone. If we stick to this pattern, we can all advance without unnecessary risks. What do you think?

  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's maintain the systematic rotation to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. This round, I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This pattern has worked well so far, minimizing risks and maximizing advancement for everyone. If we stick to this strategy, we can all continue progressing without unnecessary conflicts. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P1, your rotation strategy seems to favor you a bit more, considering you're already ahead. To balance things, how about we adjust slightly: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we all have a fair chance to catch up and avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems like the rotation strategy hasn't been as beneficial for me. To ensure everyone gets a fair chance, let's try this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, I can catch up a bit, and we can still avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your concern is valid, but the rotation strategy has worked well so far. However, to address your position, I propose a one-time adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This gives you a chance to advance significantly while keeping the pattern fair. After this, we can return to the systematic rotation. Let me know if you agree.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've seen some progress, but it's time to shake things up. To catch up and keep things interesting, let's try this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, I can advance without collisions, and we all get a fair shot. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your proposal seems reasonable, but I suggest we stick to the systematic rotation to maintain fairness. This round, I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures steady progress for everyone without unnecessary risks. If we deviate too often, it may lead to collisions and setbacks. Let’s keep the pattern consistent for now. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, the systematic rotation has kept us advancing steadily. This round, I propose we stick to it: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. It minimizes collisions and ensures fairness. Deviating now could risk setbacks for everyone. Let’s maintain consistency to reach the goal efficiently. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the appeal of the systematic rotation, but it's clear I'm falling behind. To keep things competitive, how about this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This gives me a chance to catch up while still avoiding collisions. Let's keep the game interesting and fair for everyone. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but deviating from the rotation risks collisions and setbacks for everyone. Consistency has kept us advancing steadily. However, to address your concern, I’m open to a one-time adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. After this, let’s return to the systematic rotation to ensure fairness and efficiency. This way, you can catch up, and we avoid unnecessary risks. Let me know if you agree.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the consideration, but it's clear I need to catch up. Let's try this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This gives me a chance to close the gap while still avoiding collisions. It keeps the game competitive and fair for everyone. What do you both think?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all close to the finish line, but I need to make up some ground. Let's try this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, I can catch up without causing collisions. It's a fair approach that keeps the game competitive and interesting for everyone. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your urgency is understandable, but deviating again risks collisions and slows everyone down. Instead, let’s stick to the systematic rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures steady progress for all. If we keep changing strategies, it becomes chaotic and unpredictable. Consistency will help us reach the goal efficiently while minimizing risks. Let’s prioritize fairness and focus on advancing without setbacks. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire for consistency, but given our current standings, I need a chance to catch up. Let's try this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, I can close the gap without causing collisions, keeping the game competitive and fair. It’s a small adjustment to maintain balance and interest. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, while your urgency is clear, frequent deviations increase collision risks and disrupt progress for everyone. Sticking to the systematic rotation ensures fairness and minimizes setbacks. However, to address your position, I’m open to one final adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. After this, we return to the rotation. This balances your need to catch up while maintaining order. Let’s avoid chaos and focus on steady advancement. Agree?
