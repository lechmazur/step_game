P3, you're in a tough spot - if you take 1, you only reach 19 while we both reach 20 and tie for the win. If you choose 3 or 5, you'll likely collide with one of us. This is our optimal strategy at this point in the game."}

You're both planning to reach 20 this round, forcing me to either let you both win or risk collision. I understand this is strategic gameplay. While you might expect me to take 1, I need to make the best move for my chances of winning. I'll be making my decision based on game theory and what I believe you'll actually do versus what you're claiming. Let's see how this final stretch plays out."}
