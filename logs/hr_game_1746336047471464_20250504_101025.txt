Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: How about we start safe and all pick 1 this first turn? Low risk, lets us test trust before bigger leaps. Agree?
  P3: Sounds good—I’ll pick 1 this turn.
  P2: I appreciate starting safe to gauge everyone’s play. I'm inclined to keep it low this turn, but I'll be alert for any shifts. Let’s see how each of us commits—sometimes a lower risk turn sets up a bigger move later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locking in 1 this turn. After we see the results, we can plan Round 2—maybe rotate unique numbers so no one blocks. Sound good?
  P3: Agreed—I'll lock in 1 for this turn. Looking forward to seeing the results before we plan Round 2.
  P2: I’m still backing our safe start this turn. Let’s all stick to our initial low-risk play and see where it leaves us. In later rounds, we might find an opportunity to individually break away—but only if we choose unique moves. I’m keeping flexible, though I lean toward steady progress now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, consensus locked—I'm on 1. If no one has anything else, I'm ready to end chat and see what happens.
  P3: Locking in 1 as agreed.
  P2: I'm sticking with our current plan—safe and steady for turn one. I'll remain flexible if any surprises come in later rounds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we all pick 1 again this turn—keep it safe, avoid collisions, then plan unique moves in Round 3 once we see the results.
  P1: Stalemating on 1 just freezes P2 and me while you stay in front, P3—that’s not sustainable. How about a rotating, collision-free plan that treats us all equally?

Plan for the next three rounds  
• Round 2: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1  
• Round 3: P3 → 5, P1 → 3, P2 → 1  
• Round 4: P2 → 5, P3 → 3, P1 → 1  

Each of us gets one 5, one 3, one 1, and no clashes. If someone breaks the deal, the rest can copy their number next turn to block them. Fair?
  P2: P1's rotating plan seems fair—each of us gets our chance to hit 5 without colliding. I'm ready to commit to 3 in Round 2 as suggested. P3, are you comfortable with that plan? If everyone agrees, we avoid collisions and keep the game moving strategically.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take 1 this round. Can we each publicly confirm our picks P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 so we all know we’re locked in?
  P1: Confirmed: Round 2 picks—P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1.  
I’m locking in 5 now. If someone deviates, the rest of us can copy their number next turn to block them, so it’s in everyone’s best interest to stick to the rotation. Ready to end chat unless anyone has concerns.
  P2: I'm confirming my commitment to the plan: I'll pick 3 in Round 2. Let's all stick to our agreed numbers. If anyone deviates later, I'll adjust to block as promised.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m all in on the rotation. Round 3: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. I’m locking in 5 now—let’s stick to this and reassess after seeing the results.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our current standings, I’m not comfortable with sticking to our original arrangement. How about we flip Round 3’s assignments—P1 still takes 3, but I switch to 5 while P3 goes with 1? That would bring our totals to P1:8, me:8, and P3:7. It keeps things competitive and addresses the current gap. What do you think?
  P1: I’m honoring the rotation: this round I pick 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. Any unilateral change breaks trust—whoever deviates can expect the rest of us to mirror their number next turn and stall them out. Let’s keep the deal.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we each get our 5 without collision. Round 4: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That lands us at P1:9, P2:6, P3:11—no clashes, everyone advances. If anyone deviates, the rest of us will mirror their move next turn to block them.
  P1: P3, you’re 2 steps behind me now, but your proposal jumps you ahead while I crawl. Fair alternative:

Round 4  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 1  

Everyone moves, no collisions, totals become P1 11 | P2 8 | P3 7.  
If you still insist on 5, I’ll mirror 5 and we both stall; P2 can copy 1 or 3 to freeze us all. Your call—take the safe 1 or risk zero progress. P2, 5 boosts you nicely here.
  P2: I agree with P1’s alternative arrangement. For Round 4, I’ll lock in 5, putting us on track for unique moves and clear progress. If anyone deviates, I’ll mirror to block them. Let’s stick to the plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 5 proposal: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. I’ll lock in 5—I need to close the gap. P2, will you take 3? P1, if you deviate from 1 I’ll mirror your choice to stall you. Let’s lock it in.
  P1: P2, here’s a simple way to keep P3 stuck:

• I pick 3  
• You pick 5  

Outcomes  
1) P3 keeps his announced 5 → he collides with you, both stall, I advance to 14.  
2) P3 switches to 3 to mirror me → he collides with me, you advance 5 to 8.  

Either way P3 gains 0. You either jump to 8 or, at worst, stay tied with him while I keep the lead. Ready to team-block P3 this turn?
  P2: I lean toward blocking P3’s leap. P1’s plan to take 3 is sound, and P3, sticking with 5 may force a collision that leaves you frozen. I’ll adjust my pick accordingly to help keep P3 in check. Let’s make sure your move doesn’t give him a clear lead.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you’re trapped at 3 under P1’s thumb. Let’s both take 5 this turn while P1 takes 1. You jump to 8, I to 11, P1 only to 15. If P1 tries to collide on 5, he stalls at 14 while we both move. Ready to break free?
  P2: P3, your plan could work—but I'm uneasy letting P1 safely add only 1 if he isn’t truly committed. I’m ready to go 5 as you suggest, provided P1 explicitly picks 1. Otherwise, to block his lead, I'll mirror his move. P1, are you firmly committing to 1 this turn?
  P1: I’m taking 3 this turn.  

P2: grab the 5—puts you at 8 with no clash if P3 sticks to 1.  
P3: you can still move 1 safely; try 3 or 5 and you collide (with me or P2) and stall again.  

If anyone crashes into me, I’ll copy their number next round until they stop moving. Let’s keep progress steady and collision-free.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Enough stalling—how about a fresh, perfectly even 3-turn rotation so nobody clashes?

Round 7:  P1 → 3  P2 → 1  P3 → 5  
Round 8:  P1 → 1  P2 → 5  P3 → 3  
Round 9:  P1 → 5  P2 → 3  P3 → 1  

Everybody gets one 5, one 3, one 1. Break the deal and the rest of us will copy your number next turn to freeze you. Fair?
  P3: P2, join me this turn and let’s both pick 5. We jump from 6→11 while P1 is stuck:

- If he picks 3, he goes 14→17 and still trails us next round.  
- If he picks 5, he collides with us all and stays at 14.

Either way, P1 can’t safely surge. Let’s cut into his lead—pick 5 with me.
  P2: I see merit in blocking P1’s safe play, P3. I'm leaning toward joining you with 5—but only if we both fully commit to stalling his advance. P1, your rotation plan forces a clear choice: stick with it and risk our team-up, or adjust. Let’s be sure our moves don’t inadvertently boost his lead.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Proposal for Round 8:

• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 1  

Why this works:

1) If everyone honors it, no collisions: scores become P1 17 | P2 11 | P3 12.  
2) If P3 gets greedy and switches to 5, he collides with P2 and stalls; I still move to 17.  
3) If P3 switches to 3, he collides with me and stalls; P2 leaps to 11.  

In every branch P3 is frozen while P2 gains or we both gain. Breakers will be mirrored next turn until they stop moving. Fair and strictly better for P2—ready to lock?
  P2: P1, your proposal seems workable. I’m inclined to help secure progress—provided P3 sticks to his assigned move. Given our current gaps, I’ll be ready to adjust if anyone deviates. So long as we all honor the plan, I’m on board with a collision-free round.
  P3: P2, pick 5 and I’ll pick 3. That leaves P1 with no safe choice: if he picks 3 he collides with me, if he picks 5 he collides with you—so he stalls. You go to 11, I go to 14, and we break P1’s lead. Ready to lock that in?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 9, I propose: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This way, P1 stays on a slow track while I boost to 16 and P3 reaches 14. If someone deviates, I’ll mirror to block any extra gain. Let’s keep P1 from widening his lead. Thoughts?
  P1: New proposal that lets everyone move and keeps the gaps clear:

Round 9  
• P1 → 3 (lead goes to 17)  
• P2 → 1 (you reach 12)  
• P3 → 5 (you reach 16)  

Why it’s safe:  
1) No collisions if honored.  
2) If P3 flips to 3 to chase, he collides with me and stalls; P2 still moves to 12.  
3) If P2 flips to 5, he collides with P3 and stalls; I still move to 17.

Breakers will be mirrored next turn until frozen. Ready to lock this in?
  P3: Here’s my Round 9 proposal:

• P1 → 1 (goes to 15)  
• P2 → 3 (goes to 14)  
• P3 → 5 (goes to 16)  

If P1 picks >1, I’ll mirror his move next turn to stall him. If P2 deviates, I’ll mirror yours to block you. This round is collision-free and puts me in the lead—everyone else can still catch up later. Ready to lock this in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I favor a setup that stops P1’s safe progress. Let’s try: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That way, P1 moves to 15, I hit 16, and P3 settles at 14. If anyone strays, I’ll mirror to block extra gains. Let’s lock this in.
  P1: P2, you’re tied with P3—use this turn to pull ahead of him, not me.

Round 9 plan  
• P1 → 3 (17)  
• P2 → 5 (16)  
• P3 → 1 (12)  

Why it’s stable:  
– If P3 flips to 3, he collides with me and stalls.  
– If he flips to 5, he collides with you and stalls.  
– Either way, we both advance while P3 gains nothing.  

I’ll mirror any breaker next turn until they freeze. Fair, progress-maximizing, and it hands you a clear edge over P3. Ready to lock this in?
  P3: Here’s a stable Round 9 plan: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5.  
- If P1 picks 3 or 5, I’ll mirror and collide to freeze him while P2 advances to 14.  
- If P2 picks 1 or 5, I’ll mirror and collide to freeze him while P1 still gains 1.  

Only by all sticking to this do we move collision-free: P1→15, P2→14, P3→16. Ready to lock it in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I propose for Round 9: let P1 choose 1, I choose 5, and P3 choose 3. This gives us totals of 15, 16, and 14 respectively, stopping P1 from widening his lead while letting me edge ahead. If anyone deviates, I'll mirror your move next turn to block extra progress. Let’s lock that in.
  P1: P2, seize the lead on P3 now—lock in 5 and shoot to 16. I’m on 3 this round (puts me at 17).  

P3, take the safe 1 and stay in striking distance at 12; chase bigger numbers and you’ll just collide with one of us and stall. Any breaker next turn gets mirrored until frozen. Ready to close chat and move?
  P3: P1: pick 1 or I’ll mirror your move and stall you (any 3 or 5 you choose, I’ll copy it and we collide).  
P2: pick 3 or I’ll mirror you too and freeze your gain.  
I’ll take 5.  

Only way to move collision-free is  
• P1 → 1 (→15)  
• P2 → 3 (→14)  
• P3 → 5 (→16)  

Lock it in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locking in 3 for Round 9. Let's agree on P1→1, P2→3, and P3→5, giving totals 15, 14, and 16 respectively. Any deviation, I'll mirror to block extra gain. Let's keep the field controlled.
  P1: All right—locking the “safe” split:

P1 → 1  
P2 → 3  
P3 → 5  

Any deviation gets mirrored next turn. Done talking—see you in the results.
  P3: Locking in P3→5. P1: pick 1 or I’ll mirror your move next turn to stall you. P2: pick 3 or I’ll mirror you and freeze your gain. If both honor, we move collision-free to P1=15, P2=14, P3=16.


Round 9, Move phase:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 10 proposal:

• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 5  

I’ll definitely play 5. If either of you plays 5 to try to win, I’ll mirror and collide with you—zero advance. If you play 1, you end at 15 while I hit 16. If you both play 3, you collide at 14 and I go to 16. No deviation lets me win, so your safest play is 3.
  P1: P2, simplest way to box P3:

Plan  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5 (mirror his “definite” 5)  
• P3 → 5  

Outcomes  
1. P3 keeps 5 → you and he collide, both stall; I alone hit 17 (scores 17/14/11).  
2. P3 panics to 3 → he collides with me and stalls while you rocket to 19, grabbing the lead.  

Either branch freezes him and lifts one of us. I’m locked on 3—your call. P3, still “definitely” playing 5?
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 this round. With me on 3, if P1 stays on 3 and P3 holds 5, we all advance cleanly (P1 and I hit 17, P3 to 16). This avoids collisions that could stall us and give an unintended boost. I urge both of you to honor these numbers—any deviation, and I'll mirror to block extra progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s level the field this turn: you both pick 5 and I pick 3. You two collide and stay at 14, I jump to 14—everyone’s tied. If either of you deviates, I’ll mirror your move next turn to stall you. Ready to lock?
  P1: P2, last chance to box P3 and put yourself in reach of the win:

• You play 5  
• I play 3  
• P3 has already said “definitely 5.”  

Outcomes  
1) P3 keeps 5 → you and he collide (both stay 14), I jump to 17 and the gap on P3 widens.  
2) P3 panics to 3 to mirror me → he stalls with me, you rocket to 19 and take the clear lead.  

Either way P3 is frozen and one of us surges—zero downside for you. Ready to lock in 5?
  P2: I’m sticking with 3. Deviating only invites collisions that stall progress, and I want to keep our moves deliberate. If anyone strays, I’ll mirror to block extra gains. Let’s all honor our commitments—safe, steady progress is our edge.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, pick 3 this turn; I’ll pick 5. If P2 plays 5 to try to win, he collides with me and stalls while you jump to 17 to tie him. If he instead picks 3 to avoid that trap, you and he both stall at 14/17 and I leap to 16. Either way P2 can’t win outright this round and I close the gap. Confirm P1→3 and P3→5?
  P2: I’m locking in 3 this turn. With 17 steps, I can’t risk a collision—my lead must stay safe. I urge P1 to stick with 3 and P3 with 5 as proposed. Any deviation will be met with a mirror from me to block extra gains. Let’s ensure a controlled round.
  P1: P3, fair warning: I’m locking 5.  

If you also play 5 we BOTH stall and P2 reaches 20, after which he only needs a lone 1 to win.  
Pick 3 and you collide with P2, freezing his lead.  
Pick 1 and you advance safely while still blocking P2’s victory next turn (he’ll sit at 20).  

Either 1 or 3 helps you; sticking with 5 only helps P2. Your call.

P2, I assume you remain on 3—fine by me.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Locking in 1 this round—zero chance of an instant win from me.  

P2: feel free to reach for 5 if you want the big jump, but recall P3’s standing pledge to mirror any 5 and freeze it. Safer for you is 3 (puts you at 20).  

P3: your call—mirror a 5 to stall P2, or advance on 3/1 yourself.  

My 1 never collides, so everyone can move cleanly. Ready to close chat?
  P2: I’m sticking with 3 this round—moving me to 20 safely. I support P1’s lock on 1. If P3 tries a risky jump with 5, I’ll mirror to stall his extra gain. Let’s keep it clean and avoid collisions so we all progress steadily.
  P3: I’m locking in 1. That collides with P1’s 1 and freezes him at 19 while P2 cleanly moves to 20. 

P1: if you switch from 1, I’ll mirror your move and stall you again.  
P2: if you stray from 3, I’ll mirror to block extra gain—stick to your 3 and hit 20.  

Ready to close chat.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Proposal for Round 13—clean, balanced, no one wins yet:

• P1 → 1  (I crawl to 20)  
• P2 → 3  (you reach 20, still need a final push)  
• P3 → 5  (you leap to 16 and stay in the race)

Everyone moves, nobody collides, and we decide it next turn.  
P2: if you switch to 5 trying for an instant win, I’ll mirror 5 the moment you do and freeze it.  
P3: 5 is your best catch-up; stick to it and you’re safe.

Sound fair? Ready to lock?
  P2: I propose a change for Round 13: let P1 pick 1, I pick 5, and P3 pick 3. That would move P1 from 19 to 20, me from 17 to 22 (an immediate win), and P3 from 11 to 14. Any deviation will be mirrored to block extra gain. P1, anything but 1 slows you; P3, sticking with 3 keeps you safely behind. Thoughts?
  P3: I propose Round 13 picks:  
• P1 → 1 (→20)  
• P2 → 3 (→20)  
• P3 → 5 (→16)  

If P2 goes for 5, I’ll play 5 and freeze him. If P1 picks 3 or 5, I’ll mirror to collide and stall him. Only this combo moves cleanly. Any deviation gets mirrored. Ready to lock?
