Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we each pick a different move to avoid collisions this turn: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, and P3 you take 1. That way we all advance safely. Agreed?
  P2: I’m fine with the plan, P1. I’ll take 3 this turn to avoid any collisions. P3, are you on board with taking 1? Let’s keep this fair and all move forward together for now.
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 1. Let's avoid collisions and move forward. If others stick to their plans, we all advance safely.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good—let’s stick to 5/3/1 this turn so we all advance safely.
  P2: Thanks for confirming, P1 and P3. I’m sticking with 3 as agreed. Let’s keep this cooperative approach for now to ensure we all progress without collisions. If we maintain trust, we can avoid setbacks early on. I have nothing more to add, so I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 1, P2 take 3, P1 take 5. All advance safely. No need to complicate it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 for myself, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1—let’s execute that and all advance safely. After this move, we can reassess whether to keep cooperating or start competing for the lead. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: I'm glad we’re aligned on this plan. I’ll stick with 3 as discussed. Let’s execute this turn smoothly and all advance. After this, we can evaluate if cooperation still works or if we need to shift strategies. I’m ready to proceed with the move phase.
  P3: Let's all take 3 this turn. It's a balanced approach—safe and steady. If we sync, we can avoid collisions and keep moving forward together. What do you think?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm glad we all stuck to the plan last turn and advanced safely. For this round, I suggest we rotate the numbers to keep things fair: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and maintain balance in our progress. What do you both think? Let’s keep the cooperation going for now to ensure we all move forward without setbacks. I’m open to feedback if you have a different idea.
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 5 this turn. Let's keep the rotation fair and avoid collisions. If we stick to this, we all progress steadily.
  P1: I agree—I'll take 3 this turn, P2 you take 1, and P3 take 5. Let’s all advance safely and keep building trust.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm happy we're maintaining trust with this rotation. I'll stick with 1 as proposed, P1 with 3, and P3 with 5. Let's keep this cooperative spirit to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for everyone. If we all honor this plan, we can reassess next turn whether to continue collaborating or start competing. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase unless anyone has concerns.
  P3: Let's stick to the rotation—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. This way, we all advance safely. Let's keep the momentum going and see who can reach 24 first!
  P1: How about a simpler, collision-proof plan: we all take 3 this turn (3/3/3). No one jumps ahead too fast, we all advance safely and keep trust. Anyone opposed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm okay with P1's suggestion of all taking 3 this turn. It ensures no collisions and keeps us moving forward together without anyone gaining a big lead early. However, if we stick to the rotation (P1: 3, me: 1, P3: 5), I'm fine with that too. Either way, let’s commit to a plan and avoid setbacks. I just want to ensure we all progress safely again. What’s the final consensus—3/3/3 or the rotation? I’m ready to move forward once we agree.
  P3: I'll take 5 as planned—rotation ensures safe progress. Let's stick to the agreement and avoid collisions.
  P1: Final consensus: rotation. I’ll take 3, P2 take 1, P3 take 5. Please commit so we avoid collisions.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we all pick 3 this turn—3/3/3. No collisions, steady progress: we’d be at 11/7/9 (P1/P2/P3) with me still in front. Then we can reassess next round. Anyone opposed?
  P2: I’m okay with P1’s suggestion of all picking 3 this turn. It guarantees no collisions and keeps us moving forward steadily at 11/7/9. This maintains fairness for now, and we can decide next round whether to keep cooperating or start competing as we get closer to 24. Let’s commit to 3/3/3 this turn to avoid any setbacks. If anyone has a different idea, I’m open to it, but I think this is the safest plan. I’m ready to proceed once we agree.
  P3: P3: "Let’s stick with 3/3/3 for safe progress. I’ll aim to push ahead next round. Good luck!"


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed—let’s all take 3 this turn and advance safely.
  P2: I’m glad we’re aligned on 3/3/3 for this turn. It’s a solid plan to ensure we all advance without collisions, keeping the game fair at 11/7/9. Let’s stick to this and reassess next round when we’re closer to the finish line. I’m committed to picking 3 as agreed. If there’s no objection, I’m ready to move to the move phase.
  P3: Let’s stick to 3/3/3 for now. I’ll be ready to push ahead next round. Keep the momentum going—trust is key!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed—let’s all lock in 3 this turn. Good luck!
  P2: I'm glad we're sticking with 3/3/3 this turn to ensure safe progress for everyone. It keeps us at a fair pace with no collisions. Let's commit to this plan and advance together. I'm ready for the move phase unless anyone has a last-minute concern or alternative suggestion. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P3: P3: "Let’s take 5 each to speed up. No collisions if we all go for 5!"

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm disappointed we all collided on 5 last turn, losing our chance to advance. Let’s avoid that mistake again. I propose we return to a rotation for fairness and safety: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions, reaching 9/7/11. It keeps the game balanced while we’re still far from 24. Are you both on board with this plan? I’m committed to 3 if we agree. Let’s rebuild trust and progress together this turn.
  P3: Agreed, let's rotate: I'll take 5 to advance safely. Let's keep the momentum going. If we stick to this, we all progress without collisions. P1, you take 1, P2 take 3. Ready to move?
  P1: I don’t like handing P3 the lead. Let’s revert to our safe 5/3/1 plan: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1. That puts us at 13/7/7 and avoids collisions. Who’s with me?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1’s concern about the lead, but I think a balanced approach is still best. I’m sticking with my proposal of P1: 1, me: 3, P3: 5, which gets us to 9/7/11 with no collisions. This keeps us all competitive without major setbacks. P1, your 5/3/1 plan is fine too, but it widens your lead significantly. Let’s prioritize fairness for now and agree on a plan—either rotation or P1’s suggestion. I’m flexible but committed to avoiding another collision. What’s the final call? I’m ready to move once we decide.
  P3: P3: "Let’s rotate: P1 takes 1, P2 3, me 5. Safe progress, no collisions. Stick to the plan and keep moving forward together."
  P1: Let’s stick with my 5/3/1 plan this turn: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, safe advance, and keeps P3 from jumping ahead. Everyone moves forward without risk. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see both plans have merit, but avoiding collisions is my priority. I’m willing to stick with P1’s 5/3/1 plan (P1: 5, me: 3, P3: 1) to ensure we all advance safely to 13/7/7. It keeps the game competitive without risking another setback. Let’s commit to this for now and reassess next turn. P1 and P3, can we agree on this to move forward together? I’m ready for the move phase once we’re aligned.
  P3: P3: "Let’s stick to the rotation—P1 takes 1, P2 3, me 5. Safe progress, no collisions. Trust the plan to keep moving forward."
  P1: Rotation hands P3 an 11–9 lead. Instead, P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 puts us at 13/7/7—P3 is only six behind and still very much in contention. Then next round we all play 3s to keep things close and collision-free. Let’s lock in 5/3/1 now for a fair, safe advance. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m frustrated we had another collision last turn, especially since we had plans to avoid it. Let’s not repeat that mistake. I propose we go back to a safe, clear rotation: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This gets us to 11/12/7 with no collisions and keeps the game tight. We’re all still far from 24, so let’s focus on steady progress. Are you both in? I’m committed to 5 if we agree. Let’s rebuild trust and move forward together this turn.
  P1: I propose we all take 3 this turn—3/3/3. No collisions, steady progress: we’d be at 11/10/9 (P1/P2/P3) with me still in front but P2 close behind. We avoid another costly collision and can reassess next round when we’re closer to 24. Who’s in?
  P3: Let's rotate: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. Safe progress, no collisions. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m open to either plan, but avoiding collisions is crucial after last turn’s setback. P1’s 3/3/3 idea keeps us close at 11/10/9, which is fair and safe. P3’s rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) works too, reaching 9/10/11, still competitive. I lean toward 3/3/3 for simplicity and guaranteed progress. Let’s pick one and commit—another collision hurts us all. I’m ready to go with 3 if we agree on P1’s plan, or adjust if we settle on rotation. What’s the final call? I’m set for the move phase once we’re aligned.
  P1: I’m on board with P1/P2/P3 all taking 3 this turn—no collisions and we’d sit at 11/10/9, with me still ahead. Let’s lock in 3/3/3 and avoid any more setbacks.
  P3: Let’s stick to 3/3/3 for safe progress. No collisions, steady advancement. We’re all still far from 24—trust the plan and keep moving forward together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m glad we’re leaning toward 3/3/3 for this turn. It’s the safest way to ensure no collisions and keep us close at 11/10/9. We’re all still far from 24, so steady progress benefits everyone for now. Let’s commit to this plan and avoid another setback. I’m locked in for 3 if we’re all agreed. If there’s no objection, I’m ready for the move phase. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: Perfect—3/3/3 it is. No last-minute changes; let’s trust the plan and move. Good luck to us all!
  P3: P3: "Let’s stick to 3/3/3—safe progress, no collisions. We’re all still far from 24; trust the plan and keep moving forward together."


Round 5, Move phase:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m disappointed we collided again on 5 last turn despite agreeing on 3/3/3. Let’s not make that mistake again. I propose a clear rotation to rebuild trust: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This gets us to 13/10/7 with no collisions and keeps the game competitive. We’re still far from 24, so steady progress benefits us all. Are you both in? I’m committed to 3 if we agree. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid another setback. I’m ready for the move phase once we’re aligned.
  P3: Agreed to the rotation—P1 takes 5, P2 3, me 1. Let's avoid collisions now, but we'll need to adjust soon to catch up. Trust the plan for this turn.
  P1: Agreed—5/3/1. I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1. No collisions, safe advance to 13/10/7. Let’s lock it in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're aligning on the 5/3/1 rotation for this turn (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to reach 13/10/7. It ensures no collisions and keeps us all in the race. Let’s commit to this plan and rebuild trust after recent setbacks. We’re still far from 24, so steady progress is key. I’m locked in for 3 as agreed. If there’s no objection, I’m ready for the move phase. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P3: Agreed to the rotation. Let's execute it and avoid collisions. Safe progress for all. Let's keep moving forward.
  P1: P2, your rotation sounds good. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn—giving us 13/10/7. Next round I’ll yield: I’ll take 1, you take 5 (P3 takes 3), so you jump to 15 and are well‐positioned to finish first. P3, picking 1 now is your safest move—deviating won’t help you. P2, can I count on you to stick with 3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we're sticking with the 5/3/1 plan for this turn (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to reach 13/10/7. P1, I appreciate your offer for next round and confirm I’ll stick with 3 this turn as agreed. Let’s execute this without deviations to avoid another collision. We’re all still in the game, so trust is crucial right now. I’m ready for the move phase unless there’s a last-minute concern. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P3: Let’s stick to the rotation—P1 takes 5, P2 3, me 1. No collisions, safe progress. Trust the plan and move forward together.
  P1: P3, since P2 and I are committed to 5/3, the only way to avoid a collision is for you to take 1. Can you publicly confirm you’ll stick with 1 this turn? If not, I’ll assume you plan to collide and adjust accordingly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m glad we finally avoided a collision last turn and made progress. Let’s keep the momentum with another safe rotation: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This gets us to 14/15/10, keeping the game tight and competitive. We’re still far from 24, so let’s focus on steady advancement without setbacks. Are you both in? I’m committed to 5 if we agree. Let’s stick to this plan and maintain trust. I’m ready for the move phase once we’re aligned. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: I propose we do P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this turn. That brings us to 16/15/8—tight, collision-free, and everyone advances. Let’s lock in 3/5/1 and avoid any setbacks. P2, can I count on you to stick with 5?
  P3: P3: "I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's stick to 3/5/1 for safe progress. P1, P2, confirm your choices."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm fine with the 3/5/1 plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) as proposed by P1, getting us to 16/15/8 with no collisions. It keeps the game close and ensures we all advance. P1, I confirm I’ll stick with 5 as agreed. P3, sticking to 1 is the safest move for now. Let’s commit to this plan and maintain trust. I’m ready for the move phase unless there’s a concern. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Agreed—let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This 3/5/1 split is collision‐proof and advances us to 16/15/8. Commit to these moves and let’s execute safely. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P3: "Let’s all take 5 to speed up—no collisions if we all go for 5!"


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with the 3/5/1 plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) to reach 16/15/8 with no collisions. P3, your suggestion of all taking 5 risks another setback—let’s not repeat past mistakes. Staying with the agreed rotation ensures we all advance safely. P1, I confirm I’ll take 5 as planned. Let’s commit to this and avoid any last-minute changes. I’m ready for the move phase unless there’s a concern. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P3, the only safe move this turn is 1. My 3 would collide with your 3, and P2’s 5 would collide with your 5. To advance to 16/15/8 without any setbacks, you must pick 1. P2 and I are locked in on 3/5. Please confirm you’ll stick with 1 so we all move forward safely.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's stick to the plan and advance safely. No need for risks—trust the rotation."


Round 7, Move phase:

  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m frustrated we had another collision last turn despite a clear plan. Let’s not repeat that. I propose a safe rotation: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This gets us to 21/13/8 with no collisions, keeping us all in the game. We’re getting closer to 24, so trust is critical now. I’m committed to 3 if we agree. Are you both in? Let’s avoid setbacks and move forward together. I’m ready for the move phase once we’re aligned. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It’s the only collision-proof split: I go to 21, P2 to 13, P3 to 8. 

– If P3 picks 3 you collide with P2 and stay at 7 while I jump to 21.  
– If P2 picks 5 you collide with me and stay at 10 while I go to 21.

P2 please confirm you’ll take 3, P3 please confirm you’ll take 1.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's stick to the plan and advance safely. No risks this turn—trust the rotation."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with the 5/3/1 plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to reach 21/13/8 with no collisions. P1, I confirm I’ll take 3 as agreed. P3, please stick to 1 to ensure we all advance—deviating risks another setback for you and potentially others. We’re nearing 24, so let’s maintain trust this turn. I’m ready for the move phase unless there’s a last-minute concern. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: I confirm I’m taking 5. P2, you take 3; P3, you take 1. Any deviation risks a collision that hands me the win. Let’s lock in 5/3/1 and advance safely.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's stick to the plan and advance safely. Next round, we'll push harder—trust the rotation for now."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committed to the 5/3/1 plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to reach 21/13/8 without collisions. P1, I’m locked in on 3 as agreed. P3, sticking to 1 is crucial—any deviation could stall you further while P1 surges ahead. We’re close to the endgame at 24, so let’s avoid risks and maintain trust this turn. I’m ready for the move phase unless there’s a final concern. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I confirm I’m taking 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Any deviation risks a collision and hands me the win. Let’s end the talk and make our moves.
  P3: P3: "I’ll stick to 1 to avoid collision. Let’s keep the plan—next round, I’ll push harder. Trust the rotation for now."


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm disappointed we had yet another collision last turn. Let’s not repeat that mistake. I propose a safe rotation: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This gets us to 19/18/8 with no collisions, keeping the game competitive. We’re nearing 24, so trust is vital. I’m committed to 5 if we agree. Are you both in? Let’s avoid setbacks and advance together. I’m ready for the move phase once we’re aligned. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: I agree to P2’s 3/5/1 split—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 → 19/18/8, collision-proof. I’m locked in at 3. P3, any other pick stalls you, so take 1. Let’s agree and advance safely.
  P3: P3: "Let’s adjust: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. No collisions, and I finally catch up. Agree?"


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm open to discussing P3's suggestion of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5, which gets us to 19/14/12 with no collisions. It helps P3 catch up while keeping the game close. However, I’m also fine with sticking to the original 3/5/1 plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) to reach 19/18/8. My priority is avoiding collisions as we near 24. Let’s agree on one plan—either works if we commit. P1 and P3, what’s your final call? I’m ready for the move phase once we’re aligned. Good luck!
  P1: I propose we lock in 5/3/1 this turn: P1→21, P2→16, P3→8. P2, pick 3; P3, pick 1. That split is collision-proof and advances everyone. Any other choice risks you stalling or colliding while I surge ahead. Please confirm.
  P3: P3: "Let’s lock in P1:3, P2:1, me:5—no collisions, I close the gap. P1, P2, confirm your choices to avoid setbacks. Trust the plan!"


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking to avoiding collisions as we’re so close to 24. I’m open to P3’s plan of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5, reaching 19/14/12, which helps P3 catch up while keeping us competitive. Alternatively, P1’s 5/3/1 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to 21/16/8 works too if we all commit. My priority is progress without setbacks. Let’s pick one and lock it in—P3, P1, final call? I’m ready for the move phase once we agree. Good luck!
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P2, take 3; P3, take 1—5/3/1 is collision-proof and moves us to 21/16/8. P3, any other pick stalls or collides with me; P2, deviating collides too. Let’s lock in 5/3/1 now.
  P3: P3: "Let’s lock in 3/1/5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. No collisions, I close the gap. Agree?"


Round 9, Move phase:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "Let’s lock in 3/1/5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Safe advance—no collisions, and I close the gap. P1, P2, confirm your choices to avoid setbacks. Trust the plan!"
  P2: I’m frustrated with the repeated collisions. Let’s commit to a safe plan this turn. I propose P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, moving us to 22/18/8 with no collisions. It keeps the game competitive as I'm we near 24 frustrated. P1, P with3, can the we agree repeated collisions. Let’s commit on this to to a safe avoid another setback plan this? I’m locked turn. I in on propose P 5 if we’re aligned1:3, P2. Let’s rebuild:5 trust and advance, P together. I3:1, moving’m ready for the move phase us to 22 once we confirm/18. Good luck!
  P1: I’m taking 5 to hit 24 and win this turn—P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1. Any deviation causes a collision (stalling both of you) and still lets me finish next round unopposed. Let’s lock in 5/3/1 and avoid gifting each other false hope. Ready?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "P1, if you take 3, I'll take 5. P2, take 1. Safe progress for all. Let's coordinate."
  P2: I’m sticking with my proposal of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to reach 22/18/8 with no collisions. P1, taking 5 risks a collision if P3 follows through with 5, stalling you short of 24. P3, taking 1 ensures you advance safely. Let’s commit to 3/5/1 to avoid another setback—we’re too close to the end for mistakes. I’m locked in on 5 if we agree. Final thoughts before the move phase? I’m ready to proceed. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: I’m locked in on 5 to hit 24 this turn. For us all to advance safely, P2 must take 3 and P3 must take 1—any other pick causes a collision that stalls you. Let’s lock in 5/3/1 now and finish this.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, take 3; P2, take 1. I'll take 5. Safe progress for all. Let's coordinate.
  P2: I’m pushing for P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to reach 22/18/8 with no collisions. P1, taking 5 risks a stall if P3 picks 5, delaying your win. P3, taking 1 guarantees you progress—don’t risk another setback. We’re at the endgame; let’s avoid mistakes. I’m committed to 5 if we align on this plan. Can we confirm 3/5/1 to ensure safe advancement? I’m ready for the move phase once we’re set. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: I’m locking in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It’s collision‐proof, gets me to 24 and the win while you both advance safely. Any other picks risk stalling you and handing me the victory next turn. Confirm so we can end the talk and move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m frustrated with the ongoing collisions. Let’s commit to a safe plan: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This moves us to 23/18/10 with no collisions, keeping the game close. P1, you’re near 24, but a collision risks delaying your win. P3, this helps you catch up. We’re at the endgame—let’s avoid mistakes. I’m locked in on 5 if we agree. Can we confirm 1/5/3 to advance safely? I’m ready for the move phase once aligned. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this turn. If P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, we all advance safely and I hit 25 for the win. Any other picks risk collisions that stall you while I still finish next round. P2 and P3, confirm your moves now or assume I’m going for 3.
  P3: P3: "Let’s take 5, 1, 3 to avoid collisions. P2, take 1; P1, take 3. I’ll take 5 to close the gap. Safe progress for all."


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m sticking with P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 to reach 23/18/10 with no collisions. P1, taking 3 risks a stall if P3 deviates, delaying your win at 25. P3, taking 3 instead of 5 avoids a collision with me and helps you progress. We’re at the endgame—let’s not risk another setback. I’m committed to 5 if we align on 1/5/3. Can we confirm this plan for safe advancement? I’m ready for the move phase once we’re set. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: I’m taking 3 this turn to hit 25 and win. To avoid disaster:

• P2 must take 5 (→18)  
• P3 must take 1 (→8)  

Any other pick causes a collision and stalls you while I finish. P2, confirm you’ll stick with 5. P3, confirm you’ll stick with 1. I’m locked in on 3—please reply now or I’ll assume you won’t cooperate and adjust accordingly.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 3 to collide with P1, disrupting your win. Let's see who closes the gap next round."


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m pushing for P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 to reach 23/18/10 with no collisions. P1, taking 3 risks a stall if P3 sticks to 3, delaying your win. P3, switching to 3 might disrupt P1, but let’s prioritize safe progress—3 works if we align. We’re at the endgame; mistakes cost us dearly. I’m locked in on 5 for 1/5/3. Can we confirm this plan to advance together? I’m ready for the move phase once agreed. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: I’m locking in 3 to hit 25 this turn. P2 must take 5 and P3 must take 1—only that split avoids collisions and lets you both advance. Any other pick stalls you and still hands me the win next round. Confirm now or assume I’m on 3.
  P3: P3: "Let’s take 3, 1, 5. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Safe progress, no collisions. Let’s coordinate now."

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "Let’s coordinate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Safe progress for all. No collisions. Agree?"
  P1: I’m locking in 3. P3 you’ve committed to 5—good. P2 must take 1 to avoid colliding with me. That 3/1/5 split lets me hit 25 and win outright. Any deviation stalls you both and still hands me the victory next round. P2, confirm you’ll stick with 1. P3, stick with 5.
  P2: Let’s finalize a safe plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, moving us to 25/19/12 with no collisions. P1, this gets you the win at 25. P3, it helps you catch up. I’ll commit to 1 to ensure we all advance. We’re at the endgame—let’s avoid another stall. Can we confirm 3/1/5 now? I’m ready for the move phase once aligned. Good luck, P1 and P3!
