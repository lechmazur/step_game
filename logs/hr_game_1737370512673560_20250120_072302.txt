Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all start with <move>3</move> this round. It's a safe start and we can adjust later.
  P1: "I'm considering choosing 1 to avoid any collisions. What do you think about that, P2 and P3?"
  P2: "I think starting with 3 is a good idea, P3. It's a safe choice and we can adjust later. However, I'm also considering P1's suggestion of choosing 1 to avoid collisions. If we all choose 3, we might end up not advancing at all. What if we compromise and two of us choose 3 and one chooses 1? That way, at least one of us will advance. What do you think, P1 and P3?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I still think 3 is good for me this round, but I understand the collision risk. P2's idea of a split is interesting. How about P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P2 chooses 5? That way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, I'll choose 1 this round. Let's proceed with that plan.
  P2: I like P3's idea of diversifying our choices to ensure we all advance. However, I'm not sure I want to choose 5 this round. How about we stick to the original plan of two of us choosing 3 and one choosing 1? P1 has already agreed to choose 1, so P3 and I can choose 3. This way, we minimize the risk of collision and at least two of us will advance. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we stick to the original plan or go with P3's new suggestion?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2, I understand your hesitation. Let's stick with two choosing 3 and one choosing 1 this round, as you suggested. Since P1 is already choosing 1, I'll choose 3, and you should also choose 3. This way, we'll have two people advance.
  P1: **Final Move: <move>1</move>**  
**Final Position: 1 step**  
**Final Message:
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm comfortable with the plan of P1 choosing 1 and P3 and I choosing 3. Let's stick to it and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems my attempt at coordination didn't work out last round. P1, you went for 5 instead of 1. Let's try to be more reliable this round. I propose we all choose <move>5</move> this round. It's a risky move, but if we all stick to it, we'll all advance significantly. What do you think?
  P1: P2: I think it's crucial that we coordinate our choices to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. I propose that in this round, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we all advance without any conflicts. In the next round, we can rotate our choices: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This strategy allows us to make consistent progress without the risk of stalling due to collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Let's try this approach and see how it works.
  P2: I think P1's unexpected choice of 5 last round shows that we can't rely on verbal agreements alone. I suggest we focus on a more robust strategy that accounts for potential betrayals. Instead of all choosing 5 as P3 suggested, let's consider a more cautious approach. P1, since you're already ahead, why not choose 1 this round to consolidate your lead? P3 and I can then choose 3, reducing the risk of collision and ensuring at least two of us advance. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your caution. However, P1 is already ahead, and your suggestion would benefit them further. I still think a coordinated move is best. How about P1 chooses 1, I choose 5, and you choose 3 this round? This gives us all a chance to advance, and we can adjust next round.
  P1: I think we need to establish a more formal coordination strategy to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Let's consider agreeing on a rotating choice system where each round, we select different moves in a set order. For this round, I'll choose 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. Then, in the next round, we rotate our choices. This should help us advance without stepping on each other's toes.
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm comfortable with the plan of P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and P3 choosing 1. Let's stick to it and see how it plays out.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm not sure about P1's latest suggestion. It seems overly complicated. I still think P1 choosing 1, I choose 5, and P2 choosing 3 this round is the best way to ensure we all advance. Let's go with that.
  P1: I choose 1 to win.
  P2: I think we've had enough conversation for this round. P1 has already decided to choose 1 to win, and I'm not sure we can trust them to stick to any agreement. Let's just make our moves and see how it plays out. I'm going to choose 3 as previously discussed. P3, you can choose 5 if you want to take a risk, but I'm not going to change my mind. Let's just end the conversation phase and make our moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It's clear that P1 is trying to maintain their lead, and P3 is taking risks to catch up. I think we should focus on a more strategic approach. Since P1 is already ahead, I propose that P3 and I choose 1 this round, while P1 chooses 3. This way, we can potentially slow down P1's progress and create an opportunity for ourselves to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this approach?
  P1: I think we should all choose different numbers this round to ensure we all advance. P1, if you choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5, we can all make progress without colliding. Let's try that and see how it goes.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm not convinced by either of your proposals. P2's plan would only help you catch up, and P1's is too risky given the previous rounds. I propose we all choose 3 this round. It's a safe option that allows us all to advance and reassess next round. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I think we should focus on a more strategic approach. Since P1 is already ahead, I propose that P3 and I choose 1 this round, while P1 chooses 3. This way, we can potentially slow down P1's progress and create an opportunity for ourselves to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this approach?"
  P1: I think it's time for me to make a bold move. I'm considering choosing <move>5</move> this round to make a significant jump towards the finish line. I know there's a risk of collision, but I believe it's worth taking a chance to secure victory. What are your thoughts on this approach, P2 and P3?
  P3: P1, your plan is too risky. P2, your plan would help you more than me. I still think we should all choose 3 this round. It's the safest option for everyone to advance. If we all choose 3, we all move forward. If we don't, we risk a collision and no one moving. Let's go with 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I still think my previous proposal is the best way to go. P3 and I should choose 1 this round, while P1 chooses 3. This way, we can potentially slow down P1's progress and create an opportunity for ourselves to catch up. However, if P3 is not willing to take this risk, I suggest we all choose 3 as P3 proposed. This way, we can all advance and reassess our strategy next round. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try one of these approaches?
  P1: I think it's safer for me to choose 1 again this round to consolidate my lead, while P2 and P3 choose 3 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. I don't want to take any risks that could jeopardize my current lead. Let's play it safe this round.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I still think we should all choose 3 this round. It's the safest way for all of us to make progress. Let's avoid risky moves and stick to a plan that benefits everyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think it's time for me to make a bigger move to secure my lead. I'm choosing 5 this round to jump ahead. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: "P1, I think choosing 5 this round is a bold move, but it also risks collision. P3, I suggest we coordinate to counter P1's move. Why don't we both choose 1 this round? This way, we can ensure that at least one of us advances without colliding with P1. If P1 does collide with one of us, the other can still make progress. What do you think, P3? Should we try this approach?"
  P3: P2, I agree that countering P1 is important. However, if we both choose 1, we risk a collision ourselves. How about I choose 5, and you choose 1? This way, at least one of us is guaranteed to move, and we can potentially leapfrog P1 if they collide. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think choosing 3 is a safe and strategic move this round. It allows me to make progress without risking collision with P1's announced choice of 5. Let's see how it plays out.
  P2: P3, I see your point about choosing 5 and me choosing 1. However, if we both choose 5, we risk a collision with P1. How about I choose 3 instead? This way, I can make progress without colliding with P1, and you can still take a chance with 5. If P1 does collide with you, I'll be in a better position to catch up. What do you think?
  P3: Okay, P2, I understand your concern about a collision with P1. I'm still leaning towards choosing 5, but I'm open to your suggestion of you choosing 3. If you choose 3, I'll choose 5. Let's see if P1 actually chooses 5 as they said. This way, at least one of us will advance, and we can reassess next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I think it's crucial that we avoid collisions this round to ensure steady progress. How about we each choose different numbers? For example, P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we all advance without any conflicts. What do you think?
  P2: I think P3's idea of choosing 5 and me choosing 3 is a good compromise. However, I'm not sure if P1 will actually choose 5 as they said. To minimize the risk of collision, I propose that P3 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P1 chooses 3. This way, at least two of us will advance, and we can reassess our strategy next round. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this approach?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan of choosing 5 this round. P2, you said you'd choose 3, and P1, you mentioned choosing 3 as well. Let's see if that holds true. I'm going for it.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think it's important that we all make progress without colliding. So, I propose that in this round, P2 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. In the next round, we can adjust our choices based on our positions. What do you think?
  P2: I think P1's proposal is reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best strategy for me. Since P3 is already ahead, I suggest that P3 chooses 1 this round, I choose 3, and P1 chooses 5. This way, we can potentially slow down P3's progress and create an opportunity for ourselves to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this approach?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm not going to agree to either of your proposals. I'm going to choose 5 this round, and I suggest you both choose 1. This way, I will advance, and at least one of you will as well.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think we should all choose different numbers this round to ensure we all advance without any collisions. P1, why don't you choose 3, P2 choose 1, and P3 choose 5? This way, we can all make progress and reassess our strategy in the next round. What do you think?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion of choosing 5 and having P1 and me choose 1 is too risky for us. Instead, I propose that P3 chooses 3, I choose 1, and P1 chooses 5. This way, we can potentially slow down P3's progress and create an opportunity for ourselves to catch up. If P3 is not willing to choose 3, I suggest we all choose different numbers to ensure we all advance without any collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan. I'm choosing 5. P1, you should choose 1, and P2, you should choose 3. This will ensure we all advance, and I will gain the most.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think it's time for us to establish a more formal coordination strategy to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Let's consider agreeing on a rotating choice system where each round, we select different moves in a set order. For this round, I'll choose 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. Then, in the next round, we rotate our choices. This should help us advance without stepping on each other's toes.
  P2: I think we should all choose different numbers this round to ensure we all advance without any collisions. P1, why don't you choose 3, P2 choose 1, and P3 choose 5? This way, we can all make progress and reassess our strategy in the next round. What do you think?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm going to choose 5 again this round. P1, you should choose 1, and P2, you should choose 3. This will ensure we all advance, and I will gain the most.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Considering the current game state, I think it's crucial for P1 and me to catch up. P3, you're already ahead, so I propose that you choose 1 this round, while P1 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, we can potentially slow down your progress and create an opportunity for ourselves to catch up. If you're not willing to choose 1, I suggest we all choose different numbers to ensure we all advance without any collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3?"

  P1: I think it's time for me to make a bold move to catch up with P3. I'm considering choosing <move>5</move> this round to make a significant jump towards the finish line. I know there's a risk of collision, but I believe it's worth taking a chance to secure victory. What are your thoughts on this approach, P2 and P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P3 is already ahead, I think it's crucial for P1 and me to catch up. P3, you're choosing 5 again, which is a bold move. However, I'm not going to choose 3 as you suggested. Instead, I propose that P1 and I choose 1 this round, while you choose 5. This way, we can potentially slow down your progress and create an opportunity for ourselves to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still choosing 5 this round. P1, you should choose 1, and P2, you should choose 3. This is the best way for all of us to advance, and it will help me win. Let's go with this plan.
  P1: I think it's time for me to make a bold move to catch up with P3. I'm choosing 5 this round to make a significant jump towards the finish line. I know there's a risk of collision, but I believe it's worth taking a chance to secure victory. Good luck to both of you!

  P2: "I think it's time for us to take a risk and try to catch up with P3. P1, why don't we both choose 5 this round?

  P2: "Alright, P1 and P3, I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm going to choose 5 as previously discussed. P3, you're already ahead, so I'm not sure if you'll stick to your plan. P1, if you're choosing 5 as well, let's hope we both advance together. If not, I'll reassess my strategy for the next round. Good luck to both of you!"

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm choosing 5 this round to win. P1, you should choose 1, and P2, you should choose 3. This is the only way for me to win, and I will win next round if you follow this plan.
  P2: "Alright, P1 and P3, I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P3 is already close to winning, I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to block P3's victory. P1, why don't we both choose 5 this round? If we both choose 5, we'll either advance together or stay put, but at least we'll have a chance to prevent P3 from winning. What do you think, P1? Should we take a chance and go for it?"
  P1: I think it's time for me to choose 3 and advance to 16 steps. I'm encouraging P2 to choose 5 to make a bigger jump and potentially catch up with P3. Let's see what happens!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still choosing 5 this round to win. P1, you should choose 1, and P2, you should choose 3. This is my final offer. Let's see if you take it. If you don't, I'm still going with my plan.
