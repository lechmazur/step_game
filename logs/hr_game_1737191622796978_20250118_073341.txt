Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looking forward to a strategic game! Let's see who reaches 16 steps first.
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and make this game interesting. What do you say, P1 and P3?
  P3: I agree coordination could be good, but we should be careful since only one can win. Maybe we can take turns with different numbers?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Sounds good! I'll start with <move>5</move> this turn. P2 and P3, you can choose <move>3</move> and <move>1</move> to avoid collisions.
  P2: I'll take <move>3</move> this turn as suggested. P3, if you go with <move>1</move>, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let's see how this strategy works out!
  P3: I don't fully trust this coordination since we're competitors, but I'll play along for now. I'll consider taking <move>1</move> as suggested.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Understood, P3. Let's proceed with <move>1</move> this turn as suggested, and continue building trust in our strategy.
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation, but let's give this coordination a try. If it works, we can all advance smoothly. If you're still unsure, we can reassess next round. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination attempt, but I need to play to win. I'll make my own choice in the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Understood, P3. I respect your decision to play competitively. I'll focus on making strategic moves to reach 16 first. Best of luck to everyone!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to build my lead. P2 and P3, choose your moves wisely!
  P2: P1, since you're planning to take <move>5</move> again, I'll consider <move>3</move> to avoid a collision with you. P3, if you're also thinking about <move>3</move>, maybe consider <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance. Let's keep the coordination going but stay flexible.
  P3: Since P1 and P2 collided with me last round, I don't trust the suggested coordination. I'll make my own strategic choice to win. Let's keep playing.

  P1: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to advance quickly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I don't trust any move suggestions since both of you have caused collisions with me before. I'll make my own strategic choice to catch up.
  P2: P1, I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round to avoid colliding with you. P3, since you're behind, consider <move>1</move> to catch up safely. Let's keep our coordination flexible but effective.

  P1: P1: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to build my lead. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:

  P2: P1, I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round to avoid colliding with your planned <move>5</move>. P3, since you're behind, consider <move>1</move> to catch up safely. Let's keep our coordination flexible but effective.
