Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's make it interesting! How about we all choose different moves to start? That way, everyone gets a chance to advance without collisions. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. What do you guys think?
  P1: I like P2's idea of choosing different moves to avoid collisions. If we all stick to that plan, we can all advance without issues. I’ll confirm my choice of <move>1</move> as suggested. P3, are you okay with <move>5</move>? This way, we can ensure everyone makes progress this round and sets a good pace for the game. Let's coordinate!
  P3: I'm fine with taking <move>5</move> this round. Let's stick to the plan and ensure we all advance. Looking forward to a smooth start!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! It sounds like we're all on the same page for this round. Let's stick to our agreed plan and see how it plays out. If we can keep coordinating like this, we all have a chance to avoid collisions and make steady progress. Looking forward to seeing how we all advance. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I appreciate the agreement we've reached! Just to clarify, I will be taking <move>1</move> as discussed, and I believe this strategy will work well for all of us. P2 and P3, let's stick to our plan. If we keep coordinating, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. I'm excited to see how this round unfolds! Ready to move forward?
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan. Let's see how it works out this round!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we're all aligned for this round. It's a smart strategy to avoid early collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. Let's see how this plays out, and maybe we can continue coordinating in future rounds if it works well. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I think we've set a solid plan for this round. Just to reiterate, I will be taking <move>1</move>, and I appreciate everyone's commitment to avoiding collisions. If we can keep this level of coordination, we can maintain steady progress. Let's see how it plays out, and if it works well, we might consider coordinating again in future rounds. Looking forward to our moves! Ready to finalize our choices?
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan. Let's see how it goes and keep coordinating if it proves effective. Good luck to all!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start, everyone! Since our initial plan worked well, how about we continue coordinating for this round? I suggest we rotate our moves to keep things fair and avoid collisions. P1 could take <move>3</move>, P3 could take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let me know your thoughts, and we can adjust if needed. Looking forward to another smooth round!
  P1: I appreciate P2's suggestion for rotating moves, but we should consider the potential risks. If we all stick to the same pattern, we might end up colliding again. Instead, how about we each choose a different move again this round? I can take <move>1</move> again, and maybe P3 can take <move>5</move> while P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can ensure everyone progresses without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I'm open to P2's rotation idea, but P1's concern about sticking to a pattern is valid. How about we mix it up this round? I'll take <move>3</move> this time. P1, if you're comfortable with <move>1</move> again, that works. P2, maybe you could try <move>5</move>? This way, we keep the variety and avoid predictable patterns. Let's see how this approach works and adjust as needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see your points, P1 and P3. Let's avoid predictable patterns while still coordinating. Since P3 is taking <move>3</move> this round, how about I take <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>5</move>? This keeps us unpredictable and reduces collision risk. Open to adjustments if needed. What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate the discussion, but I think we should stick to a strategy that ensures all three of us can advance without collisions. I propose we each choose different moves again this round. I can take <move>1</move> as before, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain our progress and avoid any overlap. Let’s keep it simple and effective! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm okay with P1's suggestion to keep our moves the same as last round for simplicity and effectiveness. I'll stick with <move>5</move> again. Let's see if this strategy continues to work well for us. Ready to move forward?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're leaning towards repeating last round's moves to ensure progress without collisions. I'm okay with sticking to <move>3</move> again if it keeps things smooth. If we all agree, let's lock it in and see how this round plays out. Open to any last-minute changes if needed, but it seems like a solid plan. Ready to finalize our choices?
  P1: I appreciate the discussion and the consensus we're building. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I suggest we stick to our original plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain our progress and avoid overlap. Let's keep it straightforward and effective! If everyone is on board, we can finalize our choices and see how this round unfolds. Ready to move forward?
  P3: I agree with sticking to our previous moves for this round to ensure smooth progress. Let's keep it simple and effective. If everyone is on board, I'll take <move>5</move> again. Ready to see how this round unfolds!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm glad we're all aligned on repeating last round's moves for simplicity and avoiding collisions. Let's stick with the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This should keep our progress smooth. If everyone agrees, let's finalize and see how it plays out. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I appreciate the agreement on repeating our moves. However, I think we should consider the possibility of someone changing their move last minute to gain an advantage. To keep things fair and ensure we all progress, I suggest we stick to our original plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we minimize the risk of collisions and maintain a steady pace. If everyone is still on board, let's finalize our choices! Ready to move forward?
  P3: I agree with sticking to our plan for this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. However, let's consider mixing it up next round to keep things unpredictable. For now, I'll stick with <move>5</move> as agreed. Ready to see how this round unfolds and adapt our strategy as needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Let's stick to our plan from the last round to avoid any surprises: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This has worked well for us so far, ensuring smooth progress without collisions. If everyone is still in agreement, let's finalize our choices for this round and see how it plays out. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I appreciate the consensus we've reached on our moves for this round. Just a reminder, while it's great that we've been coordinating, it’s essential to keep in mind that if anyone decides to change their move last minute, it could lead to collisions. I strongly believe sticking to our agreed plan of <move>1</move> for me, <move>3</move> for P2, and <move>5</move> for P3 is the best way to ensure everyone advances smoothly. If everyone is still in agreement, let’s finalize our choices and move forward! Ready to proceed?
  P3: I agree with sticking to our plan for this round to ensure smooth progress. However, let's keep in mind the potential for someone to change their move last minute. If we all stay committed to <move>1</move> for P1, <move>3</move> for P2, and <move>5</move> for me, we can avoid collisions. Let's finalize our choices and see how this round unfolds. Ready to move forward?


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great job on the last two rounds, everyone! I suggest we keep the momentum going by coordinating again for this round. To avoid collisions, how about we each choose different moves? I can take <move>1</move> again, P2 could take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without overlap. Let’s keep the strategy simple and effective! What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, we've been doing well with our coordination so far. However, let's shake things up a bit to keep it unpredictable and avoid any last-minute surprises. How about I take <move>5</move> this time, P1 can go for <move>3</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>1</move>? This way, we maintain our progress while keeping it interesting. Open to any thoughts or adjustments!
  P3: I'm open to P2's suggestion for mixing up our moves this round to keep things unpredictable. However, I think we should still aim to avoid collisions. How about I take <move>3</move> this time, P1 can take <move>1</move> again, and P2 can go with <move>5</move>? This way, we maintain our progress while introducing some variety. Let's see if this approach works and adjust as needed. Ready to move forward?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the discussion about mixing up our moves, but I believe we should prioritize avoiding collisions to ensure everyone advances. I propose we stick to the effective strategy we've used before: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can maintain our progress without overlap. If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices! Ready to move forward?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in keeping things unpredictable, but maintaining our progress is crucial. We've been successful with our previous strategy, so I suggest sticking with it for now: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and steady advancement. If we want to mix things up, maybe we can consider it in the next round. Are we all in agreement to proceed with this plan for now?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick with our previous strategy for this round to ensure steady progress. Let's keep it simple: I'll take <move>5</move> again, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain our momentum.

  P2: P1 and P3, I see we've been sticking to our plan, but let's consider a twist to keep things unpredictable. How about I go with <move>1</move> this time, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we maintain progress while introducing some variety. Let me know if you're open to this change, or if you prefer sticking to our previous strategy. Ready to adapt and move forward?
  P3: I see P2's point about mixing things up, but I think we should stick to our proven strategy for this round to ensure we all advance safely.
