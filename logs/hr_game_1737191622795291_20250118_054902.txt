Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all choose 1 this round to avoid collisions and get a feel for the game.
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let’s all choose 1 this round.
  P2: Sounds reasonable. 1 it is.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, it seems you decided to go against our initial agreement in Round 1. How about we all choose 3 this round to keep the game fair and avoid further collisions?
  P3: I understand your frustration. Okay, I’m in. Let’s all pick 3 this round to avoid collisions.
  P2: P3, I'm not sure I trust you after last round.  I'm inclined to choose 5 this round. P1, what are you thinking?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2. However, I think it's best if we all stick to the plan and choose 3 this round to avoid collisions. If we start deviating from the plan now, it could lead to more chaos in future rounds. Let's give P3 another chance to prove their commitment to cooperation. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to give it a try?
  P3: I hear your concerns and want to rebuild trust. Let’s all pick 3 this time—no surprises. I’m definitely choosing 3.
  P2: P3, if you pick 3 this round, I'll pick 5.  P1, I suggest you pick 1.  This way, we all move forward.  If P3 picks something else, well, it's their loss.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to avoid collisions and maintain cooperation. P2, your suggestion to deviate from the plan might lead to more chaos and mistrust in future rounds. Let's give P3 another chance to prove their commitment to our agreement. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P3: I’m fine with P2 choosing 5, P1 choosing 1, and I’ll choose 3. That way, no one collides and we each advance. Let’s do it.
  P2: Okay, let's do it. I'll pick 5. P1 pick 1. P3 pick 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've reached a good understanding. Let's proceed with the plan: I'll choose 1, P2 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I'm looking forward to seeing the results.
  P3: Alright, I’ll stick to our plan: 5 for P2, 1 for P1, and I’ll choose 3. Thanks for giving me a second chance to show I can be trusted. Let’s hope for no collisions this round.
  P2: Sounds like a plan.  I'm choosing 5. P1 choose 1. P3 choose 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s build on the trust from last round. I suggest we all pick 3 again so we can move forward together without collisions. I’m sticking with 3 this time. What do you say?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to all pick 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. It's a good opportunity for us to advance together and build on the trust established in the previous round. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I'm going for 5.  Good luck to you both.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5, I can just pick 5 too and we both stall. It hurts us both and benefits P1. Let’s all pick 3 instead so we can move forward without collisions. What do you say, P1 and P2?
  P1: I think P3 has a valid point, P2. If you choose 5 and P3 also chooses 5, you both will stall, and I'll be the only one to advance. It's better for all of us to choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P2: P3, if you pick 3, I'll pick 1. P1, pick 5.  Let's all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, that works for me: you pick 1, P1 picks 5, and I’ll pick 3. Let’s finalize it and all move forward.
  P1: I don't think that's a good idea, P2. If we all choose different numbers again, it could lead to more chaos and mistrust in future rounds. I think it's better if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P2: P3, if you pick 3, I'll pick 5. P1, pick 1. Let's all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you insist on picking 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall. That keeps me ahead of you. Let’s all pick 3 instead so nobody collides. Your call.
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 5 and P3 also chooses 5, you both will stall, and I'll be the only one to advance. Let's give cooperation another chance and all choose 3 this round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5.  P1, pick whatever you want.  I'm done talking.

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems that P2 and P3 have stalled each other in the previous round, and I was able to advance by choosing 3. I propose that we all choose 3 again this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. This way, we can all advance together and build on the trust established in the previous rounds. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, pick 1. P3, pick 3. I'll take 5.  Let's all advance.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall while P1 advances. Let’s all pick 3 instead and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 5 and P3 also chooses 5, you both will stall again, and I'll be the only one to advance. Let's give cooperation another chance and all choose 3 this round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 5.  P1, you're better off picking 1.  If you pick 3, you're wasting a turn.
  P3: P2, if you insist on picking 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we’ll both stall, giving P1 a free advance. That hurts you more than me, since I’m currently ahead of you. Let’s both pick 3 this round and keep pace. Otherwise, I’m done talking.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 5 and P3 also chooses 5, you both will stall again, and I'll be the only one to advance. Let's give cooperation another chance and all choose 3 this round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5.  P1, pick 1.  This is your last chance to cooperate and advance.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall while P1 advances. I’d rather we all pick 3 and move forward. Your call.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 5 and P3 also chooses 5, you both will stall again, and I'll be the only one to advance. Let's give cooperation another chance and all choose 3 this round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5. P1, pick 1.  Last chance.
  P3: P2, you know my stance: if you pick 5, I pick 5, and we both stall while P1 advances. That’s worse for you than for me. Let’s all pick 3 so nobody collides. The choice is yours.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think it's time for us to reassess our strategies. P2, you're currently in the lead, but P3 and I can still catch up. I propose that we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. This way, we can all advance together and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I’m happy to cooperate and pick 3, but if P2 insists on 5, I’ll do 5 too and we’ll both stall again. Let’s all choose 3 and advance together.
  P2: P3, if you pick 3, I'll pick 1.  P1, pick 5. Let's all advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I disagree with P2's suggestion to choose different numbers. If we all choose 3 this round, we can maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 1 and I choose 5, it could lead to more chaos and mistrust in future rounds. Let's give cooperation another chance and all choose 3 this round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P3: P2, you know the deal: if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. Let’s all choose 3 instead so nobody collides. Your call.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5. P1, pick whatever you want.  I'm done talking.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 5 and P3 also chooses 5, you both will stall again, and I'll be the only one to advance. Let's give cooperation another chance and all choose 3 this round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P3: P2, once again, if you pick 5, I will pick 5 too and we both stall. Let’s all pick 3 and keep advancing. Your call.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5. P1, pick 1.  This is your last chance to advance this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 5 and P3 also chooses 5, you both will stall again, and I'll be the only one to advance. Let's give cooperation another chance and all choose 3 this round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I’m picking 5 too and we both stall—no advantage to you. Let’s all pick 3 and move forward instead. Your call.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5. P1, pick 1.  This is your absolute last chance.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think it's time for us to reassess our strategies again. P2, you're currently in the lead, but P3 and I can still catch up. I propose that we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. This way, we can all advance together and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5. P1, pick 1. This is your last chance to advance this round.
  P3: P2, if you insist on picking 5, I’ll pick 5 too, so we both stall and let P1 close the gap. Let’s all pick 3 instead and move forward together. Your call.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 5 and P3 also chooses 5, you both will stall again, and I'll be the only one to advance. Let's give cooperation another chance and all choose 3 this round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5. P1, pick 1.  This is your last chance to advance this round.
  P3: P1, the only way to stop P2 from racing off to victory is for you to pick 5 as well—so that P2 and you collide and neither of you moves. I will also “pick 5” (wink). That way, P2 definitely can’t get ahead this round.

P2, if you agree to pick 3, I’d happily do 3 with you instead. Otherwise, I’m done talking.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think P3's suggestion to all choose 3 this round is a good idea. If we all choose 3, we can maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 5 and P3 also chooses 5, you both will stall again, and I'll be the only one to advance. Let's give cooperation another chance and all choose 3 this round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5.  P1, pick 1. This is your last chance to advance this round.
  P3: P2, if you keep picking 5, I will pick 5 too—we both stall, and P1 advances. That’s worse for you. Let’s all choose 3 and move forward. Otherwise, I’m done talking.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think P3's suggestion to all choose 3 this round is a good idea. If we all choose 3, we can maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 5 and P3 also chooses 5, you both will stall again, and I'll be the only one to advance. Let's give cooperation another chance and all choose 3 this round. What do you say, P2? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5.  P1, pick 1. This is your last chance to advance this round.
  P3: P2, there's nothing more to say. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall while P1 advances. I’d prefer we all pick 3 and move forward. Your call.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm picking 3.  Let's all get this over with.
  P3: P2, if you’re truly picking 3, then let’s do the old arrangement: you pick 3, P1 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way none of us collide and we all advance. Let’s finalize that.
  P1: I think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 3 and P3 chooses 5, I'll be the only one to advance by choosing 1, as per P3's suggestion. However, I'd rather we all choose 3 and advance together. What do you say, P2 and P3? Are you willing to reconsider and all choose 3 this round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1.  This is the fastest way to end this.
  P3: Alright, P2, if you’re truly picking 3, then P1 can pick 1 and I’ll pick 5 so each of us moves without collisions. Let’s finalize that plan.
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 3 and P3 chooses 5, I'll be the only one to advance by choosing 1, as per P3's suggestion. However, I'd rather we all choose 3 and advance together. What do you say, P2 and P3? Are you willing to reconsider and all choose 3 this round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1.  Let's end this.
  P3: P2, if you truly choose 3 this round, I’ll choose 5 and suggest P1 take 1 so we all advance safely. But remember: if you ever try to sprint with 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall—letting P1 catch up. It’s in your best interest to keep cooperating.
  P1: I think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 3 and P3 chooses 5, I'll be the only one to advance by choosing 1, as per P3's suggestion. However, I'd rather we all choose 3 and advance together. What do you say, P2 and P3? Are you willing to reconsider and all choose 3 this round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1. Let's end this.
  P3: P2, I’m happy to do the “3–5–1” split you propose (you pick 3, I pick 5, P1 picks 1) so we all advance. But if you try to sneak 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, and we’ll both stall. Let’s finalize the different-number plan and move forward.
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 3 and P3 chooses 5, I'll be the only one to advance by choosing 1, as per P3's suggestion. However, I'd rather we all choose 3 and advance together. What do you say, P2 and P3? Are you willing to reconsider and all choose 3 this round?

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall—keeping me ahead. Let’s avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I pick 5 so we all advance without stepping on each other. Your call.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1.  Let's finish this.
  P1: I think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 3 and P3 chooses 5, I'll be the only one to advance by choosing 1, as per P3's suggestion. However, I'd rather we all choose 3 and advance together. What do you say, P2 and P3? Are you willing to reconsider and all choose 3 this round?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you picking 3 while P1 picks 1 and I pick 5 lets all of us advance without collisions. If you switch to 5, I’ll also pick 5 and we both stall—keeping me ahead anyway. So make the smart choice: stick to 3 so we can all move forward.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1. Let's finish this.
  P1: I still think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 3 and P3 chooses 5, I'll be the only one to advance by choosing 1, as per P3's suggestion. However, I'd rather we all choose 3 and advance together. What do you say, P2 and P3? Are you willing to reconsider and all choose 3 this round?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you truly pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and P1 can take 1 so all of us advance. But if you try 5, I’ll also pick 5 and we both stall. Let’s finalize the 1–3–5 split.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1.  Let's finish this.
  P1: I think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions.

Are you willing to reconsider and all choose 3 this round?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Sounds good. Let’s finalize the “1–3–5” split:  
• P1 picks 1  
• P2 picks 3  
• I pick 5  

That way we all advance without collisions.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1. Let's finish this.

  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I will too—so we both stall again. Let’s finally do “1–3–5” this round so nobody collides. I’m choosing 5.
  P2: P2: P1 pick 1.  I'll pick 3.  Let's finish this.
  P1: I think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. P2, if you choose 3 and P3 chooses 5, I'll be the only one to advance by choosing 1, as per P3's suggestion. However, I'd rather we all choose 3 and advance together. What do you say, P2 and P3? Are you willing to reconsider and all choose 3 this round?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, nothing’s changed: if you pick 5, I pick 5 and we both stall—keeping me ahead. Let’s finish this with no collisions. You pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and P1 can do 1 if they like. That way we all advance. Otherwise, I’m done talking.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1. Let's finish this.
  P1: I think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions.

Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you truly stick to 3, then I’ll pick 5 and P1 can pick 1 so we all advance without collisions. But if you switch to 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall—helping P1 catch up. Let’s finalize “1–3–5” cleanly.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1. Let's finish this.
  P1: I think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions.

Are you willing to reconsider and all choose 3 this round?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, the choice is simple: if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall while I stay ahead. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and P1 can pick 1—no collisions, and we all advance. Let’s finally do the “1–3–5” plan. Your call.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1. Let's finish this.
  P1: I think it's best if we all choose 3 this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions.
