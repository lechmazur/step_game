Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 1, you two fight over 3 and 5.  Let's get this show on the road.
  P2: I’ll take 5 this round. P1, you can take 3, and P3 can stick with 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s keep it clean.
  P1: I agree with P2's plan. I'll take 3, and let’s ensure we all advance smoothly. P3, stick with 1, and we’ll be good.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going. P2, how about we stick to our plan? I suggest I take 3 again, and P3, you should take 1. P2, you can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance again. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Same plan again? I'm taking 1.
  P2: I agree with the plan. I’ll take 5 again, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly.

  P2: I agree with the plan again. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s keep advancing smoothly without collisions.
  P3: This "cooperation" is getting boring.  I'm taking 3 this round.  One of you switch to 1, or we all lose a turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I still think we should stick to our previous plan to avoid any collisions. P3, if you take 3, we risk all losing a turn. How about you take 1 instead? Let’s keep advancing together. What do you think?

  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but sticking to the plan ensures we all advance. Let’s avoid collisions this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. Next round, we can discuss adjustments. Let’s keep it smooth for now.
  P3: Fine.  I'll take 1 *this* round.  Next round I'm taking 5.  P2, you take 3, P1 you take 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, since you’re taking 1 this round, let's stick to the plan: I’ll take 3 and P2 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. After this round, we can discuss your desire for 5 next time. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for 5 next round, but let’s focus on this round first. P1, I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Next round, we can discuss adjustments. Let’s keep it smooth for now.
  P3: Okay, fine. I'll take 1 *this* round.  Next round, I'm taking 5.  You two figure out who takes 1 and who takes 3.  If you collide, that's your problem.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, since P3 is committed to taking 1 this round, let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 3, and you take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. After this round, we can address P3's desire for 5 in the next round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, let’s stick to the plan this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Next round, we can discuss your request for 5. Let’s keep it smooth for now.
  P3: Okay, fine.  I'll take 1 *this* round.  For the last time. Next round, I'm taking 5.  You two figure out the rest.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2, let's finalize our plan for this round: I’ll take 3, you take 5, and P3 is taking 1. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance smoothly. After this round, we can discuss P3's desire for 5 next time. What do you think?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid another collision. P1, take 3, P3, take 1, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance smoothly. P3, you can aim for 5 next round if you still want it. Let’s keep it clean this round.

  P2: P3, if you take 5 this round, we risk another collision, and none of us will advance. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This ensures we all advance smoothly. Next round, you can take 5 as you’ve requested. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks now.
