Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn—1, 3, and 5. This way, we all advance and avoid wasting steps. Who wants to take which number? I’m open to suggestions.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the coordination idea. I'll take <move>1</move> this turn.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good coordination last round, everyone advanced. Let's try that again. P2, how about you take <move>5</move> this round, and P3, you take <move>3</move>. I'll take <move>1</move> again.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep advancing.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, so P2 and P3 collided last round. Let's switch things up to avoid that again. How about P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep advancing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Let's make sure we don't collide again. P2, you take <move>3</move>, P3, you take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's all advance this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’ll stick with <move>1</move> as planned. P3, please confirm you’ll take <move>3</move>, and P1, stick to <move>5</move>. Let’s avoid another collision and keep advancing efficiently.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, clearly our attempts at coordination are failing. This round, P2, you take <move>1</move>, P3, you take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. Let's actually do it this time.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions. P3, please confirm you'll take <move>3</move> this time. We need to trust each other to advance efficiently.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is leading with 10 steps, and we need to prevent them from reaching 24. P1, let’s both take <move>1</move> this round to block P3 if they choose <move>5</move>. P3, if you want to avoid collisions, take <move>3</move>. Let’s break their momentum.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, I agree with your plan. Let's both pick <move>1</move> this round to try and block P3. Hopefully, they will pick <move>5</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you’re in the lead, but if you take <move>5</move> this round, P1 and I will both take <move>1</move> to block you. To avoid a collision, take <move>3</move> instead. P1, let’s stick to <move>1</move> to ensure P3 doesn’t gain more ground. Trust is key here—let’s all advance without collisions.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, let's stick with the plan. I'm taking <move>1</move>. P3, to avoid a collision and still advance, your best bet is <move>3</move> this round. Let's make this work.
