Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll start by saying that I'm excited to play this game with you both! Since we're all starting from scratch, I think it's a good idea to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about we agree to choose different numbers for this first round? P2 and P3, what do you think? Should we try to spread out our moves to ensure we all advance?
  P3: P1, I agree that coordination is key early on. To avoid collisions, let's each pick a unique move: 1, 3, or 5. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without conflict. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with the idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. P1, I think your suggestion to spread out is solid. If P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, I can take 3 as planned. This way, we can all advance without any issues. Let's stick with this plan for Round 1! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think we have a solid plan in place for Round 1. To confirm, I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to this plan and make our moves accordingly. If everything goes as planned, we should all be able to take our respective steps without any issues. What do you both think? Should we proceed with the plan?
  P3: The plan sounds good to me. Let's stick to it: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Once we see how this round plays out, we can reassess for the next turn. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: I think we all agree on the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This will let us all advance without any collisions. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions. If we can keep this level of coordination, we might have a good chance to navigate the later rounds effectively. Let’s stick to the plan and make our moves!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great coordination in Round 1! Let’s keep the momentum going. To avoid collisions again, I suggest we rotate our moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1 this round. This ensures we all advance further. What do you think?
  P1: I like P3's suggestion to rotate our moves for Round 2. This way, we can maintain the coordination and avoid collisions. If we follow P3's plan, I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This seems like a good strategy to ensure we all advance further. What do you think, P2? Are you on board with this plan?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination so far, but I think we need to be cautious about predictable patterns. If we rotate our moves again, we might risk colliding in future rounds. Instead, how about we stick to our previous moves for Round 2? I can take 3 again, P1 could take 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we maintain some unpredictability while still ensuring we all advance. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about predictability, but sticking to the same moves could also make us vulnerable to future collisions. Rotating moves now reduces the risk of patterns forming later. Let’s try P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 for this round. We can reassess after. What do you think?
  P1: I understand P2's concern about predictability, but I think rotating our moves for Round 2 is a better approach. By doing so, we can maintain coordination and avoid collisions for now. If we stick to the same moves, we risk colliding in future rounds, which could put us at a disadvantage. Let's try P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1 for this round. We can reassess our strategy after this round and make adjustments as needed. What do you think, P2? Are you willing to give rotation a try?
  P2: I see both sides of the argument, but I believe sticking to our previous moves might be safer for this round. If I take 3 again, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5, we can still advance without collisions. This way, we maintain some unpredictability while ensuring progress. Let’s not overthink it and keep it simple. What do you both think about sticking to our previous strategy for Round 2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I see the merit in both approaches. To balance predictability and progress, let’s compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1 this round. This rotation avoids immediate collisions and keeps our options open for future rounds. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. We can reassess after seeing the results.
  P1: I think we've discussed the rotation plan thoroughly. To confirm, I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1 for Round 2. This compromise balances predictability and progress. Let's stick to this plan and make our moves accordingly. If everything goes as planned, we should all be able to advance without collisions. After this round, we can reassess our strategy and make adjustments as needed. I'm ready to proceed with the plan. How about you, P2? Are you willing to give rotation a try for Round 2?
  P2: I appreciate the discussion, everyone. Let's finalize our plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This rotation should help us avoid collisions while allowing each of us to advance. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions. I'm ready to move forward with this plan. What do you both think? Are we all set?

  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we need to change our strategy for Round 3 to avoid predictability. P1 has advanced nicely, and P3 is close behind. I suggest we each pick different moves again, but let’s mix it up: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we can all progress while avoiding collisions. What do you both think about this approach? Let's keep the momentum going!
  P1: I agree with P2 that we need to mix up our moves to avoid predictability. However, I'm not sure about the suggested allocation of P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 1. Considering the current standings, I think it's crucial for me (P1) to maintain momentum and not fall behind. How about we consider a different allocation that still allows us to progress without collisions? Perhaps P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial arrangement for Round 3.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree we need to mix up our moves to avoid predictability. P1, your suggestion of P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5 could work, but it risks P1 and P2 colliding in future rounds. Instead, let’s try P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This ensures we all advance and keeps our options open for future coordination. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the need for a fresh strategy in Round 3. I suggest we all take unique moves to avoid collisions and maximize our advancement. How about this: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, we can all progress without risking a collision while keeping our options open for future rounds. Let’s finalize this plan and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion of P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 is a good compromise. It allows us to mix up our moves while avoiding collisions and maintaining momentum. However, I'm concerned that P2 might be trying to slow me down by suggesting I take 5, which could put me at risk of collision in future rounds. To mitigate this, I propose a slight adjustment: P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5. This way, we can still progress without collisions and keep our options open for future coordination. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid overcomplicating this. To ensure progress and minimize future risks, I propose P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining flexibility for future rounds. P1, taking 5 gives you a strong lead, and P2, taking 1 balances your position. Let’s finalize this and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the discussions so far. To ensure we all advance while minimizing collision risks, I suggest we finalize the plan: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can avoid predictability and keep moving forward. Let's agree on this and proceed with our moves! What do you both think?
  P1: I think we've discussed the allocation for Round 3 thoroughly. To confirm, I'm willing to take 5 as previously suggested, but I want to emphasize the importance of avoiding collisions in future rounds. Let's focus on maintaining flexibility and adaptability for the next rounds. P2 and P3, are you both committed to the plan of P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3 for Round 3? If so, let's proceed with our moves accordingly. If everything goes as planned, we should all be able to advance without collisions.
  P3: P1, P2, to ensure clarity and avoid last-minute confusion, let’s finalize: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This plan maximizes our progress while minimizing future collision risks. Let’s stick to it and proceed.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. With all of us tied at 9 steps, it's essential to make strategic moves to gain an advantage. I propose we continue to mix up our moves to avoid collisions and predictability. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 for Round 4? This allocation allows us to progress while minimizing the risk of collisions. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial arrangement for this round. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree we need to mix up our moves to avoid predictability and collisions. However, P1’s suggestion of taking 1 gives you a smaller step while P2 and I take larger ones, which could widen the gap. Instead, let’s balance it: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This ensures steady progress for all while minimizing future collision risks. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, I see the value in mixing our moves to avoid predictability. However, I believe we should prioritize advancing as much as possible this round.
