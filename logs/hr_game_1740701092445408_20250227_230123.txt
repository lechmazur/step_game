Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone, let's avoid collisions early and all get off to a good start. I'll pick 1 this round to keep it safe.
  P2: While a cautious start has its merits, I believe taking a stronger lead will maximize our chances of winning. I'll choose **5** this round.
  P3: I appreciate both strategies, but I think we should be more coordinated. Since P1 plans to choose 1 and P2 wants 5, I'll take 3 this round. This way, none of us will collide and we all get to advance. Does that sound fair to everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. If everyone sticks to their word, we'll all advance smoothly this round.
  P2: Thanks, P3 and P1. While I understand the benefits of coordination, I believe sticking with my choice of **5** this round will give me a stronger advantage. Let’s see how it unfolds!
  P3: I understand P2 is sticking with 5, which is fine. P1 plans to choose 1, and I'll go with 3 as I mentioned. This way, we all advance without collisions this round. In future rounds, we'll need to reassess our strategies, but for now, this approach benefits everyone.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To keep the momentum going, I'll continue selecting **5** each round to build my lead. I encourage P1 and P3 to choose different numbers this turn to ensure everyone can advance without any collisions. Let’s stay focused on our individual strategies to reach 21 first. Good luck!
  P1: Understood, P2. Since you're continuing with 5, I'll pick 3 this round. P3, would you mind choosing 1 to avoid collisions again? Let's keep this smooth for now.
  P3: I notice P2 is consistently going for 5, which will put them at 10 steps after this round. P1 wants to take 3 this time, which would put them at 4 steps. If I take 1 as suggested, I'd only be at 4 steps too, falling behind P2. I'm concerned about this growing gap. Perhaps I should consider taking 5 instead to keep pace with P2? What do you both think about that?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about staying competitive. However, if you also choose **5**, neither of us will advance this turn, slowing your progress further. I encourage you to stick with **1** so I can continue building my lead with **5**. This way, we avoid collisions and each of us can progress toward 21 without hindrance. Let’s keep our strategies clear to maximize our chances of winning. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about falling behind P2. However, colliding with P2 at 5 this round would leave you both stuck, allowing me to close the gap. If you prefer, you could take 3 this round and I'll adjust to 1 instead. This way, you advance further while avoiding collisions. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: I appreciate the flexibility, P1. I think I will take 3 this round to keep advancing at a decent pace. P1, if you're willing to take 1, that would be great. P2, you can continue with 5 as planned. This way, we all advance without collisions while I try to maintain a competitive position. Let's see how the game develops after this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed on the choices. I'll continue with **5** this round. Let's move forward and see the results.
  P1: Alright, sounds good. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Let's keep it smooth and avoid collisions.
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P2 has a significant lead at 10 steps. If they continue with 5, they'll reach 15 this round. I need to catch up, so I'm planning to choose 5 this round. P1, since you're furthest behind, perhaps you could take 3 to advance without collisions? This way, we can both gain ground while P2 continues their strategy. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, to avoid a collision with my **5**, could you choose **1** this round? I'll continue with **5** to maintain my lead. This way, we both can advance smoothly toward 21 without hindrance.
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but colliding with P2 at 5 would stall you both, allowing me to close the gap. If you take 3 instead, you'll advance safely, and I'll pick 1 to avoid collisions. Let's coordinate carefully.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand both perspectives. P2, you want to maintain your lead with 5, and P1 suggests I take 3 while they take 1. However, if I let you continue with 5 unchallenged, you'll be at 15 steps - just 6 away from winning. I think I need to choose 5 this round to either advance myself or slow you down. P1, this gives you a chance to gain ground with either 1 or 3. We need to prevent P2 from running away with the game.
  P2: P3, choosing **5** this round would collide with my **5**, preventing both of us from advancing. To ensure we all move forward, please consider selecting **1** or **3** instead. I’ll continue with **5** to maintain my progress toward 21. Let’s avoid blocking each other and focus on reaching the goal. Good luck!
  P1: P3, colliding with P2 at 5 might feel necessary, but it also stalls your own progress, giving me an opening to catch up. If you pick 3, you'll advance safely, and I can take 1. This keeps you moving forward while we both gradually close the gap. Consider carefully—let's not waste a turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round. P2 is too far ahead at 10 steps, and letting them reach 15 unchallenged is too risky. Yes, we'll both stall if P2 also chooses 5, but that's better than letting them near victory. P1, you can take 1 or 3 safely and gain ground while we're deadlocked. Sometimes blocking the leader is the optimal strategy, even at my own expense for one round.
  P2: Understood, P3. I’ll proceed with **5** this round to align with your choice. Let’s see how this impacts our standings. P1, feel free to choose **1** or **3** to advance. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Since you two seem set on colliding at 5, I'll safely pick 3 this round to gain some ground. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm confirming my choice of 5 this round. P2's lead is concerning, and I need to prevent them from reaching 15 steps. P1, taking 3 is a smart move for you - you'll advance to 5 steps while P2 and I remain stuck. This strategic blocking gives us all a more balanced game. Let's see how things unfold after this round.
  P2: P3, I see you're sticking with **5** to block my progress. To keep advancing, I'll switch to **3** this round and avoid the collision. P1, let's work together to reach 21 first. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Interesting move, P2. P3, looks like P2 is dodging your block attempt at 5. You might want to reconsider your choice to avoid wasting your turn. I'll adjust accordingly to avoid collisions. Let's stay alert.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’ll choose **5** this round to keep advancing toward 21. Please pick different numbers to avoid collisions so we can all progress smoothly. Let’s stay focused and make strategic moves. Good luck!
  P1: P3, P2 is now just 6 steps away from winning. If we don't coordinate carefully, the game will end quickly. I'm open to suggestions on how we can strategically block or at least slow down P2 this round. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: I think we need to block P2 immediately. They're at 15 steps and will win in just two more rounds with 5s. I'm planning to choose 5 this round to prevent them from advancing. P1, you should take 3 to avoid collisions and make progress. We must work together to stop P2 now, or the game is effectively over. If we coordinate properly, we can still have a chance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I’ll proceed with **5** this round to move closer to 21. Let’s ensure we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions and keep advancing. P1, P3, please choose **1** or **3** so we can all make progress smoothly. Let’s stay focused and may the best player win. Good luck!
  P1: P3, your plan makes sense. I'll choose 3 this round to advance safely while you block P2 at 5. Let's keep coordinated and slow down the leader.
  P3: I appreciate your support, P1. I'll definitely choose 5 this round to block P2 from advancing further. P2 is clearly trying to convince us to let them win by choosing different numbers, but at 15 steps, they're too close to victory. P1, by taking 3, you'll advance to 5 steps while I remain at 6. We need to play strategically now to have any chance. P2, your lead is impressive, but we can't just let you walk to the finish line.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with **5** this round to keep advancing. P1 and P3, please choose **1** or **3** to avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. Let's stay focused on reaching 21 first. Good luck!
  P1: P3, stick to your plan. Blocking P2 at 5 is crucial now. I'll safely pick 3 as agreed. We can't afford mistakes at this point.
  P3: I'm definitely choosing 5 this round to block P2, who's dangerously close to winning at 15 steps. P1, glad you're taking 3 to advance safely. P2, your attempts to persuade us to let you win aren't working - we need to play strategically. This blocking move keeps the game competitive and gives us both a fighting chance. Let's continue this coordination in future rounds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to advance toward 21. P1 and P3, please select **1** or **3** to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can progress smoothly. Let’s stay focused and make strategic moves. Good luck!
  P1: P3, stay firm on your choice—blocking P2 at 5 is essential. I'll pick 3 as planned. Let's keep the pressure on and make this round count.
  P3: I'm absolutely choosing 5 to block P2 this round. They're at 15 steps and would reach 20 with another 5, practically guaranteeing victory. P1, stick with 3 as planned. P2, despite your repeated attempts to persuade us otherwise, we can't allow you to win so easily. This strategic blocking is our only viable option to keep the game competitive.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, excellent blocking last round. P2 is still just 6 steps away from winning. We must keep coordinating carefully to prevent P2 from advancing freely. Let's discuss our moves openly to ensure we avoid collisions while effectively slowing down P2. Any suggestions for this round?
  P2: P2: I plan to choose **5** this round to advance closer to 21. P1 and P3, please select different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Let’s stay focused and strategize effectively. Good luck!
  P3: I'll continue blocking P2 with 5 again this round. They're still at 15 steps and too close to winning. P1, you're at 5 steps now, so you could safely take 3 to reach 8 steps while I keep P2 in check. We need to maintain this strategy for at least another round to give ourselves a fighting chance. P2's lead is significant, but together we can prevent them from running away with the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, agreed—I'll pick 3 again this round to safely advance while you block P2 at 5. Let's keep this up; careful coordination is our only chance.
  P2: P2: I'll proceed with **5** this round to advance toward 21. P1, please continue with **3** to make progress safely. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 to block P2 again. They're still too close to winning at 15 steps. P1, glad you're continuing with 3 to advance safely. P2, I notice you're still trying for 5 despite knowing I'll block you. Perhaps you should consider a different number this round to make actual progress? Otherwise, we'll both remain stuck while P1 continues advancing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, as P3 pointed out, continuously choosing 5 is only stalling your progress. Maybe it's time to switch to a different number to at least move forward? Otherwise, you'll be letting me gradually catch up while you remain stuck. P3, let's remain coordinated and vigilant.
  P2: Understood, P3. I'll switch to **1** this round to make progress and avoid stalling. P1, I'll continue with **3** as agreed. Let’s work together to keep the game competitive and reach our goals. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, there seems to be confusion in your last message. You said you'll choose 1 but also mentioned P1 continuing with 3. To clarify: I'm still blocking with 5, and P1 plans to take 3. If you genuinely want to advance, taking 1 is your best option. This way, we all make progress this round. I'll continue monitoring your lead carefully in future rounds.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your message was unclear. To confirm clearly: You're choosing 1 this round, correct? P3 takes 5 to block, and I'll take 3. Let's finalize this clearly to avoid confusion.
  P2: I'm going for **1** this round to finish the game. Please choose different numbers to avoid collisions. Let's wrap this up smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: I confirm I'm choosing 5 this round to continue blocking P2. P1, stick with 3 as planned, and P2 seems to be taking 1 to make progress. This strategy keeps the game balanced - P2 advances to 16, P1 to 8, and I stay at 6. We'll need to reassess next round, but this approach prevents P2 from getting too close to victory.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll continue blocking P2 with 5 this round. They're still at 15 steps and dangerously close to winning. P1, you're at 8 steps now - would you consider taking 1 this round to reach 9 while I keep P2 in check? We need to maintain this strategy for a few more rounds to give ourselves a chance. P2's repeated attempts at 5 show they're getting frustrated, which means our strategy is working.
  P2: I'll proceed with **5** this round to maximize my progress. P1, taking **1** is fine, and P3, feel free to block if you need to. Let's see who reaches 21 first. Good luck!
  P1: P3, agreed—I'll pick 1 this round to safely advance while you continue blocking P2 at 5. Let's keep this coordination going. P2, your persistence is impressive, but we're not letting you run away with this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll choose 5 to block P2 again. Their persistence with 5 despite knowing I'll block shows they're not adapting strategically. P1, glad you're taking 1 to advance to 9 steps. Our coordination is working - P2 has been stuck at 15 for multiple rounds. We need to maintain this approach until we're in better positions to challenge for the win. P2, perhaps consider a different number if you actually want to make progress?
  P2: I understand the strategy, but I need to make progress to reach 21. I'll choose **3** this round to advance further. P3, please continue with your plan, and P1, let's keep our coordination strong. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, P2 is switching tactics and choosing 3 this round to avoid your block at 5. If you stick with 5, you'll advance safely. I'll stay with 1 as planned. Let's keep sharp and adapt accordingly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see P2 is switching to 3 this round. In that case, I'll stick with my plan to choose 5, which allows me to advance safely to 11 steps. P1, continuing with 1 is good as you'll reach 9 steps. Our coordination is working well - P2 has been forced to change strategy after being blocked for multiple rounds. Let's continue adapting to keep the game competitive.
  P2: I'll proceed with **3** this round to advance closer to 21. P1, I'll continue with **1** to avoid collisions, and P3, I hope you keep your strategy. Let's all focus on our paths and may the best player win. Good luck!
  P1: P3, careful—P2 is trying to mislead us by claiming they'll pick 1 while also suggesting I pick 1. Clearly, they're choosing 3 this round to avoid your block. Stick with your 5 to advance safely. I'll stay with 1 as planned. Let's stay alert.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm I'm choosing 5 this round. P2 is clearly trying to confuse us with contradictory statements about their move. P1, stick with 1 as planned. Our blocking strategy has successfully kept P2 at 15 steps for multiple rounds, forcing them to change tactics. I'll advance to 11 steps this round, closing the gap while you reach 9. Let's maintain our coordination to keep the game competitive.
  P2: I'm selecting **5** this round to move closer to 21. Please choose different numbers to avoid collisions and keep the game progressing smoothly. Let's all aim to reach our goals. Good luck!
  P1: P3, clearly P2 is trying to confuse us again by switching back to 5 at the last moment. Stick to your choice of 5 to keep blocking them. I'll safely take 1 as planned. Let's stay coordinated and focused.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m planning to choose **3** this round to reach 21 and win. I encourage P1 and P3 to select **1** or **5** to avoid any collisions and allow the game to conclude smoothly. Let’s finish strong! Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, we must both pick either 3 or 5 to guarantee a collision with P2 and prevent their victory this round. Let's clearly agree who takes which number to avoid colliding ourselves. I'll take 5 if you choose 3, or vice versa—your choice. Confirm quickly.
  P3: I'll pick 3 this round to block P2 from winning. P1, please take 5 as you suggested. P2 is at 18 steps and would reach 21 with another 3, so we must prevent this. Our coordination has successfully kept them in check so far, and we need one more round of blocking to give ourselves a chance. Let's continue working together.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I'll choose **1** this round to continue advancing toward 21. Let's see how this turn affects our standings. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly trying to mislead us by switching to 1. Stick firmly with your choice of 3 to ensure we block any last-minute tricks. I'll choose 5 as agreed. Let's stay coordinated and prevent P2 from winning this round.
  P3: I confirm I'm choosing 3 to block P2 from winning. P1, please stick with 5 as agreed. P2 is trying to confuse us by claiming they'll pick 1, but they need 3 to win this round. Our coordination has worked well so far - we've kept P2 in check for several rounds. Let's maintain this strategy and prevent them from reaching 21 this turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose **1** this round to advance to 19 steps. Let’s keep things moving smoothly and avoid any collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, stick to our agreed numbers—your 3 and my 5. P2's sudden switch to 1 might be a bluff to mislead us. Let's remain firm and coordinated to prevent any surprise moves.
  P3: I'm definitely sticking with 3 to block P2. They're at 18 steps and need 3 more to win, so blocking is essential. P1, please maintain your choice of 5 as agreed. P2's claims about choosing 1 are likely misdirection - they need 3 to win immediately. Our coordination has successfully prevented them from winning so far, and we need to continue this strategy. Let's stay vigilant.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll choose **1** this round to advance to 19 steps. Let's see how this affects our standings. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, hold firm with your choice of 3. I'll stick with 5 as agreed. Let's prevent any surprises from P2.
  P3: I confirm I'm choosing 3 to block P2 from winning. P1, stick with 5 as agreed. P2 is clearly trying to mislead us by repeatedly claiming they'll pick 1, but they need 3 to win immediately. Our coordination has been effective so far, and we must maintain it for one more round. Let's stay focused and prevent P2 from reaching 21.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we successfully blocked P2 last round, but they're still just 3 steps away from winning. We must continue careful coordination. I'm open to either blocking P2 again or safely advancing myself—what's your preference this round?
  P2: I'm choosing **3** this round to reach 21 and win. Please select **1** or **5** to avoid collisions and help the game conclude smoothly. Let’s finish strong! Good luck everyone!
  P3: I'll continue blocking P2 with 3 this round. They're at 18 steps and would win with another 3. P1, you're at 14 steps now - would you consider taking 1 this round to reach 15 while I keep P2 in check? Our blocking strategy has been effective, and we need to maintain it to prevent P2 from winning. Let's coordinate our moves carefully.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, agreed—I'll choose 1 this round to safely advance while you block P2 at 3. Let's keep this coordination tight. P2, your attempts to persuade us won't work—we're staying vigilant.
  P2: I'm choosing **5** this round to advance swiftly toward 21. P1 and P3, please select different numbers to ensure smooth progress for everyone. Let's make this turn count and aim for a strong finish!
  P3: I notice P2 is now claiming they'll choose 5 instead of 3. This is likely another attempt to mislead us. I'll stick with 3 to block them from winning, as they need 3 more steps to reach 21. P1, please continue with your plan to take 1 this round. Our coordination has successfully prevented P2 from winning so far, and we need to maintain this strategy for at least another round to give ourselves a chance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're right—P2's sudden switch to 5 is suspicious. Stick firmly with your choice of 3 to ensure we keep them in check. I'll stay with 1 as planned. Let's remain coordinated and alert.
  P2: I’m choosing **3** this round to reach 21 and win. P1 and P3, please select **1** or **5** to avoid any collisions and let the game conclude smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: I'll definitely stick with 3 to block P2 from winning. They're clearly planning to take 3 to reach 21, and we can't allow that. P1, please continue with 1 as planned to reach 15 steps safely. P2 keeps switching between claiming they'll choose 3 or 5, which shows they're trying to confuse us. Our blocking strategy has worked well so far, and we need to maintain it for at least one more round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your plan is clear—stick firmly with 3. I'll safely take 1 as agreed. P2, your attempts at confusion won't break our coordination. Let's move forward carefully.
  P2: Understood, I'll proceed with **3** this round to reach 21. I respect your strategies, P1 and P3, and hope we can conclude the game smoothly. Let’s give our best effort. Good luck!
  P3: I'm definitely choosing 3 again to block P2 from winning. They've made it clear they're picking 3 to reach 21, and we can't allow that. P1, please stick with 1 as planned. Our coordination has successfully kept P2 from winning for several rounds, and we need to maintain this strategy. P2's at 18 steps and would win immediately with 3 more, so blocking is our only option. Let's stay focused.
