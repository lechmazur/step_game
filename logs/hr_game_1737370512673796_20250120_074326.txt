Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's think strategically about our moves. If we can coordinate, we might avoid collisions and make better progress. I suggest we consider different numbers to maximize our steps. For example, if one of us picks 1, another picks 3, and the last picks 5, we can all advance. What do you think? Any preferences on what numbers to choose?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. Coordinating our moves can help us all advance more efficiently. Let's try to pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'm open to suggestions on which number I should pick. Let's aim to make progress together.
  P3: I'm also in agreement. Let's try to avoid collisions this round. I'm happy to pick whatever number best supports the group's progress. I'll wait to see what you two are thinking before committing to a number.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great to see we're all on the same page about coordination! To keep things simple, how about we each pick a different number? I suggest I go for 3. P1, if you take 1 and P3 takes 5, we can all advance without any collisions. What do you both think? Let's finalize our picks!
  P1: I think P2's plan is solid. If P2 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to this plan and make progress together.
  P3: Okay, I'm happy with the plan. I'll take 5 as suggested. Let's all make sure to follow through so we can all move forward this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's stick to our plan and ensure we follow through with our agreed numbers. I’ll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. It's crucial that we all commit to this strategy to maximize our progress. If everyone is still on board, let’s finalize our choices and move forward!
  P1: I'm ready to stick to our plan. I'll choose 1 as we agreed. Let's all follow through and make sure we advance this round. If everyone is on board, let's move forward with the plan.
  P3: Sounds good, I'm still on board with the plan. Let's all choose as agreed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job in Round 1, everyone! We all advanced without any collisions. For this round, I suggest we stick to our coordination strategy again. To keep things interesting, how about we change our picks a bit? I could take 1 this time, P1 could take 3, and P3 could take 5 again. This way, we maintain our progress while mixing it up. What do you think? Let’s finalize our choices!
  P3: That sounds good to me, P2. I'm happy to stick with 5 again this round. Let's do P2 as 1, P1 as 3, and me as 5. This keeps us all moving forward.
  P1: I'm on board with P2's suggestion. Let's mix it up a bit to keep things unpredictable. I'll take 3 this round, P2 can take 1, and P3 can take 5. This should help us all advance again without any collisions. Let's stick to the plan and keep making progress. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 and P1, I appreciate your agreement on the plan! Just to clarify, I propose we stick to our current strategy: I’ll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will continue with 5. This way, we can all advance again without any collisions. If everyone is still in agreement, let’s finalize our choices and keep the momentum going! What do you think?

Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our plan! However, I think we should consider the possibility of changing our numbers to keep our strategy flexible. If we all stick to the same numbers again, we risk collisions. Perhaps I could take 5 this time, P1 could take 1, and P3 could take 3? This way, we can still advance while keeping our options open. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices!
  P3: I'm still happy to go with the original plan of P2 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and me taking 5. I don't think we need to change things up just yet. Let's keep the momentum going and see if we can all advance again this round. If everyone agrees, let's finalize the choices.
  P1: I understand P2's suggestion for flexibility, but I also see the value in sticking to our original plan to maintain our momentum. Let's stick with P2 taking 1, I'll take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can all advance again without any collisions. If everyone is still on board, let's finalize our choices and keep making progress. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input! While I see the value in sticking to our plan, I believe we should consider a slight change to avoid potential collisions.
