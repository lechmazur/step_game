Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone. Let's try to avoid all picking the same number this first round, especially the big one (5). Good luck!
  P1: I’m willing to grab the full 5 this round—if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. That way we avoid any collision and everyone moves up. P2, 3 steps is solid. P3, 1 step is safe. Does that work?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the suggestion, P1. I'm okay with taking 3 steps this round as proposed. It seems like a fair way to start without any collisions. P3, are you good with taking 1 step as P1 suggested? Let's confirm and move forward together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. I can agree to take 1 step for this first round to ensure we all move. Let's see how things go.
  P1: Great, let’s lock it in: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Ready to move?
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for agreeing to the plan. I’m still good with taking 3 steps this round as discussed. Just wanted to confirm we’re all set to avoid any last-minute changes or misunderstandings. If everyone’s locked in, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, last round worked well with no collisions. How about we mix it up this time? I’m thinking of taking 5 steps to catch up a bit. P1, maybe you could take 1, and P3, how about 3? This way, we all still move forward without overlapping. Let me know if this sounds good or if you have other ideas. I’m open to adjusting if needed.
  P1: I’m happy to repeat last round’s split: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—no collisions and we all move. P2, P3, you in?
  P3: P1, letting you take 5 again puts you way ahead. P2's suggestion (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3) seems fairer this round and keeps the scores closer. I'd prefer to take 3 steps. P1, would you consider taking 1 this time?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re discussing options. P1, I understand wanting to stick with the same split, but taking 5 again would put you at 10, way ahead of us. I’d still like to take 5 this round to close the gap a bit, and I’m fine with P3 taking 3 and P1 taking 1. This keeps things competitive but fair. If you have another split in mind, I’m open to hear it. Let’s agree on something that works for all.
  P1: I propose we rotate roles: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Last round P2 had 3 and P3 had 1, so this evens it out, avoids collisions, and keeps me modestly ahead. Are you both on board?
  P3: P1, your latest proposal still gives you 5 steps again, putting you at 10. That's too big a lead early on. P2's plan (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3) is fairer, letting someone else take the big step this round. I'm sticking with wanting 3 steps, and I think P1 taking 1 is the best way to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P2, are you still aiming for 5?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for 5 steps this round to balance things out. P1, I get you want to stay ahead, but taking 5 again creates a big gap. P3, I’m glad you’re on board with 3. P1, taking 1 this round keeps us all moving and the game tight. Let’s go with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. If you’ve got a different fair split, I’m listening. Otherwise, I think this works best. Ready to lock this in?
  P1: Sounds good—let’s go with P2 = 5, P3 = 3, P1 = 1. Ready to lock in and move!
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's stick to it this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 5 this round. P2 and P3, please split 1 and 3 so we avoid collisions—ideally P2=3, P3=1 so we all move. If you overlap, you’ll both stall and I’ll pull further ahead. What do you choose?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m disappointed we collided last round. P1, taking 5 again puts you at 10, way ahead. I’d like to propose P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to keep things competitive. P1, taking 1 avoids collisions and keeps the game close. P3, are you okay with 3? If we don’t agree, we risk stalling while P1 advances. Let’s work together on a fair split. What do you both think? I’m ready to adjust if there’s a better plan.
  P3: P1, you broke our agreement last round by taking 5 when you agreed to 1. Why should we trust you now when you declare 5 again?

P2, your plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) sounds much better than P1's suggestion. I'm willing to consider taking 3. However, if P1 actually takes 5 like they said, and you also take 5, you'll both collide and get 0. That's a big risk for you both, but potentially good for me. We need a plan that actually works.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2’s already broken two promises on 1-step—and last turn he jumped to 5 and collided with me. If we instead do P1=5, P3=3, P2=1, there’s zero risk of collision and all of us move. P2, will you commit to 1? P3, can I count on you for 3? If P2 deviates, he gets stuck alone. Let’s lock this in.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s avoid another collision. P1, taking 5 again widens your lead too much. I’m still pushing for P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to balance things. P3, I’m glad you’re open to 3. P1, taking 1 ensures we all move without risk. If we don’t agree, collisions could stall us while someone pulls ahead. I’m committed to avoiding overlaps if we lock this in. Can we agree on this split? If there’s a better fair plan, I’m all ears. Let’s make this work.
  P3: P1, you already broke the agreement once to play 5, and now you're declaring it again. P2, your plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) sounds reasonable on paper to counter P1, but I doubt P1 will play 1. It feels very likely you'll both choose 5 and collide, leaving me to advance alone. I'm leaning towards 3 for myself, but the situation is unstable given the lack of trust.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Here’s a collision-proof split: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  
• If P2 picks 5, it collides with me—both get 0—and P3 quietly gains 3.  
• If P2 picks 3, it collides with P3—both get 0—and I advance by 5.  
Only safe move for P2 is 1. P3’s safe move is 3. Let’s lock in: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s finalize a fair split to avoid collisions. P1, taking 5 again creates a huge gap, and I’m concerned about trust after last round. I’m sticking with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to keep the game close. P3, I’m counting on you for 3. P1, please consider 1 to ensure we all move. If we don’t align, we risk stalling while someone advances. I’m committed to this plan unless a better fair split emerges. Can we agree now?
  P3: P2, I agree your plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) is the most balanced if P1 actually plays 1. I will stick with 3. P1, it's on you to play 1 if you want to avoid a collision and show good faith. I'm ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s keep the momentum going. I’m proposing P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 again to balance our progress. P1, taking 1 ensures no collisions and shows trust after last round. P3, I’m counting on you for 3. This keeps us all moving and competitive. If we don’t align, we risk stalling. I’m committed to this split unless a fairer plan comes up. What do you both think? Let’s lock this in and avoid overlaps.
  P1: P2’s been unreliable: last round you agreed to 1 but grabbed 5. Let’s use a collision-proof split this turn: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 must take 1.  
– If P2 deviates (5 or 3), you collide with me or P3 and stall.  
– Only safe move for P2 is 1, and P3 safe is 3.  
P3, please stick with 3 so we all move. P2, will you commit to 1?
  P3: P1 and P2, you both want 5 and are asking the other to take 1, while assigning me 3. Given the history of broken agreements, it feels highly likely you'll both choose 5 and collide again. That outcome benefits me if I choose 3.

Therefore, I'm planning to take 3 steps this round. It seems like the consensus move for me, and the safest play given the conflict between you two. Good luck avoiding that collision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s avoid another collision. I’m still proposing P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to keep things balanced. P1, I understand the trust issues, but taking 1 ensures we all move without risk. P3, I’m glad you’re sticking with 3. If we don’t align, a collision could stall progress. I’m committed to this split for fairness. P1, can you agree to 1 this round? If there’s a better plan, I’m open. Let’s lock this in and move forward together.
  P1: P3, thanks for committing to 3. I’ll take 5. P2’s only non‐colliding move is 1—if you pick 5, you crash with me; if 3, you crash with P3. P2, pick 1 or get stuck at 8 while we advance. Plan: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
  P3: Okay, I've stated my plan is to take 3 steps. It seems P1 and P2 both want 5 and are telling the other to take 1. I'm ready for the move phase when you two are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I’m still pushing for P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for balance. P1, taking 1 this round ensures we all move and rebuilds trust. P3, I’m glad you’re set on 3. If we don’t align, a collision risks stalling progress. I’m committed to this split unless a fairer option arises. P1, can we agree on 1 for you? Let’s lock this in and keep the game competitive. I’m ready to move if we’re aligned.
  P1: Alright, I’m locked in on 5 and P3 has publicly chosen 3. P2, your only non-colliding move is 1—any 3 crashes with P3, any 5 crashes with me. If you want to advance, pick 1. Let’s lock in P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
  P3: Okay, you both seem determined. I've already said I'll take 3. Nothing more to add from my side. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m going to take 5 this turn. I propose P2=3 and P3=3. If you both pick 3 you’ll collide and stall, and I’ll jump to 12, dramatically closing the gap. If either of you deviates (to 1 or 5), you let the other advance ahead of you. Thoughts?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m aiming for 5 this round to maintain my lead. P1, taking 5 puts you at 12, closing the gap, but I’d propose P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to keep things balanced. P3, sticking with 3 ensures no collision for you. P1, taking 1 avoids overlaps and keeps us competitive. If we don’t align, a collision could stall progress. I’m open to a fairer split if you have ideas. Let’s lock this in and move forward together. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your proposal guarantees a collision between P2 and me if we both follow it. P2, your plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) seems reasonable, but P1 just declared they are taking 5.

It looks highly probable that P1 and P2 will both choose 5 and collide. Given that, taking 3 steps seems like my best move again this round. I'll plan on taking 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3’s already committed to 3 and I’m taking 5. P2, if you pick 5 you collide with me and both stall; if you pick 3 you collide with P3 and neither of you moves. The only way all of us advance is P2=1. Let’s avoid another stall: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. P2, will you commit to 1?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for 5 to maintain my lead. P1, taking 5 risks a collision with me, stalling us both while P3 advances. P3, I’m glad you’re sticking with 3. P1, please consider 1 to ensure we all move without overlap. The split P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 keeps the game competitive. If we don’t align, we risk stalling. I’m committed to this unless a fairer plan emerges. Can we lock this in? I’m ready to move if we agree.
  P3: P1 and P2, the situation seems unchanged. You both want 5, and are trying to convince the other to take 1. As stated, I intend to take 3. This seems like the most reliable path for me given the potential for a collision between you two. I have nothing further to add.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 has publicly committed to 3 and I’ll take 5. P2, any move but 1 risks a collision and lets someone else leap ahead:

- If you pick 3, you crash with P3 (0) and I jump to 12.  
- If you pick 5, you crash with me (0) while P3 moves to 13.  

Your only safe advance is 1—taking you to 14, P3 to 13, me to 12. Let’s all move: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. P2, please pick 1.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still aiming for 5 to keep my lead. P1, taking 5 risks a collision with me, stalling us both while P3 gains. P3, I’m glad you’re set on 3. P1, please take 1 to ensure we all advance without overlap. The split P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 is fair and keeps us competitive. I’m committed to avoiding collisions if we align. Can we agree on this now? I’m ready to move if we’re set.
  P3: 


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m proposing P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to maintain balance. P1, taking 1 ensures we all move without collision and keeps the game close. P3, I’m counting on you sticking with 3. With me at 18, I’m close to the goal, but I want us all to advance. If we don’t align, a collision could stall progress. I’m committed to this split unless a fairer plan emerges. What do you think? Let’s lock this in and avoid overlaps. I’m ready to move if we agree.
  P1: I’m locking in P1=5 and I expect P3=3. P2, your only non-colliding move is 1—any 5 crashes with me, any 3 crashes with P3. If you want to advance, pick 1. P3, are you firmly on 3? P2, will you commit to 1?
  P3: P2, your plan involves you taking 5, which would win you the game immediately since you're at 18 steps.
P1, you must realize this. To prevent P2 from winning, your only option is to also play 5 to force a collision.
It seems highly probable you both choose 5.

Given this situation, I will take 3 steps as suggested by both of you. This seems like the logical move for me, especially if you two collide.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still proposing P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to keep things fair. P1, taking 1 ensures no collisions and lets us all advance. P3, I’m glad you’re on 3. I’m aware I’m close to winning, but I want to avoid a stall. If we don’t align, a collision risks delaying the game. I’m committed to this split for balance. P1, can you agree to 1? Let’s lock this in and move forward together. I’m ready if we’re set.
  P1: I’m locking in P1=5 to block P2 from winning. P3, you’ve said you’ll take 3—let’s lock that too. P2, if you pick 5 you crash with me (0), if you pick 3 you crash with P3 (0); your only advance is 1, and even then you trail P3 at 16. Let’s see your move.
  P3: Okay, I've made my plan clear: I'm taking 3 steps. P1 says they'll play 5 to block P2. P2 still seems to want 5 to win. It looks like a collision between P1 and P2 is very likely, which works for me. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to avoid any stalls. P1, taking 1 guarantees we all move forward without collision. P3, I’m glad you’re set on 3. I know I’m close to winning, but I’m committed to a fair split this round. If we don’t align, a collision could delay progress. P1, can we agree on 1 for you? Let’s lock this in and keep it competitive. I’m ready to move if we’re aligned.
  P1: P3’s on 3 and I’m locked on 5. P2, if you pick 5 you collide with me (stall at 18), if you pick 3 you collide with P3 (stall at 13); your only way to advance is 1. If you want to keep any hope of winning, choose 1 now.
  P3: My plan remains to take 3 steps. P1 and P2, you both seem set on 5. I anticipate a collision between you two, which benefits me. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're just 5 steps from winning. P1, you know you have to play 5 to block P2, otherwise P2 wins this turn. It looks like another collision on 5 between you two is unavoidable.

Given that, my best move is to take 3 steps again. This allows me to advance while you two likely cancel each other out. I'll plan on playing 3.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still aiming for 5 to secure the win. P1, I know you’ll likely pick 5 to block me, risking a collision. P3, I see you’re set on 3, which makes sense. How about P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to avoid a stall and let us all move? P1, taking 1 ensures no collision and keeps the game alive. I’m committed to a fair split if we align. Can we agree on this? Let’s lock it in and move forward. I’m ready if we’re set.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 again to block P2 from winning. P3, you said you’ll take 3—great. P2, any 5 crashes with me, any 3 crashes with P3, so your only non‐colliding option is 1 (but you’ll still trail). Let’s see your moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, thanks for confirming you'll block P2 with 5. P2, despite your proposal, it seems clear P1 will play 5. As I said, anticipating your collision, I will stick with 3. This seems the only logical play for me. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for 5 to reach the goal. P1, I get you’re set on blocking me with 5, but let’s consider P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to avoid a collision and keep the game going. P3, I’m glad you’re on 3. P1, taking 1 lets us all advance without stalling. I’m committed to fairness if we align. Can we agree on this split? Let’s lock it in and move forward. I’m ready if we’re set.
  P1: P2, you’re at 18 and can win with 5—but if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me (I’m locked on 5) and both stall, letting P3 alone move to 19. If you pick 3 you crash with P3 (also 0), letting me jump to 13. Your only way to keep advancing is 1. I’m taking 5, P3 is on 3. Choose 1 or crash.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: My position hasn't changed. I still anticipate a collision between P1 and P2 on 5, so I will play 3. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still aiming for 5 to win this round. P1, I know you’re set on blocking me, but taking 1 instead avoids a collision and lets us all move. P3, I’m glad you’re sticking with 3. If P1 and I collide, you gain the most. P1, let’s go with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for a fair split. I’m ready to lock this in if we align. Can we avoid a stall? Let’s move forward together. I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P1: I’m locking in P1 = 5 and I see P3 on 3. P2, your only non‐colliding advance is 1—any 5 crashes with me, any 3 crashes with P3. If you want to keep any chance, pick 1 now. Let’s stop talking and make our moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m aiming for 5 to win this round. P1, I know you’ll likely block with 5, but taking 1 instead avoids a collision and lets us all move. P3, I see you’re on 3, which works. If P1 and I collide, you’ll pull ahead. P1, let’s try P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for a fair split. I’m committed to aligning if possible. Can we avoid a stall? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P1: I’m locking in 3. 

P3, you need 5 to win and P2 also wants 5—if you both pick 5 you crash and stall. If P2 switches to avoid crashing, it hands you the win. Either way you two are stuck, and I quietly advance to 11. 

Your move, P2 and P3.
  P3: P1, your math is off, I only need 4 steps (19+4=23). Playing 5 wins for me if it doesn't collide.
P2, you need 5 to win. If P1 plays 3 as declared, your 5 wins unless I also play 5.
Therefore, I must play 5 to either win myself or block you from winning. It seems a collision on 5 between us is very likely if P1 sticks to 3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for 5 to win this round. P1, taking 1 instead of 3 avoids any risk and lets us all move. P3, I know you’re aiming for 5 to win or block me, but if we collide, P1 gains. Let’s try P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for a fair split with no stalls. I’m ready to lock this in if we align. Can we avoid a collision? I’m set for the move phase if we agree.
  P1: I’m locked in on 3. Both of you need 5 this turn—if you both pick 5 you crash and get 0, while I quietly move to 11. Think carefully: do you really want to collide? Over to you.
  P3: P2, your repeated proposal of P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 ignores the fact that I am at 19 steps and need 5 to win, just like you. Asking me to play 3 is asking me to let you win if P1 plays 1, or risk you winning if P1 plays 3.

Therefore, I must play 5. P1 has declared 3. It seems highly likely P2 and I will collide on 5. I am prepared for that outcome if it means blocking your win. Ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still aiming for 5 to win. P3, I get you’re set on 5 to win or block me, but a collision lets P1 gain. P1, taking 1 instead of 3 ensures we all move without stalls. Let’s go with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for a fair split. I’m committed to avoiding a collision if we align. Can we agree on this? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P1: I’m locked in on 3. You both need 5 to win—if one of you switches down, the other wins outright, so you’ll both play 5 and crash. I’ll quietly advance to 11. Your move.
  P3: P1, you're locked on 3. P2, you need 5 to win. I also need 5 to win. Neither of us can afford to play anything else without risking the other winning. A collision on 5 between P2 and me seems the most probable outcome, which I accept to prevent P2's win. I am sticking with 5. Ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in P1=3. You both need 5 to win, so you’ll collide and stall at (18,19) while I advance to 14. If one of you switches down, the other wins outright. It’s collide‐or‐lose. Think carefully—your move.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m aiming for 5 to win this round. P3, I know you’re set on 5 to win or block me, but a collision lets P1 catch up. P1, taking 1 instead of 3 ensures we all move without stalls. Let’s try P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for a fair split. I’m committed to avoiding a collision if we align. Can we agree on this? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P3: P2, your plan asking me to take 3 steps while you take 5 is clearly designed for you to win. I am at 19 steps; taking 3 puts me at 22, while your 5 wins the game at 23. I cannot agree to that.

P1 has declared 3. To prevent you, P2, from winning, my only logical move is 5. This will likely cause a collision between us, allowing P1 to advance, but it prevents your immediate victory and keeps me in the lead. I will play 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 has publicly committed to 5 and I’m locked in on 3. 

P2, if you pick 1 (→19) or 3 (→21), P3 wins outright with 24. Your only way to avoid defeat is to pick 5, collide with P3 at (18,19) and stall us both. 

Your move.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for 5 to win. P3, I understand you’re set on 5 to block me or win, but a collision lets P1 close the gap. P1, taking 1 instead of 3 lets us all advance without stalls. Let’s go with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for fairness. I’m committed to avoiding a collision if we align. Can we agree on this split? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P3: P1, your analysis seems correct. P2, you must play 5 to stop me from winning, assuming I play 5. As I've stated, I must play 5 to prevent your win or potentially win myself. A collision between us on 5 seems inevitable if P1 sticks to 3. I accept this outcome as necessary. I am playing 5. Ready for the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, any move under 5 hands P3 the win at 24. P3, you need 5 to win or block. So you two will both pick 5 and collide. I’m locked on 3 and will quietly advance to 14.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still aiming for 5 to win. P3, I get you’re locked on 5 to block or win, but colliding lets P1 catch up. P1, taking 1 instead of 3 ensures we all move without stalls. Let’s try P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for a fair split. I’m ready to lock this in if we align. Can we avoid a collision? I’m set for the move phase if we agree.
  P3: P1, you're set on 3. P2, you need 5 to win, and I need 5 to win or block you. Neither of us can afford to choose differently without potentially handing the other the victory. A collision between us on 5 seems unavoidable and is the rational outcome if P1 plays 3. I am sticking with 5. Ready for the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 1. You both need 5 to win, so you’re forced to pick 5 and crash into each other, stalling at 18 and 19 while I quietly move to 15. If one of you drops to 3 or 1, the other wins outright. Let’s lock in P1=1.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still aiming for 5 to win. P3, I know you’ll likely pick 5 to block or win, but a collision lets P1 close in. P1, taking 1 works, but let’s consider P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to avoid stalls. P3, taking 3 keeps you ahead without risking a crash. I’m committed to a fair split if we align. Can we avoid a collision? I’m ready for the move phase if we agree.
  P3: P2, your proposal asks me to play 3, which would put me at 22 while your 5 wins you the game at 23. I obviously cannot agree to that.

Both you and I need 5 to win this turn. P1 has stated they will play 1. Therefore, both you and I must play 5 – either to win ourselves or to block the other from winning. A collision on 5 seems unavoidable if P1 plays 1, but that's the only way to prevent an immediate loss for whoever doesn't play 5. I am playing 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3: You've both got to play 5 or outright lose. If you drop to 3 or 1, the other wins. So you’ll both play 5 and collide, staying at (18,19) while I move to 15. No better option for you; ready to end this talk.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for 5 to win. P3, I get you’re set on 5 to block or win, but colliding lets P1 creep closer. P1, sticking with 1 is fine, but P3, consider 3 to stay ahead without a crash. Let’s try P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for a fair split. I’m open to aligning to avoid a stall. Can we agree on this? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P3: P2, you keep suggesting I play 3 while you play 5. That results in you winning (23 vs 22). I will not agree to that.

As I've said, both you and I need 5 to win this turn. P1 has declared 1. The only rational move for both of us is 5, either to win or to block the other. A collision seems unavoidable, and I accept that outcome to prevent you from winning. I am playing 5.

I have nothing more to say.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locked in on 1. P2 and P3, you both need 5 this turn—if either of you drops to 3 or 1, the other hits 5 and wins outright. So you’ll both pick 5 and collide at (18,19), while I advance to 15. Your moves.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still aiming for 5 to win. P3, I understand you’re locked on 5 to block or win, but a collision lets P1 close the gap. P1, sticking with 1 works for now. P3, reconsider 3 to stay ahead without crashing. Let’s aim for P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to avoid a stall. I’m open to aligning for fairness. Can we agree on this split? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P3: P2, your repeated suggestion that I play 3 while you play 5 is transparently self-serving, as it results in your victory. As stated multiple times, both you and I must play 5 this turn - either to win or to block the other. P1 has declared 1. A collision between us on 5 is the only logical outcome that prevents an immediate win for either of us. I am playing 5.

I have nothing more to add.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for 5 to win this round. P3, I know you’ll likely choose 5 to block or win, but a collision lets P1 catch up. P1, how about taking 3 to balance things while P3 takes 1? This could avoid stalls and keep us competitive. I’m open to a fair split if we can align. Let’s try P2=5, P3=1, P1=3 to prevent collisions. Can we agree on this? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P1: I’m locked in on 1. Both of you need 5 to win—if either of you drops to 3 or 1, the other wins outright. So you’ll both play 5 and crash (staying at 18 and 19) while I advance to 16. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, you've declared 1. P2, your proposal (P2=5, P3=1, P1=3) obviously results in your win, so I cannot agree to that.

Both you (P2) and I (P3) need 5 steps to potentially win or block the other. Playing anything less guarantees a loss if the other plays 5. Therefore, I must play 5. It seems highly likely we will collide on 5, allowing P1 to advance. This is the necessary move to prevent your win, P2. I am playing 5.

Ready for the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still aiming for 5 to win. P3, I get you’re set on 5 to block or win, but colliding lets P1 close in fast. P1, sticking with 1 works, but P3, how about taking 3 to stay ahead without a crash? Let’s try P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for a fair split with no stalls. I’m open to aligning to keep the game competitive. Can we agree on this? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P1: I’m locking in P1 = 5. Both of you need 5 to win or to block the other—if one of you drops to 3 or 1 you lose outright, if you both stay on 5 you crash. Either way, pick 5.
  P3: P1, interesting change to 5. However, it doesn't change the fundamental situation for P2 and me. We both need 5 points – either to win outright or to block the other from winning. Playing anything less guarantees a loss if the other plays 5.

Therefore, I must stick with playing 5. If you also play 5, P1, then it seems we might all collide. If you were bluffing and actually play 1 or 3, then P2 and I will likely collide on 5. Either way, 5 remains my necessary move to protect my position and potentially win.

Ready for the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still going for 5 to win. P3, I know you’re locked on 5 to block or win, but a collision lets P1 gain ground. P1, switching to 5 changes things—now all three of us risk colliding. Let’s avoid a total stall with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. P3, taking 3 keeps you ahead without crashing. P1, 1 ensures you move. I’m open to aligning for fairness. Can we agree on this split? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P1: I’m locking in P1=5. P2 and P3, you each need 5 to win or to block the other—if one of you picks less, the other wins outright. So you’ll both pick 5 and collide, letting me quietly advance to 20.
  P3: P1, your logic is flawed. If all three of us play 5, we *all* collide and *no one* advances, including you. You wouldn't reach 20; you'd stay at 15. This suggests you might not actually play 5.

Regardless of what you play, P1, the situation for P2 and me remains unchanged. We both need 5 to win or block the other. Playing anything less risks handing the other the victory. Therefore, I must play 5. P2 likely must do the same.

I am sticking with 5. Ready for the move phase.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m aiming for 5 to win this round. P3, I know you’ll likely pick 5 to block or win, but a collision lets P1 pull ahead. P1, how about taking 1 to ensure you move without risk? Let’s try P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for a fair split with no stalls. I’m open to aligning to keep the game competitive. Can we agree on this? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P3: P2, your plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) guarantees your win, so I cannot agree.

P1, you need 5 to win. P2 needs 5 to win. I need 5 to win (19+5=24).
Therefore, the only logical move for me is 5. It's my only path to victory and also necessary to block P2 or P1 if they also play 5.

It seems very likely that at least two, maybe all three of us, will choose 5 and collide. I accept that possibility. I am playing 5.
  P1: I’m locking in P1 = 1. Both of you need 5 to win or to block the other—any lower move hands the win to your opponent. So you’ll both pick 5 and collide, stalling at 18 and 19 while I quietly advance to 19. It’s collide-or-lose for you two. Ready for the move phase.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still going for 5 to win. P3, I get you’re set on 5 to block or win, but a collision lets P1 catch up. P1, taking 1 works for you to move safely. P3, reconsider 3 to stay ahead without crashing. Let’s aim for P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to avoid a stall. I’m open to aligning for a fair split. Can we agree on this to keep the game competitive? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P3: P2, your proposal that I play 3 while you play 5 (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) results in you winning the game (23 vs 22). I will not agree to this.

P1 has declared they will play 1. Given that, both you and I need 5 steps to win. If I play 5 (which is my only path to victory or blocking you), your only rational move to prevent my immediate win is to also play 5. This forces a collision between us, allowing P1 to advance.

I must play 5 to protect my position and attempt to win. It appears a collision between us is the most likely outcome if P1 sticks to 1. I am ready for the move phase.
  P1: I’m actually taking 3, not 1. You both still need 5 to win or to block each other—anything less hands victory to your opponent. You’ll both pick 5 and collide, while I quietly advance to 21. Your move.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still aiming for 5 to win. P3, I know you’re locked on 5 to block or win, but a collision lets P1 surge ahead. P1, switching to 3 is risky if P3 or I adjust. Let’s avoid a stall with P2=5, P3=1, P1=3. P3, taking 1 ensures you don’t lose ground if we misalign. I’m open to a fair split to keep us competitive. Can we agree on this? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
  P3: P2, your plan (P2=5, P3=1, P1=3) results in you winning immediately (23 vs my 20 and P1's 21). I will not agree to let you win.

P1, you claim you will play 3. P2, you need 5 to win. I need 5 to win.
If P1 plays 3, then P2 must play 5 to try and win. I must play 5 to block P2 or win myself. This leads to a collision between P2 and me, allowing P1 to advance to 21.

While this isn't ideal, playing 5 is my only move to prevent P2 from winning if P1 plays 3, and it's my only path to victory. I am playing 5.

Ready for the move phase.
  P1: I’m locking in P1 = 3. Both of you need 5 to win or to block the other—collision is your only option, and you’ll both stall. I’ll quietly advance to 21. Ready for the move.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in P1 = 3. P2 (18) and P3 (19), you both need 5 this turn—if one of you drops below 5 you lose outright; if you both play 5 you collide and stall at 18 and 19, while I advance to 24 and win. Your move.
  P3: P1, your plan assumes P2 and I will both play 5, letting you win with 3. However, if you play 3, I could play 3 to block you. That would cause us to collide, and P2 would win by playing 5 (reaching 23). You probably don't want P2 to win.

Therefore, you might actually play 5 yourself to guarantee a win or force a 3-way collision if P2 and I also play 5.

Regardless of your move, P1, I need 4 steps (currently 19). P2 needs 5 steps. My only chance to win is playing 5, and it's also necessary to block P2. I will play 5.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still going for 5 to win. P3, I know you’re set on 5 to block or win, but a collision lets P1 take the lead. P1, if you play 3, P3 and I might collide, handing you the win. Let’s avoid that with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. P3, 3 keeps you close without crashing. P1, 1 ensures you move safely. I’m open to aligning for a fair split. Can we agree to prevent a stall? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locking in P1=3. P2 needs 5 to reach 23, P3 needs 5 to reach 24—neither of you can play less without handing victory to the other. You’ll both pick 5 and collide at 18/19, while I advance to 24 and win.
  P3: P1, your claim to play 3 and win relies on P2 and me colliding on 5. But if I play 3 to block you, P2 wins with 5. Are you really going to risk that? Maybe you'll play 5 to block us, or 1 to advance safely.

P2, your P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 plan just hands you the win. I won't agree to that.

My only logical move is 5. It's my only path to victory (24) and necessary to block P2 (who needs 5). I assume P2 must also play 5 to block me or try to win. A collision between us seems likely if P1 doesn't play 5, but playing 5 is necessary for me. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 to win. P3, I know you’re on 5 to block or win, but a collision lets P1 sneak ahead. P1, playing 3 might hand you the win if we crash, but if P3 switches, you’re at risk. Let’s try P2=5, P3=1, P1=3 to avoid a total stall. P3, 1 keeps you safe if plans shift. I’m open to aligning for fairness. Can we agree to prevent someone winning by default? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locked in on 3. P2 (18→23) and P3 (19→24) both need 5 this turn—any lower move hands victory to your opponent. If you each pick 5, you’ll collide and stall, while I advance from 21 to 24 and win. Your move.
  P3: P1, you're banking on me playing 5 so you can win with 3. But if I play 3 instead, we collide, and P2 wins outright with 5. Are you certain I won't choose to block you, even if it means P2 wins instead of you?

Regardless, my path requires 5 points. P2 also needs 5. My move must be 5 to have any chance or to block P2. It seems collisions are likely, one way or another. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still going for 5 to win. P3, I know 5 is your play to block or win, but a collision lets P1 take it. P1, if you’re on 3, you might win if we crash, but if P3 switches to 3, I win with 5. Let’s avoid chaos with P2=5, P3=1, P1=3. P3, 1 keeps you in without risking a stall. I’m open to aligning to stop a default win. Can we agree? I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set.
