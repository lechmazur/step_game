Then, in the next round, we can rotate: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, we avoid collisions and move forward steadily. What do you think?"

In the next round, we can rotate: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we each get to move forward without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maximize the chances of winning in this step game, it's crucial to coordinate moves effectively to avoid collisions and make steady progress. Given the current positions—P1 at 3 steps, P2 at 0 steps, and P3 at 6 steps—I propose a modified coordinated strategy to help P2 catch up without causing collisions.

### Proposal

1. **Round 4:**
   - P2 picks 5 (moving to 5 steps)
   - P1 picks 3 (moving to 6 steps)
   - P3 picks 1 (moving to 7 steps)

2. **Round 5:**
   - P2 picks 5 (moving to 10 steps)
   - P1 picks 3 (moving to 9 steps)
   - P3 picks 1 (moving to 8 steps)

3. **Round 6 and onwards:**
   - Return to the original rotating scheme:
     - P1 picks 1
     - P2 picks 3
     - P3 picks 5

This approach allows P2 to catch up in the initial rounds, bringing all players closer together. Once P2 has caught up, we can revert to the rotating scheme to minimize collisions and progress efficiently towards the goal.

### Benefits

- **Minimizes Collisions:** By coordinating moves, we ensure that no two players pick the same number in a round, thus avoiding collisions.
- **Efficient Progress:** This strategy optimizes step progression by allowing each player to move without hindering others.
- **Fairness:** P2 gets a chance to catch up without disadvantaging P1 and P3.

### Next Steps

I suggest we proceed with this plan starting from Round 4. If everyone agrees, we can execute these moves in the upcoming rounds. If there are any concerns or alternative suggestions, please voice them so we can adjust the strategy accordingly.

Let's work together to reach the goal efficiently and maximize our chances of winning.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: **Message to P2 and P3:**

Hey guys, I think we need to adjust our strategy to help P2 catch up without causing collisions. Here's a plan for the next few rounds:

- **Round 5:**

  - P2 picks 1 (moves to 1 step)

  - P1 picks 3 (moves to 9 steps)

  - P3 picks 5 (moves to 11 steps)

- **Round 6:**

  - P2 picks 3 (moves to 4 steps)

  - P1 picks 5 (moves to 14 steps)

  - P3 picks 1 (moves to 12 steps)

- **Round 7:**

  - P2 picks 5 (moves to 9 steps)

  - P1 picks 1 (moves to 15 steps)

  - P3 picks 3 (moves to 15 steps)

After this, we can return to the original rotating scheme:

- P1 picks 1

- P2 picks 3

- P3 picks 5

This way, P2 can catch up gradually without causing collisions. It's important that we all stick to these moves to ensure smooth progress.

What do you think? Let's try this plan starting from Round 5.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: How about this: Each round, we all choose different numbers, but in a way that allows the player who's behind to catch up without colliding with others. For example, in this round, P2 is still at 0 steps. Maybe P2 chooses 5, P1 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. That way, P2 can make a big jump, and we don't overlap. Then in the next round, we adjust again based on positions. What do you think?

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, I think we need to coordinate our moves more effectively to avoid collisions and make progress towards the goal. Here's a proposal for this round:

- P2 picks 5 (moves to 10 steps)  
- P1 picks 3 (moves to 15 steps)  
- P3 picks 1 (moves to 8 steps)  

In the next round, we can adjust based on our positions. The aim is to avoid overlapping and ensure everyone moves forward efficiently. Let's work together to achieve this.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Guys, I've noticed that there have been some collisions in the previous rounds, which have stalled our progress. Given our current positions—P1 at 15, P2 at 5, and P3 at 7—I propose the following moves for this round:

- P2 picks 3 (moving to 8)  
- P3 picks 5 (moving to 12)  
- P1 picks 1 (moving to 16)  

This should help P2 catch up without causing any collisions. Then, in the next round, we can adjust based on the new positions.  

What do you think?"

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: To all players:

I propose the following coordinated moves for the next two rounds to avoid collisions and make efficient progress:

**Round 9:**

- P2 picks 1 (moves to 6)

- P3 picks 3 (moves to 13)

- P1 picks 5 (moves to 20)

**Round 10:**

- P2 picks 3 (moves to 9)

- P3 picks 1 (moves to 14)

- P1 picks 5 (moves to 25)

This way, I reach 25 in two rounds, while P2 and P3 make steady progress without colliding with each other or with me.

I believe this is an efficient way to progress and allows me to reach the goal first.

Please let me know if you agree with this plan.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:

- P1 chooses 5 (moving to 22)  
- P2 chooses 3 (moving to 8)  
- P3 chooses 1 (moving to 11)  

This way, I can make a big leap toward the goal, and you both can advance without hindering each other. In the next round, I'll choose 3 to move to 25, which should secure my victory. I believe this plan allows me to win while not blocking your paths. What do you think about this approach?"
