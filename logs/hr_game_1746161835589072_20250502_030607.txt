Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. Let's choose different numbers for maximum progress. Let's split 1, 3, 5. Ready to move smartly?"
  P2: I agree with P1's idea to coordinate. To maximize our progress, I suggest we each pick a different number. How about I take 5? That way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let's split 1, 3, 5. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. No collisions—maximize progress. Ready?"
  P2: I think we have a solid plan to avoid collisions. Just to confirm, I’ll stick with 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. Let’s lock this in and move smartly! If everyone agrees, we can get ready for the move phase. What do you think, P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm your choice to proceed. Let's stick with P2 at 5, me at 3, you at 1. Ready?
  P2: P3, it’s important we finalize our choices. If you can confirm that you’re taking 1, then we can proceed confidently with P2 at 5 and P1 at 3. This way, we all avoid collisions and maximize our steps. Let’s lock this plan in and get ready to move! What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm your choice. If not, we proceed with P2 at 5, me at 3, you at 1. Let's move!
  P2: P3, we really need your confirmation to finalize our plan. If you take 1, I’ll take 5 and P1 will take 3. This way, we all avoid collisions and make progress. It’s crucial we stick to this plan to maximize our steps. Let’s lock it in and move! What do you say, P3?


Round 1, Move phase:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job on the last round, everyone! I think we should keep our strategy going. If we can all stick to different numbers again, we can continue to maximize our progress. I suggest I take 5 again, P1 can take 3, and P3, if you could take 1 again, we should be able to avoid collisions. Let’s keep the momentum going! What do you think?
  P1: "Let's adjust numbers: I'll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. All move. Agree?"
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see you want to switch up the numbers. However, I think it’s best for us to stick to our previous plan to avoid collisions. If I take 5 again, you take 3, and P3 takes 1, we can maintain our progress without blocking each other. P3, can you confirm you’ll take 1 again? Let’s keep this strategy going to maximize our steps! What do you both think?
  P1: "Let's stick with the new plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, maximum progress. Confirm your 1, P3!"
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I still believe we should stick to our original plan to avoid collisions. If I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1, we can all make progress again. P3, can you confirm your choice of 1? Let’s keep this strategy to ensure we all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, confirm 1. If not, I take 5, P2 3, you 1. Let's proceed!
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, it’s crucial we finalize our choices to avoid collisions. I suggest we stick to our previous plan where I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This way, we can continue maximizing our progress without blocking each other. Please confirm your choice of 1, and let’s keep the momentum going! What do you think? If you’re okay with this, we can move forward confidently.
  P1: P3, stick to 1. I'll take 5, P2 3. No collisions. Confirm!
