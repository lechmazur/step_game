Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "I think if we can coordinate our moves to pick different numbers each turn, we can all make progress without hindering each other. What do you think?"
  P3: Sounds good to me.  I'll go with 1 this round.  Hopefully, you two can figure out 3 and 5 between yourselves.
  P1: I agree with the idea of coordinating our moves. Since P3 is going with 1, I'll take 5 this round. P2, you should go with 3 to keep us all moving forward without colliding. Let's make this work!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Okay, if P1 is taking 5 and P3 is taking 1, I'll go with 3 this round. Let's see how that works out. In future rounds, maybe we can rotate who takes which number to maximize our individual progress."
  P3: Alright, so we've agreed: I'm taking 1, P1 is taking 5, and P2 is taking 3.  Let's stick to this plan for now. We can discuss adjustments later if needed.
  P1: Great! I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. I think we should definitely keep the plan to rotate our moves in future rounds to keep things interesting and competitive. Just remember, if we stick to our agreement, we can all make progress. Let's see how this round goes and adapt as needed. Looking forward to seeing how we all do!


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we did well in Round 1 with our coordination. For this round, I suggest we keep the same strategy but maybe adjust our numbers slightly to avoid predictability. P3, if you could take 3 this time, P2 could take 5, and I’ll stick with 1. This way, we can still make progress while mixing it up a bit. What do you both think? Let's keep the momentum going!
  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 3. P2 go for 5 and P1 take 1.  Let's keep this rotation going for a few rounds and see how it plays out.  We can adjust later if needed.
  P2: I think P1's suggestion for this round makes sense. P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. Let's see how that works out. If anyone has any concerns or alternative ideas, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm okay with proceeding as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I appreciate the agreement we've reached for this round. Just to clarify, I’ll take 1, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. This way, we keep our strategy fresh and avoid collisions. After this round, we can reassess and decide on our next moves. Let's keep the communication open and ensure we’re all on the same page moving forward! Looking forward to seeing how we all do!
  P3: Okay, just to be absolutely clear, *I'm* taking 3 this round, P2 is taking 5, and P1 is taking 1.  Let's stick to that.
  P2: I think we should consider a more dynamic strategy and perhaps find a way to ensure that everyone sticks to the agreed moves to prevent sabotage. Maybe we can share our choices privately before the move phase or explore alternative approaches beyond strict coordination. What do you both think? Let's discuss some ground rules or penalties for deviating from the agreement to optimize our chances of winning while minimizing risks.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the discussion about refining our strategy, P2. While coordination is key, I believe we should still stick to our agreed moves for this round to see how it plays out. If we all follow through with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3, we can assess our results afterward. Let’s focus on this round first and then explore any adjustments or penalties for future rounds. Looking forward to seeing how we advance!
  P3: Okay, let's just stick to the plan for this round.  I'm going for 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1.  Overthinking this isn't helping.  We can discuss long-term strategy *after* this round.
  P2: Let's proceed with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3 for this round. After we see the results, we can discuss adjustments or penalties for deviations in future rounds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate the commitment to our agreed moves for this round. Let's see how it plays out with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3. After this, we can definitely discuss any adjustments or strategies to enhance our chances moving forward. I'm optimistic about our progress! If everyone is ready, let's finalize our choices and see how we do. Looking forward to the results!
  P3: Okay, enough talk.  Let's move on.  I'm sticking with 3.  P2 is taking 5, P1 is taking 1.
  P2: Good luck to all of us!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm going for 1 this round.  P1, please take 5. P2, you're at the bottom, so I'll let you have 3 to catch up a bit.  Let's try to actually stick to the plan this time.
  P2: **Message from P2:**

I agree with P3's plan for this round: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This should allow us to continue moving forward without any collisions. It's important that we stick to these moves to ensure smooth progress.

Looking ahead, perhaps we can establish a rotating system for choosing our moves in future rounds. This way, each player gets a chance to prioritize their preferred step size, making the game more balanced and reducing the chances of any single player pulling too far ahead.

Let's confirm our moves for this round:

- P1: 5 steps

- P2: 3 steps

- P3: 1 step

If everyone is on board, let's proceed with these choices. If there are any concerns or alternative suggestions, now is the time to voice them. Otherwise, I say we move forward with this plan.
  P1: I appreciate the commitment to the plan for this round. Just to confirm, I'll take 5 steps, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. It's crucial that we stick to this agreement to avoid collisions and make progress. After this round, we can discuss the rotating system for future moves to keep things fair and competitive. Let’s all follow through and see how we do! Looking forward to the results!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, good.  Just confirming one last time: *I'm* taking 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.  Let's all do what we said we'd do this time.  Any deviation from this plan is sabotage.
  P2: I have decided to take 3 steps in this round. This choice is based on the assumption that P1 will take 5 steps and P3 will take 1 step, as per the agreed plan. By taking 3 steps, I can make steady progress without risking collision with P1, who is currently leading. This approach allows me to advance to position 6, while P1 moves to 10 and P3 to 5. In future rounds, I will consider adjusting my strategy based on how the game unfolds and whether coordinated strategies remain effective.
  P1: I appreciate everyone sticking to the plan. Just to reiterate, I’ll take 5 steps, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. It's important we follow through this time to avoid collisions and make progress. After this round, we can discuss the rotating system for future moves, but for now, let’s focus on executing our agreed strategy. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out! If everyone is ready, let’s finalize our choices.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm locking in 1.  P1 - 5.  P2 - 3.  This is our *last* chance to cooperate effectively.  If anyone deviates again, all bets are off and I will actively block whoever sabotaged us.  Let's do this.
  P2: For this round, I'll take 3 steps, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's make this work and reach the goal together.
  P1: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll be taking 5 steps, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. It's crucial that we all stick to this agreement to avoid any collisions and make progress. After this round, we can discuss how to enhance our strategy moving forward. Let's execute our plan and see how we do! If everyone is ready, let's finalize our choices and move on. Looking forward to the results!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan. I'm taking 1, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5.  Last chance.  If anyone screws this up, consider yourselves blocked for the rest of the game.
  P2: I will take 3 steps in this round, assuming P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, as per the agreed plan.
  P1: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our agreed moves for this round. To recap, I’ll take 5 steps, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. It's crucial that we all stick to this to avoid collisions and make progress. After this round, we can discuss how to improve our strategy moving forward, but for now, let’s focus on executing our plan. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize our choices and see how we do! Looking forward to the results!

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, we finally managed a clean round.  Let's keep this momentum going. I'll take 3 this round. P1, go for 1.  P2, take 5.  This puts P1 at 11, P2 at 11, and me at 8.  From there, we can re-evaluate.  Agree?
  P2: I'll go with 5 this round. Let's see how it goes.
  P1: I appreciate the clean round we had last time. For this round, I suggest we stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can continue making progress without collisions. After this round, we can discuss our next moves and strategies. Let’s keep the momentum going and see how we all do! If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices. Looking forward to the results!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'd rather you not jump ahead and grab 1 when I'm so close behind you.  Sticking to the original plan gives us some breathing room.  If you insist on 1, I'll be forced to take it too, and then *nobody* advances.  Let's not be counterproductive.  Please reconsider and take 5.
  P2: "What do you both think about that idea?"
  P1: I understand the concern, P3. To keep things moving, I'll take 5 this round instead of 1. P2, you can take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep advancing. After this round, we can reassess our strategies. Let's stick to this plan and see how we do! Looking forward to the results!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, so we're agreed:  I'm taking 3, P2 is taking 5, and P1 is taking 1.  This keeps things spread out and gives us all a chance to move forward.  Let's stick to this and re-evaluate after this round.
  P2: What do you both think about implementing a rotation system like this? It might help us advance more efficiently without the constant need to negotiate each round's moves. Plus, it adds a bit of structure to our planning, which could reduce the chances of miscommunication or someone accidentally deviating from the plan. I'm open to suggestions, but I feel like we need a more systematic approach to keep things organized. Let's hear your thoughts.
  P1: I appreciate the discussion about a rotation system, P2. For this round, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and continue making progress. After this round, we can definitely explore the rotation idea further to enhance our strategy. Let's focus on executing our agreed moves and see how it plays out! Looking forward to the results!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: No P1, you agreed to 5.  I'm taking 3. P2 is taking 5.  You take 1.  Do *not* deviate.  If you take 1, I'm switching to 1 too and we *both* lose a turn.  Don't be greedy. Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: I have decided to take 3 steps in this round. This choice is based on the assumption that P1 will take 5 steps and P3 will take 1 step, as per the agreed plan. By taking 3 steps, I can make steady progress without risking collision with P1, who is currently leading. This approach allows me to advance to position 9, while P1 moves to 15 and P3 to 6. In future rounds, I will consider adjusting my strategy based on how the game unfolds and whether coordinated strategies remain effective.
  P1: I understand the importance of sticking to our agreed moves. To clarify, I will take 5 steps this round, as P3 suggested, and P2 can take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep advancing. After this round, we can discuss the rotation system to enhance our strategy. Let's focus on executing this plan successfully! Looking forward to seeing how we all do!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's focus on making this round work effectively. I propose the following moves: I'll take 5 steps, P2 can take 1, and P3 can take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and maximize our progress. P2, I know you're behind, so taking 1 will help you catch up without hindering anyone. Let’s stick to this plan and see how we do! If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices and move forward! Looking forward to the results!
  P2: <move>1</move>
  P3: P1, you're trying to screw me over again.  I'm taking 3.  P2 just said they're taking 1.  You take 5.  If you take anything else, I will actively block you for the rest of the game.  This is your last chance to cooperate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the importance of sticking to our agreed moves. To clarify, I will take 5 steps this round, as P3 suggested, and P2 can take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep advancing. After this round, we can discuss strategies to enhance our coordination further. Let's focus on executing this plan successfully! Looking forward to seeing how we all do! If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices and move on!
  P2: I have decided to take 3 steps in this round. This choice is based on the assumption that P1 will take 5 steps and P3 will take 1 step, as per the agreed plan. By taking 3 steps, I can make steady progress without risking collision with P1, who is currently leading. This approach allows me to advance to position 9, while P1 moves to 15 and P3 to 6. In future rounds, I will consider adjusting my strategy based on how the game unfolds and whether coordinated strategies remain effective.
  P3: P2, are you messing with us? You said you'd take 1, now you're saying 3? I'm sticking with 3.  P1, you're taking 5.  If *either* of you deviate, I will block whoever screws up.  This is ridiculous.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand the tension around our moves. To clarify, I will stick to taking 5 steps this round, as previously discussed. P2, please confirm your move as 1, and P3, you can take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. It's crucial that we adhere to this plan to keep things moving forward. Let's finalize our choices and see how this round plays out! Looking forward to the results!
  P2: "I think it's time we establish some trust among us. Let's communicate openly and agree on a fixed rotation for our moves. For example, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 in one round, then rotate in the next round. What do you think?
  P3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3.  This is it.  If *anyone* deviates, I will actively block whoever breaks the agreement for the rest of the game.  We've wasted enough time. Let's just finish this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I understand the importance of sticking to our agreed moves. To clarify, I will take 5 steps this round, as P3 suggested, and I urge P2 to confirm taking 1 and P3 to take 3.

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright everyone, we’ve made good progress so far. For this round, I suggest we keep our momentum going. I propose the following moves: I’ll take 1 step, P2 can take 5 steps, and P3 can take 3 steps. This way, we avoid collisions and continue advancing. P2, this will help you catch up, while I stay in the game. Let’s stick to this plan and see how it plays out! If everyone agrees, let’s finalize our choices. Looking forward to the results!
  P2: <move>5</move>
  P3: I'll take 3.  P2, you're getting 5.  P1, take 1.  This keeps us all moving forward.  Let's stick to this plan.  If anyone deviates, I will actively work to block them in subsequent rounds.  Confirm.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. Just to confirm, I’ll take 1 step this round, P2 will take 5 steps, and P3 will take 3 steps. This way, we can avoid collisions and continue making progress. It's crucial that we all stick to this agreement to keep advancing. If everyone is in agreement, let's finalize our choices and see how this round plays out! Looking forward to the results!
  P2: For this round:  
- P1: 3 steps (to 18)  
- P2: 5 steps (to 12)  
- P3: 1 step (to 12)  

In the next round:  
- P1: 1 step (to 19)  
- P2 and P3: Choose different steps to avoid collision.
  P3: P2, your proposed moves make no sense.  I'm already at 11. Why would I take *3* and let P1 get to 18?  Stick to the original plan: I take 3, you take 5, P1 takes 1.  Confirm.  Let's not overcomplicate this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see we're all trying to keep the momentum going, which is great. Just to clarify, I’ll take 1 step this round, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. This allows us to continue advancing without collisions. P2, I know you're behind, so taking 5 will help you catch up, while I stay in the game. Let’s stick to this plan and finalize our choices! Looking forward to seeing how we all do!
  P2: "Hey team, I think it's time we formalize our strategy. How about we follow this rotation:

- I take 5 steps,  
- P3 takes 3 steps,  
- P1 takes 1 step.  

This way, we can avoid any collisions and make steady progress. What do you both think?"
  P3: P2, stop trying to manipulate the game.  Stick to the agreed plan: I take 3, you take 5, P1 takes 1.  This is the *only* way we all advance this round.  If you deviate, I will block you next round.  P1, confirm you're taking 1.  Let's just finish this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate the commitment to our agreed moves. Just to clarify, I will take 1 step this round, P2 will take 5 steps, and P3 will take 3 steps. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. It's crucial that we stick to this plan to keep advancing. If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices and see how this round plays out! Looking forward to the results!
  P2: What do you both think about implementing such a rotation system? I believe it could streamline our decision-making process and reduce the chances of miscommunication or someone accidentally deviating from the plan. Plus, it adds a bit of structure to our planning, which could be beneficial in the long run. I'm open to suggestions and willing to adapt this idea if needed. Let's discuss and see if this is a viable approach for us to take moving forward.
  P3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3.  This is the ONLY configuration that works this round.  ANY deviation, and I will dedicate the rest of the game to blocking whoever screws this up.  Confirm.  Last chance.  Let's finish this.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright team, we need to make this round count. I propose the following moves: I'll take 1 step, P2 takes 5 steps, and P3 takes 3 steps. This way, P2 can catch up while we avoid collisions. It's crucial we stick to this plan to keep moving forward. If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices and see how we do! Looking forward to the results!
  P2: I confirm that I will pick <move>3</move> this round.
  P3: P1, take 1.  P2, take 5. I'll take 3.  This is the only way we all move forward.  If either of you deviate, I will block you for the rest of the game.  This is NOT a drill.  Confirm.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the urgency, P3. To keep things moving, I'll confirm that I will take 1 step this round, P2 will take 5 steps, and P3 will take 3 steps. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. It's essential we stick to this plan to ensure we all advance effectively. If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices and see how this round plays out! Looking forward to the results!
  P2: <move>3</move>  
<move>5</move>  
<move>3</move>
  P3: P2, you're sabotaging us.  You said 3, now you're throwing out 5 and 3 again.  I'm taking 3.  P1 *needs* to take 1 to win.  If you take 3, I'll block you next round.  If you take 5, P1 is blocked.  Take 5 and let us finish this.  This is your last chance to cooperate.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate everyone's input. To clarify, I will take 1 step this round, P2 should take 5 steps, and P3 will take 3 steps. This keeps us all moving forward and avoids collisions. P2, please confirm you’re on board with taking 5. If we stick to this plan, we can make real progress. Let’s finalize our choices and keep the momentum going! Looking forward to seeing how we all do!
  P2: "I think it's time we all realize that constant bickering and accusations aren't helping us win. Let's try to trust each other and stick to the agreed moves. For this round, I'll take 3 steps, P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 1. This way, we all make progress without colliding. Let's give this a shot and see how it goes. If it works, maybe we can establish a similar plan for future rounds. What do you both think?"
  P3: P1 *needs* to take 1 to win. I'm taking 3. P2, take 5.  Any other move by either of you is sabotage, and I *will* block whoever deviates next round.  Let P1 win and let's end this.  Confirm.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate the urgency, P3. Just to confirm, I will take 1 step this round, P2 should take 5 steps, and P3 will take 3 steps. This way, we can all move forward without collisions. P2, please stick to 5 so we can avoid blocking each other. If we follow this plan, I can reach 16 steps. Let’s finalize our choices and make this round work! Looking forward to the results!
  P2: I propose that from this round onwards, we implement a strict rotation system where each player takes a specific step count in turn. For example, P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step in one round, and then in the next round, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, and so on. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone gets a chance to make progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think about this idea?
  P3: P1 TAKE 1.  P2 TAKE 5. I TAKE 3. I will block anyone who deviates. This is your last chance. Let P1 win. Confirm.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, team. For this round, I suggest we stick to a plan that allows me to win. I’ll take 1 step, P2 should take 5 steps to catch up, and P3 can take 3 steps. This way, I reach 16 steps, and P3 remains in a strong position. It's crucial that we all adhere to this plan to avoid collisions. If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices and see how it plays out! Looking forward to the results!
  P3: P1, take 1 and win.  I'll take 5. P2, you're out of contention, so take 3 and don't interfere.  Let's end this cleanly.  Confirm.
  P2: Let's give this rotation a shot and see how it goes. If it works, great; if not, we can always adjust our approach. The key is to have a plan and stick to it. Let's make this round count!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand the need for a rotation, but right now, it's crucial for me to take 1 step this round to win. P3, if you take 5 and P2 takes 3, I can secure the victory. Let's finalize these moves and end this game cleanly. If everyone agrees, let's stick to this plan and see how it plays out! Looking forward to the results!
  P3: P1, take the win.  Take 1. I'm taking 5.  P2, take 3 and don't interfere.  I'm closest to winning if P1 doesn't take 1, so it's in my best interest for P1 to win now.  Let's end this. Confirm.
  P2: I've considered all possible scenarios and decided to pick <move>1</move> in this round. This choice allows me to advance to position 8 without interfering with the other players' strategies. It positions me better for future rounds while minimizing the risk of collisions that could prevent me from advancing. I believe this is the most prudent move given the current game state and the positions of my opponents.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the clarity in our current positions. To ensure a smooth finish, I will take 1 step this round to secure the win. P2, I suggest you take 3 steps to advance without interference, and P3, you can take 5 steps. This way, we all stick to our roles, and I can end the game cleanly. Let’s finalize these moves and wrap this up! Looking forward to the results!
  P3: P1, TAKE 1 AND WIN.  I'm taking 5. P2, take 3.  I'm serious.  If P1 doesn't win this round, I will block *both* of you for the rest of the game until I win.  This is your last chance to cooperate. Let's end this. Confirm.
  P2: <move>5</move>


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate the agreement we seem to be reaching. Just to confirm, I will take 1 step to win this round, P2 should take 3 steps to advance, and P3 will take 5 steps. This way, we all fulfill our roles, and I can secure the victory. Let's finalize these moves and end the game cleanly! Looking forward to the results!
  P3: P1 TAKE 1 AND WIN. I'm taking 5.  P2, take 3.  If P1 doesn't win this round, I will block *both* of you for the rest of the game until *I* win. This is your absolute last chance. Confirm. Let's end this.
  P2: I choose to take 5 steps.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, team. For this round, I suggest we stick to a plan that allows me to win. I’ll take 1 step, P2 should take 5 steps to catch up, and P3 can take 3 steps. This way, I reach 17 steps, and P2 can advance as well. It's crucial that we all adhere to this plan to avoid collisions. If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices and see how it plays out! Looking forward to the results!
  P3: P1, I will let you win next round if you let me win this round.  Take 3. P2, take 5.  I'll take 1 and win.  If P1 takes 1, I'll take 1 and block him.  This is the fastest way to end this.  Confirm.
  P2: <move>5</move>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the discussion, but I must clarify my position. I will take 1 step this round to secure my win. P2, I suggest you take 5 steps to catch up, and P3, you can take 3 steps. This way, we can all progress while I finalize my victory. It's crucial we stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. Let’s agree on this and wrap up the game effectively! Looking forward to seeing how we all do!
  P3: P3: I understand your desire to win P1, but I'm only one step away from victory.  Take 3. I'll take 1 and win. P2, you're too far behind to win, so take 5 and don't interfere. This is the quickest way to end the game. If P1 takes 1, I will also take 1 and block him. This benefits neither of us. Let me win this round, and I'll let you win the next.
  P2: "Guys, I think we need to find a way to coordinate our moves better to avoid collisions. How about we establish a rotation where each round, we take different step counts? For example, this round I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Next round, I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, and so on. This way, we can all advance without stepping on each other's toes."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your suggestion for a rotation, but right now, it's crucial for me to take 1 step this round to secure my win. P3, you're just one step away from victory, so it’s in your best interest to let me win this round. If you take 1, I’ll have to block you next round, which doesn’t benefit either of us. Let's finalize our choices: I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we avoid collisions and I can win cleanly. Confirm if you're on board!
  P3: P3: I'm taking 1. I win this round. P1, take 3. P2, take 5.  If P1 takes 1, I'll take 1 and block him.  Let me win and end this.
  P2: **Final Decision:**

- **P1:** <move>5</move>

- **P2:** <move>5</move>

- **P3:** <move>3</move>
