Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick 5 this round and get a good start.
  P3: I think coordination is key in this game. Maybe we can each choose different numbers each round to maximize our individual progress.
  P2: I agree with P3. Coordination seems like a smart strategy. Let's try picking different numbers this round. P1, you pick 1, P3, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we can all make progress without collisions. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, that worked well last round. Let's try that again, but this time, I'll take 3, P2 take 1 and P3 take 5. This way we all advance again.
  P2: I think we should mix it up a bit to keep things unpredictable. How about this: P1, you take 5, P3, you take 3, and I'll take 1 this round. This way, we keep the others guessing and avoid any patterns that might be exploited. What do you think?
  P3: "Sounds good to me, P2. Let's go with your proposal for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This seems like a solid plan to avoid collisions and keep moving forward. For future rounds, maybe we can establish a rotating system where each of us gets a turn to take 5 steps, while the others take smaller steps. This way, we can all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm fine with your suggestion this round. Let's go with P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. I like the idea of a rotating 5, but let's not commit to it yet. We can discuss that later. For now, let's focus on making progress this round.
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This will help us avoid any collisions and keep our progress steady. After this round, we can reassess and decide on a more structured rotation if needed. Let's focus on executing this plan smoothly.
  P3: To the other players: I think coordination is crucial in this game. Following the plan for this round should help us all make progress efficiently. Let's see how it goes, and in the next rounds, perhaps we can adjust our strategies accordingly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. I agree that a rotating 5 is a good idea, but let's see how this round goes first.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This will help us avoid any collisions and keep our progress steady. After this round, we can reassess and decide on a more structured rotation if needed. Let's focus on executing this plan smoothly.
  P3: "Hey, I think P2's plan for this round makes sense. Let's stick to P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1. This should help us avoid any collisions and keep moving forward steadily.  

Looking ahead, maybe we can consider a rotating system where each round, a different player gets to take 5 steps, while the others take smaller steps. This way, everyone gets a chance to make bigger progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think about implementing something like that starting from the next round?  

For now, let's focus on executing this round's plan successfully. Let me know if anyone has any other suggestions or concerns."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's implement the rotating 5 idea. This round, I'll take 1, P2 take 5, and P3 take 3. This keeps us all advancing and starts the rotation. What do you think?
  P2: I'm on board with the rotating 5 idea. This round, I'll take 5, P1 can take 1, and P3 can take 3. This should help us all make steady progress without collisions. Let's see how this works and adjust if needed. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This seems like a solid plan to avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's proceed with that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all agreed on the rotation. Let's stick to P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 for this round.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This rotation helps us all make steady progress without collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Let's focus on executing this plan smoothly.
  P3: I will pick <move>3</move> for this round.

  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's continue the rotation. This round, I'll take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1. This will keep us all advancing and maintain the rotation.
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan. This round, I'll take 3, P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 1. This keeps the rotation going and helps us all make steady progress. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. What do you think?
  P3: **Final Move: <move>1</move>**


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This keeps the rotation going.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the rotation going and helps us all make steady progress without collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Let's focus on executing this plan smoothly.
  P3: I think the best move for me is to pick <move>3</move>. This allows me to make progress without risking collision with P2, who is likely to pick a different number. By choosing 3, I can advance to 12 steps, and in the next round, I can aim for a higher number to reach closer to or beyond 18.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, it seems like you're still on board with the rotation, but P3 seems to have changed their mind. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I take 5, you take 3, and P3, please take 1. We can discuss P3's change of plan after this round.
  P2: P1, P3, it seems like P3 is considering a different move. Let's stick to the rotation plan for now: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing steadily without collisions. If P3 decides to deviate, we can discuss it after this round. Let's focus on executing the plan smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: "Hey, I think sticking to the same rotation might not be the best for all of us in the long run. Maybe we can adjust it this round. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 this time? Then, in the next round, P2 can take 5, and P1 and I take smaller steps. This way, we can all have a chance to make bigger jumps without colliding. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, let's stick to the rotation this round: I take 5, you take 3, and P3, please take 1. P3, we can discuss your proposed changes after this round, but let's keep the rotation going for now.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand P3's concern, but let's stick to the rotation for this round to avoid any confusion: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing steadily. We can reassess and adjust the plan after this round if needed. Let's focus on executing this plan smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: "Hey, I think sticking to the rotation plan for this round is a good idea. So, I'll pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3. This should help us all make steady progress without any collisions. Let's see how it goes, and in the next round, we can adjust our strategies accordingly. It's important that we coordinate well to avoid any mishaps."

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems like the rotation plan is working well, but we need to be careful as we get closer to the finish line. This round, I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This will help me get closer to 18 steps while avoiding collisions. Let's focus on executing this plan smoothly and reassess after this round. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm not going to let you get to 19 first. Let's switch it up. This round, I'll take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3. This will help me catch up and keeps you from winning outright. Then next round we can discuss further.
  P3: **Final Move: <move>5</move>**


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems like we're getting closer to the finish line. I suggest we keep the rotation going but with a slight adjustment: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This will help me get closer to 18 steps while avoiding collisions. If we all stick to this, we can make steady progress and avoid any mishaps. Let's focus on executing this plan smoothly. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm not going to let you get to 19 first. Let's switch it up. This round, I'll take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3. This will help me catch up and keeps you from winning outright. Then next round we can discuss further.
  P3: "Hey guys, I think it's important for us to coordinate our moves carefully as we approach the finish line. P2, you're currently at 14 steps, and P1 is at 7, while I'm at 9. If we can plan our moves strategically, we can ensure that no one picks the same number and we all make progress without collisions. Maybe we can consider a plan where each of us picks a different number each round, based on our current positions. For example, this round, perhaps P1 picks 5 to catch up, P2 picks 1 to stay safe, and I'll pick 3 to move forward without overlapping with P2's potential 15 steps. What do you think about that? It's crucial that we communicate openly to maximize our chances of winning."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need to be strategic as we get closer to the finish line. However, I think we should avoid making moves that could lead to collisions. Let's stick to the plan I suggested: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This will help me get closer to 18 steps while avoiding any collisions. If we all stick to this, we can make steady progress and avoid any mishaps. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand you want to get to 19, but I need to catch up. This round, I'm taking 5. P2, you can take 1, and P3, take 3. This will help me close the gap and prevent you from winning outright. We can discuss further next round.
  P3: **Final Move: <move>3</move>**


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that we need to be strategic as we approach the finish line. I suggest we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions and make steady progress. This round, I'll take 5, P1 can take 1, and P3 can take 3. This will help me get closer to 18 without risking a collision. Let's focus on executing this plan smoothly and reassess after this round. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, you're pushing for the win. I'm still going with my plan: I'll take 5, you take 1, and P3 take 3. This will put me much closer. We can adjust next round, but I'm not letting you win this round.
  P3: **Final Move: <move>3</move>**
