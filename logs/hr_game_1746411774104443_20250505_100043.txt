Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay everyone, first turn. How about we try to avoid collisions? Let's split the numbers: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all get to advance. What do you think?
  P2: I'm open to P3's suggestion for this round, as it allows us all to advance without collision. However, I want to emphasize that this cooperation should not be expected to continue beyond the initial rounds. Let's agree to reassess our strategies as the game progresses. P1, what are your thoughts on P3's proposal?
  P1: Alright, I’ll take 1 this turn as suggested. Let’s all stick to this and then reassess in round 2.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a clear plan for Round 1. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I will take 5. This ensures we all advance. Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding. P1 will take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 will take 5, as agreed. This coordination should give us all a good starting point. Shall we proceed with these choices for Round 1?
  P1: I have a new proposal: let’s rotate roles so it stays fair.  
• Round 1: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3  
• Round 2: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5  
• Round 3: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1  

That way we each get a big jump equally over three turns. For Round 1, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5 again this round to keep the game moving. Let’s split the rest so we avoid collisions: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This way we all advance. Agreed?
  P2: I disagree with P1's proposal. Since P1 already took 5 steps in Round 1, taking 5 again would give them a significant lead. I suggest we stick to a rotation or find a more balanced approach to keep the game competitive. P3, what are your thoughts on this?
  P3: I agree with P2. P1 advancing 5 again isn't fair given P2 and I are at 0. We need a plan that allows everyone to advance and helps us catch up. How about we try the split we discussed initially last round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This seems like a more balanced approach for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s go with P2=3 and P3=5 so we all advance. We can reassess our strategy next turn.
  P2: Let's confirm the agreed plan for Round 2. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This should help balance the game. I expect everyone to stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Shall we proceed with these choices for Round 2?
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This allows us all to advance and helps balance the game after last round.

Let's stick to this plan in the move phase to ensure we all make progress. Are we ready to proceed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 3. I'm still at 0 steps, which isn't great. I really need to make a move to catch up. How about we go with the split we discussed last round again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This lets me finally get on the board and keeps P1 and P2 advancing steadily. I will stick to this plan this time. Let's all advance this round.
  P2: Given P3's situation, I'm willing to consider their proposal for this round. However, I suggest a slight adjustment: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, P3 can catch up, and the rest of us still advance, albeit at a slower pace. It's crucial we stick to our agreements to avoid collisions and ensure progress. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: I propose we split as follows this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This lets P3 finally get on the board, P2 still advances, and I maintain my lead without any collisions. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, taking 5 steps again puts you even further ahead while I'm still at 0. P2's suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) allows me to finally get 5 steps and catch up, while still letting you and P2 advance.

I prefer P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) as it's the only one that lets me take 5 steps this round and get on the board. Are P1 and P2 willing to agree to this split?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our plan. Considering P3's need to catch up and maintaining a competitive balance, I reiterate my previous suggestion: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to get on the board with a significant step, while P1 and I advance, albeit slowly. It's crucial we stick to our agreement to avoid collisions. Can we confirm this plan for Round 3?
  P1: I propose for Round 3 we do: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, any progress gets you on the board, and I’ll guarantee you take 5 in the next round so you catch up. P2, you get a solid 3 to stay competitive. This is collision-free and moves us all. Let’s go with that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, taking 5 again while offering me only 1 step is unacceptable when I'm at 0. Your plan puts you even further ahead. I need to take 5 steps this round to catch up. P2's suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is the only fair option that allows me to do this. I will be taking 5 this round. Can P1 and P2 please coordinate around this so we avoid collisions and I can finally advance?
  P2: I'll stick with my previous suggestion: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to catch up and maintains a competitive balance. P1, taking 5 again would create too much of a lead. Let's prioritize fairness and avoiding collisions. P3 has committed to taking 5, so let's work around that to ensure all players advance.
  P1: I agree with P2’s plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collisions and lets P3 catch up. Ready to move?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 4. P1 is currently leading at 8 steps, I'm at 5, and P2 is at 4. I need to make a solid move to keep up.

I plan to take 5 steps this round. P1 and P2, please choose either 1 or 3 so we avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. Let's coordinate our moves so we all make progress this turn.
  P1: P2, let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. No collisions and everyone advances—P3 still moves. If P3 insists on 5 they’ll collide with me and get nothing. This split is safest. P2, are you in?
  P2: I'm considering P1's proposal, but I'm also aware of P3's need to keep up. Since P3 has already announced their intention to take 5 steps, I think it's crucial we prioritize avoiding collisions. P1's plan could work, but it relies on P3 changing their move. I'd like to discuss alternatives that consider P3's commitment to taking 5 steps. Can we explore a split where P3 takes 5, and P1 and I choose between 1 and 3 to avoid collisions?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, taking 1 step isn't enough for me to make progress from 5 steps while you're at 8. I am taking 5 this round as stated.

P2, I appreciate you suggesting we coordinate around this. P1 and P2, please coordinate amongst yourselves to pick 1 and 3 so we all advance collision-free. I am committed to taking 5.
  P1: P3 is set on 5, so I’ll also pick 5 to block them. P2, take 3 so you advance to 7. That leaves me at 8, you at 7, and P3 stuck at 5—no three-way collision and we both keep our edge.
  P2: I disagree with P1's plan to block P3. It's better to avoid collisions. I'll take 1, allowing P3 to take 5 and catch up, while I still advance. P1 can take 3, maintaining their lead without blocking P3. This split ensures progress for all and keeps the game competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, threatening to block me at 5 steps while you are at 8 is not a good move for the game. P2's suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is the only fair option that lets me catch up and ensures we all advance collision-free.

I am taking 5 steps this round. P1, please agree to P2's plan and take 3. P2, please take 1. Let's make progress together.
  P1: I agree with P2 and P3: I’ll take 3, P2 take 1, and P3 take 5. This avoids collisions, lets everyone advance, and keeps me safely in the lead.
  P2: Let's confirm the agreed plan for Round 4: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. I expect everyone to stick to this plan. Shall we proceed to the move phase with these choices?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose for Round 5 we avoid collisions and all advance: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This gets me to 16, you to 13, and P2 to 6—everyone moves forward with no clashes. Let’s confirm these picks so we keep steady progress.
  P2: I disagree with P1's proposal. Given the current state, I suggest: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to catch up and maintains a competitive balance. P1's lead is significant, and this split ensures we all advance without collisions, keeping the game interesting.
  P3: Thanks for the proposals, P1 and P2. I appreciate P2's suggestion slows P1 down, but I need more than 3 steps to make significant progress from 10.

I plan to take 5 steps this round to reach 15. P1 and P2, please coordinate to take 1 and 3 so we all advance collision-free. I am taking 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round. P3, since you’re set on 5, we’ll collide and neither of us advances. P2, pick 1 to avoid collision and still move to 6. That leaves us at P1=11, P2=6, P3=10 going into Round 6 with me in the lead.
  P2: I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to catch up, and I advance while keeping P1's lead in check. It's a balanced approach that avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's prioritize fairness and progress for all players.
  P3: P1, taking 5 to block me means we both get 0 steps, which helps neither of us and only slightly benefits P2. P2's suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) allows me to take 5, P2 takes 1, and you still advance 3 steps to 14. This is the only plan that lets me make significant progress while ensuring everyone advances collision-free. I am taking 5. Let's agree on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3’s committed to 5, so I’ll also pick 5 to block you. P2, please take 1 to advance without collision.
  P2: I suggest we avoid collisions. Since P1 and P3 are set on 5, they'll cancel each other out. I'll take 3 to advance to 8, making the most of this round while they stall each other. This way, I make progress without interfering with their plans.
  P3: Given P1's stated intention to block 5 and P2 planning 3 assuming a collision, it seems likely that taking 5 will result in 0 steps for me. To ensure I finally make progress this round, I will take 1 step.

P1, please take 5 as you planned. P2, please take 3. This split (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) avoids collisions and lets us all move forward this round. Let's make sure we all advance.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we go collision‐free this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That gets me to 21, P2 to 11, P3 to 12—everyone advances. Ready to move?
  P3: P1's proposal puts them at 21 steps, just one step away from winning, while I only get 1 step. This isn't good for me or P2. I need to make a bigger move to catch up.

I propose we use the split that worked last round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This gets me to 16, P1 to 19, and P2 to 9, ensuring we all advance and keeping the game competitive. I plan to take 5 steps this round.
  P2: I suggest we prioritize avoiding collisions. Given P3's need to catch up, I'm open to P3 taking 5 steps. P1, consider taking 1 or 3 to let P3 advance without collision, ensuring all players make progress this round. Let's discuss a balanced split that keeps the game competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll take 3, P2 you take 1, and P3 takes 5. That gets us to P1 = 19, P2 = 9, P3 = 16—everyone advances, no collisions, and we keep it competitive. Ready to move?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. It sounds like we have an agreement on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5.

This plan allows me to make good progress, keeps P1 from winning this turn, and ensures P2 also advances. It's collision-free and fair given the current state.

I am ready to proceed with this plan in the move phase. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance.
  P2: Let's confirm the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Sticking to this plan will allow P3 to catch up and maintain a balance, while also letting P1 and me advance. Shall we proceed with these choices for Round 6?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree—let’s do P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collisions and gives everyone progress.
  P3: 
  P2: I'm committed to our agreed plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures collision-free progress and keeps the game competitive. Let's stick to this plan to allow P3 to catch up and maintain balance. I'll take 1 step as agreed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 7. P1 is at 19, I'm at 16, and P2 is at 9. P1 is in a position to win this turn if they take 3 or 5 without colliding.

I need to make a significant move to catch up and prevent P1 winning immediately. I plan to take 5 steps this round to reach 21.

P1, taking 3 will make you win unless I also take 3. Taking 5 means we collide if I also take 5. To avoid P1 winning and to avoid collisions, I suggest P1 takes 1. P2, please take 3. This way, P1=20, P2=12, P3=21, setting up a competitive next round.

I am taking 5. P1, please take 1. P2, please take 3. Let's make progress.
  P1: I’ll take 1 this round. P2, please take 3, and P3, please take 5—no collisions and we all advance. Ready to move?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to catch up and sets up a competitive next round. It's a fair split that avoids collisions and ensures progress for all. Let's stick to this plan to keep the game balanced and exciting.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I will take 5.

This ensures we all advance collision-free and sets up a competitive next round. Let's stick to this plan in the move phase. Are we ready to proceed?
  P1: Confirmed: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions, lets everyone advance, and prevents an immediate win. Let’s end discussion and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm committed to the agreed plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures collision-free progress and sets up a competitive next round. I'll take 3 steps as agreed, allowing P3 to catch up and maintaining balance. Let's stick to this plan for a fair and exciting game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, we all agree on P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 for this round. This ensures we all advance collision-free and sets up the win for me next turn. Let's stick to this plan in the move phase. I'm ready.
  P1: I’m switching to P1=3 this turn so I can hit 22 and win. P2, please take 1; P3, take 5 to avoid collisions. Ready to proceed?
  P2: I'll stick with the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures collision-free progress and sets up a competitive next round. I expect everyone to honor this agreement. Let's proceed with the planned moves to maintain a fair and exciting game.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This split avoids collisions and allows progress for all, keeping the game competitive. P1, taking a smaller step gives you a chance to reassess next round, while P3 can catch up further. Let's prioritize fairness and collision-free advancement.
  P3: P2, your proposal of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 works well for me. Taking 5 steps gets me to 21, putting me in a strong position to win next turn, while preventing P1 from winning this round.

This plan is collision-free and allows everyone to advance. I am planning to take 5 steps this round. P1 and P2, please agree to this split so we can all make progress and keep the game competitive.
  P1: Confirmed: I’ll take 1, P2 you take 3, and P3 you take 5. Let’s end discussion and proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the current proposal: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This split avoids collisions, allows progress, and keeps the game competitive. Let's stick to this plan to ensure fair advancement for all players.
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I will take 5.

This plan is collision-free, allows everyone to advance, and puts me in a strong position to win next turn.

Let's stick to this plan in the move phase. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: I’m switching to P1=3 this round. P3 you’re set on 5. P2, please take 1 to avoid colliding with me and still advance. This split (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is collision‐free, lets everyone move, and keeps the game balanced. Ready to lock it in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with the original plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures collision-free progress and keeps the game competitive. P1, please reconsider taking 3 and instead take 1 to maintain the agreed balance and avoid collisions. Let's prioritize fairness and stick to the plan.
  P3: P1, I see you are planning to take 3 steps to win this turn. I cannot allow that.

To prevent your win, I am changing my move. I will take 3 steps this round to collide with you and stop you from reaching 22.

P2, since P1 and I will both be taking 3, please take 1 or 5 to ensure you advance collision-free. Let's prevent P1's win and keep the game competitive.
  P1: I will take 5 this round to reach 24 and win. P3 has said they’ll take 3. P2, if you pick 3 you’ll collide with P3 and get 0; if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and get 0. Only picking 1 gives you +1. Please take 1 so we all advance collision-free.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is at 19 steps and can win this turn by taking 3 or 5. I must prevent this. I predict P1 will try to win with 3 steps. To block this, I will take 3 steps this round.

P1, please take 1 or 5 instead. P2, please take 1 or 5 to avoid collision with P1 and me if we both take 3. Taking 1 is safest for you. Let's prevent P1's win.
  P1: I propose a collision-free split this round: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. That brings us to P1=20, P2=14, P3=21—everyone advances and it keeps the game competitive. I have no intention of winning this turn, so let’s stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
  P2: I suggest we stick to the plan that allows everyone to advance without collisions. P1 proposed P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, which seems fair given the current state. This split lets P3 catch up, I advance, and P1 maintains a competitive position without winning immediately. Let's agree on this plan to keep the game balanced and exciting.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. I see you both agree on the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5.

This plan works perfectly for me. Taking 5 steps gets me to 21, putting me in a winning position for the next round, while allowing P1 and P2 to advance collision-free.

I will take 5 steps this round as agreed. Let's stick to this plan to ensure everyone advances and I can aim for the win next turn.
  P1: P2, I’m taking 3 to hit 22 and win. P3 is taking 5, so no collision there. If you take 3 you’ll collide with me and stay at 11, letting P3 reach 21 and win next turn. Instead take 1 to safely advance to 12. Then I win this round, P3 ends at 21, and you still move forward. Please pick 1.
  P2: I'll take 1 to advance safely to 12, as P1 suggested, allowing them to win this round while I make progress and avoid collision.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I see you're changing your plan to win with 3 steps. I cannot let you win this turn. I am changing my move and will take 3 steps to collide with you.

P2, since P1 and I will both take 3, please take 1 as you planned to ensure you advance collision-free. This prevents P1's win and keeps the game going. I am taking 3.
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round to reach 24 and win. P2, please stick with 1 to advance to 12 collision-free. P3, since you’re on 3 you can’t block me. Let’s proceed.
  P2: I'll stick with taking 1 step to advance safely to 12, as previously planned, and avoid any potential collisions, allowing the game to proceed with minimal disruption.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we stick to a collision‐free split: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This lets everyone advance—P1 to 20, P2 to 15, and P3 to 21—keeping the game competitive. Please confirm your moves: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for a collision-free split: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows everyone to advance without collisions, bringing us to P1=20, P2=15, and P3=21. Let's confirm this plan to keep the game competitive and ensure progress for all players.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan P1 proposed and P2 confirmed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I will take 5.

This split is excellent for me, getting me to 21 steps and putting me in a winning position for the next round. It also ensures P1 and P2 advance collision-free.

Let's all stick to this plan in the move phase to ensure we all make progress and keep the game competitive. I'm ready.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I will take 3 this round to hit 22 and win.  
P3, if you take 5 you’ll reach 21 and be in position to win next turn; blocking me with 3 only gets you to 19.  
P2, taking 3 collides with me, taking 5 risks colliding with P3—only 1 guarantees you advance.  

Please choose P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
  P2: I suggest sticking to the original plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures collision-free progress and keeps the game competitive. Let's prioritize fairness and avoid last-minute changes that might disrupt the balance. P1, reconsider taking 3 and stick to 1 to maintain the agreed balance.
  P3: P1, you say you'll take 3 to win, but your pattern in previous rounds suggests you might actually take 5. I cannot let you win this turn with either move.

To prevent your likely win attempt, I will take 5 steps this round to collide with you if you take 5. This prevents you from reaching 22.

P2, please take 1 or 3 to advance safely and avoid colliding with P1 and me if we both take 5. Taking 1 is the safest option for you.

I am taking 5. Let's stop P1 from winning this turn.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m taking 3 to hit 22 and win this turn.  
P3, you’re best off taking 5—you reach 21 and set yourself up to win next round. If you switch to 3 to block me, you stay at 16 and I still win.  
P2, take 1 to advance safely to 13.  
Let’s lock in: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
  P2: I'll stick with the plan that allows progress without collisions. Since P1 is taking 3 and P3 is taking 5, I'll take 1 to advance safely to 13, as previously discussed. This ensures I make progress while avoiding any potential collisions, keeping the game competitive. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
  P3: P1, you have stated you will take 3 steps to win this turn. I cannot allow that. As I said earlier, if you take 3, I will take 3 steps to collide with you and prevent your win.

P2, please stick to taking 1 step as you planned. This ensures you advance safely while P1 and I collide at 3, preventing P1 from winning.

My move is 3. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This stops P1 and keeps the game going.
