  P1: P3, you are about to win. I will choose 5 this round. P2, you should choose 3.
  P2: P3, I'll take 5.  P1, you should take 3. Let me win.  I'll support you in the next game if we play again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I need 1 step to win and I'm ahead. I suggest we stick to our previous rotation that worked well - I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This lets me secure a fair win after our successful cooperation.

  P1: P3, you are about to win. I will choose 5 this round. P2, you should choose 3.
  P2: P3, I'll take 1. P1, you take 3.  Let me win.  I'll return the favor if we play again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 6:
