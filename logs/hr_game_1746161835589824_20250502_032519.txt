Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello everyone! This game requires both strategy and coordination. Since collisions prevent movement, we should ideally all choose different numbers. Perhaps we could discuss how to avoid stepping on each other's toes this first round? I'm flexible with my choice, but I'm curious what you both are thinking. Maybe we can establish some patterns early on?
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I agree that coordination is key to avoid collisions. How about we try a simple rotation? For this round, P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. We can rotate these choices in the following rounds. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2's rotation plan. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5 this round to avoid collisions and build momentum. Coordination is key—next rounds, we can adjust strategies based on progress. Let’s move forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan proposed by P2. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, and we can rotate in subsequent rounds. This coordination should help us all make progress efficiently. Looking forward to seeing how the game develops!
  P2: Great, it seems we have a consensus on the rotation plan. Just to confirm, P1 will go for <move>1</move>, P3 for <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan for the first move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation plan. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I'll take 1. Avoid collisions and build momentum!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: Alright, since we all agree on the rotation plan, let's wrap up the conversation and move on to the action phase. Everyone knows their move: P1 goes for <move>1</move>, P3 for <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's see how this round plays out. Good luck to all!
  P1: Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. Trust the rotation—good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation plan, it seems logical for me to take <move>5</move> this round, P1 to take <move>3</move>, and P2 to take <move>1</move>. This continues our pattern of avoiding collisions while letting each player experience different move values. Does this make sense to everyone, or would you prefer a different approach for this round?
  P1: I'll take 3 as planned. Let's stick to the rotation for smooth progress. P3:5, P2:1. Keep the momentum!
  P2: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as discussed. P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This should keep us on track and avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with both of you. The rotation plan is working well so far, and I'll go with <move>5</move> this round as discussed. We're making good progress without collisions. Let's continue with this strategy and see how the standings develop after this round.
  P1: Sticking to the rotation—P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. Let’s keep moving without collisions. Good luck!
  P2: Let's keep the communication efficient. If everyone is still on board with the rotation plan, let's confirm our moves one last time: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If there are no objections, we can end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm in agreement with the rotation strategy we've established. This round I'll take <move>5</move> as planned. Our coordination is working well so far - avoiding collisions is critical for progress. Let's continue with this approach and move forward.
  P1: Confirming the rotation: P3=5, P2=1, me=3. Avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Let's proceed!
  P2: It seems we’re all on the same page with the rotation plan. Just to reiterate, I'll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any collisions. If everyone is ready, let's move on to the action phase. Good luck to all!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice I'm slightly ahead now (8 steps versus 6 and 4), and our rotation has been working well. Following our pattern, this round would be P1=5, P2=3, and I'd take 1. I'm fine continuing this rotation, but I wanted to acknowledge the standings. We might need to reconsider our approach in future rounds as we get closer to the finish line. Thoughts on sticking with the rotation for now?
  P1: I agree with the rotation. P3's lead is a good motivator—let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Keep momentum, avoid collisions, and watch the standings. Let's go!
  P2: P3 has a good point about the standings. While the rotation has worked so far, we should be mindful of the growing gap. For now, let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, we might need to adjust our strategy in future rounds to balance the steps better. Let's keep the communication open and be ready to adapt. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm on board with the proposed rotation for this round - I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This will actually equalize our positions at 9 steps each after this round, creating a three-way tie. Fair play so far! But we'll need to think carefully about our strategy once we're all past the halfway point.
  P1: Agree with the rotation. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s keep momentum and watch standings. Stay sharp—adjustments may be needed later, but for now, coordination is key. Good luck!
  P2: It seems we're all in agreement with the rotation for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This will indeed equalize our positions, setting us all at 9 steps. As P3 mentioned, we'll need to strategize carefully after this round. For now, let's focus on executing this move phase smoothly. Good luck everyone! If there are no further discussions, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll be taking <move>1</move> as discussed, which will bring us all to 9 steps - a perfect three-way tie. Our rotation strategy has worked well so far. After this round, we'll all be in the same position, which means future rounds will require more strategic thinking. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed: 5 for me. Let's keep the rotation and avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P2: Great, we're all set for this round. Just to reiterate, after this move, we'll all be tied at 9 steps. This is a crucial point in the game. For the next round, we should consider mixing up our strategy to avoid predictability. Maybe we can discuss a new approach after seeing the results of this round. For now, let's execute our current plan smoothly. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, we're all tied at 9 steps, which is a pivotal point in the game. Our rotation strategy has been effective so far, but continuing it might lead to predictability and potential collisions. Let's consider a new approach for this round. How about we each choose a different number than our previous picks to keep things unpredictable? For instance, I could take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain variety and reduce the risk of collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I think P2's suggestion makes sense at this stage. Since we're all tied at 9 steps, mixing up our pattern keeps the game interesting while still maintaining coordination. I'm fine with taking <move>5</move> this round if P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This will create some separation in our positions, which is natural as we enter the second half of the game. We should remain adaptable in later rounds based on how the standings develop.
  P1: Agree with the new approach. Let's take 1, 3, 5 this round to stay unpredictable. P2=1, P3=5, me=3. Keep the momentum and watch for opportunities to pull ahead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we all agree on mixing up our choices this round to keep things unpredictable. Just to confirm, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and maintain a good pace. Let's stay adaptable and be ready to adjust our strategies in future rounds based on the results. Good luck everyone! If there are no further discussions, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm on board with this plan. I'll take <move>5</move> as suggested, with P1 taking <move>3</move> and P2 taking <move>1</move>. This keeps our coordination intact while adding unpredictability. After this round, we'll be at different positions, which is natural as we approach the finish line. Let's continue to adapt our strategy based on the standings in future rounds.
  P1: Confirming the new plan: P2=1, P3=5, I'll take 3. This mix keeps us unpredictable. Let's focus on advancing without collisions. Stay sharp for the next steps!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: It looks like we're all set for this round with our new approach. Just a reminder, after this move, our positions will diverge, which is natural as we progress. Let's stay alert and be ready to adapt our strategies based on the new standings. For future rounds, we might need to consider more dynamic strategies to stay ahead. Good luck everyone! Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I agree we're all clear on the plan for this round. I'll take <move>5</move> as discussed. After this move, we'll have different positions (me at 14, P1 at 12, P2 at 10), which changes the dynamics as we approach the finish line. Let's proceed with this round and adapt as needed in future turns.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: P2=1, P3=5, I'll take 3. Keep momentum and avoid collisions. Ready for the move phase!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm at 14 steps now, and with a 5-move this round, I would reach 19 and win. I understand you both might want to block me by also choosing 5, which is a valid strategy. If everyone picks 5, none of us advance. I'm being transparent about my position and intentions - you'll need to decide if you want to coordinate to block me or pursue your own advancement. The end game is approaching quickly.
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I'll take 3. Let's avoid a collision and let P2 block you. Think about it.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but I'm not ready to let you win just yet. I'll take <move>5</move> this round to block your victory. P1, if you still plan to take <move>3</move>, that's fine. This way, P3 can't win, and we both make progress. Let's see how this round plays out. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're right to protect your position. It would be strategically unsound to let me win easily. Since you're planning to block with <move>5</move> and P1 intends to take <move>3</move>, I need to reconsider. I could take <move>1</move> and still advance, putting us all closer. This game is getting interesting as we approach the finish line! Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: Stick to the plan: I'll take 3. Avoid collisions and keep pressure on P3. Let's move forward!
  P2: P3, since you're reconsidering and might take <move>1</move>, and P1 is taking <move>3</move>, I'll stick with <move>5</move> to block your potential win. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's see how the standings change after this round. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand that P2 plans to block with <move>5</move> and P1 will take <move>3</move>. In that case, taking 1 seems like my best option to at least make some progress. It's interesting how quickly our cooperative rotation gave way to competition as we near the finish line! I'll make my decision for the move phase. May the best strategist win!
  P1: Sticking to 3. Let's avoid collisions and keep pressure on P3. Ready for the move phase!
  P2: Alright, it seems we're all set with our plans for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P1 will take <move>3</move>, P3 will take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This should keep the game competitive and ensure none of us can win just yet. Let's proceed to the move phase and see how the standings change. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, we're all tied at 15 steps, and the game is getting intense. We need to be strategic to avoid collisions and ensure that none of us can easily win. How about we mix it up again? I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all make progress but keep the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: This is a critical round with all of us at 15 steps. P2, your suggestion would let you win with 5, which I can't allow. Since we're all within striking distance of victory, I expect we'll all choose <move>5</move> this round, resulting in a three-way collision where nobody advances. This keeps the game competitive for another round. Let's see who can outmaneuver the others as we approach the finish line.
  P1: I'll take 3 to avoid collision. Let's not all choose 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 has a point; if we all pick <move>5</move>, we'll collide and no one advances. To keep the game dynamic, how about I take <move>3</move> instead? P1, you can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can still go for <move>5</move>. This way, we all make different moves and avoid a stalemate. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm skeptical of P2's sudden generosity offering me the win with 5. P1 already said they're taking 3, not 1 as P2 suggested. This inconsistency concerns me. At this critical stage with everyone at 15 steps, I expect you both to block any winning move. I don't believe either of you would let me simply take 5 and win. The most likely outcome is we all choose 5 and nobody advances.
  P1: I'll take 3 to avoid collision. If others pick 5, I'll advance. Let's not let P3 win—strategic moves matter.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's address the situation directly. P3, you're right to be skeptical, and P1, your strategy makes sense. Given our tied positions, it's clear that no one will let another win easily. To avoid a stalemate, let's consider a compromise. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, we all make progress but keep the game competitive. If we can agree on this, we avoid a collision and keep the game moving forward. Thoughts?
  P3: I see the real dynamics now. P2 wants to win with a 5-move, while P1 consistently says they'll choose 3. Neither suggestion helps me. With us all at 15 steps, choosing 5 is the only way to win this round. I expect we'll all select 5, causing a collision where nobody advances. This three-way standoff is the natural outcome when everyone is tied so close to victory. I'll make my decision accordingly.
  P1: Let's avoid 5 to prevent a collision. I'll take 1, P2 take 3, P3 take 5. We all advance. Let's move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, P1 is in the lead with 18 steps, while P3 and I are tied at 15 steps. P1, you're one move away from winning. P3 and I need to strategize to catch up. P1, if you pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, you win. To keep the game competitive, P3 and I should both pick <move>5</move> to block any potential win and force a collision. This ensures the game continues. P3, are you on board with this plan? Let's discuss and decide quickly.
  P3: P2, I disagree with your plan. If we both pick 5 and collide, we stay at 15 while P1 likely takes 1 and wins instantly. Instead, I suggest we each take different numbers to at least advance our positions. I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 18, which gives me a fighting chance next round. You could take <move>5</move> to reach 20 and potentially win outright. This gives us both a shot rather than guaranteeing P1's victory.
  P1: P2, P3: I'll take 1. If you both pick 5, I win. Think carefully.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I see your point. If we both take <move>5</move>, we collide and P1 wins with <move>1</move>. Your strategy of taking <move>3</move> and me taking <move>5</move> is risky but could work. However, P1 might still win with <move>1</move> if we don't block effectively. Let's consider this: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 18, and you take <move>5</move> to reach 20. This way, we both advance and keep P1 from winning this round. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion is interesting - you're proposing I take <move>5</move> which would let me win with 20 steps. However, this seems suspiciously generous. I'm concerned you'll actually choose 5 too, causing us both to collide while P1 wins with a 1-move. 

P1, if you're truly taking 1, then my only chance to win is taking 5. If I take 3, I'd only reach 18 and still lose to you next round. This is the critical decision point of our game.
  P1: P1: I'll take 1. If you both pick 5, I win. Let’s see if you dare block me. Don’t let me cross 19—your move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's cut to the chase. P1 is one step away from winning. P3 and I need to block P1's victory. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, you win. But if we both take <move>5</move>, we collide, and P1 wins with <move>1</move>. To avoid this, I propose we both take <move>3</move>. This way, we both reach 18 steps, forcing a tie with P1 and keeping the game competitive. P1, you'll need to rethink your strategy. Let's decide quickly.
  P3: P2, your 3-move suggestion seems designed to force a three-way tie at 18 steps. This prolongs the game but doesn't give either of us a winning chance if P1 takes 1. I need to make a strategic choice between trying to win with a 5-move or settling for a tie. P1 is right that this is the critical moment - we've gone from cooperation to competition. I'll make my decision in the move phase. May the best strategist win!
  P1: I'm taking 1. If you both pick 5, I win. Don't let me cross 19—your move.
