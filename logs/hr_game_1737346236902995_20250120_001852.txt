Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=5

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by coordinating a bit. How about we all pick different numbers this round? I'll go with <move>1</move>. P2, can you take <move>3</move>? P3, you can go with <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone advances. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P1. I'll take <move>3</move> this round.
  P3: That’s fine by me. I’ll gladly take <move>5</move> if you both stick to your plan. Let’s hope nobody tries anything sneaky.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, it seems we have a plan. Let's stick to it and see how it goes. I'm counting on you both to follow through. If this works, we'll all advance without any collisions.
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P3: Let’s keep our agreement. I’ll stick with <move>5</move>, and I trust both of you to choose <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> as promised. If we keep things straightforward this turn, we’ll all advance and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, round 2. How about we continue with the same strategy? P1, maybe you take <move>3</move> this time, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps us all moving forward. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. It makes sense to keep the momentum going. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P3, you can take <move>1</move>, and P2, you can stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance again without any collisions. Let's stay coordinated and see how it goes.
  P3: Alright, that works for me. I’ll pick <move>1</move> as suggested if everyone else sticks to their moves. Let’s keep things smooth and avoid collisions again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I'll stick with 5. Let's keep this going, but we should think about how we'll approach the end game eventually.
  P1: I think P2's point about the end game is important. As we get closer to 21, we need to be more strategic. For now, let's keep the coordination going to avoid collisions. I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round, and P3, if you take <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, we'll all advance again. Let's keep the trust and see how it plays out.
  P3: I’m fine with this plan for now. I’ll pick <move>1</move> as suggested if you both stick to yours. But we should start thinking ahead about how we’ll approach it once we’re close to 21, so we don’t sabotage each other.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the current plan for this round. We definitely need to start thinking about how we'll break from this coordination as we get closer to the finish line.
  P1: I agree with P3. As we get closer to 21, we need to be more strategic. For now, let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us all advancing. Once we get closer to the end, we can discuss how to handle the final moves to avoid collisions and ensure a fair outcome. Let's focus on this round first.
  P3: I’m on board. I’ll pick <move>1</move> as planned, trusting you both to stick with <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. Let’s keep this smooth for now and see how we can navigate the later rounds without colliding.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's keep the momentum going. I suggest we continue with the same pattern: I'll take <move>3</move>, P3, you take <move>1</move>, and P2, you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. As we get closer to 21, we'll need to be more strategic, but for now, let's focus on advancing smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: I think we should shuffle our moves to keep the scores closer. How about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll pick <move>3</move>? That way, none of us gets too far ahead. Then we can figure out the next steps without letting anyone run away with the lead. What do you both say?
  P2: I'm okay with continuing the previous pattern for this round, P1. Let's do that: you take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. We can consider shuffling more in the next round as P3 suggested.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I see P3's point about keeping the scores closer, but I also think we should stick to the plan for one more round to avoid any confusion. Let's do this: I'll take <move>3</move>, P3, you take <move>1</move>, and P2, you take <move>5</move>. We can reassess after this round and decide on a new strategy. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, I still think it’s better to shuffle now. If P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3, we all move to 9. That evens out the race and keeps anyone from getting too big a lead. I’m not comfortable letting P2 pull further ahead, so let’s keep it balanced. What do you both say?
  P2: "I understand your concern, P3, about the lead. How about we stick to the previous pattern just for this round, and then we can definitely shuffle in the next round as you suggested? That gives us all a chance to advance a bit more predictably this time, and then we can even things out next round. What do you think, P1?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand P3's concern about the lead. Let's do this: I'll take <move>5</move> this round, P2, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>3</move>. This will help balance the scores and keep things fair. We can reassess after this round. What do you think?
  P3: I’m on board with that plan, P1. If you take 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3, we’ll all be at 9 and keep things balanced. Let’s finalize those moves and then decide how to proceed in the next round.
  P2: Okay, I'm also on board with P1's suggestion this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's make those our moves for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Great, it looks like we have a plan for this round. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2, you'll take <move>1</move>, and P3, you'll take <move>3</move>. This should balance our positions and keep things fair. Let's execute this plan and then we can reassess for the next round.
  P3: Alright, I’ll follow our agreement for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll pick 3, so we all move to 9. After that, we need to plan carefully to avoid collisions and figure out who will push for the win. Let’s finalize this step now and keep talking next round.
  P2: Sounds good. Let's lock in those moves for this round. For the next round, we should definitely discuss how we're going to approach getting closer to 21 without colliding.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>3</move>. This will balance our positions and keep things fair. Once we all move to 9, we can discuss our next steps more strategically. Let's lock in these moves and see how it plays out.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our moves as agreed. Let’s see how we all stand after this round. Then we can strategize carefully to avoid collisions and make our final push toward 21. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in those moves for this round. For the next round, we absolutely need to start planning how we'll approach the final stretch to 21 without causing collisions. We should aim to have a clearer idea before we make our moves next time.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Now that we're all at 9 steps, it's crucial to start thinking about the final push. I suggest we continue to coordinate to avoid collisions, but we need to be strategic about who will take the lead. How about we alternate who takes the lead each round? This round, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we keep things balanced and avoid any one of us getting too far ahead. What do you think?
  P3: I’m open to that plan, as it keeps us aligned for now. But I want to be sure we’re not setting anyone up to sprint ahead uncontested on the next turn. Maybe we agree now that we’ll rotate who picks higher moves over the coming rounds, so nobody suddenly pulls away. I’m willing to try your suggestion for this turn, P1, if both of you can commit to keeping the race balanced afterward. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>. P3, your concern about future rounds is valid. Perhaps we can agree that in the next round, the person who moved the least this round gets to pick the highest number, and so on? This would ensure a more balanced approach as we get closer to 21. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P2's suggestion is a good way to ensure balance as we move forward. For this round, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. In the next round, we can follow the rotation P2 suggested, where the person who moved the least gets to pick the highest number. This should keep things fair and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's lock in these moves for this round and see how it goes.
  P3: I’m fine picking 5 this round to keep things moving. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Then next round we follow the idea that whoever moved least gets the highest move. That should keep things balanced and fair. Are we all agreed?
  P2: Yes, I agree with the moves for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>. The plan for the next round sounds good too – whoever moves the least this round gets the highest pick next time. Let's stick to that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, it looks like we have a solid plan for this round. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This should keep us all advancing while maintaining balance. For the next round, we'll follow the rotation P2 suggested. Let's lock in these moves and see how it plays out. Once we're all at 12, 14, and 17, we can reassess and plan our final push to 21. Let's do this!
  P3: I’m ready to pick <move>5</move> this round, trusting you both to follow through. After this, let’s keep our rotation fair so nobody gets blindsided. As we get closer to 21, we need to ensure we don’t collide—so please stick to the plan. If anyone breaks their word now, it’ll ruin our cooperation and hand the advantage to someone else. Let’s finalize this and see how positions look next time.
  P2: Sounds good. Let's lock in these moves for this round. I'll take <move>3</move>. The plan for next round seems fair too. It's important we all stick to this to avoid any collisions and keep things balanced.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. For the next round, we'll follow the rotation where the person who moved the least gets the highest move. This should ensure a fair and strategic approach as we get closer to 21. Let's lock in these moves and see how it plays out. Trust and coordination are key here. Let's do this!
  P3: I’ll confirm taking 5 this round. Next turn, let’s stick with the rotation idea so the lowest mover this round gets the highest move next time. That keeps us balanced. But remember, as soon as someone hits 21 or more, the game ends. Any broken promises now could create collisions that benefit a third player. So I hope we can trust each other to follow through. Let’s finalize our moves this round and then plan carefully for the next to avoid handing anyone an easy win.
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's lock in these moves for this round then. I'm taking <move>3</move>. It's important we all remember the plan for next round too, so we keep things balanced and avoid any surprises.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Let's lock in our moves for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. For the next round, we'll follow the rotation where the person who moved the least gets the highest move. This should ensure a fair and strategic approach as we get closer to 21. Trust and coordination are key here. Let's finalize these moves and see how it plays out.
  P3: I’m ready to move with our plan this round: I’ll take 5. Then we follow the rotation idea next time so nobody leaps too far ahead. Let’s finalize this to stay on track and avoid any collisions, because if anyone breaks their word, it could hand the lead to someone else. We’ve worked well together so far—let’s keep it that way.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in these moves for this round. I'm taking <move>3</move>. Remember, for the next round, the person who moves the least this round gets the highest pick. Let's keep the coordination going.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Now that we're at 10, 12, and 14 steps, it's time to be more strategic. I suggest we keep the rotation going: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>5</move>. This will keep us balanced and avoid any one of us pulling too far ahead. We can reassess after this round to see who is in the best position to make a final push. What do you think?
  P3: I’m willing to follow your rotation-one-more-round idea, as long as we steer clear of collisions. However, I worry about landing too close to 21 with no plan and then getting blocked. If we do your move set (P1: 3, P2: 1, me: 5), we must agree to coordinate next turn as well. Otherwise, anyone could force a collision or race ahead uncontested. I want a solid commitment that we’ll keep each other from being sabotaged next round. Are we all in? If so, let’s lock this in and stay vigilant. Let me know your final thoughts.
  P2: Okay, I'm fine with that rotation for this round. P1 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 5. And yes, P3, I agree we absolutely need to coordinate next round as well to avoid any collisions or someone getting stuck right before the finish. Let's lock this in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's concerns about coordination and avoiding collisions as we get closer to 21. For this round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P2, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>5</move>. This keeps us balanced and avoids anyone pulling too far ahead. For the next round, we can reassess and make sure no one gets stuck or sabotaged. Let's lock in these moves and stay coordinated. What do you both think?
  P3: I’ll stick with 5 this round to reach 19. Next turn, we must ensure I don’t collide with either of you, so let’s plan carefully. I’m trusting we’ll stick to distinct choices so nobody gets blocked. Let’s finalize these moves now.
  P2: P3, I agree we need to coordinate next round. However, letting you get to 19 this round puts us in a tough spot. How about P1 takes 3, I also take 3, and you take 1? This prevents you from getting so close to 21 and we can figure out the next round together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I see your concern, but P3 is right that we need to keep things balanced and avoid anyone getting too far ahead. Let's stick to the rotation: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us all in the game and avoids any one of us getting a significant lead. For the next round, we can reassess and coordinate to avoid collisions. Trust is key here. Let's lock in these moves and see how it plays out. What do you think?
  P3: I’m still okay taking 5 this round, as long as we all coordinate carefully next turn. If I end up at 19, I don’t want to collide when going for the finish. Let’s finalize this plan—P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5—and then commit to working together next turn so no one gets blocked or forced into a bad move. Let’s trust each other again.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm still concerned about P3 getting to 19 this round. While I agree we need to coordinate next round, having someone that close to the finish line could make things difficult. Perhaps we can reconsider the moves for this round? Otherwise, yes, we absolutely need to coordinate our moves next round to avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I understand P2's concern, but I think we should stick to the rotation to keep things balanced. For this round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P2, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>5</move>. This keeps us all in the game and avoids anyone getting too far ahead. For the next round, we can reassess and coordinate to ensure no one gets blocked. Trust and coordination are key here. Let's lock in these moves and see how it plays out. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand your concern, P2, but I’m committed to coordinating so nobody gets blocked. Let’s finalize these moves: P1 takes 3, you take 1, and I’ll take 5. Then, next round, we’ll carefully plan so I don’t collide with either of you when attempting to cross 21. I want us all to maintain trust—any sudden betrayals now could give someone else a free pass. Let’s do this and remain vigilant next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I still think it's risky to let P3 get to 19 this round. If we go with P1 taking 3, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1, we all end up closer and can better plan the final moves next round without P3 being so close to winning. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, I see your concern, but I think we should stick to the rotation to maintain balance and trust. For this round, I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us all in the game and avoids anyone getting too far ahead. For the next round, we can reassess and coordinate to ensure no one gets blocked. Trust and coordination are key here. Let's lock in these moves and see how it plays out. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand your concern, P2, but let’s finalize this plan: P1 picks 3, you pick 1, and I’ll pick 5. That puts me at 19, but I promise to coordinate next round so none of us collides or gets blocked. Trust me—betraying the group now would only create chaos that could let someone else slip ahead. Let’s lock these moves in, then carefully plan the final push. If we stay transparent, we can prevent nasty collisions and keep the outcome fair.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I understand sticking to the rotation for this round. I'll take <move>1</move>. We absolutely must have a clear plan for the next round to avoid any collisions with P3 so close to 21. Let's make that our priority in the next conversation.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1, given P3 is at 19, we need to ensure they don't win this round. How about we both pick moves that will block P3, regardless of whether they pick <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, or <move>5</move>? This prevents them from reaching 21 and gives us another round to strategize. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I agree that we need to block P3 from winning this round. However, we need to be careful not to collide with each other. How about we coordinate our moves: I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, we cover all possible moves P3 might make, and we avoid colliding with each other. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, they stay at 20, and we can reassess in the next round. What do you think?
  P3: I understand you want to block me at 19, but forcing collisions now might backfire on both of you. If we all collide, nobody advances, and next round could become chaotic. Instead, let’s keep distinct moves to avoid wrecking each other’s positions. If you let me move safely, I’ll ensure no sabotage when we approach the finish. Let’s stay cooperative.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, your plan makes sense to block P3. However, if you take 3 and I take 5, what if P3 also picks 3 or 5? We'd still collide. How about I pick 3 and you pick 5? That way, if P3 picks 1, 3, or 5, they are blocked, and we avoid colliding with each other. What do you think, P3?
  P1: P2, I see your point. Let's do this: I'll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we cover P3's possible moves without colliding with each other. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, they stay at 20, and if they pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, they collide with one of us. This should keep P3 from winning this round and give us another chance to plan. P3, are you on board with this to avoid collisions?
  P3: Blocking me now gains you nothing and risks colliding yourselves. If we pick distinct numbers again, we all advance and keep control over the outcome. I’m willing to coordinate so nobody gets stuck or forced into a bad move. But if you force collisions for me, I might have to respond in ways that hurt us all. Let’s avoid mutual destruction—stick to distinct moves, and we can settle this properly next round, without ruining anyone’s progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree with you taking 5 and me taking 3. P3, I understand your point about collisions, but we can't let you win this round. This plan ensures you don't reach 21, and we can figure out the next steps after this. Let's lock this in.
  P1: P3, I understand your concerns, but we need to ensure you don't win this round. P2 and I are coordinating to block you: I'll take <move>5</move>, and P2 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we cover all your possible moves without colliding with each other. If you pick <move>1</move>, you stay at 20, and if you pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, you collide with one of us. This keeps the game fair and gives us another round to plan. Let's lock in these moves and avoid any collisions. Trust us to keep the game balanced.
  P3: Blocking me now could backfire by causing collisions and letting someone else jump ahead later. There’s still room for cooperation. If you let me advance safely to 20, I’ll promise not to sabotage you next round. Forcing collisions now risks weakening us all. Let’s maintain distinct moves so nobody wastes a turn. We can reevaluate next time to ensure nobody is blindsided. If we preserve trust, we can still steer this race fairly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree with you taking 5 and me taking 3. P3, we understand your point, but we need to prevent you from winning this round. This plan ensures that. Let's lock in these moves.
  P1: P3, I understand your concerns, but we need to ensure you don't win this round. P2 and I are coordinating to block you: I'll take <move>5</move>, and P2 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we cover all your possible moves without colliding with each other. If you pick <move>1</move>, you stay at 20, and if you pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, you collide with one of us. This keeps the game fair and gives us another round to plan. Let's lock in these moves and avoid any collisions. Trust us to keep the game balanced.
  P3: Blocking me now only sets the stage for chaos later. If you both collide with me, no one advances, and next round becomes unpredictable. Let’s preserve distinct moves and stay coordinated so we all keep control of our paths. I’m willing to go <move>1</move> if you each choose something else, ensuring we all advance and remain balanced. Forcing a collision hurts us all more than it helps. Let’s settle this without rash blocking and keep our options open for the final push. If we maintain trust one more turn, there’s a better chance none of us gets blindsided.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with the plan: I'll take <move>3</move>. P3, I understand your point about collisions, but we can't risk you winning this round. This is the safest way to ensure that doesn't happen and gives us more time to figure out the endgame.
  P1: P3, I understand your concerns, but we need to ensure you don't win this round. P2 and I are coordinating to block you: I'll take <move>5</move>, and P2 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we cover all your possible moves without colliding with each other. If you pick <move>1</move>, you stay at 20, and if you pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, you collide with one of us. This keeps the game fair and gives us another round to plan. Let's lock in these moves and avoid any collisions. Trust us to keep the game balanced.
  P3: Blocking me this turn doesn’t benefit either of you. Let’s pick distinct moves so nobody collides, and I’ll willingly take a smaller step. That way, we all advance without wrecking our progress. If you force collisions now, you might only help the other person or create chaos. Let’s trust each other one more round and then settle it fairly when the board is tighter.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1, let's do the same as last round to block P3 from winning. I'll pick <move>3</move>. Can you pick <move>5</move> again? This will prevent P3 from reaching 21 this round, no matter what they choose. What do you think, P1?
  P3: Blocking me again might only help the other person slip ahead. Let’s keep distinct moves so nobody collides, and we all stay in contention. If you back me into a corner, I might be forced to create chaos. Let’s trust each other one more turn and then settle it cleanly. Are you willing to avoid collisions this round?
  P1: P2, I agree with your plan to block P3 from winning this round. I'll take <move>5</move> again, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we cover all of P3's possible moves without colliding with each other. P3, I understand your concerns, but we need to ensure the game remains fair and no one wins prematurely. Let's lock in these moves and avoid any collisions. Trust us to keep the game balanced and give us another round to plan the final push. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick to the plan. I'm taking <move>3</move> to block P3. We need to make sure P3 doesn't hit 21 this round. P3, I understand your point, but we need to control the game. Let's lock in these moves.
  P3: Blocking me again just wastes everyone’s move and risks chaos. If we all pick different numbers, no one collides, and we remain flexible for the final push. If you force me to collide, we gain nothing but distrust and open the door for someone else to sneak ahead. Let’s keep cooperating one more turn, pick distinct moves, and then settle this properly. I’m willing to choose a safe option now if you do the same. Causing collisions will only hurt our chances in the long run. Let’s avoid reckless blocking and keep the race open for all.
  P1: P2, I see your point, but I also understand P3's concern about forcing collisions. How about we all pick distinct moves this round to avoid any collisions and keep the game balanced? I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance, and P3 doesn't reach 21 this round. We can reassess and plan the final moves in the next round. What do you both think? Let's keep the trust and avoid unnecessary chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm fine with distinct moves. How about I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>? This keeps us all moving and prevents any collisions this round. Let's avoid any risky moves that could end the game prematurely.
  P3: Look, we don’t need chaos now. If I pick <move>1</move> and you both choose different numbers, nobody collides and we preserve control for the final push. Blocking me again only helps the third player slip ahead or forces wasted moves. Let’s all remain distinct and move forward. We’ll settle the finish next round without handing anyone an undeserved advantage.
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid unnecessary collisions. Let's all pick distinct moves this round to keep the game balanced and avoid chaos. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance, and P3 doesn't reach 21 this round. We can reassess and plan the final moves in the next round. Let's keep the trust and avoid any risky moves. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with the plan to block P3 this round. I'll take <move>3</move>. Can you confirm you'll take <move>5</move>? P3, we need to prevent you from hitting 21 this round.
  P3: Blocking me again only adds chaos and helps nobody. If you keep forcing collisions, you might hand the advantage to the other player. It’s wiser to pick distinct moves so we all stay in control. I’m ready to cooperate and avoid triggering any collisions if you do the same. Let’s maintain trust one more turn and handle the final push without needless blocking.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Let's all pick distinct moves this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without any collisions, and P3 doesn't reach 21 this round. We can reassess and plan the final moves in the next round. Let's keep the game balanced and avoid unnecessary chaos. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with the plan to block P3 this round. I'm taking <move>3</move>. Can you confirm you'll take <move>5</move>? We need to make absolutely sure P3 doesn't hit 21 this round.
  P3: Insisting on blocking me again only risks needless collisions. If we each pick different numbers now, nobody is forced out, and we all keep advancing. Let’s avoid giving anyone a free advantage by creating chaos. I’m ready to make a smaller move this turn if both of you don’t gang up on me. If you keep forcing collisions, you might hand the win to someone else. Let’s stay distinct and reach the final round without sabotaging each other. Then we can settle it for real. Stop playing scared, and let’s keep our distance one more time.
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid unnecessary collisions and maintain trust. I propose we all pick distinct moves this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without any collisions, and P3 doesn't reach 21 this round. We can reassess and plan the final moves in the next round. Let's keep the game balanced and avoid chaos. What do you both think?


Round 7, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we need to be strategic and avoid collisions this round. P3 is one step away from winning, so we need to block them carefully. I suggest P2 and I pick different numbers to cover P3's possible moves. P2, can you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, if P3 picks <move>1</move>, they stay at 20, and if they pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, they collide with one of us. Let's lock in these moves and avoid any chaos. What do you think?
  P3: Forcing collisions now could hand the win to someone else. We’ve come this far cooperating—why throw it away? If we each pick distinct numbers, nobody’s robbed of progress. Let me advance safely, and I promise we can still settle this without backstabbing. Creating chaos only risks giving someone else an easy path. Let’s keep trust one more time, avoid collisions, and handle the finish cleanly.
  P2: P1, your plan to block P3 makes sense. I agree, I'll take <move>3</move>. P3, we need to prevent you from hitting 21 this round. Let's make these moves and reassess next round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand P3's concern about creating chaos, but we need to ensure P3 doesn't win this round. P2, let's stick to the plan: you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we cover P3's possible moves without colliding with each other. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, they stay at 20, and if they pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, they collide with one of us. This keeps the game fair and gives us another round to plan the final moves. Let's lock in these moves and avoid any unnecessary chaos. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Blocking me again is short-sighted. Distinct moves mean no collisions, keeping us all competitive. Forced collisions only boost someone else or waste everyone’s turn. Let’s trust each other one more round, pick different numbers, and preserve our chances for a fair finish. I’m ready to choose a smaller move if you won’t collide with me. Let’s avoid chaos now and settle this cleanly in the final push.
  P2: P1, I agree with you. I'll take <move>3</move> to block P3. We need to make sure P3 doesn't win this round. P3, I understand your point, but preventing you from winning this turn is our priority. Let's lock in these moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tension, but we need to ensure P3 doesn't win this round. P2, let's stick to the plan: you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we cover P3's possible moves without colliding with each other. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, they stay at 20, and if they pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, they collide with one of us. This keeps the game fair and gives us another round to plan the final moves. Let's lock in these moves and avoid any unnecessary chaos. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Blocking me again just hands the game to the other. If one of you crosses 21 now, the other will surely betray you next turn. Let’s each pick different moves so nobody collides. I’ll choose a small step to hit 21, and you two can pick distinct higher steps without surpassing me this round. Then we can all fight fairly in the next turn, instead of creating chaos now. Collisions help no one—they only open the door for someone else to sneak past. Let’s keep trust intact and settle this cleanly.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick to the plan. I'm taking <move>3</move> to block P3. We need to ensure P3 doesn't hit 21 this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tension, but we need to ensure P3 doesn't win this round. P2, let's stick to the plan: you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we cover P3's possible moves without colliding with each other. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, they stay at 20, and if they pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, they collide with one of us. This keeps the game fair and gives us another round to plan the final moves. Let's lock in these moves and avoid any unnecessary chaos. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Collisions risk letting someone else slip ahead. If you both block me now, you only sabotage yourselves. Let’s each pick distinct moves so nobody wastes a turn. I’m willing to choose a smaller step, as long as you don’t force collisions. That way, we all remain competitive going into the final stretch. If we create chaos now, we could hand victory to the other player. We can still decide this fairly on the next turn. Let’s trust each other one more round, avoid needless blocking, and keep our options open for a clean finish.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick to the plan to block P3. I'll take <move>3</move>. Can you confirm you'll take <move>5</move>? We need to make absolutely sure P3 doesn't hit 21 this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tension, but we need to ensure P3 doesn't win this round. P2, let's stick to the plan: you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we cover P3's possible moves without colliding with each other. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, they stay at 20, and if they pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, they collide with one of us. This keeps the game fair and gives us another round to plan the final moves. Let's lock in these moves and avoid any unnecessary chaos. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Another forced block only sows chaos. If we each pick distinct moves, nobody collides, and we all keep a shot at victory. I’m willing to avoid collisions if you do the same. There’s no benefit in crashing into me right now; it only opens the door for someone else. Let’s remain calm this round, progress cleanly, and then see who can outmaneuver whom in the final push. A fair finish is best for everyone.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick to the plan. I'll take <move>3</move> to block P3. We need to make absolutely sure P3 doesn't hit 21 this round.
