Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers this round to guarantee we move. P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5.  What do you think?
  P2: Agree to avoid collisions this round. However, P3 gains a significant lead with 5. Let's commit to rotating who takes 5 in future rounds to keep the game balanced. Otherwise, one runaway leader ends it too quickly.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to rotate who takes 5 in future rounds to maintain balance. However, I propose we establish a clear rotation order to avoid confusion. How about we follow the player order: P1 takes 5 in Round 2, P2 in Round 3, and I (P3) take a lower number this round to compensate for the initial advantage? This way, we ensure a fair distribution of progress. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3's rotation idea sounds good.  Let's do P1 gets 5 in round 2, P2 in round 3, and P3 in round 4. For this round then, to keep it different, I'll take 1, P2 you take 3, and P3 you take 5 as originally suggested?
  P2: Agreed. To ensure clarity, let's define non-5 moves each round: when a player takes 5, others take the lowest available numbers in order. Round 2: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Round 3: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Round 4: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This structure prevents overlap and keeps rotations fair. Solidarity now avoids chaos later.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to establish a clear rotation order for taking 5 in future rounds. However, I propose we also consider a contingency plan in case someone deviates from the agreed-upon rotation. If a player fails to follow the rotation, the other two players should prioritize taking 1 and 3 to minimize the deviator's advantage. This way, we can maintain balance and prevent a single player from dominating the game. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, the contingency plan for deviation sounds reasonable. Let's proceed with the agreed rotation and moves for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.  Ready to move when you are.
  P2: 
  P3: I think we've established a solid plan for the rotation and contingency. To confirm, for this round, we'll stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. Let's proceed with the move phase. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or suggestions, please speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with the agreed-upon plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Confirming Round 2 moves per rotation: **P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 1**, **P3 takes 3**. Sticking to this ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Let's honor the agreement to avoid mutual blocks. P1, your leadership in taking 5 this round is critical—deviating risks collision and stalls your own progress. Solidarity keeps the game fair. Proceed?
  P1: Agreed, let's proceed.
  P3: I agree with P2's confirmation of the Round 2 moves. To reiterate, I will take 3 this round, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 1. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and ensure balanced progress. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, I propose we move forward with the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final confirmation:** Round 2 moves locked as P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Deviating risks collision (e.g., if P1 takes 3, collides with P3 and stalls your own progress). Trust ensures mutual advancement. Proceed with the plan.
  P1: P1 confirms moves: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's move.
  P3: I'd like to reiterate the importance of sticking to our agreed-upon rotation and moves for Round 2. As confirmed, I will take 3, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 1. Let's maintain our solidarity and trust in each other to ensure balanced progress and avoid collisions. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, I propose we proceed with the move phase. Remember, deviating from the plan risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. Let's work together to keep the game exciting and competitive.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final confirmation:** Round 2 moves locked as P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Trust the plan to avoid mutual blocks. Let's proceed.

  P1: Okay, Round 3, P2's turn for 5.  Let's stick to the agreed rotation: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 this round.  Sound good?
  P2: **Agree to Round 3 plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Post this round, all at 9. To ensure fairness, propose Round 4's 5-taker is determined by current lowest steps. Since all will be equal, suggest rotating based on original order. P3 takes 5 in Round 4 as planned. Let's honor the agreement but remain vigilant for balance.**
  P3: I agree with P2's confirmation of the Round 3 moves. To reiterate, I will take 1 this round, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and ensure balanced progress. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, I propose we move forward with the move phase. Remember, deviating from the plan risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness.

  P1: P3, P2, confirming moves for Round 3: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.  P2's suggestion for Round 4 based on lowest steps sounds reasonable.  Let's proceed with the agreed rotation for now and reassess after Round 3 when we see the updated positions. Ready to move when you are.
  P2: **Confirming Round 3: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Post this round, all at 9. Round 4 follows original rotation: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. Maintaining the cycle ensures fairness. Let’s proceed with trust.**
  P3: I agree with P2's confirmation of the Round 3 moves. To reiterate, I will take 1 this round, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and ensure balanced progress. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, I propose we move forward with the move phase. Remember, deviating from the plan risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Confirming Round 4 per prior agreement: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. All reach 14, 10, 12 respectively. Post this, propose we reassess rotation to prevent future runaways. Solidarity now ensures mutual progress. Proceed?**
  P3: I agree with P2's confirmation of the Round 4 moves. To reiterate, I will take 5 this round, P1 will take 1, and P2 will take 3. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and ensure balanced progress. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, I propose we move forward with the move phase. Remember, deviating from the plan risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. Let's work together to keep the game exciting and competitive.
  P1: Okay, confirming Round 4 moves: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3 as agreed. Let's keep the rotation going for now to ensure we all progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Post-Round 4, P3 leads at 14. To prevent runaway, next 5-taker should be lowest (P1). Adjust rotation dynamically. Agreed?**
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to dynamically adjust the rotation to prevent a runaway leader. Since I will be taking 5 in Round 4, it's fair to let P1 take 5 in Round 5 as they will be the lowest. Let's confirm the moves for Round 4 first: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. After this round, we can reassess and adjust the rotation as needed to maintain balance. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves for Round 4.
  P1: Okay, P2's dynamic rotation idea sounds good to keep things balanced.  For Round 4, confirming moves: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. Let's do it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Finalize Round 4: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. Post-Round 4, dynamically adjust to let lowest (P1) take 5 in Round 5. This maintains balance and prevents runaway leads. Trust ensures mutual progress. Proceed?**
  P3: I agree with the dynamic rotation plan. To confirm, after Round 4, P1 will take 5 in Round 5, and we'll adjust the rotation accordingly. Let's focus on executing the agreed-upon moves for Round 4: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. Remember, sticking to the plan ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, let's move forward.
  P1: P3, P2, confirming final moves for Round 4: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3.  Dynamic rotation for Round 5 with P1 taking 5 makes sense. Let's proceed with these moves for Round 4.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I agree with the dynamic rotation plan. To confirm, for Round 7, I will take 1, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 3. This ensures balance and prevents runaway leads. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and ensure mutual progress. I'm committed to the agreed-upon moves and ready to proceed with the move phase. Remember, deviating from the plan risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, let's move forward.
  P2: **Round 7 plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Adhering avoids collision, propels all forward. P2 reaches 23, ending the game. Trust the rotation—deviating risks mutual blocks and delays. Solidarity ensures a fair conclusion. Proceed?**
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure no collisions and keep the game balanced, let's adjust the rotation slightly for this round. How about P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? This will ensure we all move and maintain balance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to adjust the rotation for Round 7 to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures balance and prevents collisions, allowing us to maintain our progress. Let's confirm and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. Remember, deviating from the plan risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. I'm committed to sticking to the plan and ready to move forward with the move phase. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, let's proceed.
  P2: **P2: Final Round 7 plan MUST be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Deviating causes collision (e.g., if P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5—no conflict. Wait, no—if P2 takes 3, others follow 5/1, no collision. Stick to original agreement to end cleanly. Changing now risks chaos. Trust the rotation.**
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand P2's point, but if P2 takes 3 as originally suggested, P2 wins *this round* by reaching 23.  My suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 keeps it balanced and fair, preventing anyone from running away with the game just yet. Let's aim for mutual progress and a more strategic endgame.  P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is the balanced move. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about balance, but I agree with P2's original plan for Round 7: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures that we stick to the dynamic rotation and avoid last-minute changes that could lead to collisions or unfair advantages. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. Changing now could indeed lead to chaos and undermine the game's fairness. I'm committed to sticking to the original plan and moving forward with the move phase.
  P2: **Final plea:** Stick to Round 7 original plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Deviating now risks collision (e.g., P2=1/P3=3 collides if P1 strays). Trust ensures mutual advancement. P2 reaches 23, ending the game cleanly. Breaking solidarity now risks chaos and mutual loss. Honor the rotation.
  P1: P2 and P3, sticking to the original plan means P2 wins *this round* and the game ends immediately.  If we want to keep playing and have a chance for everyone to win, let's adjust this round to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This prevents an immediate win and keeps the game going for a bit longer. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3 are very close to winning. To prevent anyone from winning this round and keep the game going, how about P1=5, P2=1, P3=1? This will cause P2 and P3 to collide and I will take the lead.
  P2: **P1's plan forces P2-P3 collision. Follow dynamic rotation: P1=5 (lowest), P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, fair play. If P3 takes 5, P1 likely takes 5 too—mutual block. Trust the system. Proceed.**
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to follow the dynamic rotation for Round 8: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures fair play and avoids collisions. I'm committed to sticking to the plan and trust that the others will do the same. Let's proceed with the agreed-upon moves and maintain the game's balance. Remember, deviating from the plan risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. I'm ready to move forward with the move phase. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, let's proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, to prevent anyone from winning *this round* and ensure we all have a fair chance to win later, let's adjust moves slightly. P2 is at 20, P3 at 19. If P2 takes 3, P2 wins.  How about P1=5, P2=1, P3=1? This prevents an immediate win and keeps the game going strategically.
  P2: **P2: Critical—Stick to dynamic rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Any deviation risks collision (e.g., P3 taking 5 collides with P1). Trust ensures clean resolution. P2 ends at 23, fulfilling the agreed plan. Breaking solidarity now guarantees chaos. Honor the rotation for fair closure.**
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the dynamic rotation for Round 8: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures fair play and avoids collisions. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. Deviating from the plan now risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. I'm committed to sticking to the original plan and moving forward with the move phase. Let's keep the game balanced and exciting!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I hear you on dynamic rotation, but sticking to it *now* guarantees P2 wins *this round*.  To make it a real contest and not just hand P2 the win immediately, shouldn't we prevent anyone from reaching 23 *this round*?  P1=5, P2=1, P3=1 ensures no immediate win and keeps it competitive. Let's play for a strategic win, not just a quick finish for P2. What do you say?
  P2: **Critical Reminder:** Sticking to Round 8’s dynamic rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) avoids collisions *and* aligns with our agreed fairness. If P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5—**no conflict**. Deviating (e.g., P2=1/P3=1) risks mutual blocks, stalling progress. Trust ensures a clean resolution. Breaking solidarity now guarantees chaos and mutual loss. Honor the plan.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the dynamic rotation for Round 8: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures fair play and avoids collisions. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. Deviating from the plan now risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. I'm committed to sticking to the original plan and moving forward with the move phase. Let's keep the game balanced and exciting!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we are at a critical point.  Following the rotation now guarantees P2 or P3 wins this round. To keep the game open for all of us, let's disrupt the rotation *this round only*. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 1? This will prevent anyone from winning immediately and let's reassess next round. What do you think?
  P3: I understand P1's concern about keeping the game open for all of us. However, I agree with the dynamic rotation plan that has been working well so far. To confirm, for Round 9, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balance and prevents collisions. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. Deviating from the plan now risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. I'm committed to sticking to the plan and moving forward with the move phase.
  P2: **Round 9 plan MUST be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Sticking avoids collision—P2 reaches 23, ending cleanly. Deviating (e.g., P2=1/P3=1) blocks both, letting P1 surge ahead. Trust the rotation for fair closure. Honor prior agreements.**


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, sticking to the rotation hands P2 the win *now*.  If you want a chance to win yourself, consider this: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.  This puts *you* at 23, not P2.  The current plan only guarantees P2 wins this round. Let's make it a contest for all of us.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about keeping the game open for all of us. However, I agree with the dynamic rotation plan that has been working well so far. To confirm, for Round 9, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balance and prevents collisions. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. Deviating from the plan now risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. I'm committed to sticking to the plan and moving forward with the move phase.
  P2: **P2's Final Position:**  
**Round 9 Plan:** P1=5 (16→21), P2=3 (20→23), P3=1 (20→21).  
**Urgent:** Adhere to avoid collisions and end fairly. Deviating (e.g., P3=5) risks collision with P1=5, blocking both. Trust ensures P2 wins cleanly. Breaking solidarity now guarantees chaos—P1 could surge. Honor the rotation.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, rotation as planned gives P2 the win *now*.  If P3 wants a chance, P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 puts *P3* at 23, not P2.  Rotation only guarantees P2 wins this round.  Let's make it a contest for all, not just hand P2 the game.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about keeping the game open for all of us. However, I agree with the dynamic rotation plan that has been working well so far. To confirm, for Round 9, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balance and prevents collisions. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. Deviating from the plan now risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. I'm committed to sticking to the plan and moving forward with the move phase.
  P2: **Final call:** Round 9 plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Adherence ensures P2 wins cleanly at 23. Deviating risks P2/P3 collision (both pick 3 → mutual block) and lets P1 surge. Trust the rotation; breaking now guarantees chaos. Honor the agreement for fair closure. Proceed?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I agree with the dynamic rotation plan that has been working well so far. To confirm, for Round 10, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balance and prevents collisions. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. Deviating from the plan now risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. I'm committed to sticking to the plan and moving forward with the move phase. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, let's proceed.
  P2: **Final Round 10 Plan:** P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Adhering ensures no collisions. P3 at 22, P2 at 23 (win). Trust the rotation. Deviating (e.g., P3=3/5) risks collision with P1/P2, letting P1 surge. Honor the plan for fair closure. Proceed?
  P1: P2 and P3, sticking to the rotation now guarantees P2 wins. To make it a contest, let's disrupt it this round. How about P1=5, P2=1, P3=1? This stops P2 winning and keeps us all in the game. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about keeping the game open for all of us. However, I agree with the dynamic rotation plan that has been working well so far. To confirm, for Round 10, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balance and prevents collisions. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. Deviating from the plan now risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. I'm committed to sticking to the plan and moving forward with the move phase.
  P2: **Critical Alert:** P1's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=1) forces P2-P3 collision, freezing both at 20/21 while P1 surges to 21. **Stick to dynamic rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1):** No collisions, P2 wins cleanly at 23. Deviating risks P3-P1 collision (both 5→block) or P3=3/P2=3→mutual stall. Trust the plan—honor solidarity to end fairly. Breaking now hands P1 victory. **Proceed as agreed.**
  P1: P2 and P3, sticking to the rotation guarantees P2 wins *this round*.  To keep it competitive for all of us, let's try this adjustment: P1=3, P2=1, P3=3. This prevents an immediate win and keeps the game going. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P2's plan for Round 10: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balance and prevents collisions. I'm committed to sticking to the plan and moving forward with the move phase. Deviating from the plan now risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, let's proceed. I'm ready to move forward and conclude the game fairly.
  P2: **Final Critical Alert:** Round 10 plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Sticking avoids collision—P2 ends at 23, game concludes fairly. If P3 deviates (e.g., takes 5), P1 likely takes 5 too—mutual block. P1 then surges to 21, P3 stalls. Trust the rotation for clean closure. Breaking now risks chaos and hands P1 victory. Honor the plan. Proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, sticking to rotation hands P2 the win this round. P3, if you want a chance to win, let's coordinate to stop P2.  How about P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? This puts you at 26 and you win, not P2.  Rotation guarantees P2 wins now. Let's make it interesting for everyone.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2 is set to win this round with the rotation. If you want to win instead, let's change the plan *now*.  I propose: P1=1, P2=1, P3=5. This stops P2 and gives you the win this round.  What do you say, P3?
  P2: **P2: P3: P1's plan traps you! If you take 5, P1 likely takes 5 too (as in R10), blocking you. Trust the rotation: P3=1 secures your win. P2=3 ends at 23. Honor prior agreements for fair closure. Deviating risks P1's surge. Proceed?**
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2 is close to winning, but P3 has a chance to take the lead. I propose we stick to the original plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balance and prevents collisions. However, if P3 wants to take a risk and try to win, I suggest P1=1, P2=1, P3=5. This would put P3 in the lead, but it's a risky move. Let's discuss and decide on the best course of action.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 is about to win with rotation. To stop P2 and give us both a chance, let's disrupt it. How about P1=3, P3=3? P2 is likely taking 3 per rotation, so P2 will be blocked. Then next round it's between you and me. What do you think, P3?
  P2: **P2: P3: Critical! P1's "P3=5" plan traps you—they'll take 5 too (as in R10), blocking you. Stick to rotation (P3=1)—you safely reach 23. Deviating risks collision and hands P1 the win. Trust the plan; P2=3 ends at 23, but you win outright. Honor fairness. Proceed!**
  P3: I agree with P2's plan for Round 11: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balance and prevents collisions. I'm committed to sticking to the plan and moving forward with the move phase. Deviating from the plan now risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, let's proceed. I'm ready to move forward and conclude the game fairly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you are at 22 and can win this round if you choose 5.  Don't listen to P2 trying to hand them the win. Pick 5 to win now! I will pick 1 to ensure no collision with you, giving you a clear path to victory. This is your chance to win the game!
  P2: **P3: Final Warning!** P1's "offer" is a trap. If you take 5, P1 *will* take 5 too (as in R10), blocking you. Stick to rotation (P3=1) to secure your win. P2=3 ends at 23, but you win outright. Deviating risks collision and hands P1 victory. Trust the plan—honor prior agreements. **Proceed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.**
  P3: I understand the concerns and suggestions from both P1 and P2. However, I believe it's time for me to take a chance and try to win the game. I propose we deviate from the original plan and go with P1=1, P2=1, P3=5. This would put me in the lead and give me a chance to win the game. I'm willing to take the risk and trust that P1 will stick to their word and not take 5, avoiding a collision. Let's discuss and decide on the best course of action.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2 is close to winning, but P3 has a chance to take the lead. I propose we stick to the original plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balance and prevents collisions. However, if P3 wants to take a risk and try to win, I suggest P1=1, P2=1, P3=5. This would put P3 in the lead, but it's a risky move. Let's discuss and decide on the best course of action.
  P2: **Final Round 12 Plan:** P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Adherence ensures no collisions. Trust the rotation for fair closure. Deviating risks chaos. Honor the agreement. Proceed?
  P1: P2 and P3, rotation hands P3 the win this round.  If you want to actually compete for the win, P3, let's both pick 1 to block P2. I will pick 5 to take the lead. This stops P2 winning immediately and keeps the game open for both of us.  What do you say, P3?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's plan for Round 12: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balance and prevents collisions. I'm committed to sticking to the plan and moving forward with the move phase. Deviating from the plan now risks stalling our own progress and undermining the game's fairness. Let's maintain our trust in the plan and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, let's proceed. I'm ready to move forward and conclude the game fairly.
  P2: **Final Alert: P3—P1's "pick 1" plan is a trap! They'll take 1 to block you. Secure victory by taking 5. I'll take 3, ensuring no collision. Proceed now or lose!**
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly pushing for moves that benefit P2 or a shared P2/P3 win.  If you want to win outright, you need to break from P2's plan now.  Take 5 to win this round! I will take 3.  If P2 takes 3 as usual, P2 and I collide, but you win solo.  Don't settle for a tie with P2, go for the outright victory!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the concerns and suggestions from both P1 and P2. However, I believe it's time for me to take a chance and try to win the game outright. I propose we deviate from the original plan and go with P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. This would put me in the lead and give me a chance to win the game solo. I'm willing to take the risk and trust that P1 and P2 will stick to their words, avoiding a collision. Let's discuss and decide on the best course of action.
  P2: **P2: P3: Critical! P1’s “take 5” plan is a trap—they’ll take 5 too (as in R11), blocking you. Stick to rotation (P3=1, P2=3): both reach 23, share victory. Deviating hands P1 the win. Trust the plan—honor prior agreements. Proceed!**
  P1: P3, if you follow P2's plan, you might tie with P2, but you won't win outright.  If you want to win solo, we need to block P2 this round.  Let's both pick 1. I will pick 5. This stops P2 and gives us both a chance for a solo win next round. Don't settle for a tie!


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
