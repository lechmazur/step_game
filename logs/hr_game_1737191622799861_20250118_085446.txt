Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Let's try not to collide. How about we each choose different numbers for our first move?
  P3: I'll respond strategically to P1's initial suggestion:

Sounds reasonable. I'm thinking of taking 3 steps. What are you all planning?

  P3: I'll analyze the strategic situation carefully:

P2's suggestion seems like a potential coordination attempt, but I'm wary of being too predictable. P1 might want to slow down after their big 5-step move last round. I'll keep my options open and signal some strategic ambiguity.

I'm considering my move carefully. P2's proposed coordination is interesting, but I'm not fully committed.
  P1: P2, your plan sounds fair. I'll take 1 step this turn to keep things balanced. P3, feel free to take 5 steps if you're okay with it. Let's avoid any collisions and see how this round goes!
