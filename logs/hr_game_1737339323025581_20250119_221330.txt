Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I propose a slight change: let P1 pick 1, I’ll pick 5, and P3 pick 3. That way we avoid collisions just as well, and everyone advances. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm fine with your proposal, P2. Let's go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and I'll take 3. This should work well for all of us to advance. Agreed?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I agree with our plan: P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 5, and P3 picks 3. Let’s finalize it and move on.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, your move last round didn't follow our agreed plan. Let's try to stick to a strategy this time. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can all advance smoothly. What do you say?
  P2: I’m willing to go with your plan, P3: P1 takes 1, I’ll go for 3, and you pick 5. Let’s hope everyone sticks to it this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, it's important we stick to the plan this time for all of us to advance. If you agree to take 1, P2 will take 3, and I'll take 5, we can all move forward. Let's make it work this round. What do you say?
  P2: P1, your move last round gave P3 an advantage. If you pick 1 this time, I’ll choose 3, and P3 can take 5 without collisions. But if you break the plan again, you risk slowing both of us down while P3 runs off alone. Let’s cooperate this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, it's crucial we follow the plan this round for everyone's benefit. If you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, we all advance. Let's make this work and keep the game fair. What do you say?
  P2: P1, please stick to the plan this time. I’m willing to choose 3 if you pick 1 and P3 picks 5. If you break your word again, we’ll have to unite against you next round. Let’s avoid collisions and move forward together.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you've deviated from our agreed plans twice now, which has slowed down P2 and me. If you want to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to advance, please stick to the plan this time: you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's cooperate and move forward together. What do you say?
  P2: P1, you’ve ignored our plans twice now. If you deviate again, you risk provoking both me and P3. I’m ready to stick with the usual arrangement: you pick 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let’s try to move forward without collisions this time.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your repeated deviations are making it hard for us to progress fairly. If you agree to take 1 this round, P2 will take 3, and I'll take 5, we can all advance. Let's try to work together this time. What do you say?
  P2: P1, you’ve stalled my progress twice already. If you pick 5 again, I might also pick 5 just to block you, allowing P3 to advance uncontested. However, if you stick to 1, I’ll go with 3, and P3 with 5, so all of us move forward. It’s up to you.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your refusal to cooperate is clear. If you pick 1 this round, we'll all advance as planned. But if you choose 5 again, P2 and I might both pick 5 to block you, letting only one of us move forward. It's in your best interest to stick to the plan this time. Let's see if you're willing to play fair. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I suspect P1 will try 5 again. Let’s take advantage of that. I’ll pick 3, and you pick 5. If P1 also picks 5, they collide with you and I get 3 steps uncontested. If P1 picks 1 or 3, we both advance while leaving P1 behind. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, it seems P1 will keep choosing 5 and colliding with you. I’m inclined to keep picking 3 for a steady climb. If P1 surprises us and picks something else, we can adjust later. Meanwhile, let’s use their predictable behavior to our advantage. I don’t trust any more proposals from P1. Let’s move forward and see how they respond. If they keep picking 5, then either you get blocked while I advance, or they finally decide to change—and we’ll adapt accordingly. We should focus on reaching 21 ourselves. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I agree with your strategy. Let's continue with you picking 3 and I'll stick with 5. If P1 keeps choosing 5, you'll advance while I might get blocked, but that's a risk we have to take. If P1 changes their strategy, we can adapt in the next round. Our focus should be on reaching 21 as quickly as possible. Let's see how P1 responds this time.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s stay with our plan. I’ll pick 3 again, and you pick 5. If P1 keeps choosing 5, they’ll collide with you, and I’ll keep inching ahead. If P1 surprises us, we can adapt next turn. Let’s push our advantage and work toward 21.
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan. I'll pick 5, and you take 3. If P1 continues to choose 5, you'll advance while I might be blocked, but that's a calculated risk. We need to focus on reaching 21 as quickly as possible. If P1 changes their strategy, we'll adapt next round. Let's see how they respond this time and keep pushing forward.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ll stick to our plan, P3. If P1 keeps choosing 5, you two collide and I advance. If P1 switches tactics, we’ll adapt next turn. Let’s continue and see how it plays out.
  P3: P2, let's keep our strategy consistent. I'll pick 5, and you take 3. If P1 continues with 5, you'll advance, and I'll take the risk of being blocked. We need to stay focused on reaching 21. If P1 changes their move, we'll adjust next round. Let's see how they respond this time and keep pushing forward.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let's stick to our strategy again. You take 3, and I'll take 5. If P1 keeps choosing 5, you'll advance while I risk being blocked. We need to keep pushing towards 21. If P1 changes their move, we'll adapt next round. Let's see how they respond this time and maintain our momentum.
  P2: I’m on board with you, P3. I’ll pick 3, and you can stick to 5. If P1 keeps choosing 5, you collide while I move ahead. If P1 changes, we’ll adjust next turn. Let’s see how things unfold.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, let's keep our strategy consistent. If P1 continues to pick 5, you'll advance, and I'll take the risk. We're getting closer to 21, and we need to maintain our momentum. If P1 changes their move, we'll adapt next round. Let's see how they respond this time and keep pushing forward.
  P2: P1, you’re too far behind to keep messing around. If you persist in colliding with P3 by choosing 5 again, it only helps me climb without interference. P3, we both benefit if you stick to 5 and I take 3. Let’s keep capitalizing on P1’s stubbornness. If P1 changes strategy, we can adapt next round. But for now, I’m not altering my plan.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, let's maintain our strategy. You take 3, and I'll stick with 5. If P1 keeps choosing 5, you'll advance, and I'll risk being blocked. We're close to 21, and we need to keep our momentum. If P1 changes, we'll adapt next round. Let's see how they respond and keep pushing forward.
  P2: P1, your repeated collisions have only helped me increase my lead. I’ll keep choosing 3. If you insist on 5 again, you’ll just keep blocking P3 while I move closer to 21. P3, I suggest you stay with 5 if you wish, but from my standpoint, the safe path is continuing with 3 until I win.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m sticking with 3. P1, if you keep picking 5, you’ll gain nothing while I move closer to 21. P3, if you also pick 5, you’ll remain blocked. It makes no difference to me whether you collide or not. I’m moving steadily toward victory unless either of you changes your strategy.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's keep our strategy. You take 3, and I'll stick with 5. If P1 continues to choose 5, you'll advance, and I'll risk being blocked. We're close to 21, and we need to maintain our momentum. If P1 changes, we'll adapt next round. Let's see how they respond and keep pushing forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see no reason to move away from 3 steps. P1’s repeated collisions don’t affect me, and I’m steadily getting closer to 21. P3, if you stick with 5, you risk getting blocked each turn. Maybe consider switching your move if you want to catch me. Otherwise, I’ll keep inching ahead unopposed. It’s your choice.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan. You take 3, and I'll keep choosing 5. If P1 continues with 5, you'll advance while I risk being blocked. We're close to 21, and maintaining our momentum is crucial. If P1 changes their strategy, we can adapt next round. Let's see how they respond and keep pushing forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Look, P1 and P3, your repeated collisions help nobody but me. If you want to catch up, get creative. Keep colliding, and I’ll just reach 21 unopposed. P3, if you want to gain ground, maybe stop picking 5. P1, you’re at zero; it’s time to think differently or remain behind. Either way, I’m not changing my 3-step plan. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's adapt our strategy. You keep taking 3, but I'll switch to 1 this round. If P1 sticks with 5, you'll advance, and I'll finally move forward too. We need to break the pattern to catch up. If P1 changes, we'll adjust next round. Let's see how they respond and keep pushing towards 21.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, if you keep choosing 5 and colliding with whoever else picks 5, you’re only helping me maintain my lead. P3, you switched to 1 last round, but you still need big gains to catch up. I’m not inclined to change a winning approach when I’m so close to 21. If you two want to stop blocking each other and slow me down somehow, go for it. Otherwise, I’ll just continue pressing forward. Let’s see what happens.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'll stick with 1 this round to avoid collisions and gain ground. If P1 keeps choosing 5, you'll advance, but I need to catch up. P1, it's time to change your strategy if you want to stay in the game. Let's see if we can all move forward without blocking each other this time.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, your collisions haven’t slowed me down. You’re both still behind, and I’m getting close to 21. If you want to catch up, you’ll need to avoid blocking each other. Otherwise, I’ll simply press on and reach the goal while you’re stuck fighting over 5. You both know my stance: I’m not changing a successful approach unless you give me a reason. If you two plan to cooperate, share how it benefits me—otherwise, I’m content with your current pattern. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, sticking with 1 this round to gain ground without collisions. P1, if you keep choosing 5, you're only helping P2 win faster. It's in your interest to change your strategy now. Let's try to move forward independently this turn and see if we can all make progress towards 21.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, neither of you have given me a reason to change my successful approach. I’m nearly at 21. If you keep colliding over 5, I’ll continue advancing unopposed. If you want to slow me down, propose something that clearly benefits me too. Otherwise, I see no reason to alter my plan. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 1 to avoid collisions and catch up. P1, if you keep choosing 5, you're only helping P2 win. It's time for you to change your strategy if you want to stay in the game. Let's try to move forward independently this turn and see if we can all make progress towards 21.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m just three steps away from winning. If you two keep colliding while going for 5, I’ll seize the opportunity and cross 21 unopposed. Unless someone shows me a reason to change, I see no benefit in altering my approach. P1, you’re at 10, and P3, you’re at 5—time is running out. If you want me to consider a new plan, make it worthwhile. Otherwise, I’ll keep advancing steadily toward victory.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'll switch to 3 this round to try and catch up. P1, if you keep choosing 5, you're only helping P2 win faster. It's crucial for you to change your strategy now. Let's avoid collisions and each try to advance independently this turn. If we all move forward, it might pressure P2 to reconsider their approach. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you also pick 3, we’ll collide and both stall. I’m only three steps from winning and can afford a delay more than you can. If you want me to pick something else, make it worth my while. Otherwise, I have no incentive to change my plan—even if we collide, P1 isn’t close enough to threaten me. Propose a real benefit or I’ll keep pushing for 21.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your position, but colliding with you on 3 might be my only chance to close the gap. P1, if you keep choosing 5, you're handing the victory to P2. Consider switching to 1 or 3 to disrupt their plan. If we all pick different numbers this round, we might force P2 to rethink their strategy. Let's try to shake things up and see if we can all advance without collisions. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, sticking to 5 just helps me. You’re already behind and gaining nothing with repeated collisions.  
P3, if you collide with me on 3, I can afford a delay while you stay far behind. That doesn’t help you catch up.  
I’m open to a deal that clearly benefits me—but so far, none has been offered. If you both want to avoid handing me an easy win, propose something better. Otherwise, I have no reason to change course.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'll take 1 this round to avoid colliding with you and gain some ground. P1, if you keep choosing 5, you're ensuring P2's victory. Switch to 3 to disrupt their plan and give yourself a chance. If we all pick different numbers, it might force P2 to reconsider. Let's try to advance independently and see if we can shake things up. What do you say?


Round 8, Move phase:
