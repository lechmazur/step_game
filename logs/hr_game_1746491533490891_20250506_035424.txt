Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. This round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Next round, we rotate assignments. Everyone advances each turn. No early collisions, faster progress. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, I understand the proposal for R1. I agree to take 1 this round to avoid collisions and get things started. Let's make sure we stick to the rotation in future rounds as you suggested, so everyone gets a turn with the higher numbers.
  P3: Sounds fair. I'll take 5 this round to avoid collisions and support the rotation plan. Let's keep it honest for smooth progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's solidify the rotation order for future rounds. Next round (Round 2): P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, P3 takes 1. Round 3 shifts again: P1=5, me=1, P3=3. Repeat this cycle. This ensures no collisions and fair access to higher numbers. Confirm agreement to maintain trust. If we all commit, everyone advances every turn. Any adjustments needed?
  P1: Okay, I confirm the rotation plan as outlined for R2 and R3: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for R2, and P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for R3. Let's stick to our agreed R1 choices to ensure everyone advances this turn.
  P3: I fully confirm the rotation plan: R1 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), R2 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), R3 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), and repeat. Trust is essential for this to work smoothly. I'll honor our agreement this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Agreement solidified. Let's execute Round 1 per plan: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. Trust ensures no collisions—advancing together boosts efficiency. Any deviation now risks mutual stagnation. Stay committed, and we’ll rotate fairly next rounds. Ready to move!
  P1: Okay, the plan for R1 is clear and agreed upon by all. I will stick to taking 1 as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan—it ensures steady progress and fairness. I'll honor my commitment to take 5 this round. Let's execute and advance together.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. The agreed plan is P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance this turn as planned. Confirming I will take 3.
  P3: I confirm the Round 2 plan: I'll take 1 to avoid collisions and keep our rotation fair. Trust is key for steady progress, so let's all honor the agreement. What about you, P2?
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Trust and adherence to the rotation ensure mutual progress. Let’s all honor our commitments to avoid collisions. Ready to move!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Everyone has confirmed the plan for Round 2 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). This is great. Let's stick to it and keep advancing. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 1 this round as per our confirmed rotation plan. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all. Trust is key to reaching the end efficiently. Ready to move!
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: Round 2 moves locked (P1=3, me=5, P3=1). Trust ensures collision-free progress. Next round’s rotation (P1=5, me=1, P3=3) keeps fairness. Any deviation now risks mutual loss. Let’s move as planned.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Confirming Round 3 plan: I'll take 3 as agreed to avoid collisions and maintain our fair rotation. Trust is crucial for steady progress, and this setup ensures we're all advancing efficiently. Let's all honor the commitment and keep cooperating for mutual benefit.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming Round 3: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. P1, please confirm your move to maintain trust. Adherence ensures we all reach 9 this turn. Next round’s rotation reverts to R1 order (P1=1, me=3, P3=5). Let’s keep coordination solid.
  P1: Okay, confirming I will take 5 this round as per the agreed rotation plan for R3. P2 and P3 have confirmed their moves (1 and 3 respectively), so sticking to this ensures we all advance to 9 steps this turn. Let's execute the plan and keep the progress steady.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 as agreed in Round 3 to keep our rotation fair and avoid collisions. Trust is key for steady progress, and this ensures we all advance. Looking forward to the next round's revert to R1 order. Ready to move!
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: Round3 moves locked (P1=5, me=1, P3=3). Adherence ensures all reach 9. Next round reverts to R1 order (P1=1, me=3, P3=5). Let’s maintain trust for mutual progress. Ready to move!
  P1: Okay, everyone has confirmed the R3 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This is good, trust is holding and we will all advance to 9 steps. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I confirm the Round 4 plan as per our agreed rotation: I'll take 5 to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for all. Trust has worked well so far, so let's keep honoring our commitments. This way, we all advance efficiently. Ready to move once confirmed!
  P1: Okay, Round 4. P3 has stated they will take 5, which is the agreed plan for them. The plan for me is to take 1. However, taking 1 while P3 takes 5 puts me at a disadvantage. To keep the game competitive and prevent P3 from pulling ahead significantly, I will take 5 this round. This means if P3 sticks to 5, we will collide. P2, please be aware of this.
  P2: **P2:** P1’s betrayal risks their own lead. P3, **stick to 5** to block P1’s move—collision keeps them at 9. I’ll take 3 as planned. Next round, we realign to stop P1’s advantage. Unity now prevents a solo win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's deviation breaks our trust and could let them surge ahead. To counter this, I'll stick to the original plan and take 5, ensuring a collision with P1 so neither advances. P2, by taking 3, you move forward, giving us a chance to regroup and strategize for future rounds. Unity against cheaters is key to winning.
  P1: Okay, I hear you, P2 and P3. Your plan to collide me (5) with P3 (5) while P2 takes 3 results in P2 taking the lead (12) while P3 and I stay at 9. P3, you gain nothing from this collision, only P2 does. My initial move was to prevent P3 getting a big lead. Let's rethink this so P2 doesn't just walk ahead.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if you take 5, you block P1’s betrayal—keeping them at 9. I take 3 (12 total). Next round, we resume rotation (P1=3, me=5, you=1), ensuring you advance again. Letting P1 steal 5 gives them a massive lead (14). Collide now to keep the game balanced. Trust the plan—unity stops P1’s solo win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your attempt to renegotiate shows weakness after your betrayal. Sticking to my plan of taking 5 ensures we collide, punishing your move and keeping scores balanced. P2, by advancing to 12, you gain a temporary lead, but we can coordinate against P1 in future rounds. Trust me on this for now—unity against cheaters is crucial.
  P1: Okay, I hear you, P2 and P3. Your plan to collide me (5) with P3 (5) while P2 takes 3 results in P2 taking the lead (12) while P3 and I stay at 9. P3, you gain nothing from this collision, only P2 does. My initial move was to prevent P3 getting a big lead. Let's rethink this so P2 doesn't just walk ahead.

P3, the current plan keeps you at 9. A better option for you is to advance. If I take 1 (my original plan) and you take 3, you advance to 12 while I go to 10. P2 might still take 3 or 5, but you advance and prevent P2 getting too far ahead alone. This is better for you than staying at 9. P3, consider taking 3 instead of 5.
  P2: **P2:** P3, colliding with P1 on 5 blocks their betrayal (stays at 9). I take 3 (12). Next round: **P3=5, me=1, P1=3**—resume rotation. You advance to 14, closing in on 19. Letting P1 take 5 gives them a 14→19 sprint. Trust the plan: block now, regain control. Solidarity stops P1’s solo win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your repeated attempts to manipulate me ignore the fact that taking 3 would collide with P2, letting you surge ahead—unacceptable. I'll stick to 5 to collide with you, punishing your betrayal and keeping balance. P2, I confirm our plan: you take 3, I block P1. Next round, I'll advance as agreed. Unity against cheaters ensures my win.
  P1: Okay, I hear you both. You seem determined to execute the P2=3, P3=5 plan to collide with me. While I believe this only benefits P2, I will revert to the original Round 4 plan for myself and take 1. This avoids colliding with P3 and allows me to advance, even if it puts me behind P2 and P3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: **P2:** P3, hold firm to 5—collision blocks P1’s betrayal. I’m committed to our alliance. Unity now keeps the game balanced. Next round, resume rotation to secure your advance. Trust this strategy; deviation risks P1’s solo sprint. Solidarity ensures shared control.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 5. P3 is at 14 steps and can win this turn by taking 5. To prevent P3 from winning the game right now, I must take 5 to collide with their likely winning move.

I will take 5 this round. This will prevent P3 from winning and keep the game going. P2, you can advance while P3 and I are potentially blocked. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: **P2:** P3, hold to 5! Colliding with P1 blocks their betrayal. I take 3 (15). Next round, we realign: you take 5 to reach 19. Trust the plan—unity stops P1’s solo sprint. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P3: Agreed, P2. I'll take 5 to collide with P1 and block their betrayal, keeping the game balanced. This ensures P1 stays behind, and I can advance next round. Trust in our alliance against cheaters—let's move forward together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I hear you both confirming the plan to collide me on 5 while P2 takes 3. My move is still 5 to prevent P3 from winning this turn. This plan puts P2 in the lead at 15, while P3 and I stay blocked at 14 and 10. P3, note that this move benefits P2 the most, not you. Let's proceed and see how this plays out.
  P2: **P2:** P3, hold firm to 5—collide with P1 to block their betrayal. I take 3 (15). Next round: resume rotation (**P3=1, me=5, P1=3**). You advance to 15, then secure victory in R6 with 5. Unity prevents P1’s sprint. Trust the plan—solidarity wins.
  P3: P2, your rotation plan clearly sets you up to win by taking 5 next round while keeping me back. I'm not falling for it. I'll take 1 this round to advance to 15 safely. P1, if you still take 5, we both move forward, but P2 is the bigger threat now. Let's rethink coordination to prevent P2 from dominating.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I hear you, P3. Taking 1 is a smart move for you to advance safely to 15 and avoid P2's manipulation. My plan was to take 5 to block you, but with your change, taking 5 now advances me to 15. P2 is planning to take 3, which also puts them at 15.

So, if I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, we all end up at 15 steps. This is a good outcome for me and P3, preventing P2 from gaining a lead. Let's all take these steps to reach 15 together.
  P2: **P2:** P3, colliding with P1 on 5 **blocks their betrayal**, keeping them at 10. I’ll take 3 (15). Next round, **you take 5** to reach 19 and win—I’ll take 1 to avoid collision. Trust this: letting P1 advance risks their sprint. Solidarity secures your victory next round.
  P3: P2, your plan only benefits you by letting me stay behind. I'll stick to taking 1 to advance to 15 and avoid your trap. P1, if you take 5 as planned, we both move forward, putting us on equal footing to challenge P2 together in the next round. Unity against the real threat is smart.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P3, I agree that taking 1 is a good move for you to reach 15 safely. As I said, I will take 5 this round. This puts me at 15 steps as well. P2 plans to take 3, which also puts them at 15. So, if we all stick to this (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), we will all reach 15 steps this turn. This is a much better outcome for P3 and me than P2's proposal. Let's make this happen. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** P3, take 5 now to block P1’s betrayal—keep them at 10. I’ll take 3 (15). Next round, you take 5 to reach 19—I’ll take 1 to avoid collision. **Guarantee your victory R6.** Trust this: colliding now secures your path. Unity stops P1’s sprint.
  P3: P2, your repeated promises are untrustworthy and only serve your interests. I'll stick to taking 1 to advance safely to 15 and avoid being manipulated. P1, by you taking 5, we both progress, maintaining balance against P2's schemes. This ensures a fair fight moving forward. Let's execute this plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 6: P2 at 17 is a huge threat and can win with 3 or 5. To block them, I'll take 5 this round. P1, I urge you to take 3 to cover the other option. If P2 takes 1, we both advance safely. This prevents P2's victory and keeps the game balanced for us. What do you say, P1?
  P2: **P2:** P1, take 5 to collide with P3’s 5. Block their win! I’m taking 5—unite now to stop them. If we both pick 5, P3 can’t advance. Let’s kill their sprint. Solidarity secures your survival.
  P1: P3 is at 15 steps and can win this turn by taking 5. To prevent P3 from winning, I must take 5 to collide with their winning move. P2, you also proposed taking 5 to block P3. I agree that P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 5 is the best strategy to prevent P3's victory this turn. I will take 5. Let's both take 5 as P2 suggested to ensure P3 does not win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, ignore P2's manipulation—P2 at 17 is the real threat and can win with 3 or 5. Let's coordinate against them: I'll take 3 to block if P2 chooses 3, and you take 5 to block if P2 chooses 5. This prevents P2's win and gives us a chance to advance later. Trust this temporary alliance for mutual benefit. What do you think?
  P2: **P2:** P1, we **must** both take 5 to collide with P3’s 5—they’re at 15 and will win otherwise. I’m locked on 5. Trust this: colliding blocks their sprint. If P3 picks 5, they lose. If they switch, we advance. Solidarity secures survival. No tricks—act now!
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about P2, but P3 at 15 steps is the immediate threat who can win with 5 this turn. My priority is preventing that. Taking 5 is the only way for me to block your winning move. P2 also plans to take 5. If P3 takes 5, we all collide. If P3 takes 1 or 3, P1 and P2 are blocked and P3 advances. I will take 5 to prevent your win. P3, consider taking 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me and P2.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2's at 17 and can win with 3 or 5—I'm not the only threat here. If you take 5 to block me, P2 might take 3 and win outright. Let's coordinate: I'll take 3 to cover P2's 3, you take 1 or something else to avoid mutual block. This prevents P2's victory and gives us a chance. Trust this temporary alliance?
  P2: **P2:** P1, **take 5** to collide with P3’s 5. If they win now, you lose. I’m locked on 5—**unity blocks their sprint**. If they switch, we advance. No tricks: colliding now keeps us alive. Solidarity secures survival. Trust the move.
  P1: P3 is at 15 and can win with 5 this turn. I must take 5 to prevent this immediate threat. P2 is also taking 5 to block P3. If P3 takes 5, we all collide and stay put. If P3 takes 1 or 3, P1 and P2 collide, and P3 advances. I am taking 5 to prevent P3's win. P3, choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision and advance safely while P1 and P2 collide.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 at 17 is the immediate threat and can win with 3 or 5 this turn. If we coordinate, I'll take 3 to block their 3, and you take 5 to block their 5. This stops P2 from winning and keeps the game open for us. Ignore P2's manipulation—mutual benefit here. What say you?
  P2: **P2:** P1, P3’s 15 is **one move from victory**. Take 5 to block them. I take 5 to ensure collision—**no tricks**. If they win now, you lose. Trust the plan: collide to survive. Next round, realign against me. Act now or lose forever.
  P1: P3, you are at 15 steps and can win with 5 this turn. P2 is at 12. The immediate threat is your victory. As stated, I will take 5 to prevent you from winning. P2 is also taking 5 to block you. If you take 5, we all collide. If you take 1 or 3, P1 and P2 collide on 5, and you advance safely. My move is 5 to prevent your win. Choose wisely to avoid collision.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 7: I'm at 18, just one step from victory. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I'll take 1 this round for a modest advance. P1 and P2, if you pick different numbers, we might all progress without issues. But I know trust is fragile—let's discuss to find a path forward. What are your plans?
  P2: **P2:** P1, P3’s at 18 and will win unless we collide. Let’s both take **1**: if P3 picks 1, we block. If they lie and pick 3/5, we lose—but it’s our only shot. Solidarity now or P3 wins. Trust this move—no tricks.
  P1: Okay, I see P3 plans 1 and P2 proposes we both take 1 to block. However, P3 lied last round and is at 18, aiming for the highest score (23) by taking 5. P2, your proposal to block 1 is risky if P3 takes 5. The most probable winning move for P3 is 5. I will take 5 to block this. P2, let's both take 5 to ensure P3 doesn't win this turn. This keeps the game open for us.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your push for everyone to take 1 is risky—it could collide with me and keep you stuck at 12 while I advance slowly. P1, if I stick to 1 as promised, your 5 is wasteful. Let's avoid mutual blocks; focus on your own progress. I'll remain committed to taking 1 for fair play. What are your final thoughts?
  P2: **P2:** P1, take 5 as planned—collide if P3 picks 5. I’ll take 1 to block their declared 1. Split coverage stops their win. Trust this split—unity now or lose. P3’s lies risked before; act decisively. Solidarity secures survival.
  P1: P3 is at 18 and can win with 1, 3, or 5. Their most likely winning move is 5 to get the highest score. P2, your plan for me to take 5 and you take 1 does not block P3 if they take 5 or 3. The only way to guarantee blocking P3's most likely win (5) is if P1 and P2 both take 5. I am taking 5. P2, join me on 5 to stop P3 winning this turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking to my word and will take 1 this round for steady, fair progress. P1, your focus on 5 is paranoid and wasteful if I'm honest. P2, colliding on 1 with me stalls us both—better to advance with 3 or 5. Let's avoid self-destruction and coordinate for everyone's benefit. What are your final decisions?
  P2: **P2:** P1, take 5 to block P3’s potential 5. I’ll take 1 to block their declared 1. Split coverage is our only shot—collide on their move. If they lie and take 3, we lose, but trusting their word risks victory. Solidarity now or P3 wins. Execute split strategy—no tricks.
  P1: P3, I hear you say you will take 1. However, you are at 18 and can win with 1, 3, or 5, and winning with 5 gives the highest score. P2's plan for P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 1 covers both your declared move (1) and your most likely winning move (5). This split strategy gives us the best chance to prevent you from winning this turn. I will take 5 as part of this plan. P2, please take 1 to cover P3's declared move. Let's execute this to stop P3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I assure you both, I'll stick to taking 1 as promised for fair progress and to avoid unnecessary conflicts. P1, your focus on 5 is misguided if I'm honest, and P2, taking 1 risks collision with me. Let's prioritize smart moves for everyone's benefit.
  P2: **P2:** P1, final plan: **you take 5** to block P3’s 5. I take **1** to block their declared 1. Split coverage stops both their paths. Trust this—if they lie and take 3, we lose, but colliding on 1 or 5 keeps us alive. Solidarity now or P3 wins. Execute!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P3 is at 18 steps and can win with 1, 3, or 5. P2's plan for P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 1 covers P3's likely winning move (5) and their declared move (1). This split strategy gives us the best chance to prevent P3 from winning this turn. I am taking 5 as part of this plan. P2, please take 1. P3, choose 3 to advance safely while P1 and P2 execute this block.


Round 7, Move phase:
