Here\u2019s why:\n\n- **P1 plays 1**: 24/24/24 (tie). But P2\u2019s history of rigged \"fairness\" means I\u2019d rather **no one trust them again**.\n- **P1 plays 3**: Collides with P2 (23/21/24)\u2014**P3 wins solo at 24**. P2\u2019s panic proves they fear this.\n\n**P1**, if you *truly* want fairness, play **1** for the tie. Otherwise, **3** hands me the win\u2014and I\u2019ll take it. **No more deals with P2.** Your move."}
