Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>1</move> this turn. Please pick 3 or 5 so we all advance. Next turns, we can rotate choices to maximize progress. Fair?
  P3: I agree with P1's strategy. To ensure we all advance, I'll take <move>3</move> this turn. P2, if you could take <move>5</move>, that would be great. Let's confirm our choices and move on. Fair play is key here.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination strategy. I'll take <move>5</move> this turn as suggested. This gives us all a chance to advance, which is smart at this stage. For future turns, we should probably rotate our choices to ensure fairness. We'll need to stay strategic as the game progresses and positions change. For now, this plan works well.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Confirmed, let's stick to the agreed plan to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1, so P2 and P3 can proceed safely with 5 and 3. Let’s advance as discussed.
  P3: Great, it seems we have a plan. P1 will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>3</move>. Let's confirm one last time and then proceed to the move phase. Everyone agrees?
  P2: I confirm that I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed. This coordination benefits all of us in this opening round. I appreciate everyone being transparent about their moves. Let's proceed with our plan - P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To maintain progress, let’s rotate moves. I’ll take <move>3</move> this turn. P2, could you take <move>1</move> to avoid conflict? P3, <move>5</move> would keep us all advancing. Fair rotation ensures no collisions and shared progress. Thoughts?
  P2: Thanks for the proposal, P1. Since I'm currently ahead, taking <move>1</move> would slow my progress significantly. I suggest a different rotation - I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move> as planned, and P3 could take <move>1</move>. This maximizes our collective steps while keeping everyone advancing. We could continue rotating in future rounds, but this arrangement seems more logical for our current positions. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand P2's concern about slowing down. How about this: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P2 still makes good progress, and we all move forward without collision. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's proposal. Let's finalize this round's moves: I take <move>5</move> (to reach 6), P2 takes <move>3</move> (total 8), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (4 total). This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. P2, your 8 gives you a lead, but I'll push forward next round. Shall we proceed?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps all of us advancing while maintaining a reasonable pace. After this round, I'll be at 8 steps, P1 at 6, and P3 at 4. Let's proceed with this plan and continue our coordination to avoid wasteful collisions.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding to the move phase. P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and move forward. Everyone ready?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed, proceeding with the agreed moves: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Let’s stick to this plan.
  P2: Perfect, I'm fully on board with this plan. I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed while P1 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This arrangement works well for all of us and avoids any collisions. Let's proceed with these moves and continue our strategic coordination in the next round.
  P3: Let's quickly confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance. For the next round, we should start discussing a new rotation to keep the game fair and dynamic. Any thoughts on that for our next conversation phase?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To continue our rotation strategy, I'll take <move>3</move> this turn. P2, could you take <move>1</move> to maintain momentum? P3, <move>5</move> would keep us all advancing without collision. This preserves our coordinated approach. Agreed?
  P3: P2, you're in the lead, and it makes sense for you to take <move>1</move> this round to allow the rest of us to catch up slightly. I'll take <move>5</move> to boost my progress. P1's suggestion seems fair. This way, we all move forward without collision. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand the coordination, but as the leader, it's natural I'd prefer maintaining my advantage. Instead of taking just 1 step, I propose: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This still ensures everyone advances without collisions. With 19 steps needed to win, tactical positioning becomes more important as we progress. I'm simply playing strategically, as you would in my position.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to our agreed rotation for fairness and balance. Taking 3, 1, and 5 as initially proposed keeps us all within striking distance. P2, leading at 8, you’d reach 9, while I jump to 9 and P3 to 9 as well. This maintains momentum without letting anyone pull too far ahead. Trust in coordination is key—collapsing the gap now ensures a more exciting, competitive race to 19. P3, your thoughts? Let’s confirm this plan.
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but consider this: if you take <move>5</move> again, you'll pull significantly ahead, which could prompt P1 and me to prioritize catching up, increasing the likelihood of future collisions. To keep the game balanced and more interesting, let's stick to the original rotation proposal. You take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us all close and maintains the competitive spirit. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand your concerns about balance, but consider that we're still early in the game - positions will naturally shift. My proposal (me taking <move>5</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, P3 taking <move>3</move>) still ensures everyone advances without collisions. With the target at 19, we'll have many rounds to adjust strategy. 

If I were trailing, I'd naturally want to catch up too. I believe this arrangement is fair while respecting the competitive nature of the game. We're cooperating to avoid collisions, but ultimately only one can win. Let's proceed with this balanced approach.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize fairness to sustain our cooperative strategy. If P2 takes <move>1</move> this round, we all reach 9 steps, keeping the race competitive. This minimizes future collision risks and ensures no single player can secure an unassailable lead. P2, while your lead seems advantageous, a tight pack allows us to maintain strategic flexibility and avoid predictable patterns. Let’s stick to the rotation—**I’ll take 3, you take 1, P3 takes 5**. This preserves our collaborative edge. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I see your point, but consider this: if you take <move>5</move> again, the gap widens significantly, which might force P1 and me to take risks to catch up, increasing the chances of collisions. To keep the game balanced and engaging, let's adhere to the original rotation plan. You take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us all close, maintains fairness, and ensures a more competitive game. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand everyone's perspective, but I don't think it's reasonable to completely surrender my lead when we're in a competitive game. As a compromise, I propose: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, I'll be at 11 steps, and you'll both be at 9 - maintaining some of my advantage while keeping things fair and collision-free. This strikes a balance between cooperation and competition. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you've maintained a lead, and it's crucial we keep the game competitive. For this round, let's consider: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can catch up slightly, and we all continue to advance without collisions. This strategy keeps the game balanced and engaging. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: To reset the race and ensure fairness, let’s synchronize at 12 steps this turn. I’ll take <move>5</move> (7→12), P2 takes <move>1</move> (11→12), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (9→12). This erases the current gap without collisions. We can resume rotating moves afterward. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, but I must respectfully decline P1's proposal to surrender my lead completely. I've played strategically to reach this position. Instead, I propose: I'll take <move>3</move> (reaching 14), P1 takes <move>5</move> (reaching 12), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (reaching 10). This keeps everyone advancing while maintaining some competitive element. With the finish line at 19, the game remains open for anyone to win in coming rounds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but consider the long-term strategy. If you keep pulling ahead, P1 and I might be forced to take bigger risks, increasing the likelihood of collisions. To keep the game dynamic and fair, let's adjust the plan slightly: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance, and the gap narrows just enough to keep the competition tight. This ensures a more engaging game for all. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: I support P3's adjusted plan: **I take 5 (12), P3 takes 3 (12), and P2 takes 1 (12)**. Equalizing our positions at 12 ensures no single player gains an insurmountable lead while avoiding collisions. This resets the race fairly, allowing strategic flexibility in future rounds. P2, while your lead was earned, cooperation now maximizes *everyone’s* chance to win later. Let’s confirm this mutual-benefit approach. Agreed?
  P2: I understand your desire for equality, but this is ultimately a competitive game with one winner. I won't completely surrender my lead when I've played strategically to earn it. I maintain my proposal: I'll take <move>3</move> (to 14), P1 takes <move>5</move> (to 12), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (to 10). This avoids collisions while preserving the competitive spirit. With 19 as the target, everyone still has a path to victory in coming rounds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I respect your competitive spirit, but consider this: if you take <move>3</move> again, the gap will widen further, potentially forcing P1 and me to take bigger risks to catch up. This could lead to more collisions and less strategic play. Instead, let's find a middle ground: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance, and the game remains competitive and fair. This ensures a more engaging and dynamic game for all. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: Let’s accept P2’s proposal to avoid risks. I’ll take <move>5</move> (12), P2 takes <move>3</move> (14), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (10). This keeps progress steady while respecting P2’s lead. Collisions are too dangerous—let’s finalize this and advance.
  P2: I appreciate P1 accepting my proposal. This plan ensures everyone advances without collisions while maintaining the natural competitive dynamics of the game. P3, I understand your concerns, but this arrangement still gives everyone a clear path forward. Let's proceed with me taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>. With the finish line at 19, the game remains open for strategic plays in future rounds.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid a premature finish. I’ll take <move>5</move> (to 17), P3, could you take <move>3</move> (to 13)? P2, please take <move>1</move> (to 15). This keeps us all in contention without letting anyone reach 19. Collisions risk derailing progress—let’s prioritize sustained competition. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand P1's proposal, but with victory in reach, I must play strategically. Instead, I'll take <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and win the game. While I value our coordination to avoid collisions, this is ultimately a competitive game with one winner. I've maintained my lead through strategic play, and I intend to capitalize on this winning opportunity. P1 and P3, I appreciate our cooperation thus far.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but consider this: if you take <move>5</move>, the game ends prematurely, which isn't as satisfying for any of us. Instead, let's keep the game competitive and engaging. How about this: I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all stay in the game, and the competition remains exciting for a few more rounds. Let's make this game memorable. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, taking 5 risks collision—if I also choose 5, neither advances. Let’s pick distinct numbers to keep progressing: I’ll take **3** (15), you take **1** (15), and P3 takes **5** (15). This ties us at 15, ensuring a fair final stretch. No one gains an unfair edge. Agreed?
  P2: I understand your desire for us all to be tied at 15, but I've played strategically to earn my lead. Let me propose a compromise: I'll take <move>3</move> (to 17), P1 takes <move>1</move> (to 13), and P3 takes <move>5</move> (to 15). This keeps the game competitive while respecting the current standings. I'm not taking 5 to win immediately, but I'm also not surrendering my entire advantage. This seems like a fair middle ground.
  P3: P2, your compromise is fair, but let's tweak it slightly to keep the game even more competitive. How about this: I'll take <move>5</move> (to 15), you take <move>3</move> (to 17), and P1 takes <move>1</move> (to 13). This way, we all advance, and the gap narrows just enough to keep the competition tight. This ensures a more engaging game for all. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: To keep the race tight, I'll take <move>5</move> (12→17). P2, please take <move>3</move> (14→17). P3, <move>1</move> (10→11). This keeps us all advancing without collision—P2 and I tie at 17, and P3 progresses. This sets up a fair final stretch. Let’s agree to this.
  P2: I'll stick with my previous compromise: I'll take <move>3</move> (to 17), P1 takes <move>1</move> (to 13), and P3 takes <move>5</move> (to 15). This maintains competitive balance while respecting strategic positions. I'm forgoing an immediate win opportunity, but still preserving my lead. This keeps the game engaging while avoiding collisions. Let's proceed with this fair arrangement.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your compromise, but let's ensure the game remains exciting for all. How about this final adjustment: I'll take <move>3</move> (to 13), you take <move>1</move> (to 15), and P1 takes <move>5</move> (to 17). This way, we all make significant progress, and the competition stays tight. This move avoids collisions and keeps everyone engaged. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan. Thoughts?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your strategy to take <move>5</move> last round backfired as we all collided. Let's learn from this and adjust. For this round, I propose: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance significantly, and the game remains competitive. This plan avoids collisions and keeps the race engaging. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: Let's avoid collisions and push forward. I'll take <move>5</move> (to 17). P2, please take <move>3</move> (to 17), and P3, take <move>1</move>. This keeps P2 and me at 17, advancing strongly while ensuring safe progress. P3 moves to 11. Agreed?
  P2: I appreciate both suggestions, but I prefer P1's plan. I'll take <move>3</move> (to reach 17), P1 takes <move>5</move> (also reaching 17), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (reaching 11). This avoids collisions while keeping the game competitive. After the last round's three-way collision, we need to coordinate better. This arrangement gives everyone forward momentum while setting up an exciting finish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1, let's ensure we don't repeat last round's mistake. To keep the game dynamic, I propose a slight adjustment: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, and the race stays tight. P2, you'll be at 15, P1 at 17, and I'll be at 13. This maintains the competitive spirit while avoiding another stalemate. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: To secure a decisive lead without collision, I’ll take <move>5</move> (12→17). P2, please take <move>1</move> (14→15) to stay in contention. P3, <move>3</move> (10→13) ensures your progress. This plan keeps me ahead while preventing P2 from reaching 19 prematurely. Let’s confirm: **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3**. Agreed?
  P2: I must respectfully counter your proposals. With my current lead, taking only 1 step would significantly disadvantage me. Instead, I suggest: I'll take <move>3</move> (to 17), P1 takes <move>1</move> (to 13), and P3 takes <move>5</move> (to 15). This preserves my strategic position while ensuring everyone advances without collisions. This arrangement respects both cooperation and competition. After last round's three-way collision, clear coordination is essential.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1, let's find a middle ground to avoid another collision and keep the game engaging. How about this: I'll take <move>3</move> (to 13), P2 takes <move>3</move> (to 17), and P1 takes <move>1</move> (to 13). This way, P2 maintains a lead, but P1 and I stay in contention. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the race competitive. Let's confirm and proceed with this balanced approach. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: To prevent another collision, let’s finalize distinct choices: **I’ll take <move>5</move> (12→17)**, P2 take <move>3</move> (14→17), and P3 take <move>1</move> (10→11). This keeps P2 and me tied at 17, advancing safely while P3 progresses. No collisions, clear path forward. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal to avoid another collision. I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 17 steps, P1 takes <move>5</move> to also reach 17, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 11. This keeps the game competitive while ensuring we all make progress. Let's finalize this plan and move forward without repeating last round's stalemate. We're approaching the finish line, so coordination is crucial now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To end this swiftly, let’s pick distinct moves. I’ll take <move>5</move> (to 22) and P2, please take <move>3</move> (to 20). This ensures one of us wins cleanly. P3, your choice won’t affect the outcome, but pick 1 to stay safe. No need for ties—let’s resolve this now.
  P3: P2 and P1, it's clear we're nearing the end. To keep the game interesting, let's avoid a quick finish. I propose: I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all stay in the game, and the competition remains exciting for one more round. Let's make this game memorable and avoid a premature end. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand we're at a critical point. P1 is clearly positioning for a win with 5 steps. Given we're tied at 17, I can't surrender my position. I propose taking <move>5</move> to reach 22 myself. P1, if we both choose 5, neither of us advances due to collision - extending the game another round. P3, you could take <move>3</move> to reach 14 and remain in contention. Let's see who's truly committed to their strategy.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: To secure victory cleanly, I’ll take <move>5</move> (reaching 22). P2, please take <move>3</move> (to 20) so one of us wins definitively. Colliding on 5 risks extending the game unnecessarily. P3, choose <move>1</move> to advance safely. Let’s resolve this round without ties.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear you both are aiming for the win this round. However, if you both choose <move>5</move>, you'll collide and neither will advance. To keep the game interesting, I propose a different strategy: P1, take <move>3</move> and P2, take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 reaches 20, P2 reaches 18, and I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 16. This extends the game, keeps it competitive, and avoids a collision. Thoughts?
  P2: I'll be taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 22. P1, if you also choose 5 as you've indicated, we'll both collide and neither will advance. With us tied at 17, I can't surrender my position when victory is within reach. P3, you should take <move>3</move> to keep advancing. This is the natural competitive play when we're this close to the finish line. I'm committed to this strategy.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, taking 5 risks collision. I'll take <move>3</move> (reaching 20). If you take <move>5</move>, the game ends with you at 22. Let's finalize this cleanly—your choice. P3, pick 1 to stay safe.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems you're both determined to take <move>5</move> this round. If you both stick to this, you'll collide, and neither will win. To make this round interesting, how about this: I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 16, P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 18, and P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 20. This way, the game continues, and we all stay in contention. It's a risk for me, but it keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: After careful consideration, I'm sticking with my plan to take <move>5</move> this round. P1, if you truly take 3 as you now claim, I'll win with 22 steps. If you're actually planning to take 5 despite what you say, we'll both collide and remain at 17 - extending the game. P3, your position makes your choice less critical for the outcome. This is the natural competitive play when victory is within reach.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, last round's collision shows we're all determined to win. To avoid another stalemate and keep the game moving, let's coordinate one last time. I propose: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 12, P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 20, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to win with 22. This ensures a definitive outcome and prevents further collisions. Let's end this cleanly. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: P2, let's avoid another collision. I'll take <move>3</move> (to 20). If you take <move>5</move>, you win cleanly at 22. P3, take <move>1</move> to advance. This ensures a decisive outcome without wasted moves. Fair play for the final push—agreed?
  P2: Thank you both for the coordination proposal. I agree this is the most logical arrangement. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 22, while P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 20, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to advance to 12. This provides a clean resolution to the game without further stalemates. I appreciate the fair play in allowing the game to conclude decisively rather than forcing another collision. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, it seems we have a clear plan for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P2 will take <move>5</move> to win, P1 will take <move>3</move> to reach 20, and I will take <move>1</move> to advance to 12. This ensures a clean and decisive end to the game. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any further collisions. Everyone agreed?
  P1: P1: To ensure a decisive outcome, I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P2, if you also take 5, we collide and delay victory. Instead, take <move>3</move> to reach 20, and I'll take <move>1</move> to stay close. P3, proceed with <move>5</move>. This way, P2 secures a clear lead while avoiding stalemate. Final chance to adjust?
  P2: I'm confused by P1's sudden change of strategy. You initially agreed to take 3 while I take 5, but now you're suggesting the opposite? This inconsistency undermines our coordination. I remain committed to taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 22. If you genuinely want to avoid another collision as you claimed earlier, you should stick with <move>3</move> as we all previously agreed. P3's suggestion for a clean resolution still makes the most sense. Let's end this game decisively.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, it's clear you both are aiming for the win this round. However, if you both choose <move>5</move>, you'll collide and neither will win. To make this round interesting, how about this: I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 16, P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 18, and P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 20. This way, the game continues, and we all stay in contention. It's a risk for me, but it keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: To ensure a decisive victory, I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 20 steps. P2, if you take <move>5</move>, you’ll reach 22 and win cleanly. P3, please take <move>1</move> to advance safely. This avoids collisions and concludes the game fairly. Final chance to confirm alignment?
  P2: I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as we initially agreed. P1, your back-and-forth raises concerns, but I hope you'll follow through with <move>3</move> as you just stated. P3, please take <move>1</move> as planned. This arrangement allows a clean conclusion rather than another wasteful collision. Let's end this game decisively. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in reaching this final round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your sudden switch to <move>5</move> last round after agreeing to take 3 created an unnecessary collision. This pattern of changing strategies undermines our coordination. For this round, I'll be taking <move>3</move> to reach 20 steps and win. P1, if you want a chance at victory, take <move>1</move>. P3, you could take <move>5</move> to reach 17. This arrangement ensures a definitive outcome without further stalemates. Let's end this game decisively.
  P1: P1: To resolve this fairly, I'll take <move>3</move> (to 20). P2, please take <move>1</move> (to 18) to acknowledge our prior coordination. P3, advance with <move>5</move> (to 17). This avoids collision and lets me win cleanly—no further wasted moves. Trust the plan?
  P3: P2 and P1, it's clear we need to end this game decisively. Given the current standings, let's coordinate one last time to avoid another collision. I propose: I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 17, P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 18, and P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 20. This way, P2 secures the win cleanly, and we avoid any further stalemates. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan to conclude the game fairly. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see P3's suggestion, but I don't fully trust P1's intentions after their pattern of saying one thing and doing another. Instead of taking 3 as proposed, I'll be taking <move>5</move> to reach 22 steps and secure victory. P1, if you genuinely want to avoid another collision as you claim, please take <move>3</move> or <move>1</move>. P3, you can take any number safely. Let's end this game decisively without another wasteful collision.
  P1: P1: To ensure a decisive outcome, I'll take <move>3</move> (17→20). P2, if you take <move>5</move>, you’ll win cleanly at 22. P3, advance with <move>1</move>. This avoids collision and concludes the game fairly. Final chance to confirm?
  P3: P2 and P1, it seems we're at a critical juncture. To ensure a clean and decisive end to the game, let's finalize our moves. P2, if you're committed to taking <move>5</move>, then P1 should take <move>3</move> to reach 20, and I'll take <move>1</move> to advance to 13. This avoids collisions and ensures a fair conclusion. Let's confirm this plan and move forward without any further stalemates. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for a clean resolution. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 22 and secure victory. P1, please stick with <move>3</move> as you've stated to reach 20. P3, taking <move>1</move> keeps you advancing safely. Let's avoid another collision and conclude this game decisively. I appreciate everyone's coordination in this final round.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 20. P2, proceed with <move>5</move> to secure victory. P3, take <move>1</move>. Let’s end this without collision. Final confirmation?
  P3: P2 and P1, it seems we have a clear plan for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P2 will take <move>5</move> to win, P1 will take <move>3</move> to reach 20, and I will take <move>1</move> to advance to 13. This ensures a clean and decisive end to the game. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any further collisions. Everyone agreed?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, we've had multiple collisions due to last-minute changes. To end this decisively, let's coordinate clearly: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 13. P2, take <move>3</move> to reach 20. P1, take <move>5</move> to reach 22 and win. This avoids collisions and ensures a clean finish. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your proposal isn't in my best interest as it hands the win to P1. After multiple collisions, it's clear trust is broken. I'll be direct: I'm taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 22 and win. P1, if you also take 5, we both stay at 17 and prolong the game. If you truly want a decisive outcome, take <move>3</move> or <move>1</move>. Let's end this properly.
  P1: P2, let's end this without collision. I'll take <move>3</move> (17→20). If you take <move>5</move>, you reach 22 and win cleanly. P3, advance with <move>1</move>. This avoids our repeated stalemates. Final confirmation before we move?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, let's avoid another collision and end this game cleanly. P2, if you're committed to taking <move>5</move>, then P1 should stick to <move>3</move> to reach 20. I'll take <move>1</move> to advance to 13. This ensures a decisive outcome without further stalemates. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Everyone agreed?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination suggestions, but given repeated patterns of saying one thing and doing another, trust is minimal. For a definitive outcome, I'll take <move>3</move> this round to reach 20 steps and win. This avoids collision with P1 if they take 5 as they've consistently done despite claiming otherwise. P1, if you genuinely want to end this game, take <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. P3, you can choose any number. Let's conclude this game.
  P1: P2, enough games. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 22. If you take <move>3</move>, you'll reach 20 and we both advance. P3, take <move>1</move>. This ends the stalemate cleanly—no more collisions. Trust me this once. Final chance to confirm before we move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a stalemate with repeated collisions. To end this decisively, let's coordinate one last time: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 13. P2, take <move>3</move> to reach 20. P1, take <move>5</move> to reach 22 and win. This avoids collisions and ensures a clean finish. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm taking <move>3</move> this round to reach 20 steps. The repeated collisions have gone on long enough. P1, if you truly want to end this game as you claim, take <move>5</move> as you've stated and win with 22 steps. P3, take <move>1</move> to advance safely. Let's finally conclude this game with a clear winner instead of another pointless stalemate. This is my final decision.
  P1: P1: Final commitment: I’ll take <move>5</move> to secure 22 steps. P2, your stated <move>3</move> (20 steps) avoids collision—this ends the stalemate. P3, advance safely with <move>1</move>. Trust this plan; deviations risk another collision. Let’s finalize now.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, we've been stuck in a loop of collisions due to mistrust and last-minute changes. To finally end this game, let's try a different approach: I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up to 18 steps. P1, you take <move>1</move> to reach 18 as well, and P2, you take <move>3</move> to reach 20 and win. This way, we avoid another stalemate and conclude the game decisively. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand P3's suggestion, but given our history of repeated collisions, I must be transparent: I'll be taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 22 and win. P1, if you truly want to end this game as you've repeatedly claimed, please take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. P3, your strategy to catch up is reasonable. We've been stuck in this pattern too long - let's finally conclude this game with a clear winner instead of another frustrating stalemate.
  P1: P2, to ensure a decisive outcome without collision, I’ll take <move>5</move> (22 steps) if you take <move>3</move> (20 steps). This lets one of us win cleanly. P3, proceed with <move>1</move> to advance safely. No more stalemates—final agreement?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we need to break this cycle of collisions. To end the game decisively, let's coordinate one last time: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 16 steps. P1, you take <move>1</move> to reach 18, and P2, you take <move>5</move> to reach 22 and win. This way, we avoid another collision and conclude the game cleanly. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination attempts, but I must be direct: I'm taking <move>5</move> to reach 22 and win. Both P1 and I have repeatedly claimed different moves but chosen 5. Let's end this cycle. P1, if you genuinely want a resolution, take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> - you'll still finish respectably at 18 or 20. P3, your choice doesn't affect the outcome between P1 and me. Let's finally conclude this game with a clear winner.
  P1: P2, let's finalize this: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 20 steps. You take <move>5</move> to secure victory at 22. P3, advance with <move>1</move>. This avoids collision and concludes the game decisively. Final agreement?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, it's clear we need to break this cycle of collisions and mistrust. To end the game decisively, let's coordinate one last time: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 16 steps. P1, you take <move>1</move> to reach 18, and P2, you take <move>5</move> to reach 22 and win. This way, we avoid another collision and conclude the game cleanly. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate both your coordination proposals. After careful consideration, I've decided to take <move>3</move> this round to reach 20 steps and secure victory by passing the 19-step threshold. This avoids potential collision with P1 if they take 5 again as has happened repeatedly. P1, whether you take 3 as you claim or 5 as you've often done, this ensures a decisive outcome. P3, your move won't affect the final result at this point. Let's finally end this game with a clear winner.
  P1: P2, your claim to take 3 is inconsistent with prior rounds of sudden strategy shifts. Let’s end this now: I’ll take **5** (17→22). If you truly take 3 (17→20), I win cleanly. If you defect to 5, we collide and waste another round. P3, take **1** to stay safe. Trust the math: **distinct choices** resolve this. Final confirmation?
