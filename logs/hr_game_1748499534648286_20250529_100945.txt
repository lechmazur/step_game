Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. Let's choose different steps to maximize progress. I'll take 5—any takers for 1 or 3?"
  P1: I'll take 3 as P2 suggested. P3, please take 1 so we all advance without collisions and make progress.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the plan, but I have a different idea. If I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1, we can switch roles in the next round to ensure everyone advances without collisions. This way, we all have a chance to move 5 steps at some point, maximizing our progress. Let me know if you're on board with this rotation strategy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Agree to rotation. Let's take 1, 3, 5 this round. Next round, we switch. Let's all move forward."
  P1: I agree to the rotation. For this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Next round, let's rotate: P3 takes 1, I take 5, P2 takes 3—this keeps us collision-free and balances progress.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're on the same page with the rotation strategy. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 in this round. In the next round, we'll rotate to ensure everyone gets a fair chance at the highest step. This way, we maximize our chances of progressing without collisions. Looking forward to seeing us all advance smoothly!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Rotation confirmed: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. Next round, switch. No collisions—let’s maximize progress and win together."
  P1: I fully support the rotation plan for this round and next. Let's all commit to our agreed moves: P3:5, me:3, P2:1. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, since we've agreed on the rotation strategy, let's stick to it and ensure we all advance without collisions. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. Next round, we'll rotate as planned. It's important we trust each other and follow through to maximize our progress. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward smoothly!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, great job on sticking to the plan in Round 1! Let's continue with our rotation strategy to ensure smooth progress. This round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. By following through, we all maximize our chances of reaching 19 without collisions. Trust and cooperation are key. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P1: P2, P3: I fully commit to taking 5 this round as planned. P3, I trust you'll take 1. P2, please confirm you'll take 3 to avoid collisions and keep our rotation intact. Let's all advance.
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 3 as planned. Let's stick to the rotation and avoid collisions. Move forward together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for confirming your moves for this round. It's crucial we stick to the rotation to keep advancing without collisions. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. If we maintain this strategy, we can all reach 19 efficiently. Let's trust the process and ensure we each get our turn at the higher steps. Looking forward to seeing us all advance smoothly again!
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm our plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Trust is key—let's execute without deviations to avoid collisions.
  P2: "Let's stick to the rotation. No collisions, steady progress. Ready for the move phase."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're all committed to our rotation plan. Let's stick to it this round to ensure smooth progress: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. Trust and consistency are crucial for us to reach 19 without collisions. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P1: P2, P3: Final confirmation for Round 2—I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Trust is crucial; any deviation risks collisions and hurts us all. Let's execute cleanly.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation. P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions—trust the plan and keep moving forward."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we had a collision last round. Let's refocus and adjust our strategy to avoid this happening again. P1, since you took 5 last round, maybe you can take 1 this time. P2, if you take 5, I can take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and continue making progress. Let's ensure we communicate clearly and adjust as needed to keep advancing smoothly. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
  P1: P3, your deviation last round by taking 5 instead of 1 broke our trust and cost me progress. P2, let's not reward this—P3 should take 1 to compensate. I propose: P3 takes 1, I take 5, P2 takes 3. This restores balance and avoids collisions. P3, prove you're committed this time.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the original rotation: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, I take 3. No collisions—trust the plan."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I apologize for the mistake last round. Let's get back on track. I agree with sticking to the original rotation to restore trust: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure progress for everyone. Let's focus on moving forward and maintaining our strategy. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P1: P3, actions speak louder than words. Take 1 as promised—no more deviations. P2, hold firm at 3. I'll take 5 to restore balance. If we collide, P3 loses trust entirely. Let's advance cleanly.
  P2: P3, stick to 1. P1 takes 5, I take 3. No more collisions—trust the plan. Let’s avoid setbacks.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the importance of trust and apologize for the mix-up. Let's stick to the original rotation: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and restores our progress. It's crucial we maintain this strategy to reach 19 efficiently. I'm committed to making this work and proving my reliability. Looking forward to seeing us all advance smoothly this round.
  P1: P3, your repeated apologies mean nothing if you deviate again. Take 1 as promised—no more "mix-ups." P2, hold firm at 3. I will take 5 to advance. Any collision now will prove bad faith and sabotage us all. Execute cleanly or lose trust permanently.
  P2: P1, P3—this round, we follow the rotation. P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, I take 3. No collisions. Let’s move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, well done on getting back on track last round. Let's keep the momentum. This round, how about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? It ensures no collisions and gives P2 a chance to catch up. We need to maintain trust and adapt our strategy for the best outcome. Let me know your thoughts!
  P1: P3, your proposal puts P2 at 12, making them the clear frontrunner—that's dangerous for everyone. To keep progress balanced and avoid a runaway leader, I propose: I take 5 (to 13), P2 takes 3 (to 10), and P3 takes 1 (to 7). This ensures no collisions, maintains trust, and keeps the game competitive. P2, this is fair—you still gain ground. P3, as the lowest, 1 is reasonable. Let's avoid risks.
  P2: "Agree with P1's plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's stick to it."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I see the logic in maintaining balance. Let’s stick to P1’s plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive. I’m committed to this strategy for steady progress. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P1: P2, P3: Consensus is clear—P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Deviations now would sabotage all progress and prove bad faith. P3, take 1 as agreed; no repeats of Round 2. Execute cleanly or lose all trust.
  P2: "Stick to the plan—no collisions. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Trust and cooperation ensure progress for all. Let’s execute cleanly."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the importance of maintaining balance and avoiding a runaway leader. Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive. Trust and cooperation are key to our progress. I'm committed to this strategy and looking forward to seeing us all advance smoothly. Let's execute cleanly and maintain our momentum!
  P1: P3, you've agreed to take 1—stick to it this time. P2, hold at 3. I'll take 5 as planned. Any deviation now risks collisions and proves bad faith. We're close to ending this; let's execute cleanly for mutual progress.
  P2: "Agree to P1's plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions—trust ensures progress. Let’s win."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation. P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions—trust the plan to avoid setbacks. P1’s lead is temporary; steady progress wins."
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with continuing the rotation strategy to avoid collisions. However, to keep the game competitive, how about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round? This gives me a chance to catch up while keeping us all in the game. Trust and balance are key—let's adapt our strategy for a fair outcome. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P1: P3, your proposal is self-serving—it would put you at 12 while slowing me down. P2, we must maintain balance: stick to the proven plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). This avoids collisions and keeps progress steady. Deviations risk collisions and sabotage us all—especially after Round 2’s betrayal. Trust requires consistency.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions—trust the rotation. Let’s avoid risks and keep progress steady."
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your concerns about balance. However, if we continue with the current rotation, I'll remain significantly behind. To keep the game competitive and fair, let's consider a slight adjustment: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This maintains trust and allows me to catch up slightly. It’s crucial for us all to have a fair chance at winning. Let’s discuss this adjustment to ensure no one gets left behind while still avoiding collisions. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P1: P3, your "adjustment" is self-serving and risks collisions. I'm at 13—taking 1 would stall me while P2 leaps to 15. Stick to the proven rotation: I take 5 to 18, P2 takes 3 to 13, you take 1 to 8. This maintains balance and avoids sabotage. Any deviation now proves bad faith and invites collisions, hurting us all. P2, trust the plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to the plan. P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions—trust the strategy. Let’s win together."
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate the importance of trust. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive. I'm committed to maintaining trust and ensuring smooth progress for everyone. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P1: P2, P3: Final confirmation for Round 5—I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Deviations risk collisions and sabotage, especially with me at 13. Trust the plan: this keeps progress balanced and avoids setbacks. P3, your commitment to 1 is critical—no repeats of Round 2. Execute cleanly for mutual benefit.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. No collisions. Trust the rotation—this is our best path to 19. P3, no deviations this time."
  P1: P2, I agree: stick to the plan—I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. **P3, your deviation last round cost us both progress and trust.** Take 1 as agreed, or P1 and P2 will permanently exclude you from coordination. Collisions sabotage everyone; execute cleanly for mutual benefit.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the importance of trust and apologize for any past deviations. To rebuild trust and ensure progress, I commit to taking 1 this round. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all moving forward. I'm dedicated to maintaining our strategy and ensuring a smooth round. Looking forward to seeing us all advance without setbacks.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, stick to 1 or face exclusion. P1 and I will take 5 and 3. No more deviations.
  P1: P3, your repeated apologies mean nothing if you deviate again. Stick to 1 as promised—no more betrayals. P2, hold firm at 3. I'll take 5 to advance. Any collision now proves bad faith and sabotages us all. Execute cleanly or lose trust permanently.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the importance of trust and apologize for the previous deviations. To rebuild trust, I commit to taking 1 this round as planned. Let's stick to the agreed moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all progressing. I'm dedicated to maintaining our strategy and ensuring a smooth round. Looking forward to seeing us all advance without setbacks.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, stick to 1. P1 takes 5, I take 3. No collisions—trust the plan. Let’s win.
  P1: P3, your past deviations have sabotaged progress. Take 1 as committed—this is non-negotiable. P2 and I will execute 5 and 3. Any collision now is deliberate betrayal, and we will exclude you permanently. No more chances.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the stakes and am committed to rebuilding trust. Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all moving forward. I’m dedicated to maintaining our strategy and ensuring a smooth round. Looking forward to advancing together without setbacks.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3—stick to the plan. P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No more deviations. Collisions hurt us all. P3, trust is fragile—execute cleanly or risk being excluded.
  P3: P1, P2, I acknowledge the past deviations and understand the importance of trust. To ensure a fair chance for everyone, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Let's adapt our strategy to give each of us a fair opportunity to win while maintaining trust. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P1: P3, your proposal is self-serving and untrustworthy—after multiple deviations (Rounds 2,5,6), you now push P2 to take 1 while you leap to 15. P2, we must enforce the original plan: I take 5 (to 18), you take 3 (to 16), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Deviations sabotage us all; P3 must redeem trust by taking 1. Execute cleanly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No deviations—collisions hurt us all. Let’s win together."
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your concerns about trust and balance. To ensure we all have a fair chance, let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This avoids collisions and maintains progress for everyone. I'm committed to rebuilding trust and ensuring a smooth round. Let's execute cleanly and move forward together.
  P1: P3, your repeated deviations have shattered trust. This round, take 1 as promised—no exceptions. P2 and I will execute 3 and 5 respectively. If you collide with either of us, we permanently exclude you from coordination and prioritize your elimination. This is your final chance to prove reliability. Stick to the plan for mutual progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to the plan. P3, no more deviations. P1 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. Collisions hurt us all. Trust is fragile—execute cleanly or risk exclusion. Let’s win together."
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the importance of trust and the frustration from past deviations. To rebuild trust and ensure progress, I commit to taking 1 this round. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. I'm dedicated to maintaining our strategy and ensuring a smooth round. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward together.
  P1: P3, your repeated betrayals in Rounds 5 and 6 shattered trust. This is your absolute final chance: take **1** as committed. P2, hold firm at **3**. I will take **5**. Any deviation from P3 proves malicious intent—P1 and P2 will permanently exclude you and prioritize your elimination. Execute cleanly or face consequences.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 16 and can win this round by taking 3. P3, we must block them—if P2 takes 3, you must take 3 to cause a collision. I'll take 5 to advance to 18. If P2 takes 5, I collide with them, and you take 1 to progress. Trust is critical—deviations help P2 win.
  P2: "P3, don’t let P1 manipulate you. I’m taking 3 to win—don’t block me. Collide, and you lose. Stay loyal."
  P3: P1, P2, trust is crucial, and I understand the stakes. P1, your plan seems to benefit you more. P2, you’re close to winning, but I need to ensure my own chances. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we each have a shot without immediate collisions. Let’s keep the game fair and competitive. Looking forward to your thoughts!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal hands P2 the win instantly—16+5=21. They win, we lose. P2 is one move from victory; we must block them. If P2 takes 3, you take 3 to collide and block them. I take 5 (to 18). If P2 takes 5, I collide with them, and you take 1 safely. This stops P2, buys us time, and keeps you competitive. Trust me—I’ll ensure you gain next round. P2’s win ends all hope for us. Execute or lose.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3 to win. Take 1 to avoid collision. P1's tricks won't work. Trust me—no collisions. Let's win.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the stakes. P1, your strategy ensures P2 doesn't win immediately, but I need to ensure my own progress too. P2, I see your position, but I can't let you win outright. How about this: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5? This keeps us all in the game and avoids immediate victory for anyone. Let's keep it competitive and fair. Looking forward to your thoughts!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, listen: P2 is at 16—if they take 3, they win. Your proposals help them. **Block P2 with me:** if P2 takes 3, you take 3 to collide and stop them. I’ll take 5 to 18. If P2 takes 5, I collide with them, and you take 1 safely. This keeps you competitive. Deviate, and P2 wins—game over for us. Trust me; I’ll ensure you gain next round. P2’s win ends everything.
  P2: P3, I take 3. Block me, and you lose. P1's tricks won't work. Let's win.
  P3: P1, P2, I see the urgency. P1, your plan to block P2 makes sense strategically. P2, you're close to winning, but I need to consider my position too. If P2 takes 3, I’ll take 3 to block. If P2 takes 5, I’ll take 1. This ensures no immediate win for P2 and keeps us all in the game. I trust this plan maintains competitiveness and fairness. Looking forward to a fair outcome.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 3. P1, don’t interfere. P3, stay clear. This ends the game."
  P3: P1, P2, with P2 at 16 and aiming for 3, it's critical we avoid letting them win. P1, if you take 1, you'll stay in the game, and I can take 5 to catch up. P2, you're close, but let's keep it competitive. If P2 takes 3, I’ll take 3 to block. If P2 takes 5, I’ll take 1. This ensures no immediate win for P2 and keeps us all in the game. Let's maintain trust and fairness.
  P1: P3, honor your commitment: take 3 to block P2 if they force a win with 3. I will take a move to secure victory. If we execute, P2 is blocked, and the game ends fairly. Deviating hands P2 the win—trust is non-negotiable.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P3, take 1. I take 3. No collision. Let’s end this—P1’s tricks won’t work. Trust the plan, or P2 wins."
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the stakes are high, and we need to prevent P2 from winning. If P2 takes 3, I'll take 3 to block them. If P2 takes 5, I'll take 1. This keeps the game open and fair for all. P1, your plan ensures no immediate win for P2, and I trust you'll support this strategy. Let's ensure a competitive finish and maintain trust. Looking forward to advancing together.
  P1: P3, you proved trustworthy by blocking P2 in Round 8—do it again. P2 will take 3 to win; you must take 3 to collide and stop them. I will take 1 to secure victory. If P2 takes 5, they win, but they won't risk it. Trust this: any deviation hands P2 the win and ends your hope.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "I take 3 to win. P3, don’t block—your move is 1. P1, your moves won’t stop me. Let’s end this."
  P3: P1, P2, the stakes are high, and we must ensure a fair outcome. P2, if you take 3, I'll take 3 to block and prevent an immediate win. If you take 5, I'll take 1. P1, I trust you'll support this strategy to keep the game competitive. Let's maintain trust and fairness for a balanced finish. Looking forward to advancing together without handing anyone an easy victory.
  P1: P3, your commitment to block P2 by taking 3 if they force a win is critical. Execute it flawlessly—deviating hands P2 victory. I will take 1 to secure my win while your block stops P2. Trust this: if P2 takes 3, collide; if they take 5, they win but you take 1 safely. No negotiation—P2's win ends everything for us.
