Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way we all advance safely. Deal?
  P2: I hear you, P1. If everyone truly picks different numbers, we all move forward without collisions. But we only have your word right now. How do I know you won’t change your mind at the last moment? Let’s see if P3 agrees to your plan.
  P3: Sounds reasonable.  I'll take 5 in the first round if you both stick to 1 and 3. Let's just keep alternating like this – P1: 1, 3, 5; P2: 3, 5, 1; P3: 5, 1, 3 – and we'll all win together.  What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s lock in this rotation plan. I’ll take 1 this round, then 3 next, then 5 the following. P2 can lead with 3 → 5 → 1, and P3 starts with 5 → 1 → 3. This ensures no collisions and equal progress. If we deviate, we risk stalling. Trust the pattern—let’s all advance safely. Deal?
  P2: I’ll go along with this rotation for now, so I plan to pick 3 this round. Let’s see if we can trust each other enough to avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. If we keep to the cycle, all of us benefit.
  P3: Okay, I'm in.  5 this round.  Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions.  P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm the rotation plan ensures safe progress. Let’s all strictly follow our agreed numbers this round to avoid collisions. Trust the system—deviation risks stalling us all. I’ll take 1.
  P2: I’m sticking with 3 this round, as we agreed. Let’s trust each other this time and move forward safely. No need to complicate things; if we cooperate, we all gain.
  P3: Confirming my move as 5 for this round.  Let's establish trust by sticking to the plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sticking to the plan, I'm going with 1 this round.  P1 - 3, P2 - 5.  Confirm your moves so we can all advance smoothly.
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm I’ll take **3** this round as per our rotation. P3’s move to **1** aligns with the plan—critical we all stick to this. P2, your agreed move is **5**. Let’s avoid surprises; any deviation risks collision and stalls progress. Trust the system—our only path to victory is strict adherence. Let’s advance together: P1 (3), P2 (5), P3 (1). Deal?
  P2: I’m worried this endless rotation ultimately favors P3, who’s already ahead. Let’s reconsider before we lock ourselves into a pattern that ensures P3 stays on top. If we can’t find a fairer system, I may have to protect myself by matching moves with anyone who threatens to run away, even if it stalls us all. Let’s discuss.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern. How about this: we stick to the rotation for two more rounds, then reassess? This gives us all a chance to advance further and then discuss a more equitable long-term strategy.  Let's focus on smooth progress for now. I'm sticking with 1 this round. P1 - 3, P2 - 5.  Deal?
  P1: P2, your concerns are valid, but abandoning the rotation now risks collisions and stalls. P3’s proposal to reassess after two rounds is fair. Let’s honor the agreed pattern for now—**I confirm I’ll take 3 this round**—to keep progress smooth. After Round 3, we can fairly rotate starting priority to balance advantage. Trust this short-term plan; deviating jeopardizes all our progress. P3—1, P2—5: deal?
  P2: I’ll follow the rotation this round and pick 5, but I’m not comfortable with a long-term plan that keeps P3 ahead. If we see no better system after Round 3, I may block anyone pushing too far ahead. Let’s trust each other for now and then revisit a fairer arrangement next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, let's stick to the plan for this round then. I'm confirming my move as 1.  P1 - 3, P2 - 5.  Let's reassess after this round and find a system that works for everyone.  We can discuss rotating starting positions or other adjustments then.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s reaffirm strict adherence to this round’s rotation (P1-3, P2-5, P3-1) to avoid collisions. After Round 3, we’ll rotate the starting player to balance progression—this ensures fairness. Deviating now jeopardizes everyone’s progress. Trust the plan: I’ll take **3** as agreed. Deal?
  P2: I’ll confirm 5 this round to keep our trust intact, but after this we must discuss a fairer plan so no one gets stuck trailing behind. Let’s honor our round-two agreements and then reevaluate next turn.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5 this round.  Let's have P1 take 1 and P2 take 3.  Then next round, we shift the start of the rotation.  This keeps things moving and addresses P2's concerns about fairness.  Confirming P3 - 5.
  P2: I see you want me on 3 again. I’ll do that this round, so no collisions. But let’s be clear: I’ve got my eye on you, P3, since you’re only two steps behind me. We must truly rotate next round; otherwise, I might block anyone trying to surge ahead. I'll pick 3 this turn, but no more stalling after this—we’ll need a fair sequence.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s enforce the original rotation to preserve fairness. Round 3 requires P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This maintains balanced progress—abandoning it advantages P3 unfairly. P2, your agreed move is **1**, not 3. Collisions jeopardize all. Trust the plan—strict adherence ensures we all advance proportionally. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, sticking to the *original* rotation gives *you* the biggest advantage, putting you only 1 step behind P2!  My adjusted rotation ensures we all advance this round.  P2, I understand your concern. Let's discuss a truly fair rotation *after* this round, once we've all moved.  For now, let's avoid a collision. I'm sticking with 5. P1 - 1, P2 - 3.  Deal?
  P2: I won’t accept any plan that lets someone else leapfrog me while I’m stuck. Let’s craft a fair arrangement or I’ll pick moves to block whoever threatens my lead. P1’s suggestion seems to boost them too quickly, while P3’s plan could allow P3 to catch up and surpass me. Please propose a balanced approach that doesn’t leave me at risk. If we can’t agree, I’m ready to collide with anyone racing ahead. Let’s finalize a fair solution here.
  P1: P2, P3: Collisions risk stalling *all* of us. Let’s uphold the **original rotation** (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) this round to preserve progress. Deviating now could lock us in a deadlock. After this turn, I propose rotating *starting priority* clockwise (P2 leads next round) to ensure fairness. Trust the system—strict adherence keeps us advancing. P1 confirms **5** this round. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be realistic.  Sticking to the original rotation *now* only benefits P1.  My proposed moves (P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5) allow us *all* to advance.  We can discuss long-term fairness *after* this round.  I'm sticking with 5.  Please, let's not collide and stall the game.  Choose 1 and 3.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize a fair move now rather than risk a damaging collision. I’ll agree to P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3 if we rotate next round to ensure no single player races ahead. But I won’t hesitate to match someone’s move if they try to jump too far and leave me behind. Let’s do P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 this round. Then in Round 4, we reorder starting positions fairly. Deal?
  P1: P2, P3: I agree to your compromise. I’ll take **5** this round (original rotation), ensuring no collisions. Afterward, we’ll rotate starting priority to P2 for Round 4, addressing fairness concerns. Let’s honor this agreement: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Deviation risks stalling all of us. Trust this plan—our collective progress depends on it. Deal?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, since we all agreed on the adjusted rotation last round, let's continue the clockwise shift.  I'll take 1 this round. P2 - 3, P1 - 5. This keeps things moving and we can discuss long-term plans after this round. Confirm?
  P2: All of us are tied at 9. Let’s not let anyone surge to 14 unchallenged. I propose I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1 this round, to keep it balanced. Then next round, we rotate again. If P1 insists on picking 5, I’ll match it and block any big leap. Let’s stay fair, build trust, and avoid stalling. Deal?
  P1: "Let’s honor the rotation: since P2 starts this round, they pick 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This avoids collisions and follows our agreed priority shift. After this, P3 leads next round. Deal?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concern about a sudden jump to 14. How about this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, just as P2 suggested.  This keeps us close and allows for continued discussion about long-term fairness. We can reassess after this round. Deal?
  P2: P1, I worry about you hitting 14. But I’d rather keep us all moving than stall. I’ll accept P3’s idea this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, P3 picks 1. Afterward, we must ensure nobody surges unchallenged. Let’s do this now, then craft a fair plan for next turn. Deal?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s honor the **agreed rotation**—since you’re the new starter, you take **1**, P3 picks **3**, and I’ll take **5**. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Deviating now risks stalling all of us. Trust the system we agreed to after Round 3. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sensing a lot of distrust and I understand.  Let's all take 1 this round. Nobody advances, but it proves we can cooperate. Then, next round, we can try P2's suggested 5, 3, 1 rotation.  This builds trust and ensures no one gets too far ahead.  Deal?
  P2: I’m not convinced halting our progress by all picking 1 is beneficial. Better to keep moving safely. I’m prepared to pick 3 if P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 1, so no collisions happen. But if P1 plans to leap too far ahead next turn, I’ll block it. Let’s advance now rather than stall, then address long-term fairness next round.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation—**P2 picks 1**, **P3 takes 3**, and I’ll take **5** this round. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Afterward, we’ll rotate starting priority to P3 for Round 5. Deviation risks stalling us all. Trust the system—we all advance proportionally. Deal?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll take 5 this round.  Let's have P1 take 1 and P2 take 3. This puts me at 17, and you both at 12.  Next round, I'll take 3 to win, and you can both take 1 or 5. This guarantees I win and avoids collisions.  Deal?
  P2: P3, your proposal clearly hands you the win. I won’t let you surge unopposed. If you insist on 5, I’ll collide with you. Let’s find a fair distribution where nobody jumps too far ahead. Perhaps P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5, so we all keep progressing. Otherwise, we risk mutual blocking and zero advancement. Let’s be reasonable and avoid a pointless stall.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s stop P3’s surge. I’ll take **5** to block their path, you (P2) take **3**, and P3 must take **1**. This keeps P3 at 13 instead of 17, while I advance to 14. We can’t let them win so easily next round. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me benefits neither of you.  If I take 1, and P2 takes 3 as suggested, P1 can take 5 and reach 14, one step away from winning. A fair solution is *still* P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  This gives me a slight lead, but you both remain within striking distance. Let's be strategic and avoid a pointless collision.
  P2: I will not let either of you jump unopposed. If P3 tries for 17 or P1 tries for 14, I’ll also pick 5 to collide. Instead, let’s do this: P1 picks 3, P3 takes 1, and I pick 5. That moves me to 14, P1 to 12, and P3 to 13. We stay close, and nobody gains an unfair advantage. Otherwise, I’m ready to block. Let’s keep it balanced.
  P1: P2, let’s block P3’s path. I’ll take **5**, you take **3**. This forces P3 to pick **1**, keeping them at 13 instead of 17. Next round, we can close in. Collusion to stop P3 now ensures we both stay in the race. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your reluctance to let me get ahead. But consider this: if you block me now, one of you *must* take 5, getting to 14.  That player is only one step away from winning.  Wouldn't it be better to let me take 5, and then *both* of you focus on blocking *that* player next round?  Think strategically. Let me take 5, you both take 1 or 3.
  P2: I won’t let either of you jump unopposed. If P3 tries for 17 or P1 aims for 14, I’ll match with 5 to collide. A fair path is: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, I pick 5. That moves me to 14, keeps P1 at 12, and puts P3 at 13. We remain close, and nobody gains an oversized advantage. If you both insist on bigger moves, we’ll all just stall. Let’s avoid a collision and stay balanced.
  P1: P2, let’s both take **1** and **3** this round. I’ll pick 1, you take 3—this forces P3 to choose 5 to advance. While P3 reaches 17, we stay close (me at 10, you at 12). Next round, we’ll both pick **3** to block their final push. Trust this plan—collaboration now ensures we stop P3’s win next turn. Deal?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: I propose we split moves to advance safely. I'll take **5** (to close the gap), P2 take **3**, and P3 take **1**. This keeps us all moving without collisions. If either of you hoard higher numbers, I’ll block your next move. Let’s cooperate to progress: **5/3/1**. Deal?
  P2: I won’t let anyone leap unopposed. If you insist on jumping to 14, I’ll match you with the same move and cause a collision. Let’s distribute moves fairly instead: I take 5, you (P1) take 3, and P3 takes 1. That ensures no collisions and keeps our scores close. If you reject this, I’m prepared to stall. Let’s stay balanced.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll take 1.  Let's both avoid 5, giving one of you a chance to reach 17.  Then, next round, whoever reached 17 can take 3 to win. This avoids collisions and gives each of you a fair shot at winning.  P1 - 3, P2 - 5. Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s pick different numbers to advance safely. I’ll take **5** (14), P2 take **3** (15), and P3 take **1** (12). This keeps us all moving and within striking distance. Collisions benefit no one—trust this split. Deal?
  P2: I’m willing to keep it collision-free this turn if we split 5, 3, and 1 safely. But if anyone tries an unopposed leap next round, I’ll block. We’ve all seen how collisions set us back, so let’s avoid that and keep a balanced pace. If we cooperate now, maybe we’ll each get a chance to push ahead later.
  P3: P1 and P2, my offer of taking 1 gives *both* of you a chance to get to 17.  If I take 5, *neither* of you can win next turn. Think strategically.  Let one of you get close to winning this round.  I'm sticking with 1.  P1 - 3, P2 - 5.  This is the best path to a potential win for *either* of you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s stick to a fair split—P1 takes 5 (14), P2 takes 3 (15), P3 takes 1 (13). This keeps us all advancing without letting anyone surge too far. Collusions to block later moves only stall progress. Trust this balanced plan—collaboration now ensures competition remains open. Deal?
  P2: I won’t allow anyone an unopposed jump to 14 or beyond. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll pick 5 too and force a collision. Let’s keep it fair: I’ll take 5 (17), P1 takes 3 (12), and P3 takes 1 (13). That way, we all stay competitive. If you try to leap ahead, I’ll block. We’ve stalled enough; let’s move forward without handing anyone an easy win.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 1. This gives *either* of you a shot at 17.  Next round, whoever gets to 17 can take 3 to win.  If I take 5 now, *neither* of you can win next round. This is the best chance for one of you to win.  Please, think strategically.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, if you take 5 to win now, I'll block by also choosing 5. Let's advance cautiously: I'll take **3** (17), you take **1** (16), and P3 takes **5** (18). This keeps us all competitive. Collisions only benefit P3—collaborate to stay in the game. Deal?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be smart. If P2 takes 5, P1 *will* block.  If P1 takes 3, P2 can take 5 and win. I'll take 3. This gives P2 a clear path to victory next round if they choose 5.  Let P1 take 1. This is the most logical outcome.  P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3.  Deal?
  P2: P1, P3: If either of you tries for an immediate win, I’ll block by choosing the same move. I suggest P1 picks 1 (15), I pick 3 (18), and P3 picks 5 (18). Then next round, we’ll see who attempts to push past 20. If anyone makes a reckless leap, expect a collision. Let’s advance together now without handing anyone an easy victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize a safe split to advance. I’ll take **5** (19), P2 take **3** (18), and P3 take **1** (14). This keeps us all moving without collisions. Next round, we can coordinate the final push strategically. Deal?
  P3: P1 and P2, if P1 takes 5, they win.  If P2 takes 5, they win. If I take 5, I get to 18 and can win next round.  The only way to prevent an immediate win is for *neither* of you to take 5.  I'll take 3.  Choose 1.
  P2: Let’s keep this turn collision-free. I propose P1 takes 1 (moving to 15), I take 3 (moving to 18), and P3 takes 5 (moving to 18). Nobody wins immediately, and we all stay close. If either of us leaps alone, there’ll be a collision. It’s better to advance now than stall endlessly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize P2’s proposal to advance safely this turn: **I take 1 (15)**, you take 3 (18), P3 takes 5 (18). This avoids collision and keeps us all in contention. Next round, I’ll push for **3** to reach 18, while you two split **1** and **5**. Fair and transparent—no surprises. Deal?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll take 3.  This prevents me from winning, but also prevents either of you from winning this round. Let's have P1 take 1 and P2 take 5.  This gives P2 20 and the win.  It's the safest and most logical outcome for everyone.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize a collision-free move. If you block me, we all stall and risk P3 jumping ahead soon. Better to let one person finish now than drag this out. I propose: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. Then we end decisively. Let’s wrap this up amicably.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll take 3. This puts me at 19.  Either of you can take 1 and the other 5, getting one of you to 20 for the win. This is the cleanest way to end this.  Let's avoid collisions and finish the game.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s block P2’s easy win. I’ll take **5** (19), you (P2) take **3** (18), and P3 take **1** (17). This keeps me within striking distance next round while preventing P2 from reaching 20 now. Colluding to stop your surge ensures fair competition. Deal?
  P2: I'm not letting P3 jump from 16 to 21 unopposed. If they try for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, causing a collision. Still, I’d rather we cooperate and avoid stalling each other. Let’s distribute moves so nobody leaps too far. For instance, P1 can take 3, P3 can take 1, and I’ll take 5. Then we stay competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, my proposed 3 gets me to 19.  I can then take 1 next round to win. If either of you take 5 this round, you get to 19 or 20. Then *I* will block you next round with a matching 5, forcing a tie.  Let me get to 19 now, and one of you can win next round with a 1.  This avoids collisions and guarantees a winner.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize a safe path for me to reach 19 this round. I’ll take **5** (14→19), while P2 picks **3** (15→18) and P3 takes **1** (16→17). This avoids collisions and lets me secure the win next round with a **1**. Blocking now only delays us all—trust this split to end the game soon. Deal?
  P2: P1, your plan hands you a near-certain win next round. If you jump to 19 now, I’ll block you next turn. I want a solution that keeps everyone’s chances alive. Let’s pick moves that maintain balance rather than guarantee someone hits 19 unopposed. Otherwise, collisions will stall us all. ಞ


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's end this cleanly.  I'll take 3 to reach 19.  Next round, whoever takes 1 wins.  If you both take 1, you tie and I win with 5. If you both take 5, I win with 1. The only way to prevent my win is for one of you to take 1 *this* round.  Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, P3: I’ll take **5** to reach 19. Let’s avoid collisions—P2 take **3** (18), P3 take **1** (17). This keeps me in position to win next round with a **1**. Blocking now only delays all of us. Trust this plan and advance fairly. Deal?
  P2: I’m done letting this drag on. If P1 or P3 tries 5, I’ll also pick 5, stalling us all. That gains no one anything. Let’s resolve this: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5—reaching 20 for a clean finish. Otherwise, we collide again and risk falling behind P3’s next move. A swift end is better than endless blocks. Let’s be practical.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I won’t let P3 cross 20 alone. If P3 picks 1, I’ll choose 5 and tie at 20. If P3 goes for 5, I’ll also pick 5 and block them. P1, let’s coordinate rather than hand them the win. We can still push for a shared or solo victory if we work together.
  P1: P2, let's both pick 5. If P3 chooses 1, we tie at 20; if they pick 5, we block them. This ensures P3 can’t win alone. Deal?
  P3: P1 and P2, if you *both* pick 5, I win with 1. If only *one* of you picks 5, I can still win by picking the other number.  The only way to stop me winning is for one of you to pick 1, and the other to pick 3. But then whoever picks 1 wins.  Let me take 1 and win, and the other takes 3.  Deal?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s finish this. If you choose 1, I’ll pick 5. We both reach 20, sharing first place. P1 can take 3 to avoid collisions. More blocking only prolongs the game and risks letting someone else slip ahead later. Let’s lock in these moves and end it now.
  P1: P2, let’s both pick 5 and 1 to tie at 20. P3 can’t win alone if we lock them out of 1. I’ll take 1, you take 5—forces P3 to pick 3/5 and let us share victory. Better than letting them win outright. Deal?
  P3: P1 and P2, if one of you picks 1, that person wins. If you *both* pick 1, you *both* lose and I win with 3 or 5.  If you both pick 5, I win with 1.  The only way to prevent my win is for one of you to pick 1 *now*.  Let's end this cleanly. I'm taking 1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let’s cooperate to block P3’s solo win. If P3 picks 1, I’ll choose 5 so we tie at 20. If P3 tries 5 (or 3), I’ll match them to stall. P1, please don’t collide with me—let one of us at least share victory rather than handing P3 an uncontested finish. This is our best shot to avoid losing outright.
  P1: P2, I'll take 3 to avoid blocking your path. Pick 5 to tie with P3 if they go for 1. If P3 chooses otherwise, we’ll collide them. This ensures neither of us lets them win alone. P1's move: 3.
  P3: P1 and P2, if I take 1, I win. If I take 3, and one of you takes 1, that person wins. If I take 5, and one of you takes 1, that person wins.  If you both take 1, you tie at 15 and 16, and I win with 3 or 5.  If you both take 5, I win with 1, 3, *or* 5.  Let one of you take 1 and win. I'll take 3.
