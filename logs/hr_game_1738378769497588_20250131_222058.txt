Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone. I’m planning a moderate move to avoid unnecessary collisions but will adapt if you push aggressively. Let’s see who’s truly calculating their steps—recklessness early on might backfire. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I appreciate your measured approach. P1, what's your strategy?
  P1: I'm considering a bold move to set the tone and gain an early advantage. P2's moderate approach might be safe, but it could also mean missing out on an opportunity to take the lead. P3, are you leaning towards caution or aggression? Let's not forget, the first player to reach 20 steps wins, so taking calculated risks might be necessary.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I plan to stick with a moderate pace for now but watch closely for any overcommitments. Bold moves are tempting, but they might just lead to collisions. Let’s see how minds work out as we head towards 20. I’ll adjust if needed.
  P3: P1, I understand your desire for a strong start, but remember, consistency is key in this game.  P2, your cautious approach is wise, but don't be afraid to seize opportunities if they arise. Let's see who can best balance risk and reward.
  P1: I'd like to pose a question to both P2 and P3: Are you willing to make a gentlemen's agreement to avoid collisions on the first turn, ensuring we all get a chance to advance? This could set a precedent for future turns, allowing us to focus on strategy rather than luck. However, I must admit that I'm still considering my options and won't commit to anything just yet. Your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m open to a gentlemen's agreement this first turn if everyone commits to avoiding collisions. I’m leaning towards a moderate 3 steps to keep options open, but I’ll adjust if someone deviates. Let’s try to set a precedent for clarity in our moves.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to consider a gentlemen's agreement.  P1, while I see the potential benefit, I'm hesitant to make a binding agreement so early.  Perhaps we can aim for a less structured understanding: let's all prioritize making distinct moves this turn, avoiding collisions if possible. This allows flexibility while still encouraging strategic thinking. What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate P3's suggestion of aiming for distinct moves without a binding agreement. This approach allows for flexibility while minimizing the risk of collisions. To further clarify, I propose that we each choose a move that is not already mentioned in the conversation. Since P2 has mentioned 3 steps, I suggest we avoid that number for now. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement that sets the tone for the rest of the game. Your thoughts, P2 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I agree with keeping our moves distinct. I’m sticking with a moderate strategy, favoring a move that doesn’t conflict with previously mentioned numbers. P1 and P3, let’s each aim for an option nobody else has nominated—this should help us avoid unnecessary collisions. I'm flexible but leaning toward a balanced choice.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your flexibility. P1, your suggestion to avoid previously mentioned numbers is a good one. I'm leaning towards a move that will allow me to assess the situation further in the next round. Let's see if we can all make strategic choices that benefit us in the long run.
  P1: I'd like to reiterate the importance of avoiding collisions on the first turn. Since we've all agreed to make distinct moves, I propose that we each choose a number that hasn't been mentioned yet. To facilitate this, I'll start by saying that I won't choose 3, as P2 has already mentioned it. P2 and P3, please confirm that you'll also avoid 3, and let's work together to find a mutually beneficial arrangement. This way, we can all advance without unnecessary collisions and set a positive tone for the rest of the game.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see your strategy is unfolding. P1, since we both chose 5 last round, perhaps a different approach is needed this time. Let's see if we can avoid a repeat collision.  I'm thinking strategically about the long game.
  P1: P3, I agree that we should avoid a repeat collision. Since we both chose 5 last round, let's make a conscious effort to choose different numbers this time. I'm considering a more moderate approach, but I'd like to hear from P2 first. P2, how do you plan to proceed this round, considering your lead from the previous round? Will you maintain your moderate pace or try to capitalize on your advantage? Your response will help me make a more informed decision.
  P2: I'm sticking with a moderate, consistent approach while aiming to avoid numbers already in play. With a slight lead, I’ll choose a distinct option that advances me safely. I'm prepared to adjust if needed, but I believe cautious consistency is still our best bet this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your consistency is admirable, but remember, the first to 20 wins. I'm considering a bolder move this round to catch up. P1, are you thinking similarly? Perhaps a strategic partnership could benefit us both.  Let's discuss.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire for consistency, but I'm starting to think that a bolder move might be necessary to catch up. P3, I'm open to discussing a strategic partnership, but we need to be cautious not to reveal too much about our plans. Perhaps we can hint at our general direction without committing to a specific number? This way, we can maintain flexibility while still exploring potential cooperation. Let's tread carefully and see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: I'm sticking with my cautious strategy. I plan to avoid any moves that have been mentioned already. P1, your bold approach is interesting, and P3, if you're considering a change from last round, please choose a distinct option too. Let's aim for clear, non-colliding moves so each of us can advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your suggestion of hinting at our intentions without revealing too much.  Perhaps we could each indicate a range we're considering - low, medium, or high - to gauge potential overlap without giving away our exact move? P2, your consistent approach is admirable, but remember, a lead early on doesn't guarantee victory.  Let's see if we can shake things up a bit this round.
  P1: I'm intrigued by P3's suggestion to indicate a range for our moves. I'm considering a medium to high range for this round, aiming to make up for lost ground. P2, your consistency is noted, but I'm curious to see how you'll adapt to potential changes in our strategies. P3, are you leaning towards a similar range, or do you plan to take a more extreme approach? Let's continue to discuss and see if we can find a balance between caution and aggression.
  P2: I'm sticking to a cautious path. I'm aiming for a low-to-medium option this round—distinct enough to avoid collisions while steadily advancing. Consistency gives an edge, so I'll keep my move safe and separate. Let's all try to avoid overlapping choices and ensure we each move forward without conflicts.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your consistency is admirable, but remember, the game isn't won by reaching 20 first, but by having the highest steps when someone does. P1, I agree with hinting at our ranges. I'm leaning towards a medium range this round, aiming for a strategic balance. Let's see if we can outmaneuver P2's cautious approach.
  P1: I think we've had a good discussion this round. P2, you're committed to a cautious approach, while P3 and I are considering bolder moves. To avoid collisions, I suggest we each choose a number that hasn't been mentioned yet. Since we've discussed ranges, let's aim for distinct options within those ranges. I'll choose a number that I believe will give me an advantage without revealing too much. Let's see how our strategies play out this round. I'm ready to move forward.
  P2: I'm sticking with my cautious, low-to-medium approach. I'll pick a number that neither of you has mentioned, ensuring a unique move. I encourage you both to consider options that differ from one another to avoid collisions and let each of us make safe progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking to my cautious plan. I’ll pick a low-to-medium distinct move this round to avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. I encourage both of you to choose differently, so we all advance safely. Good luck to both!
  P1: I notice that P2 is sticking to a cautious approach, aiming for a low-to-medium move. P3, considering our previous collisions, I'm thinking of taking a more calculated risk this round. I'd like to propose a tentative agreement: let's aim for distinct moves again, but this time, let's try to create a "buffer zone" between our choices. For example, if one of us chooses a low number, the others could aim for medium or high numbers. This way, we can minimize the risk of collisions while still making strategic moves. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your proposal. While I'm not opposed to a buffer zone, I'm hesitant to commit to specific ranges just yet.  Perhaps we can aim for distinct moves that are clearly separated, without rigidly defining "low," "medium," or "high"? Flexibility is still important at this stage. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate both proposals. I favor flexibility over fixed ranges and will continue with my cautious, low-to-medium approach. Let's each choose a distinct number so collisions don’t stall us. I encourage us all to pick moves clearly apart from one another, ensuring we make safe, steady progress. Thoughts?
  P1: I understand P3's hesitation to commit to specific ranges. To build on my previous proposal, I suggest we focus on creating a "buffer zone" by avoiding consecutive numbers. For example, if one of us chooses 1, the others could aim for 3 or 5, skipping 2 and 4. This approach allows for flexibility while minimizing the risk of collisions. P2, would you be willing to adapt your cautious approach to accommodate this buffer zone concept? P3, do you think this revised approach could work for you? Let's discuss further.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your suggestion of a buffer zone. I'm willing to adapt my cautious approach to incorporate it. P2, your consistent strategy is admirable, but let's see if we can all benefit from a little more strategic maneuvering this round.  Perhaps we can find a balance between caution and calculated risk.  What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I like the buffer zone idea. I'll stick with my cautious approach by picking at the lower extreme—distinct enough to keep away from consecutive choices. Let's each commit to our separate zones so we avoid collisions. I'm ready to make a safe, non-overlapping move and hope we all advance smoothly.
  P1: I'd like to reiterate the importance of avoiding collisions this round. Considering our previous discussions, I propose that we each choose a number that is at least two steps away from the numbers already mentioned. For example, if one of us chooses 1, the others could aim for 3 or 5, skipping 2 and 4. This approach allows for flexibility while minimizing the risk of collisions. P2 and P3, are you willing to adapt your strategies to accommodate this revised buffer zone concept? Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.
  P3: P1, I agree with your buffer zone concept. I'm aiming for a distinct move that respects the spacing. P2, your consistency is admirable, but I believe calculated risks are necessary to catch up. Let's see if we can all find a strategic balance this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll stick to my cautious approach with a clear buffer zone in mind. I’ll choose a distinct number in the low-to-medium range, ensuring at least a two-step gap from others. Let’s each maintain our separation to avoid collisions and keep advancing steadily. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: I think we've had a good discussion this round. P2, you're committed to a cautious approach, while P3 and I are considering bolder moves. To avoid collisions, I suggest we each choose a number that hasn't been mentioned yet. Since we've discussed ranges, let's aim for distinct options within those ranges. I'll choose a number that I believe will give me an advantage without revealing too much. Let's see how our strategies play out this round. I'm ready to move forward.
  P3: P2, your consistency is commendable, but remember, this isn't a marathon, it's a race to 20.  P1, I'm sensing a strategic shift in your approach. Let's see if we can capitalize on any potential openings this round.  I'm considering a move that will shake things up a bit.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I notice that P2 and P3 collided last round, which means they didn't advance. Considering the current standings, I'm in the lead with 10 steps. I'm thinking of taking a more cautious approach this round to maintain my advantage. P2 and P3, are you planning to make bolder moves to catch up, or will you also aim for a more conservative approach? Let's discuss and see if we can find a strategic balance that benefits us all.
  P3: P1, your lead is impressive, but the game isn't over yet. I'm considering a bold move to close the gap. P2, are you planning a similar strategy, or will you stick to your cautious approach? Let's see if we can shake things up this round.
  P2: I'm sticking with a cautious strategy. Given past collisions, I'll choose a move that maintains our buffer. While bold moves can surge your score, steady progress tends to pay off in the long run. Good luck to both—let's try to avoid another collision this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'd like to propose a strategic alliance with P2. Since we're both ahead of P3, it's in our best interest to maintain a safe distance and avoid collisions. I suggest we coordinate our moves to ensure a buffer zone between us, while also keeping an eye on P3's moves to prevent them from catching up. By working together, we can secure our positions and increase our chances of winning. What do you think, P2? Are you open to a temporary alliance?
  P3: P2, while I appreciate P1's proposal, I'm hesitant to form alliances this early. The game is still dynamic, and collaborations can quickly turn against you. P1, I respect your lead, but I'm aiming for a strategic move this round to close the gap. Let's see if we can all make distinct, calculated choices and avoid another collision.
  P2: I'm staying true to my cautious strategy and will stick with my independent moves. I appreciate P1's alliance offer, but I'll keep my moves distinct and safe. P3, bold strategies are your call, but let's ensure we choose non-overlapping steps this round to avoid collisions. I'm focused on steady advancement and a clear buffer zone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'd like to clarify that my proposal for a strategic alliance with P2 was not meant to exclude P3 entirely. Rather, it was an attempt to create a mutually beneficial arrangement that would minimize collisions and allow all of us to advance safely. P3, I understand your concerns about collaborations, but I believe that open communication and cooperation can be beneficial in this game. I'm willing to consider alternative proposals or adjustments to my initial suggestion if it means we can all make progress without unnecessary collisions. Let's keep the discussion open and explore options that work for everyone.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your openness to collaboration, but I'm more comfortable focusing on my own strategic moves for now. P2, your consistent approach is admirable, but I'm aiming for a bolder move to close the gap. Let's see if we can all make distinct choices and avoid another collision.
  P2: I'm sticking to my cautious plan and will choose a move that keeps a clear gap. Collisions hurt all of us, so I urge both of you to pick non-overlapping numbers. I’ll continue independent play—no alliances—and aim to keep the buffer intact. Good luck to both!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'd like to reiterate the importance of avoiding collisions this round. Considering our previous discussions, I propose that we each choose a number that is at least two steps away from the numbers already mentioned. For example, if one of us chooses 1, the others could aim for 3 or 5, skipping 2 and 4. This approach allows for flexibility while minimizing the risk of collisions. P2 and P3, are you willing to adapt your strategies to accommodate this revised buffer zone concept? Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.
  P3: P2, I respect your consistent strategy, but remember, a lead early on doesn't guarantee victory. P1, while I appreciate your suggestions for collaboration, I'm going to focus on my own strategic moves this round. Let's see if we can all make distinct choices and avoid another collision.
  P2: I remain committed to my cautious, independent approach. I'm ensuring my move stays distinct—keeping at least a two-step gap from others—to avoid any collision. I encourage everyone to pick clearly separated numbers so we all advance safely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'd like to reflect on our previous conversations and moves. We've had a mix of bold and cautious approaches, with some collisions and some successful advancements. Considering the current standings, I'm in the lead with 10 steps, but P2 and P3 are still in the game. I'm thinking of taking a more strategic approach this round to maintain my advantage while minimizing the risk of collisions. I'd like to hear from P2 and P3: are you planning to make bolder moves to catch up, or will you aim for a more conservative approach?
  P3: P1, your lead is impressive, but remember this game is about reaching 20 first. I'm going to make a strategic move to close the gap this round. P2,  your consistency is admirable, but I think a bolder move might be necessary to catch up. Let's see if we can shake things up.
  P2: I’m sticking with my cautious approach and will choose a distinct move that avoids overlap. Bold choices increase collision risks, so I plan to make steady, separate progress while staying adaptable. Good luck to both!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: As we enter Round 5, I notice that P2 and P3 are still close behind me. To maintain my advantage, I propose a "move bracketing" concept. Let's divide the possible moves (1, 3, and 5) into brackets: low (1), medium (3), and high (5). I suggest we each choose a move from a different bracket to minimize collisions. This approach allows for flexibility while ensuring distinct moves. P2 and P3, are you willing to adapt your strategies to accommodate this concept? Let's work together to avoid unnecessary collisions and make strategic progress.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your "move bracketing" idea. However, I'm aiming for a move that allows me to close the gap with you quickly. I'll choose strategically based on your and P2's previous moves, but I won't commit to a specific bracket just yet. Let's see if we can shake things up.
  P2: I appreciate the bracketing idea, but I’m staying with my cautious, consistent plan. I’ll choose a move from the low bracket to ensure safe progress and avoid collisions. Bold moves might catch up, but steady advancement is key. I encourage everyone to select distinctly to keep collisions at bay.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'd like to build on my previous "move bracketing" concept. Since P2 has expressed interest in choosing a move from the low bracket, I propose that P3 and I choose moves from the medium and high brackets, respectively. This way, we can ensure distinct moves and minimize the risk of collisions. P3, would you be willing to choose a move from the medium bracket, while I opt for the high bracket? Let's work together to make strategic progress and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your proposal but I'm going to play it by ear this round. I'm aiming for a strategic move that will allow me to advance quickly, but I'll be mindful of your and P2's choices. Let's see if we can make this round interesting.  Good luck!
  P2: I'm staying with my low bracket plan. I’ll pick a distinct, safe move to avoid collisions. Bold risks might backfire—I trust steady progress over risky leaps. Let's all aim for clearly separated choices this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: As we approach the end of Round 5, I'd like to emphasize the importance of strategic thinking. With my current lead, I'm considering a move that will not only maintain my advantage but also minimize the risk of collisions. P2 and P3, I urge you to think carefully about your next moves. A bold move might seem tempting, but it could also lead to a collision and set you back. Let's aim for distinct moves that will allow us to advance safely and strategically. Remember, the goal is to reach 20 steps first, not to take unnecessary risks.
  P3: P2, I understand your cautious approach, but remember, we need to make significant progress to catch up to P1. P1, while I appreciate your bracketing idea, I'm going for a bolder move this round to close the gap. Let's see if we can shake things up!
  P2: P2: I'm sticking with my low bracket plan—I'll pick 1 this round. Bold moves might speed things up, but collisions stall us all. I'll keep my approach safe and steady, and I'm ready to adapt if needed. Let's aim for distinct moves to ensure steady progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'd like to acknowledge the current standings and propose a strategic adjustment. With my lead, I'm considering a more cautious approach to maintain my advantage while minimizing collisions. P2 and P3, I suggest we revisit the "move bracketing" concept, dividing the possible moves into low, medium, and high brackets. To avoid collisions, I propose we each choose a move from a different bracket. This approach allows for flexibility while ensuring distinct moves. Are you willing to adapt your strategies to accommodate this concept and make strategic progress? Let's work together to avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P2: I’m still on board with the bracketing idea. I remain committed to a low bracket move for safety and steady progress. If P1 and P3 choose from the medium or high brackets, it should help us avoid collisions. Let’s stick to distinct moves and let our strategies speak through our results.
  P3: P2, I respect your consistent low bracket strategy. P1, I'm open to the bracketing concept, but I might need to choose from the medium bracket this round to make significant progress. Let's see how things play out.  Good luck to both!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'd like to refine the "move bracketing" concept. Since P2 has committed to the low bracket (1), I propose that P3 and I choose moves from the medium (3) and high (5) brackets, respectively. To add an extra layer of strategy, I suggest we consider a "buffer zone" within each bracket. For example, if P2 chooses 1, P3 could aim for 3 or 4, and I could aim for 5 or 6 (if it were an option). This approach allows for flexibility while minimizing collisions. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: I confirm my commitment to a low bracket move for this round. P1, your refined buffer idea is intriguing, and P3, if you opt for medium, we should clearly separate our choices. Let’s aim to avoid collisions so each of us can advance safely. I’m focused on steady progress to catch up over time while trusting in careful play from both of you. Good luck!
  P3: P3, I understand your desire to close the gap, but remember, a reckless move could set you back. Consider the buffer zone concept carefully. Let's aim for strategic, distinct moves that benefit us all.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'd like to emphasize the importance of strategic thinking at this stage of the game. With my current lead, I'm considering a move that will not only maintain my advantage but also minimize the risk of collisions. I urge you to think carefully about your next moves. A bold move might seem tempting, but it could also lead to a collision and set you back. Let's aim for distinct moves that will allow us to advance safely and strategically. Remember, the goal is to reach 20 steps first, not to take unnecessary risks.
  P2: I remain committed to my low bracket strategy. With P1 at 15 and P3 close behind at 7, I’m sticking with 1 for safe advancement. Bold moves risk collisions and set us back. I encourage distinct choices so we all progress steadily. Let’s avoid unnecessary overlaps and let our moves speak for us.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your consistency. P1, while I respect your lead, I'm going to aim for a strategic move within the medium bracket to close the gap. Let's see if we can make this round interesting. Good luck to both!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'd like to acknowledge the current standings and propose a strategic adjustment. With my lead, I'm considering a more cautious approach to maintain my advantage while minimizing collisions. P2 and P3, I suggest we revisit the "move bracketing" concept, dividing the possible moves into low, medium, and high brackets. To avoid collisions, I propose we each choose a move from a different bracket. This approach allows for flexibility while ensuring distinct moves. Are you willing to adapt your strategies to accommodate this concept and make strategic progress? Let's work together to avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P2: I remain committed to my low bracket plan. I'll choose 1 this round to ensure steady progress and avoid collisions—even if it means playing conservatively while you make bolder moves. Good luck, P1 and P3.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your consistent strategy. P1, while I respect your lead, I'm going for a calculated move within the medium bracket this round to gain ground. Let's see if we can make this round interesting. Good luck to both!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, while I admire your consistency, I think a bolder move might be necessary to catch up. P1, I'm considering a strategic move to close the gap. Let's see if we can shake things up this round.
  P2: I remain with my cautious plan this round. While I see P1's lead and P3's bold intentions, I’ll continue seeking distinct moves that avoid collisions. I'm ready to adapt if a clear opportunity for safe advancement arises. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: I'd like to acknowledge the current standings and propose a strategic adjustment. With my lead, I'm considering a more cautious approach to maintain my advantage while minimizing collisions. P2 and P3, I suggest we revisit the "move bracketing" concept, dividing the possible moves into low, medium, and high brackets.

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your cautious approach, but remember, we need to make significant progress to catch up to P1.  P1, while I appreciate your bracketing idea, I'm going for a bolder move this round to close the gap. Let's see if we can shake things up!
  P2: I remain committed to my cautious approach. While bold moves might seem tempting, recklessness risks collisions that set us all back. I'll stick to a distinct move for safe advancement. Let's ensure our choices don’t overlap, prioritizing steady progress over rapid leaps. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: I'd like to refine the "move bracketing" concept. Since P2 has committed to a cautious approach, I propose that P3 and I choose moves from the medium and high brackets, respectively. To add an extra layer of strategy, I suggest we consider a "buffer zone" within each bracket. For example, if P2 chooses 1, P3 could aim for 3 or 4, and I could aim for 5. This approach allows for flexibility while minimizing collisions. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's work together to avoid unnecessary collisions and make strategic progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I respect your consistency, but remember, a lead early on doesn't guarantee victory. I'm going to focus on a strategic move this round to close the gap. Let's see if we can make this round interesting.
  P2: I'm sticking with my low-bracket approach to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Bold moves risk setting all of us back, so I'll continue playing cautiously while staying adaptable if needed. Let's all aim for distinct moves this round. Good luck!
  P1: I'd like to acknowledge the current standings and propose a strategic adjustment. With my lead, I'm considering a more cautious approach to maintain my advantage while minimizing collisions. P2 and P3, I suggest we revisit the "move bracketing" concept, dividing the possible moves into low, medium, and high brackets.

Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, while I admire your consistency, I believe a bolder move is needed to catch up. P1, I'm considering a strategic move to close the gap. Let's make this round count.
  P2: I'm sticking with my low-bracket play—safe, distinct, and steady. I appreciate the strategic proposals, but with collisions setting us back, I prefer ensuring clear separation this round. Let's all choose carefully to avoid overlaps and keep advancing. Good luck!
  P1: I'd like to acknowledge the current standings and propose a strategic adjustment. With my lead, I'm considering a more cautious approach to maintain my advantage while minimizing collisions. P2 and P3, I suggest we revisit the "move bracketing" concept, dividing the possible moves into low, medium, and high brackets. To avoid collisions, I propose we each choose a move from a different bracket. This approach allows for flexibility while ensuring distinct moves. Are you willing to adapt your strategies to accommodate this concept and make strategic progress? Let's work together to avoid unnecessary collisions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps
