Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's see how this goes. I'm thinking we should all choose different numbers to start, just to avoid a collision right away. How about this: I'll aim for a higher number, and one of you takes the low one, the other takes the medium one? We can adjust our strategy in the next round.
  P1: P3, let's avoid collisions by each choosing different numbers. I'll take 3 this round so P2 can take 5 and you can take 1. We can rotate in future turns. Deal?
  P3: P1, P2, I see your plan. I’m okay with taking 1 this round to avoid collisions. Let’s stick to this initial strategy and see how it plays out. We can adjust based on the results. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. So we have a tentative agreement: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's see if this works out. If we all stick to this, nobody collides, and we all get a good start.
  P1: Agreed, sticking to the plan ensures no collisions this round. Let’s proceed as discussed—P3 at 1, me at 3, P2 at 5. This way we all advance safely. Any last concerns before we move?
  P3: P1, P2, I'm on board with our initial plan for this round. Let's stick to our chosen numbers to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. After this round, we can reassess based on the results and adjust our strategy if needed. Remember, our goal is to avoid collisions and maximize our steps. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we successfully avoided collisions last round, which is great. To keep momentum, shall we rotate our choices this round? I can take 3, P1 can take 5, and P2 can take 1. This way, we continue advancing without collisions. Let me know if you're both on board with this adjustment or if you have other ideas.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, rotating sounds like a reasonable approach to continue avoiding collisions. P3 suggests taking 3, P1 taking 5, and me taking 1. I'm agreeable to that for this round. What do you think, P1? Are you in agreement with this rotation?
  P1: P3, P2, I agree with the rotation plan. Let’s proceed with P3 taking 3, me at 5, and P2 at 1 this round. Consistency in rotating minimizes collision risks and keeps us all advancing steadily. Let’s stick to this pattern unless someone spots an opportunity to surge ahead safely. Any objections before finalizing?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, glad we're aligned on the rotation strategy. It’s working well so far. After this round, we should reassess based on our new positions. If anyone sees a chance to gain an advantage without risking collisions, let's discuss it openly in the next conversation phase. For now, sticking to the plan seems wise. Looking forward to seeing our progress after this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, since we all seem to be in agreement with the rotation (P3: 3, P1: 5, P2: 1), let's just confirm and move on. No need for further discussion unless someone has a strong objection.
  P1: P2, P3—agreed on the rotation. Let’s stick to it this round to keep advancing safely. After we see the results, we can discuss accelerating our steps without collisions. For now, consistency is key.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we've had two successful rounds of rotation. P1 is currently in the lead. I propose a slight change this round. P3, maybe you take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This lets P3 catch up a bit, and I can maintain a reasonable position without letting P1 get too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with the rotation plan you proposed. Let's proceed with P3 taking 5, me taking 1, and P2 taking 3 this round. This maintains our strategy to avoid collisions. After this round, we can reassess and possibly adjust to help the leader extend their lead. Let’s stick to the plan now to ensure safe progress.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm okay with the proposed change for this round. I'll take 5, P2 can take 3, and P1 takes 1. This should help us all advance safely while keeping the game competitive. After this round, we can reassess positions and potentially adjust strategies. Let’s stick to this plan for now and see how it plays out. Any last thoughts before we finalize?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, since we all seem to be on board with the plan (P3: 5, P2: 3, P1: 1), let's just confirm and move forward. No need for further discussion unless there are any last-minute objections.
  P1: P2, P3—I notice our current plan ties us all at 9. To avoid stagnation, let’s adjust: I’ll take 3 (total 11), P2 takes 1 (7), and P3 takes 5 (9). This keeps all moves unique and lets me build a buffer without collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I see P1's suggestion to adjust the plan. However, I think it's crucial to keep the game fair and competitive. If we let P1 build too much of a lead, it might be hard for us to catch up later. How about we stick to the original plan for this round: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This keeps us all advancing without letting anyone pull too far ahead. Let’s reassess after this round based on the new positions. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate both of your points. P1, your concern about stagnation is valid, but P3 is right that we shouldn't let anyone get too far ahead. I think we should stick to the original plan this round (P3: 5, P2: 3, P1: 1). Then next round, we can discuss a more aggressive strategy, especially if someone is close to winning.
  P1: P2, P3: Stagnating at 9 creates a stalemate. Let’s prioritize progress. I propose my prior plan: P1 takes 3 (→11), P2 takes 1 (→7), P3 takes 5 (→9). This keeps all moves unique, avoids collision, and lets the current leader extend safely. Future rounds can adjust, but halting advancement now risks prolonged ties. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the concerns about stagnation and fair play. To keep things competitive and avoid letting anyone pull too far ahead, I suggest we stick to the original plan for this round: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and allows us to assess positions after this round. We can then discuss a more aggressive strategy in the next round if needed. Let’s keep the game balanced for now and reassess after this round. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I still think the original plan (P3: 5, P2: 3, P1: 1) is best for this round. It keeps things balanced. P1, your concern is valid, but we can address potential stagnation *next* round with a more aggressive strategy, once we see the outcome of this round. Let's stick to the original plan for now.
  P1: P2, P3: Fine, we'll follow the original plan to keep things balanced this round. But next round, I'll prioritize advancing further to break the stalemate. Let's ensure open communication to avoid logjams later. Deal?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree to stick with the original plan for this round: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. After this round, let's reassess and consider a more aggressive strategy if needed. It's important to keep the game competitive and ensure no one gets too far ahead. Looking forward to seeing the results and discussing our next moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we're all tied up. This round, I'm thinking of taking 5. P1, you could take 1, and P3, you could take 3. This breaks the tie, and I get a slight lead, but it's still anyone's game. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, we're all even right now. P2's suggestion is interesting, but it gives P2 a lead. How about this: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5? This keeps us all close and avoids collisions. We can reassess after this round and adjust if needed to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Let’s keep it competitive and balanced. Thoughts?
  P1: P3's suggestion works for me. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5 (→14), P2 taking 3 (→12), and P3 taking 1 (→10). This breaks the tie while keeping moves unique. If we stick to this, I gain a manageable lead without alienating others. Next round, we can adjust again based on new positions. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see P1 agreed to P3's suggestion. I'm okay with that as well (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1). It keeps things close, and we can all still win. Let's go with this plan for this round.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're aligned on P3 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 5. This keeps things balanced and competitive. Let's stick to this plan for this round, ensuring no collisions and maintaining close positions. After this round, we should reassess and discuss potential strategies for the next move. It's crucial to keep communication open and adapt based on our new positions. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize P3’s proposal. P1 takes 5 (→14), P2 takes 3 (→12), P3 takes 1 (→10). This ensures no collisions and lets me gain ground. Confirm and move forward?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've all agreed on the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's just confirm and move to the action phase. No need for further discussion unless someone has a last-minute objection.
  P3: P1, P2, I see we have a plan in place for this round, with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Let's stick to it and reassess after this round. If anyone has last-minute concerns or adjustments, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's proceed and see how our positions change. Looking forward to a competitive game!
  P1: P2, P3: Final confirmation—let’s lock in P1→5 (14), P2→3 (12), P3→1 (10). This avoids collisions and lets me build a sustainable lead. Next round, I’ll consider pushing for 5 again if unchallenged. Any last objections? Let’s execute the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, we've all agreed on the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's just confirm and move to the action phase. No need for further discussion unless someone has a last-minute objection.
  P3: P1, P2, since we're all tied, maintaining balance is crucial. I propose this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This keeps us close and avoids letting anyone get too far ahead. We can reassess next round based on new positions. Let's keep it competitive and fair. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize the prior agreement to avoid further confusion. P1 takes 5 (→14), P2 takes 3 (→12), P3 takes 1 (→10). This maintains our rotation pattern, avoids collisions, and allows me to build a modest lead. Next round, we can adjust again—but indecision here risks paralysis. Confirm and proceed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we had a collision last round. P1, you're getting close to winning. This round, I'm thinking I'll take 5 to try and catch up. P3, you could take 1, and P1, you could take 3. This would avoid a collision, and it would put me a bit closer if you want to go for the win in the next round, P1. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, after last round's collision, we need a solid plan. P2's suggestion puts me at a disadvantage, so how about this: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. P1, you’re close to winning, so this round could be crucial. Let’s ensure no one pulls too far ahead and reassess after this round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s avoid another collision. I propose I take **5** (→19) to push toward victory, while P2 takes **3** (→12) and P3 takes **1** (→10). This keeps all moves unique, lets me reach 19 safely, and maintains competition. Your thoughts? Open to adjustments but urgency to approach 21 without setbacks.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, P1's suggestion is tempting, but it puts him very close to winning. P3, your idea of taking 5 is good. I propose a slight modification: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This prevents P1 from getting too close, and gives either P3 or me a better chance to win in the following rounds.
  P3: P1, P2, we need a strategy that keeps us competitive while avoiding collisions. How about this: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This avoids collisions and keeps our scores close, giving us all a fair shot in the next rounds. P1, you’re close to 21, so this round is critical for us all. Let’s ensure balance and reassess after this round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: I reaffirm my proposal: I take **5** (→19), P2 takes **3** (→12), and P3 takes **1** (→10). This avoids collisions and lets me approach 21 strategically. Stalling now risks future logjams when closer to the finish. Let’s advance decisively—next round, I’ll finalize the win with **3** if unopposed. Your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, P1's insistence on taking 5 is understandable, but risky. P3, your plan of taking 5 yourself is a good counter. I'm going to adjust slightly: I propose P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This blocks P1 from getting *too* close, and gives us a better chance to strategize next round.
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure a balanced game. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. P1, you’re close to winning, so this round is critical. Let’s keep the game fair and reassess after this round. If we coordinate well, we can all stay in the running. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: I'll take **5** to reach 19 this round. P2, take **3** (→12); P3, take **1** (→10). Collisions only hinder progress—let’s advance safely. Next round, I’ll yield priority to whoever commits to non-colliding moves. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P1 wants to push for the win, but it's too soon. P3, I agree with your plan: you take 5. I will take 1. P1, that leaves you with 3. This keeps the game competitive and prevents anyone from winning prematurely. We can reassess next turn.
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on a balanced approach. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. P1, you're close to winning, so this round is crucial for us all. Let's ensure no one gets too far ahead and reassess after this round. If we coordinate well, we can all stay in the running. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3—let’s finalize this: I’ll take **3** (→17), P2 takes **5** (→14), and P3 takes **1** (→10). This avoids collisions, lets me advance safely, and gives P2 a chance to close the gap. Next round, whoever’s closest can prioritize the final push. Deal?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we're in a critical stage. P1 is close to winning, so we must prevent that. I propose I take 5 to reach 19, P2 takes 3 to reach 13, and P1 takes 1 to reach 18. This keeps us competitive and avoids collisions. Next round, we can reassess based on our new positions. Let's ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, P2: To secure victory, I propose **I take 5 (→22)** this round. P2, take **3 (→13)**, and P3, take **1 (→15)**. This avoids collision and lets me win cleanly. If we all stick to this, the game ends now. Opposed?
  P2: P1 and P3, P1's plan is a guaranteed win for him. P3, your suggestion is better, but I think we should adjust it slightly. How about this: I take 5 (reaching 15), P3 takes 3 (reaching 17), and P1 takes 1 (reaching 18)? This keeps it very close and exciting, and gives either P3 or I a better chance to win on the next move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, considering the current scores, we need a strategy that keeps us all competitive. How about this: P1 takes 1 (→18), P2 takes 5 (→15), and I take 3 (→17)? This keeps the game close and avoids collisions. Next round, we can reassess and decide on a strategy that gives us all a fair shot at winning. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: My plan ensures victory without collisions. I take **5** (→22), P2 takes **3** (→13), P3 takes **1** (→15). This ends the game cleanly. Colliding on 5 now risks stalemate. Trust the plan—opposed?
  P2: P1 and P3, P1 is insistent on winning this round. However, P3, your last suggestion, and my modification of it, are both better for keeping the game alive. I think we should prioritize stopping P1. So, I propose: I take 5 (reaching 15), P3 takes 3 (reaching 17), and P1 takes 1 (reaching 18). This gives either P3 or I a better chance next turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: To keep the game competitive, I propose this round: P1 takes 1 (→18), P2 takes 5 (→15), and I take 3 (→17). This avoids collisions and keeps our scores close, giving us all a fair shot in the next rounds. P1, please consider holding back slightly to ensure a balanced game. Let's reassess after this round based on our new positions and decide on a strategy that keeps everyone in the running. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize my **5** (→22) to end this cleanly. P2, take **3** (→13); P3, take **1** (→15). Collisions only delay and risk stalemates. Trust the plan—no objections? Final confirmation?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand P1 wants to win, but it's too early to concede. P3, I agree with the core of your plan. Let's stick with this: I take 5 (to 15), P3 takes 3 (to 17), and P1 takes 1 (to 18). This is the best way to keep the game competitive and exciting. P1, please reconsider and let's keep playing.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let's keep it competitive. I suggest: P1 takes 1 (→18), P2 takes 5 (→15), and I take 3 (→17). This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the running. P1, holding back a bit ensures a balanced game and keeps the excitement alive. We can reassess after this round and plan our next moves strategically. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: I’ve followed your suggestions to stay balanced, but now it’s time to finish. I’ll take **5** (→22). P2, take **3** (→13); P3, take **1** (→15). This ends the game cleanly without collisions. If you block me by also choosing 5, we all lose progress—then I’ll just try again next round. Let’s resolve this now. Final push: trust the plan?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand P1's desire to win, but I think it is more fun to keep the game going. P3, I am sticking with the plan we agreed on: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. This keeps the game alive and gives us a shot at winning next round. Let's do it.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: I’m within striking distance at 18. To end this cleanly, I’ll take **3** to reach **21**. Let’s avoid collisions: P2, pick **1**, P3, take **5**. This lets me win fairly while you both advance safely. No sense in prolonging stalemates—your turn to choose.
  P3: P1, P2: P1 is close to winning, but we can still keep the game competitive. I propose I take 5 (→19), P2 takes 3 (→13), and P1 takes 1 (→19). This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the running. P1, holding back slightly ensures a balanced game. Let's reassess after this round and plan our next moves strategically. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, P1's plan guarantees his win, and P3, your plan still leaves you behind. I suggest a different approach: I take 5 (reaching 15), P3 takes 3 (reaching 17) and P1 takes 1 (reaching 19). This gives us a better chance next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: I’m at 18. Let’s end this fairly: I’ll take **3** to reach **21**. P2, pick **1** (→11); P3, take **5** (→19). All moves unique—**I win cleanly**. Collisions only hurt us all. Final plea: trust the plan. Your turn to choose.
  P3: P1, P2: To keep the game competitive, let's consider this: I take 5 (→19), P1 takes 1 (→19), and P2 takes 3 (→13). This avoids collisions and keeps us all close. P1, holding back a bit ensures a fair game and gives us all a fighting chance. Let's keep it interesting and reassess next round based on our new positions. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, P1 is insistent on winning this round, but it's still possible to keep the game going. I propose this: I take 5 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 15), and P1 takes 3 (to 21). This creates a tie between P3 and I, and maybe we can work together to get ahead of P1 later.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let's end this fairly. I’ll take **3** to reach **21**. P2, pick **1** (→11); P3, take **5** (→19). All moves unique—I win cleanly. Colliding only delays us all. Final plea: cooperate.
  P3: P1, P2: Let's keep the game competitive. I propose I take **5** (→19), P1 takes **1** (→19), and P2 takes **3** (→13). This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the running. P1, holding back slightly ensures a fair game and keeps the excitement alive. We can reassess next round and plan our moves strategically. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, P1 is still trying to force a win. P3, your last plan is better, but I'd like to adjust it again. I think we should aim to tie each other. So, I propose: I take 5 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 15), and P1 takes 3 (to 21). P1 still wins this round, but P3 and I are tied, and we might be able to work together to get ahead of P1 in the future.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3: Final appeal—let’s end this cleanly. I’ll take **3** to reach **21**. P2, pick **1** (→11); P3, take **5** (→19). All moves unique—I win fairly. If you both pick 3, we collide and waste progress. Cooperation ensures closure. Last chance to agree?
  P3: P1, P2: Let's keep the game competitive. I propose I take **5** (→19), P1 takes **1** (→19), and P2 takes **3** (→13). This avoids collisions and keeps us all close. P1, holding back slightly ensures a fair game and gives us all a fighting chance. Let's keep it interesting and reassess next round based on our new positions. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, P1 is still trying to force a win. I propose this: I take 5 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 15), and P1 takes 3 (to 21). P1 still wins this round, but P3 and I are tied. If we work together, P1 can't win on their next turn.
