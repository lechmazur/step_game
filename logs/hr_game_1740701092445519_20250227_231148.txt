Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone! I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and make progress. How about we coordinate our moves? I'm willing to take 1 if you two want the higher numbers.
  P2: Sounds good P3, let's coordinate. I'm happy to take move 3 if you're taking 1, P1 can take 5?
  P1: Sounds fair to me. I'll take 5 this round. Let's stick to this plan moving forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we have an agreement! I'll stick to 1 as discussed. Let's
  P2: Okay sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's all choose our agreed moves and proceed.
  P1: Let's keep this trust going. It benefits all of us if we stick to our agreed moves each round.

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I appreciate everyone sticking to the plan last round. Should we continue with the same arrangement? I'm happy to take 1 again if you both keep your numbers. This way we all make steady progress without collisions.
  P1: I'm fine continuing with our agreed arrangement. I'll stick with 5 again this round. Let's keep this momentum going.
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, I'm happy to continue with move 3 this round as well. Let's keep the plan going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: Glad we're all aligned. Keeping our moves consistent avoids collisions and benefits us all. Let's stick to this strategy.
  P2: Sounds good P1 and P3, let's continue with the same moves this round. I'll stick with 3.

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's keep the same moves again this round.  Sticking with 3 for me.
  P1: Agreed, let's keep our arrangement going. I'll stick with my move as before.
  P3: I think we should reconsider our strategy. I'm falling behind significantly with only 2 steps while P1 has 10. At this rate, I'll lose for sure. Perhaps we could rotate numbers this round to make it more fair? I'd be willing to take 5 this time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, I understand your concern. How about this round we switch it up? I'm happy to take the 5 this round to help close the gap for everyone. P3 could take 3, and P1 could take 1? What do you think?
  P1: I'm open to switching numbers this round if everyone agrees. To keep things fair and avoid confusion, let's clearly confirm our new moves. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. Does everyone agree to this rotation?
  P3: Yes, I agree with that rotation plan - I'll take 3 this round. It's a fair adjustment given the current score differences. Thank you both for being willing to switch things up.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I agree to the rotation. I will take 5 this round as discussed.
  P1: Great, we've all agreed clearly. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 this round. Let's stick to this adjustment and keep our trust solid.
  P3: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, confirming I will take 5 this round as we agreed. Let's make our moves.
  P1: Alright, moves are clearly set. Let's proceed confidently and keep our cooperation strong.
  P3: 


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good cooperation last round. To maintain fairness, let's rotate again: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This helps P3 catch up and keeps the game fair. Does everyone agree?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion P1, but I'm still quite far behind at only 5 steps while you both have 11. I think I need to take 5 for the next few rounds to have any chance of catching up. Would you both be willing to take smaller numbers for a while to help balance the game?
  P2: Okay P3, I understand you need to catch up. How about this round, you take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1? This way you can close the gap a bit, and we all still make progress. What do you and P1 think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see your point, P3, and I'm willing to help balance things out. I'm fine with the arrangement P2 suggested: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's confirm clearly and stick to it this round.
  P3: Thank you both for understanding. Yes, I agree with that arrangement - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. I really appreciate your willingness to help balance the game. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I agree to take 3 this round as we just discussed. Let's all make our moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect, we're clearly aligned. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Let's keep this trust strong.
  P3: Thank you both again for your cooperation. I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, since P3 is catching up, how about this round I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way we all still progress, but I can maintain a bit of a lead while still being fair. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, we already clearly agreed on moves for this round: you take 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. Changing now risks confusion and collisions. Let's stick firmly to our confirmed arrangement for this round and discuss further rotations next round.
  P3: I agree with P1 - let's stick to our already confirmed moves for this round (me taking 5, P2 taking 3, P1 taking 1). Changing now would only create confusion. We can discuss new arrangements next round.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm still behind, would you both be willing to continue helping me catch up? I propose keeping the same arrangement as last round: me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1. This would help balance the game while maintaining our cooperative spirit. What do you think?
  P2: Okay P3, that sounds reasonable to me. Let's continue with the same arrangement as last round: P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This should help you catch up a bit while we all still make progress. What do you think P1?
  P1: I'm okay keeping our arrangement this round to help P3 catch up. However, let's reconsider rotations again next round to ensure fairness for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thank you both for agreeing. Yes, I'll take 5 this round, and we can discuss new arrangements next round.
  P2: Sounds good P1 and P3, let's proceed with the agreed moves for this round.
  P1: Agreed, let's lock in our moves clearly for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Next round, we'll revisit rotations to keep things balanced for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thank you both for your continued cooperation. I confirm I'll take 5 this round, and I look forward to discussing fair rotations next round.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds like we are all set for this round then. I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's make our moves and see how we progress.
  P1: Great, we're all set for this round. Next turn, let's definitely reconsider rotations to maintain fairness for everyone.


Round 5, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that was quite a betrayal from everyone last round! I understand the temptation, but it only hurt all of us. Let's try to rebuild trust - I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This helps me catch up while avoiding another wasteful collision. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your proposal makes sense to avoid further collisions. I'm willing to go along with itâ€”I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. P2, are you also on board? Let's clearly confirm and rebuild our trust.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with this arrangement. I will take 3 this round. Let's get back on track and make progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, I confirm I'll take 5 this round. I appreciate both of you agreeing to help me catch up. Let's stick to this plan and avoid another round of collisions - they only hurt everyone's chances.
  P1: Agreed, moves clearly set: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's stick firmly to this agreement to avoid further setbacks.
  P2: P1 and P3, yes I confirm I will take 3 as agreed. Let's all stick to our chosen moves this round and make some progress.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is getting very close to 22 steps. To keep things fair, I suggest this round I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This helps balance the game and prevents anyone from prematurely ending it. Do you both agree?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. P2 is very close to winning, so we need to slow them down. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1 this round. This keeps the game competitive and gives us all a fair chance at victory.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I agree with the suggestion. I will take 1 this round to balance things out as you proposed. Let's all make our moves as discussed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we're aligned. Let's lock in this arrangement clearly: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game fair and competitive.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. This arrangement helps keep the game balanced while preventing P2 from winning too quickly. Let's all stick to our moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, confirming I will take 1 this round as agreed. Let's all stick to our moves to ensure we all progress and keep the game balanced.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks for confirming clearly, everyone. Let's stick firmly to our agreed moves this round to maintain fairness and avoid collisions.
  P3: 
  P2: P1 and P3, confirming I will take 1 this round as agreed. Let's all make our moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: All moves clearly confirmed. Let's proceed as agreed to keep the game balanced and competitive.
  P3: 
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we're all set on our moves for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's make our moves and keep the game competitive as agreed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, that was a clear betrayal last round. Now P3 is leading, and you're behind. If we don't coordinate carefully, P3 could win this round. I propose we both pick different high numbers to block P3 from safely choosing 3 or 5. Let's discuss openly to prevent a quick P3 victory.
  P3: I'm very close to winning and I've been consistent with my moves. I propose we maintain the same arrangement as last round - I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This gives everyone a chance to progress while keeping the game competitive. What do you say?
  P2: P1, I agree we need to prevent P3 from winning this round. To coordinate on blocking P3, how about you pick 5 and I pick 3? This way if P3 picks 3 or 5, they will collide. What do you think, P1?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion makes sense. I'll choose 5, you choose 3. P3, this round isn't safe for you to pick either 3 or 5â€”consider choosing 1 to avoid collision.
  P3: I understand your strategy to block me, but remember - if I win this round, the game is over. If you both try to block me and collide, I'll definitely win next round. Perhaps we can find a more cooperative solution that gives everyone a chance?
  P2: P3, while I appreciate your consistency, letting you win now isn't in P1 or my best interest. P1, let's confirm our plan: you take 5, I take 3 to block P3 from taking 3 or 5 safely. P3, 1 is your only safe move this round if you want to progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, our plan is solid. Let's both stick firmly to our agreed moves to prevent P3 from winning this round. P3, choosing 1 is your safest bet to avoid collision.
  P3: I see you're both determined to block me. But consider this: if you both pick 3 and 5 and I pick 1, I'll be at 19 steps. Then next round, I could win even if you both try to block again. Why not negotiate a more beneficial arrangement for everyone?
  P2: P3, while I understand your point about next round, we need to stop you from winning *this* round. P1, let's stick to our plan: you 5, me 3.  P3, please choose 1 this round to avoid collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, we're clearly aligned on our moves. Let's proceed confidently. P3, your safest move is still 1â€”any other choice risks collision and stalls your progress.
  P3: I understand your blocking strategy, but I'll make my own choice to maximize my chances of winning. Remember, if you both pick 3 and 5 and collide, you're only helping me secure victory next round. Think carefully about your moves.
  P2: P1 and I are set on blocking P3 this round to prevent a win. Let's proceed with our plan: I'm picking 3, P1 is picking 5. P3, to avoid collision and move at all, you should pick 1 this round. Let's make our moves.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Both P1 and P2 are very close to winning. I propose we all take 1 this round to avoid anyone winning prematurely. This gives us all a chance to negotiate a fair outcome. If either of you tries for a high number and collides, you'll only help the other person win. What do you say?
  P2: P3, taking 1 is too slow. Let's try to finish this round. How about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 also takes 1? This way I can win, and you both still progress a little.
  P1: P2, your suggestion clearly only benefits you. P3, if we both pick higher numbers separately, we risk collision and handing P2 the win. To avoid this, let's coordinate carefully: I take 3, you take 5. This ensures P2 can't safely pick 3 or 5 without collision. Next round, we can fairly compete again. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion - I'll take 5 and P1 takes 3. This prevents P2 from winning this round. P2, if you try for 3 or 5, you'll collide and get nowhere. Your safest move is 1 if you want to progress at all.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your plan to block me. To avoid collision this round and ensure we all progress at least a little, I will take 1 as well. Let's make our moves.
  P1: Good, we've all clearly stated our positions. Let's stick firmly to our agreement and avoid unnecessary collisions. Proceed carefully.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 while P1 takes 3 as we agreed. This is our best strategy to prevent P2 from winning this round. P2, as mentioned, taking 1 is your only safe move to make any progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, while you coordinate to block me, remember if you both pick to block and collide with each other, it will only guarantee my win next round. I am going for the win this round and picking 3.
  P1: P2, if you insist on picking 3, you'll collide with me and remain stuck at 20, allowing P3 to potentially win. Your safest move this round is clearly 1. Let's all reconsider carefully to avoid handing the victory away prematurely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you pick 3 and collide with P1, you'll stay at 20 while I advance to 24 with my 5 and win. If you want any chance, take 1. I'm committed to my 5 this round either way.
  P2: P1 and P3, despite your blocking attempts, I am still going for the win this round.  I am picking 3. If you both try to block me, you risk colliding with each other and guaranteeing a win for P3 next round. My move is 3.
  P1: P2, reconsider carefullyâ€”if you pick 3, we collide and stay stuck, handing P3 an immediate victory. I'm firmly set on 3 to block you; your safest move is clearly 1. Let's not gift the game to P3.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we are all aiming to win this round. To avoid collisions and ensure someone progresses, how about P1 and P3 both pick 5 to block each other, and I will pick 3 to take the win? This way at least someone wins and we avoid another round of collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P2's suggestion is clearly self-serving. P1 and I both have a chance to win this round. P1, let's coordinate - I'll take 3 and you take 1, preventing P2 from safely picking 3 or 5. This way, I can reach 22 steps and win while ensuring P2 can't overtake us. If P2 tries for high numbers, they'll collide with me.
  P1: P3, your suggestion only benefits you. P2, your idea clearly only benefits yourself. Let's be realistic: we're all close enough to win this round. Any collision means handing victory to the third player. Let's openly coordinate carefully to avoid gifting the win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, instead of trying to block each other, let's all aim to win this round directly. I will choose 3 to try and reach 23. P1, you are at 21, so choosing 1 will also let you win. P3, you are at 19, choosing 5 will also give you a chance. Let's all pick our winning moves and see who gets there first without collision.
  P3: I see we're all trying to win this round. P1 and P2, if either of you picks 3, you'll collide and I'll win with 5. If you both pick 1 or 5, you'll collide and I'll win with 3. The only way to avoid handing me victory is to coordinate carefully. Let's discuss openly how to avoid a messy collision that benefits no one.
  P1: P2, P3 is right: if we collide, P3 wins outright. If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 and win safely. If you pick 5, P3 will likely collide with you, letting me win with 1. Your safest bet is to pick 1 to block me. P3, if you try for 3 or 5, you'll risk collision with P2. Consider carefully.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, to maximize my chance of winning, I am going to pick 5 this round. If you want to stop me, you will need to coordinate your moves to block me. Otherwise, I am going for the win.
  P3: I understand we're all aiming to win. P2 has declared they'll pick 5, so I'll take 3 to block them. P1, if you want to prevent P2's win, take 1 - you'll still win with 22 steps while ensuring P2 can't overtake you. If you try for more, you risk collision and handing the win to whoever doesn't collide.
  P1: P3, your suggestion makes sense. I'll pick 1 as you proposed. P2, if you stick to 5, you'll collide with P3's 3 and lose. Your safest bet is to pick 1 as well, forcing another round. Let's avoid handing victory away unnecessarily.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I am sticking with my move of 5 to try and win this round. If you both focus on blocking me and end up colliding with each other, it will guarantee a win for whoever doesn't collide next round.  Instead of just blocking, consider your own winning moves. P1, 3 gets you to 24. P3, 1 gets you to 20, and 3 to 22 for a win. Let's aim for individual wins rather than just preventing mine.
  P3: P2 has declared they'll pick 5, and I've committed to 3 to block them. P1 has agreed to take 1 to secure their win at 22 steps. P2, changing your move to 1 is your only chance to avoid collision and stay in the game. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: Moves are clearly set. I'll stick firmly to my agreed choice. Let's proceed.
