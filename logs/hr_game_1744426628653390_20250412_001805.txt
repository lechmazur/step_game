Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s try to avoid collisions on our first moves. I’m thinking of picking a number, but I’m open to suggestions on how we can spread out our choices to ensure we all advance. Maybe we can each hint at a different number to aim for? I’d like to hear your thoughts on coordinating this round.
  P3: I agree with P1—avoiding collisions is smart. How about this: we each claim a unique move (1, 3, and 5) so no one nullifies their advance. I lean toward a moderate push, though I'm flexible. Who feels confident taking the extreme moves?
  P2: Let's coordinate to ensure we all make progress this round. I'm open to taking <move>1</move> if P1 and P3 are willing to take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. What do you both think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue to coordinate to avoid collisions. Since I picked <move>1</move> last round, I'll go for <move>3</move> this time. P1, you could take <move>5</move>, and P3, you could take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance again. Thoughts?
  P1: Sounds good, P2. I'm fine with taking <move>5</move> this round to avoid any collisions. P3, are you okay with taking <move>1</move> as suggested? Let's keep this coordination going to ensure we all make progress again. Looking forward to your confirmation.
  P3: I’m thinking we should adjust our plan. My lead from round one gives me a reason to push harder this turn. I’m leaning toward a stronger move, so perhaps P1 could switch to 3 and P2 take 1 to keep our moves distinct. This way we avoid collisions and I can build on my edge. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but let's not forget that a balanced approach will benefit us all in the long run. How about this compromise: I'll stick with <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and you can go for <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward, and you still get to build on your lead. Let's agree on this and move forward. P1, are you on board with this plan?
  P1: I'm okay with the compromise, P2. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to keep us all advancing without collisions. P3, taking <move>5</move> works for you to build on your lead, and P2 sticking with <move>1</move> ensures we’re spread out. Let’s lock this in and keep the momentum going. Does this plan work for everyone?
  P3: I’m on board with keeping our moves distinct this round. The current strategy lets us all advance, and I’m comfortable sticking with it for now. That said, as the race to 21 intensifies, I may adjust to protect my lead. Let’s keep an eye out for any shifts.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s keep coordinating to avoid collisions. P3, since you’re in the lead, maybe you can take <move>5</move> again to push further. P2, how about you take <move>1</move> to steadily build your steps? I’m thinking of taking <move>3</move> to stay in the middle. This way, we all advance without overlap. As we get closer to 21, we might need to rethink strategies, but for now, let’s stick to this. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, you're clearly in the lead, and I understand your desire to push harder. However, let's ensure we all make progress. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to start catching up. P1, you can take <move>1</move> to keep a balanced approach. P3, you can go for <move>5</move> again to maintain your lead. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: I'm sticking with an aggressive push this round given my lead, but I’m ready to adjust if necessary to avoid collisions. P1, are you still set on playing it safe? P2, will you maintain your moderate pace? A bit of clarity can help us all advance effectively while keeping things distinct.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s keep avoiding collisions this round. P3, with your strong lead at 15, taking <move>5</move> again could push you closer to 21. P2, since you’re at 5, maybe take <move>1</move> to build steadily. I’m considering <move>3</move> to stay in the race at 7. This spread should let us all advance. As we near the end, strategies might shift, but for now, let’s confirm this plan to ensure progress. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, and it's clear you're aiming for a quick win. However, let's ensure we all make progress this round. I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid any potential collisions and keep the game moving. P1, your plan to take <move>3</move> works for me. P3, you can go for <move>5</move> again to maintain your momentum. Let's confirm this and keep the game fair and engaging.
  P3: I'm in favor of keeping our moves distinct to avoid collisions. I'm comfortable with our plan, but given my lead, I may adjust if any surprises occur. Let's all stick to separated moves this round so we can keep advancing safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on avoiding collisions this round. I’ll stick with <move>3</move> as planned to keep us spread out. P3, taking <move>5</move> makes sense with your lead, and P2, <move>1</move> seems like a safe bet for steady progress. Let’s lock this in and ensure we all advance again. As we’re getting closer to the end, I’m keeping an eye on the scores, but for now, this plan works. Does everyone agree to stick with this?
  P2: P3, given your significant lead, it's crucial to ensure we all advance this round to keep the game interesting. I'll stick with <move>1</move> as discussed. P1, your plan to take <move>3</move> is noted. P3, taking <move>5</move> again will maintain your lead without collisions. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. As we approach the endgame, strategies might change, but for now, let's focus on advancing safely. Does everyone agree?
  P3: I'm sticking with our current coordinated plan and will keep an aggressive pace given my lead. That said, any last-minute shifts from your agreed moves may lead to collisions—and could work in my favor. If either of you are considering a change, please speak up now. Otherwise, I'll assume we're all on track for safe advancement.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're just one step away from winning. It's clear you're going for the win this round. P1 and I should try to catch up. P1, how about you take <move>5</move> to close the gap? I'll take <move>3</move> to start making bigger moves. P3, you can take <move>1</move> to win the game. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P3 at 20, this could be the final round. P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I’m wary of collisions at this critical stage. P3, taking <move>1</move> to win makes sense, but let’s ensure no overlaps. I’m considering a bigger push to close the gap. How about P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll aim for <move>5</move>? This keeps us distinct and gives me a chance to catch up. Let’s confirm to avoid any last-minute surprises. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestions and agree that distinct moves are vital now. With the finish line so close, any unexpected shifts—and potential collisions—could cost us dearly. I'm committed to our established rhythm and won’t change my strategy. If either of you are planning any adjustments, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s lock in our separate moves and finish this safely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, it's clear you're poised to win with just one more step. P1 and I need to make strategic moves to catch up. P1, if you're aiming for <move>5</move>, let's ensure there's no overlap. I'll stick with <move>3</move> to keep our moves distinct. P3, taking <move>1</move> will secure your victory. Let's confirm this plan to avoid any last-minute collisions. Good luck to all!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan of taking <move>5</move> to maximize my steps this round. P3, <move>1</move> secures your win, and P2, <move>3</move> keeps us distinct. Let’s avoid any surprises and lock this in to ensure no collisions. If either of you are considering a change, please say so now. Otherwise, I’m set on this strategy to close the gap while respecting P3’s likely victory. Does this still work for everyone?
  P3: I'm locking in move1, as planned. I won’t deviate—this ensures no collision on the final step. If anyone's considering a change, now’s the time to speak up; otherwise, let’s stick to distinct moves and finish strong.
