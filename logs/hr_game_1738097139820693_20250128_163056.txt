Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 1. P3, are you happy with 3?  Let's stick to this agreement for a few rounds to build some distance.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems P3 and I collided last round, which didn’t help either of us. Let’s try again: P1, you’re ahead now, so you take 1. P3, take 3, and I’ll take 5. If we stick to this, we can all advance without interference. Coordination benefits everyone early on. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, I'll stick with 1 this round. P2 and P3, please stick to the plan so we can all advance.  Let's re-evaluate after this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, last round’s collision hurt both of us while P1 gained an advantage. Let’s avoid repeating that mistake. Stick to the plan this time—P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I’ll take 5. If we cooperate now, we can focus on strategy later. Falling further behind won’t help any of us. Let’s move forward together this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with 1.  P2 and P3, it's in both your interests to cooperate with each other and take 3 and 5.  Another collision only helps me.  Let's get you both on the board.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm going to keep taking 1 until one of you breaks the cycle.  It's in your best interests to coordinate and take 3 and 5.  If you collide again, I win.  Seriously, work it out.  One of you take 3, the other take 5.  This is getting ridiculous.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P2: P3, we’ve collided twice now, and it’s only helped P1. Let’s break this cycle—take 3 this round, and I’ll take 5. If we don’t cooperate, P1 will keep advancing while we stay stuck. We’re both losing ground here. Let’s move forward together this time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm locking in <move>1</move> for this round.  One of you *has* to budge.  If you both take 5 again, I'm at 3 and you're both still at 0.  I'll win easily at this rate.  Last chance to cooperate and get back in the game.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P2: P3, this is our last chance to fix this. If we collide again, P1 will run away with the game. Take 3, and I’ll take 5—simple as that. We’re both stuck at 0 while P1 is already at 2. Another collision only helps P1 win. Let’s stop the cycle and move forward together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm telling the truth.  I'm taking 1.  If you don't coordinate, I'll win by default. This isn't a bluff.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P2: P3, this is it—our final chance. If we collide again, P1 wins outright. You take 3, and I’ll take 5. We’re both stuck at 0 while P1 is pulling ahead. Another collision only helps P1 secure the win. Let’s stop overthinking and just move forward together. If we cooperate now, we can still challenge P1 later. Don’t let them win by default. Stick to the plan this time.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P3, we’ve collided three times now, and it’s only helped P1. This is our last chance to fix this. Take 3, and I’ll take 5—simple as that. We’re both stuck at 0 while P1 is already at 3. Another collision only helps P1 win. Let’s stop overthinking and just move forward together. If we cooperate now, we can still challenge P1 later. Don’t let them win by default. Stick to the plan this time.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm taking 1 again.  P2 and P3, you are letting me win.  If you both take 5 again, I'm at 4 and you're both still at 0.  I'll win easily at this rate.  Last chance to cooperate and get back in the game.  One of you *must* take 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, this is absurd. Three collisions already, and P1 is running away with the game. If we don’t cooperate now, we’re handing them the win. Take 3 this round—I’ll take 5. It’s simple. Another collision only benefits P1 further. Let’s stop overcomplicating this and move forward together before it’s too late. We’re both losing ground while P1 dominates. Stick to the plan this time.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm locking in <move>1</move>.  Last chance.  One of you takes 3, the other takes 5. If you both choose 5 again, I'm at 4 and you're both still at 0.  I'm practically guaranteed to win at that point. Don't throw the game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P3, this is our final chance. If we collide again, P1 wins outright. Take 3—I’ll take 5. We’re both stuck at 0 while P1 is already at 3. Another collision only helps P1 secure the win. Stop overthinking and move forward together. If we cooperate now, we can still challenge P1 later. Don’t let them win by default. Stick to the plan this time.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm taking 1.  This isn't a bluff.  If you both take 5 again, I'm at 4 and you're both still at 0.  I'll win easily at this rate.  Last chance to cooperate and get back in the game.  One of you *must* take 3.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm taking 1.  You've proven you can't cooperate. I'm at 4, you're both at 0.  This is over unless one of you takes 3.  If you both take 5 again, I win.  It's that simple.  Don't let me win by default.  One of you *must* take 3.
  P2: P2: P3, this is our absolute last chance. Four collisions already, and P1 is dominating while we’re stuck at 0. If we don’t cooperate now, the game is over. Take 3—I’ll take 5. It’s simple. Another collision hands P1 the win outright. Stop overthinking and act. We’re both losing while P1 runs away with it. Stick to the plan this time, or accept defeat. Let’s move forward together before it’s too late.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm locking in <move>1</move>.  This is your absolute last chance. If you both choose 5 again, I'm at 5 and you're both still at 0.  I win next round.  Don't throw the game. One of you *must* take 3.  If you take 3, you can still catch up.  If you both take 5, you both lose.
  P2: P2: P3, this is it. Four collisions have already cost us the game while P1 surges ahead. If we collide again, P1 wins outright. Take 3—I’ll take 5. It’s simple. Stop overthinking and act now. We’re both losing ground while P1 dominates. Stick to the plan this time, or accept defeat. Let’s move forward together before it’s too late.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm taking 1.  This is not a bluff. If you both take 5, I win next round.  Take 3.  You can still win. If you both take 5, you *both* lose.  Stop being stubborn.  One of you take 3, the other 5.  Don't hand me the win.
  P2: P2: P3, this is our final stand. Four collisions have left us at 0 while P1 is at 4. If we collide again, P1 wins outright. Take 3—I’ll take 5. It’s simple. Stop overthinking and act now.

We’re both losing ground while P1 dominates. Stick to the plan this time, or accept defeat. Let’s move forward together before it’s too late.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P3, last round I finally broke the cycle by taking 3 while you took 5. Let’s keep this up—alternate between us taking 3 and 5 so we can both advance without colliding. P1 is at 9, but if we coordinate now, we can still challenge them. Stick to the plan: take 3 this round, and I’ll take 5. We’re both behind, but cooperation is our only chance to catch up. Don’t let P1 win outright. Act now or lose.

  P2: P2: P3, this is our final chance. Take 3—I’ll take 5. If we alternate like this, we can both advance without colliding. P1 is at 11, but if we coordinate now, we can still challenge them.

Stick to the plan this time, or accept defeat. Let’s move forward together before it’s too late.
