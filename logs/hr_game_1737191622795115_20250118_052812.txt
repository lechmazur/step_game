Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's all agree to avoid collisions early on. If we each pick different moves, we can all advance without setbacks. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this turn. Thoughts?"
  P2: P3, I'm okay with taking 3 this turn. P1, if you're good with 1, let's see how it goes.
  P1: I appreciate the proposed coordination from P3 and P2, but I want to be cautious. While their suggestion seems cooperative, I'll keep my options open.

"I'm considering the proposed strategy, but I want to ensure we all benefit. Can we discuss how we'll handle future rounds if this goes well?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "P1, I understand your caution, but avoiding collisions early on benefits us all. If we stick to the plan this turn, we can build trust and avoid setbacks. Let's agree to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round, and we can reassess next turn. Sound fair?"
  P2: P1, I agree with P3's plan for this round. Let's try P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 and see how it works out. We can adjust our strategy in the next round based on the results.
  P1: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I want more clarity on our long-term strategy. While avoiding collisions sounds good, I'm not fully convinced we'll maintain this trust. I'll need more assurance about how we'll handle future rounds if I agree to move 1 this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "P1, I understand your concerns about trust and long-term strategy. Let's focus on this round first—if we all stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, we can avoid collisions and build momentum. We can discuss future rounds after seeing how this plays out. Trust starts with small steps. Let's make this work for all of us.
  P2: P1, I understand your need for assurance. Let's commit to this round's plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. If it works, we can discuss and adjust our strategy for future rounds to ensure fairness and progress for all. Agreed?
  P1: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm still hesitant. While avoiding collisions sounds beneficial, I need more concrete assurances about our future interactions. What specific mechanisms can we establish to ensure continued fair play beyond this single round? I'm open to discussion, but want clarity on our long-term strategy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "P1, I hear your concerns about long-term strategy. Let's focus on this round first—if we all stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, we can avoid collisions and build trust. After this round, we can discuss specific mechanisms for future rounds to ensure fairness. Let's take this small step together and see how it goes. Agreed?"
  P2: P1, I understand your need for long-term clarity. Let's agree to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round to build trust. We can then discuss specific mechanisms for future rounds to ensure fairness. Agreed?
  P1: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm still cautious. While avoiding collisions sounds good, I want to understand how we'll handle potential conflicts in future rounds. Can we establish a clear, mutually beneficial framework for our interactions beyond this single turn?


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: "P1, P2, let's finalize this round's plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This avoids collisions and builds trust. After this round, we can discuss a clear framework for future turns. Let's take this step together and reassess next turn. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I understand your need for a long-term strategy. Let's agree to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round to build trust. After this, we can discuss and establish a clear framework for future rounds. Agreed?
  P1: I recognize the repeated attempts to coordinate, but I'm still uncertain about the long-term implications. While the proposed plan seems straightforward for this round, I want to ensure we have a sustainable approach.

"I propose we establish a principle of rotating priority in future rounds. If we all advance this turn without collision, next turn we could shift who takes the smallest/largest moves. This would create a fair rotation mechanism. What are your thoughts on this potential framework?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: "P1, P2, let's finalize this round's plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This avoids collisions and builds trust. After this round, we can discuss P1's rotation proposal for future turns. Let's take this step together and reassess next turn. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I support your rotation proposal for future rounds. Let's agree to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round to build trust and then discuss the rotation mechanism. Agreed?
  P1: "I appreciate the proposed coordination and my rotation suggestion. I'm willing to proceed with the agreed plan of me taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 this round. Let's see if we can build mutual trust and establish a fair mechanism for future turns."

  P2: P1, P3, I'm on board with the rotation proposal for this round. Let's go with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to keep the momentum going and maintain fairness. Agreed?
  P1: "I appreciate the proposed rotation strategy. However, I want to ensure we're not creating a predictable pattern that could be exploited. While the suggested moves seem fair, I'd like to discuss how we can maintain flexibility and prevent becoming too rigid in our approach."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "P1, P2, I understand your concerns about predictability. Let's stick to the rotation plan this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. After this, we can discuss adding flexibility to our strategy for future rounds. Agreed?"

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Our previous strategy of rotation and variation seems to be working well. However, I noticed our steps aren't perfectly balanced. I propose we discuss a move strategy that helps equalize our progress while maintaining our cooperative approach. P2 is currently ahead, so we might want to consider that in our next moves."
  P3: "P1, P2, let's continue our cooperative approach while addressing the imbalance. I propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round to help equalize progress and avoid collisions. This keeps us advancing strategically. Thoughts?"
