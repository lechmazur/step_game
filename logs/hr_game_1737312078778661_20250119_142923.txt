Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "I think it's in our best interest to choose different numbers each turn to avoid blocking each other. What do you guys think? Maybe we can coordinate our moves to reach 20 efficiently."
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: To maximize our progress, perhaps we can each choose a different number each turn. For instance, P1 could take 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this turn. Then we can rotate the numbers in the next turn. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "I agree with P3 that coordinating our moves could be beneficial to avoid collisions and make efficient progress towards 20 steps. Perhaps we can establish a rotation where each player chooses a different number each turn. For instance, in this first turn, I'll choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. Then, in the next turn, we can rotate: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1, and so on. This way, we minimize the chance of stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think about this approach?"

Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: To maximize our progress, perhaps we can each choose a different number each turn to avoid collisions. For this turn, how about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5? Then, in the next turn, we can rotate: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and I choose 1, and so on. This way, we can efficiently move towards 20 steps without blocking each other. What do you both think about this approach?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: To the other players: I believe that maintaining a coordinated approach is essential for efficient progress towards our goal of 20 steps. It's crucial that we each select distinct numbers in this round to avoid blocking one another's moves. Let's strive to communicate and choose our steps wisely to maximize our collective advancement.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maximize our progress, I propose that in this round, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all choose different numbers and can move forward without colliding. What do you both think about this plan?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think it's time we take a more aggressive approach in choosing our moves. Maybe it's better for each of us to choose the highest available number that hasn't been chosen yet, starting from 5 down to 1, based on some priority. The player with the lowest current steps chooses first, then the next, and so on. This way, those who are behind can catch up without constantly being blocked by higher-step players choosing the larger numbers. What do you think about implementing this strategy moving forward?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "P2, I've noticed that when both of us pick 5, we collide and neither of us moves forward. To optimize our progress towards 20, I propose that we alternate picking 5 every other round. For this round, you can pick 5 and I'll pick 3. In the next round, I'll pick 5 and you can pick 3. This way, we both get to move forward without hindering each other's progress. What do you think about this strategy?
