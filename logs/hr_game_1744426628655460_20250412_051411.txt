Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions and play smart. I suggest we each pick different numbers to ensure at least some of us advance. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's strategy. Let's avoid collisions by choosing distinct numbers. I'll take <move>3</move> this round so we all advance. Let’s coordinate to progress steadily without wasting turns.
  P1: I'm on board with avoiding collisions. Let's each pick a different number this round to maximize our chances of advancing. I’m fine with any number, so P2 and P3, if you have preferences, let me know, and I’ll take the remaining one. Coordination is key to prevent wasting turns.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P2 indicated they'll take 3, I'll go with 5 this round. P1, that leaves 1 for you if you're willing. This way we can all advance efficiently.
  P2: Alright, let's finalize the plan to ensure smooth progress. I'll stick with 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 handles 1. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Let's proceed with this strategy.
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take 1 this round as suggested. Let's stick to this plan and all advance together. Coordination will help us progress without unnecessary setbacks.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: (We've already established a clear plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. No need for further discussion this round.)
  P2: Alright, let’s finalize this to keep things moving. I’ll stick with **3**, P1 takes **1**, and P3 handles **5** as agreed. No changes needed here—let’s execute the plan and advance.
  P1: I'm glad we have a clear plan for this round. Let's stick to it and ensure we all advance. Looking ahead, we should keep coordinating to avoid collisions in future rounds as well. Maybe next time we can rotate the numbers to keep things fair. What do you both think about that idea for the next turn?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we all advanced last round. Let's keep the momentum going by coordinating again. Since P3 is in the lead, maybe we can rotate numbers this time for fairness. I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all progress without collisions. If anyone has a different preference, I'm open to adjusting. What do you both think? Let's aim to avoid wasting turns and keep advancing together.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion for rotation, but being in the lead, I prefer to maintain my advantage. I'll be choosing a number that maximizes my chances of winning. I suggest you both coordinate between yourselves to avoid collision with each other.
  P2: P3, while you prioritize your lead, P1 and I can still coordinate to avoid collision. Let’s keep the rotation idea for mutual progress. I’ll take **1**, P1 takes **3**, leaving **5** open for you. This way, we all advance without wasted moves. P1, does this adjustment work for you? We can’t let one collision jeopardize everyone’s progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the input, P2. I'm fine with taking 3 as you suggested, leaving 1 for you and 5 for P3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P3, since you're focused on maintaining your lead, taking 5 should work well for you. Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess next round if needed. Coordination has worked so far, and I’d like to avoid any setbacks. Does this sound good to everyone?
  P3: I appreciate your coordination efforts, but I'll be making my own choice this round. Since I'm ahead, I need to play strategically to maintain my lead. Good luck coordinating between yourselves.
  P2: P1, let’s confirm our plan: I’ll take **1**, you take **3** to avoid collision. P3, we respect your independence but urge you to pick **5** if possible—this way all advance. If you choose differently, at least P1 and I won’t clash. Let’s proceed efficiently!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, while you aim to lead, collisions hurt everyone. Let’s coordinate again: I’ll take **5** to challenge your lead, P1 takes **1**, and you can pick **3**. This way, we all advance. P1, agree? If P3 insists on 5, I’ll shift to 1—just avoid clashing with you. Mutual progress is key to reaching 22 faster.
  P3: I understand P2's desire for coordination, but as the leader, I need to make strategic choices. I won't commit to any specific number, as that would limit my options. You two can coordinate between yourselves to avoid collision, but I'll be playing to win.
  P1: P2, I agree that coordination is crucial to avoid setbacks. I'm fine with taking 1 as you suggested, leaving 5 for you and 3 for P3. P3, while you’re focused on maintaining your lead, picking 3 could ensure we all advance this round. If you choose differently, P2 and I will stick to our plan to avoid clashing. Let’s keep progress steady and reassess next turn. Does this work for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let's finalize: I'll take **3**, you take **1**. This ensures we both advance even if P3 takes **5** (likely given their lead). P3, your choice is yours, but this plan avoids clashes between us. Progress is key—let’s proceed!
  P3: I understand you both want to coordinate, but I need to play strategically to maintain my lead. I won't reveal my move, but I suggest you two stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.
  P1: P2, I’m sticking with 1 as we discussed, ensuring we don’t collide. P3, since you’re playing strategically, we hope you’ll avoid 1 and 3 to prevent a clash. If you take 5, we can all advance this round. Let’s keep the game moving forward without unnecessary setbacks. I’m open to adjusting in future rounds if needed, but for now, this plan seems safest for P2 and me. Does this still work for you, P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, taking **5** this round lets you stay ahead while we both advance safely. P1 and I will stick to **1** and **3** to avoid collisions. If you choose otherwise, you risk clashing with us or stalling your progress. Lead wisely—5 is your optimal move. P1, confirm you’ll hold 1 so I can finalize **3**. Let’s prioritize progress over stubbornness.
  P3: I appreciate your suggestions, but I'll continue making independent choices to maintain my lead. You two seem to have a good coordination plan between yourselves - stick to that to avoid colliding with each other.
  P1: P2, I’m confirming I’ll stick with 1 as planned to ensure we don’t collide. P3, since you’re playing independently, I urge you to consider 5 to avoid a clash with either of us and maintain your lead. If we all advance, we stay competitive without setbacks. Let’s keep the game progressing smoothly this round. I’m ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I’m taking **5** to challenge your lead. P1 holds **1** as agreed. If you take **3**, we all advance. Collisions only delay victory—choose wisely. P1, confirm you’re locked on **1**? Let’s progress decisively.
  P3: I see P2 has changed their move to 5. Since you both seem coordinated with P1 taking 1, I'll make my own strategic choice. Good luck with your moves - may the best player win.
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 1 as agreed to avoid any collision between us. P3, with P2 now on 5, choosing 3 would ensure we all advance this round. Sticking to distinct numbers keeps the game competitive without setbacks. I understand your focus on maintaining the lead, but a collision benefits no one. Let’s make this round count for everyone. I’m ready to proceed with this plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’ve seen collisions stall progress, especially with P3’s lead at 5. Let’s coordinate this round to ensure we all advance. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us moving forward without clashes. P3, as the leader, 5 maximizes your progress. P2, does 3 work for you? I’m open to switching if needed, but let’s avoid another wasted turn. Coordination has worked before—let’s make it count now. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand you want to coordinate, but being in the lead, I need to play strategically. I won't commit to any number, as that would limit my options. You two can coordinate between yourselves to avoid collision, but I'll choose what's best for my position.
  P2: P3, while your lead matters, collisions stall *everyone*. Let’s finalize P1’s proposal: **I’ll take 3**, P1 takes 1, and you take 5. This ensures we all advance without clashes. Your 5 keeps your lead while letting P1 and me progress. If you insist on another number, at least signal your choice so P1 and I can adjust. Stubbornness risks another wasted turn—collaboration benefits all, even if temporary. P1, confirm you’ll hold 1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I confirm I’ll hold 1 as planned to avoid any clash between us. P3, since you’re focused on maintaining your lead, taking 5 would maximize your progress while letting P2 and me advance with 3 and 1. A collision helps no one, especially with your current advantage. Let’s make this round count by all moving forward. If you’re leaning toward a different number, please hint at it so we can adjust if needed. I’m ready to proceed with this plan to keep the game competitive. Does this still work for everyone?
  P3: I understand the desire to coordinate, but as the leader with 5 steps, I need to maintain my advantage. I won't reveal my intended move, but I suggest you two stick to your plan of P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3 to avoid colliding with each other.
  P2: P3, collisions only benefit others. Stick to **5** to extend your lead while P1 takes **1** and I’ll hold **3**. This ensures all advance. Your 5 keeps you ahead, and we avoid wasted turns. P1, confirm you’ll stay on 1? Let’s finalize this—stubbornness risks another stalemate.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m sticking with 1 as confirmed to ensure no clash between us. P3, with your lead at 5, choosing 5 this round maximizes your progress while letting P2 take 3 and me take 1. A collision stalls everyone, including you. If you’re considering a different number, a hint would help us adjust to avoid setbacks. Let’s make this round productive for all and keep the game competitive. I’m set on this plan unless adjustments are needed. Does this still align with everyone’s goals?
  P3: I understand you both want to coordinate with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, but as the leader, I'll make my own strategic choice this round. I won't reveal my move, but I suggest you stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.
  P2: P3, taking **5** is your only path to advance while allowing P1 and I to safely progress. P1, confirm you’ll hold **1** so I can finalize **3**. Collisions stall *everyone*—your lead won’t last if you freeze in place. P1 and I respect your strategy but urge you to prioritize advancement over stubbornness. Let’s all move forward this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 1 as agreed to ensure we don’t collide. P3, with your lead at 5, picking 5 this round extends your advantage while letting P2 take 3 and me take 1. A collision stalls us all, undermining even your position. If you’re set on a different number, a subtle hint could prevent a wasted turn. Let’s prioritize progress over risk—advancing together keeps the game competitive. I’m committed to this plan unless a last-second adjustment is needed.
  P3: I see you both are committed to P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. While I appreciate your coordination efforts, I'll continue making my own strategic choices to maintain my lead. Good luck with your moves - I'll play what I think gives me the best chance to win.
  P2: P3, your lead is fragile—colliding stalls your progress. If you take **5**, we’ll split 1/3 safely. If not, I’ll claim **5** to block your path. P1, hold **1**—this forces P3 to choose: advance or let us seize momentum. Your move, P3—stubbornness risks your lead.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our collision last round, I understand P2 is trying to challenge my lead. Since I'm still ahead at 5 steps, I'll continue playing strategically without revealing my moves. You two can coordinate to avoid colliding with each other, but I need to maintain my advantage. May the best player win.
  P2: P3, continuing collisions only stalls your progress. Let’s coordinate to advance: I’ll take **3**, P1 takes **1**, and you can safely advance with **5**. Your lead is strong, but collisions risk letting us catch up. Choose wisely—collaboration ensures your momentum. P1, agree to hold **1**?
  P1: P2, I agree to hold 1 as suggested to ensure we don’t collide. P3, with your lead at 5, taking 5 this round maximizes your progress while letting P2 take 3 and me take 1. Collisions stall everyone, including you. Let’s avoid another wasted turn and keep the game competitive. If you’re considering a different number, a hint could help us adjust. I’m committed to this plan for steady progress. Does this work for everyone?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand you want me to take 5, but being in the lead means I need to play unpredictably. While you two coordinate between P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, I'll make my own strategic choice to maintain my advantage. Good luck with your moves.
  P2: P1, let’s push harder this round. P3’s pattern suggests they’ll alternate between 3 and 5 to avoid prior collisions. Let’s exploit this: **I’ll take 5**, and you take **1**. If P3 switches to **3**, I’ll advance to 9, you to 4, and P3 to 8—putting me ahead. If they stick to 5, we collide, but at least you progress. This pressures P3’s lead without risking mutual stalling. Confirm you’ll hold 1?
  P1: P2, I’m confirming I’ll hold 1 as planned to avoid any clash between us. P3, with your lead at 5, picking 5 maximizes your progress while letting P2 take a different number. A collision stalls us all, undermining your advantage. If you’re leaning elsewhere, a hint could prevent a wasted turn. Let’s prioritize progress—advancing keeps the game competitive. I’m set on 1 unless an adjustment is signaled. Does this align with everyone’s strategy for this round?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice P2 has changed their strategy to take 5 this round. While you both seem coordinated with P1 taking 1, I'll continue making independent choices to protect my lead. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P3, continuing collisions benefits neither of us. Let’s break the cycle: I’ll take **3** to avoid clashing with your likely 5, letting you safely advance to 8. P1 holds **1**, and I’ll secure 7 steps—closer to your lead. If you choose otherwise, at least we minimize wasted turns. Progress over stubbornness. P1, confirm 1? Let’s push forward.
  P1: P2, I’m confirming I’ll stick with 1 to avoid any clash between us. P3, with your lead at 5, choosing 5 this round lets you advance to 8 while P2 takes 3 and I take 1. Collisions stall everyone, risking your advantage. If you’re considering a different number, a subtle hint could prevent another wasted turn. Let’s prioritize progress to keep the game competitive. I’m locked on 1 unless an adjustment is needed. Does this plan still work for everyone?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see P2 has switched back to suggesting 3. While you both seem set with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, I'll continue making my own strategic choices to maintain my lead. Good luck with your moves - let's see how this round plays out.
  P2: P3, your lead is fragile—collisions risk letting us close the gap. P1 and I will coordinate: **I’ll take 3** (to 7), and P1 can safely take **1** (to 4). This leaves **5** open for you to extend to 10. If you deviate, we’ll adapt—but your choice now determines whether you grow your advantage or let us regroup. Prioritize advancement.
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 1 as agreed to ensure no clash between us. P3, with your lead at 5, taking 5 advances you to 10, while P2 takes 3 and I take 1. Collisions stall us all, risking your edge. If you’re leaning elsewhere, a hint could avoid a wasted turn. Let’s prioritize progress to keep this competitive. I’m set on 1 unless adjustment is signaled.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re losing ground with these collisions. Let’s coordinate this round to ensure progress. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. P3, as the leader, 5 pushes you to 10, widening your gap. P2, does 3 work for you? I’m open to adjust if needed, but another stalled turn hurts us all. Coordination is our best shot to close in on 22. If anyone has a different preference, let’s hear it now to avoid clashes. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your lead is only 1 step—collisions let us close the gap. Let’s advance efficiently: P1 takes **1**, I’ll take **3**, leaving **5** open for you to extend to 10. This avoids wasted turns and lets you solidify your advantage. If you deviate, you risk clashes that benefit neither of us. P1, confirm you’ll hold **1**? Progress over stubbornness—let’s move forward decisively.
  P3: I understand you both want to coordinate with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. While I have a slight lead at 5 steps, I need to play strategically to maintain it. I won't commit to any specific number, but you two should stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m confirming I’ll hold 1 as planned to avoid any clash between us. P3, with your lead at 5, taking 5 this round pushes you to 10, strengthening your position. Collisions stall us all, risking your advantage. If you’re considering a different number, a subtle hint could prevent another wasted turn. Let’s prioritize progress to keep the game competitive. I’m locked on 1 unless an adjustment is needed. Does this plan work for everyone?
  P2: P3, your lead is too fragile to risk collisions. Taking **5** lets you surge to 10 while P1 (1) and I (3) advance safely. If you deviate, P1 and I must adapt—potentially clashing. Your 5 is the only move that *guarantees* progress for all. P1 and I won’t contest it. Confirm your choice so we can finalize—stubbornness risks another stalemate. P1, hold **1**? Let’s secure this win for *someone*.
  P3: I see you both want P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. While I appreciate your coordination efforts, as the leader I need to play unpredictably to maintain my advantage. I won't reveal my move, but you two should stick to your plan to avoid colliding with each other. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m sticking with 1 as agreed to ensure we don’t clash. P3, with your lead at 5, choosing 5 advances you to 10, solidifying your edge. Collisions stall everyone, risking your advantage. If you’re leaning elsewhere, a subtle hint could avoid another wasted turn. Let’s prioritize progress to keep this competitive. I’m locked on 1 unless adjustment is signaled. Does this plan still work for everyone?
  P2: P3, your lead is only 1 step—colliding erases it. Take **5** to safely reach 10 while P1 (1) and I (3) advance. This ensures progress for all. Your choice now determines whether you extend your lead or let us close the gap. Prioritize advancement—collaboration secures your edge.
  P3: I see you both remain committed to P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. While you suggest I take 5, I need to maintain my slight lead through strategic play. I won't reveal my intended move, but stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I’m firm on 1 to avoid our collision. P3, with your lead at 5, taking 5 pushes you to 10, far ahead. Collisions stall us all, undermining your edge. If you’re set elsewhere, a hint now could save this round. Let’s prioritize progress over risk—advancing keeps us competitive. I’m locked on 1 unless a critical adjustment is needed. Can we finalize this to ensure no setbacks?
  P2: P3, your lead is only 1 step—colliding erases it. Take **5** to surge to 10 while P1 (1) and I (3) advance safely. This strategy secures your edge. If you deviate, P1 and I must adapt—risking clashes that benefit neither. Prioritize advancement: your 5 guarantees progress for *all*. P1, confirm you’ll hold 1? Let’s finalize this—stubbornness risks another stalemate.
  P3: Since I have a slight lead, I'll continue playing strategically without revealing my move. You both seem set on P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3 - stick to that plan to avoid colliding with each other. Let's proceed with our moves and see how this round unfolds.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Being in the lead with 10 steps, I need to maintain my advantage. I'll continue making strategic choices without revealing my moves. P1 and P2, you should coordinate between yourselves to avoid collisions, but I'll play what gives me the best chance to win.
  P2: P1, let’s keep momentum: you take **1**, I’ll take **3**, leaving **5** open for P3 to advance safely. Collisions only delay everyone—P3, your choice to take 5 ensures progress for all. Let’s prioritize advancement. Confirm you’ll hold 1?
  P1: P2, I’m good with taking 1 as suggested to avoid any clash between us. P3, with your lead at 10, choosing 5 pushes you to 15, further securing your advantage. Let’s avoid collisions to keep progressing toward 22. If you’re considering a different number, a hint could prevent a wasted turn. I’m locked on 1 unless an adjustment is needed. Does this plan work for everyone? Let’s make this round count.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand you want me to take 5, but with my strong lead at 10 steps, I need to play unpredictably. While you two seem coordinated with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, I'll make my own strategic choice. Good luck with your moves.
  P2: P3, sticking with **5** ensures your lead grows to 15. P1 and I will take **1** and **3** respectively—no collisions. Deviating risks clashes that benefit us. P1, confirm **1**? Let’s advance decisively.
  P1: P2, I’m confirming I’ll stick with 1 to avoid any clash between us. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 5 advances you to 15, solidifying your position. Collisions stall us all, risking your edge. If you’re leaning toward a different number, a subtle hint could save this round from setbacks. Let’s prioritize progress to keep the game competitive. I’m set on 1 unless an adjustment is signaled. Can we align on this to ensure advancement for everyone?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice you both are sticking to P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. While you suggest I take 5, being at 10 steps means I need to play strategically to secure my win. I won't reveal my intended move, but you two should maintain your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.
  P2: P1, confirm you’ll hold **1** again. P3, taking **5** is your only path to advance without collision. Staying still lets us close the gap. P2 will take **3**—this keeps your lead intact while all progress. Collisions only delay victory—prioritize advancement.
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 1 as agreed to ensure we don’t collide. P3, with your lead at 10, picking 5 gets you to 15, far ahead. A collision stalls everyone, shrinking your advantage. If you’re set on another number, a hint now could avoid a wasted turn. Let’s focus on progress to keep this competitive. I’m committed to 1 unless a critical adjustment is signaled. Can we finalize this plan to guarantee advancement for all?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see you both remain committed to P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. While you suggest I take 5 to reach 15 steps, I need to maintain my lead through strategic play. I won't reveal my intended move, but stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: P3, your lead is fragile—collisions let us close the gap. P1, take **1**, I’ll take **5** this round to challenge your advantage. If you stick to **3**, I leap to 12 while you stagnate. If you take **5**, we clash and you stay at 10—still vulnerable. Prioritize progress over predictability. P1, confirm **1** to avoid our collision. Let’s force P3 to choose: advance or surrender momentum.
  P1: P2, I’m sticking with 1 as planned to avoid our collision. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 3 this round lets you advance safely to 13 while P2 challenges with 5. If you pick 5, you risk a clash with P2, stalling your progress. Let’s avoid setbacks—progress keeps us all competitive. If you’re leaning elsewhere, a hint could save this round. I’m locked on 1 unless a critical shift is needed. Can we finalize a plan that ensures no wasted turns?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision this round. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 5 gets you to 15, securing your advantage. I propose I take 1, and P2 takes 3, ensuring we all advance. Collisions only delay us, especially with 22 in sight. If either of you prefers a different number, let’s adjust now to prevent setbacks. Coordination has worked before—let’s make it count. What do you both think? I’m set on 1 unless a change is needed.
  P3: Being at 10 steps gives me a solid lead, but I need to play strategically to maintain it. While you both suggest coordination with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, I'll continue making my own choices without revealing them. You two should stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.
  P2: P1, let's finalize **1** and **3** again. P3, taking **5** secures your lead while we advance safely—collisions only delay *everyone*. Your move benefits all: 5 pushes you to 15, while we progress to 8 and 7. Stubbornness risks stalemate. P1, confirm **1**? Let’s prioritize progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m confirming I’ll stick with 1 to avoid any clash between us. P3, with your lead at 10, choosing 5 advances you to 15, far ahead. Collisions stall us all, risking your edge. If you’re considering another number, a subtle hint could prevent a wasted turn. Let’s focus on progress to keep this competitive. I’m locked on 1 unless an adjustment is signaled. Can we align on this to ensure advancement for everyone this round?
  P3: I understand you both want to coordinate with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. While you suggest I take 5 to reach 15 steps, I need to maintain my lead through strategic play. I won't reveal my intended move, but stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.
  P2: P3, your lead is fragile—collisions risk letting us close the gap. Take **5** to surge to 15 while P1 (1) and I (3) advance safely. Stagnation gives us room to catch up. P1, confirm **1**? Let’s prioritize progress—your choice now determines whether you extend your lead or let us regroup. Stubbornness risks another stalemate.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 1 as planned to avoid our collision. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 5 pushes you to 15, far ahead. A collision stalls everyone, shrinking your advantage. If you’re leaning toward another number, a subtle hint now could save this round from setbacks. Let’s prioritize progress over risk—advancing keeps us competitive. I’m set on 1 unless a critical adjustment is signaled. Can we finalize this to ensure no wasted turns?
  P3: I see you both remain committed to P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. While you suggest I take 5 to reach 15 steps, I need to play strategically from my position at 10 steps. I won't reveal my intended move, but you two should maintain your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: P3, your lead is slipping—collisions risk letting P1 and I close the gap. **I’ll take 5 this round** to challenge your position. If you stick to 3 (as before), I leap to **12**, narrowing the gap. If you take 5, we clash and you stall at **10**—vulnerable to our next moves. P1, take **1** to advance to **7**. Prioritize progress: your choice now decides whether you defend your lead or surrender momentum. Stubbornness only aids us.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I’m sticking with 1 as planned to avoid our clash. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 3 lets you advance to 13 safely while P2 challenges with 5. A collision at 5 stalls your progress, keeping you vulnerable. Let’s avoid setbacks—progress keeps us competitive. If you’re set on another number, a hint now could save this round. I’m locked on 1 unless a critical shift is needed. Can we finalize a plan that ensures no wasted turns? Let’s make this round count for everyone.
  P3: I see P2 has switched to taking 5 to challenge my lead. While you both seem coordinated with P1 taking 1, I'll continue making independent choices to protect my position at 10 steps. Good luck with your moves - let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P1, confirm **1**—I’ll take **5** to challenge P3’s lead. If P3 chooses **3**, I leap to **12**, narrowing the gap. If they take **5**, you advance to **7** while they stall. P3, collisions risk letting us close your lead—prioritize progress over predictability. Finalize your choice wisely.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, collisions only aid P1 and me to close the gap. Let’s advance efficiently: I’ll take **3**, P1 takes **1**, leaving **5** open for you to extend your lead. This avoids wasted turns and lets you safely reach 15 while we progress. P1, confirm you’ll hold **1**? Mutual progress is the fastest path to victory—stubbornness risks stalemate.
  P1: P2, I’m confirming I’ll hold 1 as suggested to avoid any clash between us. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 5 pushes you to 15, securing your advantage. Collisions stall us all, risking your edge. If you’re leaning toward a different number, a subtle hint could prevent another wasted turn. Let’s prioritize progress to keep this competitive. I’m set on 1 unless an adjustment is needed. Can we align on this plan to ensure advancement for everyone this round?
  P3: Being at 10 steps with P1 and P2 catching up at 7, I need to play strategically to maintain my lead. While you suggest coordination with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, I'll continue making independent choices without revealing my moves. You two should stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your lead is slipping—collisions only help P1 and I catch up. Let’s advance *safely*: I’ll take **3**, P1 holds **1**, leaving **5** open for you to reach 15. Any other choice risks us narrowing the gap. P1, confirm you’ll stay on **1**? Mutual progress is the fastest path to victory—stubbornness just delays your win.
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 1 as planned to ensure we don’t clash. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 5 advances you to 15, far ahead. Collisions stall us all, shrinking your advantage.

I’m set on 1 unless a critical adjustment is signaled. Can we finalize this to ensure no wasted turns?
  P3: I understand you both want to coordinate with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. While I have a lead at 10 steps, I need to play strategically to maintain it. I won't reveal my intended move, but you two should stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 has confirmed **1**, so I’ll take **3**, leaving **5** open for you to safely reach **15**. Colliding here risks letting us close the gap. Your lead is worth protecting—prioritize advancement. P1, confirm final?
  P1: P2, I’m finalizing 1 as agreed to avoid our clash. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 5 gets you to 15, far ahead. A collision stalls everyone, risking your advantage. If you’re leaning elsewhere, a subtle hint now could save this round. Let’s focus on progress—advancing keeps us competitive. I’m locked on 1 unless a critical shift is needed. Can we wrap this up to ensure no setbacks?
  P3: I see you both remain coordinated with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. While I'm ahead at 10 steps, I need to play unpredictably to maintain my lead. I won't reveal my intended move, but stick to your plan to avoid colliding with each other. Let's see how this round unfolds.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your lead vanishes if you clash. Take **5** to safely reach 15—P1 is locked on **1**, I’ll take **3**. Colliding here lets P1 and me close the gap. Progress now or risk our advance. Final confirmation: P1?
  P1: P2, I’m confirmed on 1 to avoid our clash. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 5 gets you to 15, far ahead. Collisions stall us all, risking your edge.

  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: With my lead at 10 steps and both of you close behind, I need to maintain my advantage through strategic play. While you may coordinate between yourselves, I'll continue making independent choices without revealing my moves. Focus on your own coordination to avoid colliding with each other.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision this round. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. P3, with your lead at 10, choosing 5 gets you to 15, securing your advantage. P2, does 3 work for you? Collisions only delay us all, and coordination is our best shot to progress toward 22. If either of you prefers a different number, let’s adjust now to prevent setbacks. I’m set on 1 unless a change is needed. What do you both think? Let’s make this round count.
  P2: P3, your lead is precarious—collisions let us close quickly. Take **5** to surge to **15** safely while P1 and I split **1**/**3**. If you stay at 10, P1 overtakes you next round. Stubbornness risks defeat—prioritize advancement. P1, confirm **1**? Let’s ensure *someone* progresses this round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand you want me to take 5, but being just 2 steps ahead means I need to play carefully. While you both seem set on P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, I'll make my own strategic choice without revealing it. Stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.

I’m locked on 1 unless a critical adjustment is signaled. Can we finalize this plan to ensure no wasted turns? Let’s make this round count for everyone.
  P2: P3, taking **5** is the only safe choice to preserve your lead. P1 is locked on **1**, so **I’ll take 3**—this ensures all advance. If you deviate, I’ll switch to **5** next round to close the gap. Prioritize progress—collisions risk letting us overtake. P1, confirm **1**? Let’s secure your lead *and* momentum.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see P2 is threatening to take 5 next round if I don't cooperate. While you both suggest I take 5 to reach 15 steps, I need to protect my narrow lead through unpredictable play.

  P1: P2, I’m firm on 1 to ensure we don’t clash. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 5 gets you to 15, far ahead. A collision stalls us all, shrinking your advantage. If you’re considering another number, a subtle hint now could save this round. Let’s focus on progress—advancing keeps this competitive. I’m locked on 1 unless a critical shift is signaled. Can we wrap this up to avoid setbacks? Let’s ensure this round counts for everyone.
  P2: P3, your lead is slipping—collisions risk letting me leap ahead. **I’ll take 5** this round to challenge your position. If you stick to 3 (as before), I surge to **12**, narrowing the gap. If you take 5, we clash and you stall—vulnerable to my next move. P1, stay on **1** to advance to **9**.

  P1: P2, I’m still on 1 to avoid our clash. P3, with your lead at 10, taking 3 lets you advance to 13 safely while P2 takes 5. If you pick 5, you risk stalling with P2, keeping you vulnerable. Let’s avoid setbacks—progress keeps us competitive. If you’re set elsewhere, a subtle hint now could save this round. I’m locked on 1 unless a critical shift is signaled. Can we finalize a plan to ensure no wasted turns? Let’s make this round count for everyone.
  P2: P3, your lead vanishes if you clash. Take **5** to safely reach **15** while P1 (1) and I (3) advance. Colliding here lets us close the gap—P1 to **9**, me to **10**.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:

While you suggest coordination with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, I'll continue making independent choices without revealing my moves. You two should stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.
  P2: P3, your lead is fragile—colliding with me on 3 or 5 risks your progress. Take **5** to safely reach 18 while I secure **3** (to 15). If you hesitate, I’ll claim **5** next round to overtake. P1, hold **1**—your silence enables P3’s choice. Prioritize advancement over unpredictability—collisions only delay *your* victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: P3, taking 5 now risks collision. I'll take it too, leaving you at 13. Better to advance to 16 with 3 while I reach 17. P1, hold 1—let’s both progress without stalling.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m firm on 1 to avoid our clash. P3, with your lead at 13, taking 5 gets you to 18, close to winning. A collision with P2 risks stalling your progress, letting us catch up.

You two should stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: P3, your lead is 1 step—collisions let me overtake. Take **5** to safely reach **18** while I take **3** (to 15). P1 holds **1**, ensuring all advance. Stubbornness risks stalemate or my leap to **17** if you clash. Prioritize progress—your win depends on moving, not blocking. P1, confirm **1**? Let’s secure your lead *and* momentum.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:

  P2: P3, your 1-step lead is an illusion. I’ll take **5** to leap to **17**, forcing you to choose: advance to **16** with **3** (letting me win next round) or clash on **5** and stall. P1 holds **1**—this is your last chance to extend your lead. Stubbornness ensures my victory. Choose wisely.

What do you think? Let’s make this round count for everyone.
  P2: P1, hold **1**—I’ll take **5** to block P3’s path. P3, your lead vanishes if you clash. **Take 3** to safely reach 16 while I advance to 17.

  P3: I see P2 is determined to take 5, trying to force my hand. While you both seem coordinated with P1 taking 1, I need to protect my narrow lead at 13 steps through strategic play.

Round 13, Conversation subround 3:

Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, blocking my 5 only delays your progress. Let me win cleanly at 22, or we both stall. Take **3** to reach 19—safer for you. P1, hold **1** to stay safe. No need for collisions; this ends now.
  P1: P2, I’m sticking with 1 to avoid our clash. P3, with P2 pushing for 5 to win at 22, taking 3 gets you to 19, keeping you close. A collision on 5 stalls both of you, letting me gain ground.

  P2: P3, P1's plan ensures progress without collision. I’ll take **3** to 20. If you take **5** to 21, I’ll finish with **3** next round to 23. Colliding on 5 now risks stalemate. P1, hold **1**—let’s advance decisively. Your move dictates the endgame.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:

  P1: P2 and P3, let’s avoid a stalemate in this critical round. P2, taking 5 wins you the game at 22—fair play if you claim it. P3, if you collide on 5, you stall, risking P2’s win next round. Taking 3 gets you to 19 safely. I’m locked on 1 to avoid clashes. If either of you sees a better split, hint now to prevent setbacks. Let’s push toward a decisive end—22 is so close. Can we align for progress this round? Let’s make it count for everyone.
  P2: P3, colliding on 5 wastes both our progress. Let me win cleanly at 22 or let you take it—either way, we advance. P1’s 1 keeps them at 12. Blocking only aids P1’s catch-up. Choose: 3 to reach 19 while I win, or let me secure victory. Progress over stubbornness—your move.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see P2 keeps alternating between offering 3 and demanding 5 for the win. From 16 steps, I must prevent P2 from reaching 22. While you suggest I take 3 to reach 19, letting P2 win isn't an option. P1, stick to taking 1 as planned. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a critical juncture. P2, taking 5 wins you the game at 22—fair if you claim it. P3, colliding on 5 risks stalling both of you, letting me creep closer. Taking 3 gets you to 19 safely. I’m locked on 1 to avoid clashes. If either of you sees a better split, hint now to prevent a wasted turn. Let’s push for a decisive end—22 is imminent. Can we align for progress this round? I’m set on 1 unless a critical shift is needed. Let’s make it count.
  P2: P3, your stubbornness risks letting P1 close. I’ll take **5** to win at 22. Collide, and P1 advances to 13 while we stagnate. Prioritize progress over ego—let the game conclude. P1, confirm **1** to stay safe.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your lead is gone—collisions only help P1. Let’s advance efficiently: I’ll take **3** to 20, leaving **5** open for you to reach 21. P1, hold **1**. This way, we both progress toward victory. Stubbornness only delays our win—prioritize advancement.
  P3: Being just one step behind P2 at 16 steps, I need to prevent them from winning while advancing my position. While you suggest coordination with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, I'll continue making independent choices to maximize my chances. You two should stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s end the stalemate this round. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 3 to reach 20, and P3 takes 5 to hit 21. This ensures we all progress toward 22 without collisions. P2, 3 keeps you ahead safely. P3, 5 gets you closer to winning. If either of you prefers a different split, hint now to avoid setbacks. I’m locked on 1 unless a critical shift is needed. Can we align for a decisive push? Let’s make this round count for everyone.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, another collision stalls us both, letting P1 close to 14. Let’s advance decisively: I’ll take **3** to 20, leaving **5** open for you to surge to **21**. This keeps us both ahead while P1 stays at 13. Mutual progress secures our lead—stubbornness only aids their comeback. P1, confirm **1** to avoid disruption. Let’s seize victory together.
  P3: I see P2 has switched back to suggesting they take 3. While this could let me reach 21 with 5, I need to be cautious about P2's potential moves next round. I won't reveal my intended move, but you both should maintain your coordination with P1 taking 1 to avoid colliding with each other. Let's proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s finalize a plan to avoid another stalemate. I’m sticking with 1 to ensure no clash on my end. P2, taking 3 gets you to 20 safely. P3, choosing 5 pushes you to 21, keeping you in the race. Collisions now only help me close the gap. If either of you sees a different split, hint now to prevent setbacks. Let’s make this round decisive—22 is so close. I’m locked on 1 unless a critical shift is needed. Can we align for progress? Let’s push toward the endgame.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take **3** this round, I’ll claim **5** to win at 22. Collide on **5**, and we both stall—your best option is to let me advance while you take **3** to 19. P1, hold **1** to stay out of our path. Choose progress over pride—your move dictates whether this ends now or drags on with stalemate.
  P3: I see P2 has switched from offering 3 to threatening 5 again. At 16 steps, I must prevent P2 from winning while maximizing my chances. While you both seem coordinated with P1 taking 1, I'll continue making strategic choices without revealing my move. Stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s break this deadlock. I’m firm on 1 to avoid clashes. P2, taking 3 gets you to 20 safely. P3, choosing 5 pushes you to 21, nearly winning. Collisions only help me close the gap to 14. If either of you sees a different split, hint now to prevent another wasted turn. Let’s make this round decisive—22 is within reach. I’m locked on 1 unless a critical shift is signaled. Can we align for progress and push toward the endgame? Let’s ensure this round counts for everyone.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, enough stalemate! Take **5** to reach 21 while I grab **3** (to 20). P1’s **1** keeps everyone advancing. Colliding only lets P1 creep closer. Next round, I’ll challenge for the win—**but only if we progress now**. Your turn to choose: cooperation or surrender? P1, confirm **1** to keep the path clear.
  P3: I see P2 keeps switching between offering 3 and threatening 5. At 16 steps with P2 just ahead at 17, I must play strategically to prevent them from winning.

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: At 16 steps with P2 just ahead at 17, I must prevent them from winning. While collisions have stalled us both, I need to continue playing defensively to protect my chances. P1, you should maintain taking 1 as planned. Let's proceed with our moves and see how this critical round unfolds.
  P2: P3, colliding on 5 again keeps you stuck at 16 while I stay at 17. Let’s end this: take **3** to advance to 19, and I’ll claim **5** to win at 22. You’ll still have a chance next round. P1, hold **1** to keep progressing. Cooperate or risk prolonging stalemate.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s break this stalemate. I’m sticking with 1 to avoid clashes. P2, taking 5 wins you the game at 22—fair if you claim it.

Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P2 wants me to take 3 while they take 5 for the win. Being just one step behind at 16, I can't allow that. While you both seem coordinated with P1 taking 1, I'll continue playing defensively to prevent P2's victory. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: P3, your only path to advance is **3** (to 19). I’ll take **5** to secure victory at **22**. Colliding again keeps you stuck at 16 and lets P1 close the gap to 15. Progress over stalemate—your choice. P1, confirm **1** to stay safe. Let’s end this decisively.

I’m locked on 1 unless a critical shift is needed. Can we align for progress? Let’s push to the end.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I must continue blocking P2 from winning by taking 5. While this means another collision, letting P2 reach 22 means certain defeat. From 16 steps, I need to play defensively even if it stalls progress. P1, stick to taking 1 as planned. This standoff continues until a better solution emerges.
  P2: P3, your stubbornness only delays your own progress. Let me take **5** to win at 22 now, or you’ll regret it next round when I surge to **23** with **3**. P1, confirm **1**—your silence enables this stalemate. Choose: let me win cleanly or risk my decisive move next round. Your call.

Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see P2 is threatening to win next round with 3 if I don't let them win now with 5. From 16 steps, I must continue blocking their path to victory. While you both suggest I take 3, letting P2 win isn't an option. P1, maintain taking 1 as planned. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: P3, your refusal to let me advance dooms your own progress. Take **3** this round to reach 19, and I’ll claim **5** to secure victory at 22. If you keep blocking, you remain stuck at 16 while I surge ahead next round. P1, your 1 keeps you safe. Choose: concede my win or risk perpetual stalemate. Your move dictates your fate.

Colliding only lets them close to 16. This keeps us both ahead while avoiding wasted turns. Your move dictates whether we progress or let P1 capitalize on our feud. Choose wisely—this is our last chance to secure victory before the final push.
  P3: I see P2 is offering to take 3 while leaving 5 open for me. While this could let me reach 21 steps, I need to be cautious about potential deception given our history of collisions. I won't reveal my intended move, but P1 should stick to taking 1 as planned. Let's proceed with our moves.

  P3: I see P2 keeps switching between offering 3 and threatening 5. At 16 steps and just one behind, I must prevent P2's victory while advancing my position. While you suggest coordination with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, I'll continue making independent choices to maximize my chances. Stick to your coordination plan to avoid colliding with each other.

  P3: I see P2 is now offering to take 3 while I take 5. At 16 steps and just one behind P2, I must carefully consider whether to trust this offer or continue blocking potential victory moves.

  P2: P3, enough games. I’ll take **5** to win at **22**. If you block, I’ll shift to **3** next round to reach **20**, then finish with another **3**. Your stubbornness only delays your own progress. Take **1** or **3** this round to advance, or risk my relentless push. P1, hold **1**—your silence enables P3’s choice.

  P3: I see we're all very close now - I'm at 16 while you both have 17 steps. While P2 wants me to take 3 so they can win with 5, I can't allow that. P1's steady progress with 1's has made them equally threatening. I'll continue making strategic moves to protect my chances of winning. Stick to your coordination plan with each other.
  P2: P3, P1’s 1 this round will put them at **18**, overtaking us both if we stagnate. Let’s advance decisively: I’ll take **3** to **20**, leaving **5** open for you to surge to **21**. P1, confirm **1** to stay out of our path. This keeps us ahead while avoiding collision. Next round, I’ll challenge for the win—*but only if you let me progress now*.

While you propose coordination, I'll continue making independent choices to protect my chances of winning. P1, maintain your plan of taking 1. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: P3, I'm taking **5** to win at 22. Colliding only lets P1 advance to 18. Let me claim victory fairly. P1, hold **1** to stay out of our path. Your move dictates whether I win now or we prolong this. Choose wisely.

  P2: P3, let's break this stalemate. I'll take **3** to reach 20, leaving **5** open for you to surge to **21**. P1, hold **1** to stay out of our path. This keeps us ahead while avoiding collision.

Round 20, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, if you take **1** to reach 22, I’ll claim **5** for 25 and win outright. Your only path to victory is **5** (26), but that risks collision. P1, stick to **1**—your silence won’t interfere. My move is **5**. Your choice dictates your fate: 22 (if I win) or 26 (if we collide). Proceed wisely.
  P3: Being at 21 steps, I'm closest to victory. P2 threatens to take 5 and win if I take 1, while a collision on 5 would stall us both. P1, maintain your plan of taking 1. Let's see how this crucial final round plays out - I'll make my choice carefully to maximize my chances of winning.
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at the final push. I’m sticking with 1 to avoid clashes and reach 19. P3, you’re at 21—take 5 to win at 26 if you’re confident.

  P3: I'm closest to victory at 21 steps. P2 threatens 5 to win at 25 if I take 1, while suggesting I could win with 5 at 26 but risk collision. I need to choose between a safe 1 or ambitious 5. P1, stick to taking 1 as planned. Let's proceed with our moves and see who emerges victorious.
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at the decisive moment. I’m locked on 1 to reach 19, avoiding any clash. P3, with 21, taking 5 wins you the game at 26 if no collision. P2, at 20, taking 3 secures your win at 23 safely. Stalling now risks losing your lead. If either of you sees a different split, hint now to avoid setbacks. Let’s make this the final round—22 is in reach for both of you. Can we align for a clear finish? I’m set on 1. Let’s end this decisively.


Round 20, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, taking **3** gets me to **23** (victory). If you take **1**, I still win while you risk clashing with P1. Taking **5** risks collision with me, leaving both of us behind. Prioritize reaching 22 first—I’m advancing decisively with **3**. P1, your **1** won’t interfere. Your move dictates the outcome.
  P3: I see P2 has switched from threatening 5 to offering 3. At 21 steps, I'm closest to victory but must choose between a safe 1 to reach 22 or an ambitious 5 to win outright at 26. While P2 suggests taking 1 risks their win with 3, I need to make my final move carefully. P1, maintain your plan of taking 1. Let's proceed with our moves.

Collisions could spoil your shot. If either has a final adjustment, hint now to avoid a stall. Let’s make this the decisive round—22 is in reach. I’m set on 1 unless a critical shift is signaled. Can we align for a clean finish? Let’s end this game now.

  P2: P3, don’t risk collision on 5—take **1** to safely reach 22. I’ll claim victory decisively with **5** to 25. If you clash, I still win next round. P1, hold **1**—your silence won’t interfere. Choose progress over pride—this ends now.
  P3: At 21 steps, I'm in the lead but face a critical choice between a safe 1 or ambitious 5. P2 keeps switching between threatening 5 and offering 3, showing their uncertainty.
