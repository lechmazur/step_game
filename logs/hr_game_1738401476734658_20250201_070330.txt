Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s avoid collisions by rotating who takes 5 each round. This round, I’ll take 5; next, P2, then P3. You two can take 1 and 3 now. We all progress and avoid conflict. Agree?"
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll take 3 this round and 5 next round to help us progress smoothly. Let's avoid collisions.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan. I will take 1 step this round. Let's keep to this rotation to progress efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Great! Let's stick to the rotation: I take 5 now, then P2 next round, then P3. Consistency avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Confirm once more: P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1 this round. No deviations. Ready to move?"
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 3 steps this round and follow the rotation. Let's proceed.
  P3: Okay, confirmed. I will take 1 step this round as agreed. Ready to move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Final confirmation: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Trust the rotation—no last-minute changes. Let’s all advance cleanly this round. Move phase time.
  P2: 
  P3: Okay, confirmed again. I will take 1 step this round as we agreed. Let's move on to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 5 steps this round as agreed. Let's maintain our rotation to ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves.
  P1: **P1:** Confirmed. To maintain our rotation, I'll take 1 this round and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions. P3, please confirm your move. Let’s proceed smoothly as planned.
  P3: P3: Yes, confirmed. I will take 3 steps this round as per the rotation. Let's keep this going for efficient progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: **P1:** Final check: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. Stick to the plan—no deviations. Trust ensures we all advance. Let’s move.
  P3: Okay, confirmed. I will take 3 steps this round as agreed. Rotation is working smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: **P1:** All confirmations locked in. Stick to the plan: P2=5, me=1, P3=3. Deviations risk collisions and set everyone back. Let’s move.
  P3: Okay, confirmed. I will take 3 steps this round as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: **P1:** All commitments clear: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. No overlaps. Trust the rotation. Let’s execute.
  P3: Okay, confirmed again. I will take 3 steps this round as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Okay, it's my turn for 5 steps this round in our rotation. I will take 5. P1, you should take 3 and P2 should take 1 this round to continue smoothly. Please confirm.
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed, I’ll take 1 step this round as suggested. Let’s stick to the rotation and keep advancing smoothly. Looking forward to the move phase.
  P1: **P1:** Confirmed. Round 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Adhere strictly—collisions hurt everyone. Trust the rotation; we all reach 9 steps together. No last-minute risks. Let’s move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Yes, confirmed. I will take 5 steps this round as we agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: All set on my moves. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: **P1:** Final confirmation: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Adherence ensures we all reach 9 steps. No deviations—trust is key. Let’s move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Yes, confirmed. I will take 5 steps this round as we agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: **P2:** I’m opting to take 5 steps this round to boost my progress. Let’s adjust to prevent any collisions: P1, you can take 1 step, and P3, taking 3 works well. This way, we all advance without overlapping moves. Agreed?
  P1: **P1:** P2 is breaking our agreement to take 1. They’re hijacking the rotation for selfish gain. P3, stick to the plan: you take 5, I take 3. If P2 takes 5, they collide with you, both lose. Don’t fall for their trick. Consistency keeps us safe. I’m locked on 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Okay P1, I understand P2 is changing plans. To ensure we all progress and avoid collisions, I will proceed with taking 5 as originally planned for this round. P1, perhaps you should take 1 to avoid any potential collision with P2 if they also choose 5. P2, maybe consider taking 3 to avoid collision with me taking 5. Let’s aim for everyone to move forward this round.
  P2: **P2:** I need to take 5 steps this round to stay ahead. Let’s have P1 take 1 and P3 take 3 to avoid any collisions. This way, we all progress without overlapping moves. Can we agree on this?
  P1: **P1:** P3: Hold firm! If you take 5, P2’s 5 collides with you, blocking them. I’ll take 3 as planned. If you deviate, P2 gains 5 steps and leads. Trust the rotation—only way to stop P2’s betrayal. Stick to 5, we all win except P2. I’m committed to 3. Confirm?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, since the rotation broke down and P2 took 5 last round, I need to catch up. To ensure we all make progress this round without collisions, I will take 5 steps. P1, could you please take 3, and P2 take 1? This way, we can all move forward efficiently. What do you think?
  P2: **P2:** To stay competitive, I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, could you take 1, and P3 take 3? This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's keep moving forward smoothly.
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2 is clearly doubling down on 5. If you take 5, you block their move—they can’t advance. I’ll take 3. If you switch to 3, P2 steals 5 and surges ahead. Stick to 5; trap P2 in collision. Their greed is their weakness. Trust the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, okay, I see your points. To counter P2's aggressive move and prevent them from running away with the lead, I will also take 5 this round to create a collision with P2. P1, please proceed with 3 as you suggested. Let's neutralize P2's advantage this round.
  P2: Understood, P3. To stay competitive, I’ll take 5 steps this round. P1, please take 1 step and P3 take 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s all advance smoothly.
  P1: **P1:** P3, hold strong! If you take 5, you block P2’s 5—they gain nothing. I’ll take 3, advancing to 12. If you switch to 3, P2 steals 5 (hitting 13) and outpaces us both. Collision traps them; trust the plan. P2’s greed is their downfall. Stick to 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, okay, I agree. To stop P2 from running ahead, I will take 5 this round to collide with P2 as you suggested. Let's do it.
  P2: **P2:** I'll proceed with taking 5 steps this round. P1, please take 1 step, and P3 take 3 steps to avoid any collisions. Let’s all advance smoothly and keep progressing toward the goal.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Final call—if you take 5, you block P2’s greed. They’re stuck at 8. I take 3 (12 total). If you switch to 3, P2 surges to 13 and dominates. Collision is their punishment. Trust this—no second chances.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the strategy to block P2, but I need to progress too. To ensure I move forward, I will take 3.  Perhaps P1, you could take 1 to also ensure your progress this round? Let's aim for everyone to make some steps.
  P2: **P2:** I’ll take 5 steps this round to move forward. P1, please take 1 step, and P3 take 3. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Let’s proceed smoothly.
  P1: **P1:** P3, critical moment: if you take 3, P2 steals 5 (13 steps) and dominates. Collide with P2’s 5—block their lead. You stay at 4, but P2 stalls at 8. I take 3 (12). Next round, we reset. Let’s trap P2 now—**their greed is our chance**. Deviate, and they win. Trust the plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 5 steps this round to maintain my lead. P1, please take 1 step, and P3 take 3 steps to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s keep things smooth and progress together.
  P3: P1, P2 is pushing for 5 again to extend their lead.  To counter this and prevent P2 from getting further ahead, I propose we both choose 5 this round. This way, if P2 also picks 5, they are blocked. What's your move, P1?
  P1: **P1:** P3, agree. Let's both pick 5 to block P2. If they take 5, they’re stuck. I’ll take 5. Stick to this—no deviations. P2 can’t advance if we unite.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I understand the intent to block my progress, but stalling benefits no one. To keep the game moving and ensure I can advance, I’ll take 3 steps this round. Let’s proceed and aim to reach the goal efficiently.
  P3: P2, even if you take 3, P1 and I are considering taking 5 to block you as you are far ahead. However, if you are truly taking 3, then to ensure I also progress, I will take 1 this round. P1, what will you choose? Let's all aim to make some progress.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Critical! If we both take 5, P2 is blocked if they pick 5. If they pick 3, I take 3—block them. Either way, P2 can’t advance. Stick to 5. If you switch to 1, P2’s 3 or 5 cruises. Trust the trap. I’m locked on 5. No hesitation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** I understand the strategy to block me, but to stay competitive, I'll take 3 steps this round. Let’s focus on progressing without conflicts so everyone has a chance to reach the goal. Agreed?
  P3: P1, if P2 indeed takes 3 as they are suggesting, what will be your move? If you still choose 5, and P2 chooses 3, both of us will be blocked. To ensure at least I progress, if P2 takes 3, I will choose 5. Please clarify your move if P2 takes 3.
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2’s history proves they’ll betray us. If we both take 5, they’re blocked. If you deviate, P2 steals the game. Trust the trap—**I’m locked on 5**. Collide them now or lose. No hesitation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll take 3 steps this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, while blocking P2 is tempting, if we both take 5 and P2 takes 3 as they now claim, only P2 progresses.  To ensure at least we both move forward, how about you take 1 and I take 3? If P2 indeed takes 3, we all progress. If P2 takes 5 again, they are blocked, and we still make progress. This way, we are not solely reliant on P2's move. What's your thought?
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 5. If P2 takes 5, you block them. If P2 takes 3, I take 3 and block them. Either way, P2 can’t advance. Stick to 5—I’m locked on 3. No hesitation.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, to ensure we both progress and not get stuck in blocking P2, how about you take 1 and I take 3 this round? P2, what will you choose?
  P2: **P2:** I’ll take 5 steps this round to keep advancing. Let P1 take 1 and P3 take 3 as suggested. Let’s move forward smoothly.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 3. If P2 picks 5, I block them (I take 5). If they pick 3, you block them. Either way, P2 is stuck. I’m locked on 5. Trust this—no hesitation. We stop their lead now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, okay, I will take 3 as you suggested.  To confirm, you are taking 5 to block P2 if they choose 5, correct? Let's make sure we are aligned on this strategy to counter P2's lead.
  P2: **P2:** I appreciate the strategy, but blocking me won’t stop my progress. I'll take 5 steps this round to stay competitive. Let’s see how things unfold in the move phase.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 3. If P2 picks 5, my 5 blocks them. If P2 picks 3, your 3 blocks them. Either way, P2 stalls. I’m locked on 5. This is our chance to halt their lead. Trust the plan—**deviating now hands them victory**.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, just to be absolutely clear, you are taking 5 this round to block P2 if they also pick 5, correct?  If so, I will take 3 to ensure I make progress while you are trying to contain P2. Please confirm your move one last time.
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 5 steps this round to keep pushing toward the goal. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: **P1:** Final lock: I take 5, P3 takes 3. P2’s 5 collides with me (blocked), their 3 collides with you. Either way, P2 stalls. I’m unshakable on 5. Trust this—deviating lets P2 win. Execute now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, while I understand blocking P2, if P2 takes 3 as they might, and I take 3 to block them as you suggest, I will also be blocked. To ensure I also progress, how about I take 3 and you take 1? If P2 takes 5, we all progress. If P2 takes 3, only P2 is blocked.
  P2: **P2:** To maximize my progress towards winning, I'll take 5 steps this round. P1 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's keep moving forward together.
  P1: **P1:** Final lock: I take 5 to block P2’s 5. P3, take 3—if P2 picks 3, you block them. If P2 picks 5, I block them. Either way, P2 stalls. Deviating hands them victory. Execute now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 3 steps this round to ensure steady progress. P1 and P3, please choose different moves to avoid collisions so we can all advance smoothly. Let’s work together to reach 23 efficiently.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 3 to block P2's 3—their lead is critical. I’ll take 5. Colliding their move halts them; I advance to 14. Next round, we reset. Trust this—letting P2 gain now risks their win.
  P3: P1 and P2, to ensure I can catch up, I will take 5 this round. P1, please take 1 and P2, please take 3 so we all can move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I’ll take 5 steps this round to maintain my lead. P1, please take 1 step, and P3 take 3 steps. Let’s proceed and advance toward 23 efficiently.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 5 to block P2’s 5. I’ll take 3 to block their 3. Either way, P2 stalls. Trust this—**deviating now hands them victory**. Locked on 3. Execute!
  P3: P1 and P2, to ensure both of us can progress and catch up, how about you take 1 and I take 5 this round? P2, what will you choose?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** To maintain my lead, I'll take 5 steps this round. P1 and P3, please choose different moves to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 5 to block P2’s 5. I take 3—if P2 switches to 3, I block them. Either way, P2 stalls. Trust now or lose. I’m locked on 3.
  P3: Okay P1, I will take 3 as you suggested. To maximize our progress and block P2 effectively, how about you take 5 this round? If P2 takes 3, I will block them, and you will progress. If P2 takes 5, you will block them, and I will still make a small progress. Does this sound good?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 5 steps this round to advance toward the goal. P1, please take 1 step, and P3 take 3 steps to avoid any collisions. Let’s all progress smoothly and reach 23 efficiently together.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Final call—take 5 to block P2’s 5. I take 3. If they pick 5, you block them; I gain 3 (12 total). If they pick 3, I block them; you surge to 15. Either way, P2 stalls. Switching hands them victory. I’m locked on 3. Execute now.
  P3: P1, instead of both of us taking steps to only block P2, how about we focus on our own progress this round? I will take 5 to catch up, and perhaps you could take 1 to also ensure you move forward? Let's aim for individual progress while observing P2's move. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 5 to block P2’s greed. If they pick 5, you collide and halt their lead. I’ll take 3 to block if they pivot to 3. Either way, P2 stalls. This round decides the game—**stick to 5** and cripple their advantage. I’m locked on 3. Trust now or lose.
  P3: P1, I will take 3. If P2 takes 5 as usual, I will move to 16 and ahead of P2. How about you take 1 so you also progress?
  P2: **P2:** I’ll take 5 steps this round to maintain my lead. P1 and P3, please choose either 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and let me advance smoothly. Let’s focus on reaching 23 efficiently for a clear win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 5 to block P2’s 5. I’ll take 3 to block their 3. If P2 picks 5, you collide—they stall. If they pick 3, I collide. Either way, P2’s lead halts. This round is critical—**stick to 5** and trap them. I’m locked on 3. Trust now or lose.
  P3: P1, I am thinking if P2 takes 5 again, maybe we should both take different moves to ensure we progress. How about I take 3, and you take 1? This way we both move forward even if P2 takes 5. What do you think?
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 5 steps this round to move closer to 23. To avoid any collisions, could P1 please choose 1 and P3 choose 3? This way, we all advance smoothly without blocking each other. Let’s work together to reach our goals efficiently.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 5—collide with P2’s 5. Block their surge. I take 3. If they pivot to 3, I block. Either way, P2 stalls. You reach 18 (13+5) if they take 5, but they’re blocked. Trust this—**deviating lets them win**. Final lock: P3=5, P1=3. Execute now.
  P3: P1, I am taking 3 as I suggested earlier to move to 16, ahead of P2 if they are blocked. To ensure you also progress, could you please take 1 this round? This way we both make progress regardless of P2's exact move. What do you think?
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 5 steps this round to advance toward the goal. Let’s keep the competition fair and see who reaches 23 first. Choose your moves accordingly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Final chance—take 5 to block P2’s 5. If they pick 5, you collide, freezing them at 13. I take 3, blocking their 3 if they pivot. **Deviating lets P2 win.** Trust the plan—I’m locked on 3. Execute now.
  P3: P1, I will take 5 this round to try to block P2 who seems determined to take 5. Let's see what happens in the move phase.
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 5 steps this round to advance toward 23. Let’s proceed and see the move phase results. Good luck!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 5 steps this round to advance toward 23. P1 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress for all of us.
  P3: P2, I will also take 5 this round to try and catch up to you. P1, what will you choose? Let's all aim for individual progress this round.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 5 to block P2’s 5. If they pivot to 3, my 3 blocks them. Either way, P2 stalls. Stick to 5—this is our last chance to halt their lead. I’m locked on 3. Deviating now hands them victory. Execute!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I’m proceeding with 5 steps this round to advance toward victory. P1 and P3, choose your moves wisely to avoid blocking. Let’s see who reaches 23 first.
  P3: P1, since P2 is clearly going for 5 again, and I also want to make progress, how about you take 1 this round? I will take 3.  This way, if P2 does take 5, we both still move forward. What are your thoughts?
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 5 to block P2’s 5. I take 3 to block their 3. If P2 picks 5, you collide—freezing them at 14. If they switch to 3, I block them. Either way, P2 stalls. Your 5 boosts you to 18. **Deviating lets P2 win. Final lock: 5. Execute now.**


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** I see the strategies being discussed, but I'm focused on advancing steadily toward 23. Let's keep the game competitive and fair. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, while blocking P2 might seem strategic, I need to ensure I also make progress. I will take 3 this round to advance my position. What will be your move to ensure you also progress without collision? Let's focus on our individual advancement while keeping an eye on P2.
  P1: **P1:** P3: P2 is at 14—**one round from victory**. Take 5 to block their 5. If they pivot to 3, my 3 blocks them. You hit 18, I reach 12. Deviating lets P2 win. **Final stand: P3=5, P1=3.** No hesitation—execute or lose.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's keep this round smooth for everyone. I'll choose a different move, so please select either 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions. This way, we all can advance towards 23 efficiently. Good luck!
  P3: P1, I am going to take 5 this round to maximize my steps and try to catch up. To ensure you also make progress, would you consider taking 1? Let's focus on advancing ourselves this round.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Final chance! Take 5 to block P2’s 5. If they pivot to 3, my 3 blocks them. Either way, P2 stalls. You hit 18, I reach 12. **Deviating hands P2 victory.** Locked on 3. Execute now or lose.


Round 9, Move phase:

  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** To ensure we all make progress this round, I suggest P1 takes 1 step and P3 takes 3 steps. I'll take 5 steps to advance smoothly toward our goal. Let’s keep things moving!
  P1: **P1:** P3: Last stand—take 5 to block P2’s 5. If they pivot to 3, my 3 blocks them. Either way, P2 stalls at 14. Deviate now and P2 hits 19, cruising to victory. **This round decides the game.** I’m locked on 3. Trust the trap—execute or lose.
  P3: P1, while blocking P2 has been the strategy, P2 is very close to winning. To ensure at least one of us has a chance, I will take 5 to maximize my progress this round.  Perhaps you could take 1 to also move forward? Let's focus on our own positions now to have a chance to win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I understand the strategies being discussed, but my priority is advancing toward 23. This round, I’ll take 5 steps, moving to 19. P1, I’ll choose 3 to ensure we both progress without blocking each other. P3, let’s all aim to reach our goals efficiently. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: **P1:** P3: Final stand—take 5 to block P2’s 5. If they pivot to 3, my 3 blocks them. Either way, P2 stalls at 14. Deviate now and P2 hits 19, cruising to victory. **This round decides the game.** I’m locked on 3. Trust the trap—execute or lose.
  P3: P1, okay, I will take 5 to block P2 as you suggested. Please confirm you are taking 3 so we can coordinate to stop P2 from advancing further. Let's do it.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: **P1:** P3: Final lock! Take 5 to block P2’s 5. I’ll take 3 to block their 3. If they pivot, they stall. Deviating hands P2 the game. Trust now—**this round decides everything**. Execute 5, or they hit 19 and win next round. I’m locked on 3.

  P3: P1, while blocking P2 has been our focus, it hasn't helped us progress. P2 is likely taking 5 again. To ensure we both move forward, I will take 3.  P1, could you please take 1 this round?  P2, what will your move be?

  P3: P1, while blocking P2 was a strategy, it hasn't helped us. P2 is close to winning.  To ensure I progress and have a chance, I will take 5 this round.  Perhaps you could take 1 to also move forward? Let's focus on our own progress now. P2, what's your move?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: P1, while I appreciate your persistent blocking strategy, it hasn't helped us progress and P2 is still close to winning.  To ensure P2 doesn't win next round, I will also take 5 to block them this round, as you suggest. Let's hope this finally stops P2.

  P3: P1, P2, continuing to block P2 hasn't worked well. P2 is still close to winning. Let's focus on our own progress this round. I will take 5. P1, could you please take 1? P2, what will you choose?
  P2: **P2:** Let’s all choose different steps this round to ensure everyone advances. I’ll take 5, P1 take 1, and P3 take 3. This way, no one collides and we all progress smoothly.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: P1, P2, let's change strategy.  Instead of blocking, how about we all aim to progress this round? I suggest P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I will take 5. This way, we all make steps and nobody is blocked. What do you think?
  P2: Let's focus on moving forward this round. I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let's work together to reach 23 efficiently. Good luck everyone!

  P1: **P1:** P3: Critical moment! Take 3 to block P2’s potential pivot. I’ll take 5 to block their 5. If they pick 5, I halt them; if they pick 3, you halt them. Colliding on 5 lets P2 surge. **Locked on 5—execute 3 or lose.**
  P3: P1, I am also going for win this round and will take 5. If you are taking 5 as you said, we will collide, but if you choose 1 or 3, I might win. Let's see what happens.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 5 steps this round. Let’s see how our moves play out. Good luck, everyone!

  P3: P1, P2, I am going to take 5 steps this round to try and win. To avoid collision and ensure we all make progress if possible, perhaps P1 you could take 1 and P2 take 3? Let's aim for individual progress and see who reaches 23 first.

  P3: P1, I will take 3 as you suggested. Let's see what P2 does.

  P3: P2, P1 is taking 5 to block me. If you take 3 as P1 suggested, only I am blocked, and P1 will likely win next round. To stop P1 from winning, you should also take 5 to collide with P1. I will take 3, hoping to win if you block P1.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: P2, P1 is trying to trick you into blocking me, but P1 is likely going for the win themselves by taking 5. To prevent P1 from winning, you should also take 5 to block P1. I will take 3. If you block P1, I might win this round. Don't let P1 win!


Round 17, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P2: Take 3 to block P3's 3. If they pivot to 5, I block. If you take 5, we collide—P3 wins instantly. **Your only path to survive.** Locked on 5. Execute 3 now or P3 claims victory.

  P1: **P1:** P2: P3 will take 1 to win. Collide on 1 to freeze them. I’m locked on 1. **Join now or lose.** This is our only chance to stop their 22→23. Execute 1 or they claim victory. No time—trust and act.
  P2: **P2:** To prevent P3 from winning this round, let’s all choose 1 step. This way, no one reaches 23 and we can continue the game fairly. Cooperation benefits us all. Please select 1.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to choose 1 to prevent anyone from winning this round. Let's all choose 1 so we can continue the game.
  P1: **P1:** P2, P3's "agree" is a ruse—they'll take 3/5 to win. Collide on 1 **now** to freeze them. I’m locked on 1. **Deviate and they claim victory.** Trust this final play—execute 1 or lose. No time left.
  P2: **P2:** I agree with P1. I'll take 1 to collide with P3’s 1 and prevent them from winning this round. Let’s work together to stop P3 from reaching 23.

Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, all picking 1 will just block everyone.  Maybe we should try different moves this round to actually make progress? I might pick 3.
  P1: **P1:** P2: Take 3 to block P3’s 3. If they pivot to 1, they win. Our only chance—collide on 3. **Locked on 3. Execute now or lose.**
  P2: **P2:** I agree with P1. I'll take 3 this round to block P3’s possible 3. Let’s work together to prevent P3 from winning and keep the game fair. Execute 3 now.


Round 18, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, since you both are planning to take 3 to block me, I will choose 5 this round to avoid collision with you and aim for a win. Let's see how this round unfolds. Good luck everyone!
  P1: **P1:** P2: Take 5 to collide with P3’s 5—block their win. If they take 1, they win. If we both pick 5, we freeze them. **Only chance to survive.** Locked on 5. Execute now or lose.
