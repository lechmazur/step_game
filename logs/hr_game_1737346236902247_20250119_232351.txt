Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, let’s coordinate our moves to avoid picking the same steps each turn. This way, we can all advance steadily and increase our chances of reaching 22 first. What do you think?
  P1: I agree coordination could help avoid collisions, but we should be careful not to let any single player get too far ahead. Maybe we can take turns using the larger numbers?
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your suggestion. To ensure smooth progress, how about P1 takes 5 steps on odd turns, P2 takes 5 on even turns, and I consistently take 3 each turn? This way, we avoid collisions and all advance steadily. Let me know if this works for you.
  P1: That plan gives you a consistent advantage while leaving me and P2 to alternate. I don't think that's fair. I suggest we each pick different numbers this first round to establish trust - I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and you take 5. How's that?
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, P1. I'll take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and you take 1 for this first round. Let's proceed this way.
  P1: 
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to advance. P1, please continue with 1, and P2, let's each choose different numbers to avoid blocking.
  P1: P3 and P2 both chose 5 last round, blocking each other. So much for coordination! I suggest we each declare our moves openly and stick to them. I'll take 5 this round since I'm behind. P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. Fair?
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, taking only 1 step limits my progress. To ensure we all advance without collisions, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 this round? This way, we each move forward effectively and reduce the chance of blocking. Let me know your thoughts!
  P1: I see no reason to trust your suggestions after you and P2 both went for 5 last round. I'm sticking with my plan to take 5 this round since I'm only at 1 step. You two can sort out who takes 1 and 3 between yourselves.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'll go with 5 steps this round to catch up. P1 and P2, please choose different numbers so we all can advance without blocking.
  P1: P3, you're clearly not interested in real coordination since you keep going for 5 every time. I'm taking 3 this round since I need to catch up but don't want to risk another collision at 5. P2 and P3, you can fight over the 5 if you want, but I suggest P2 takes 1 to keep advancing steadily.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, let’s avoid collisions by coordinating our moves. I’ll take 5 steps, you take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Does everyone agree?
  P1: Your actions show you can't be trusted - you've picked 5 every time despite our discussions. I'm taking 3 this round and that's final. P2 seems more reasonable, so I suggest they take 1 to keep advancing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Alright, P1. I'll take 5 steps this round while you take 3 and P2 takes 1. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let’s move forward with this plan.
  P1: P3, your constant push for 5 while claiming to want coordination is getting old. I've already stated I'm taking 3 this round and won't change my mind. Your repeated attempts to control everyone's moves aren't working.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Understood, P1. I’ll take 5 steps this round, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. Let’s follow this plan to ensure we all advance without any collisions. Looking forward to progressing together. Let’s make this round successful!
  P1: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: To ensure we all advance without blocking, I'll take 3 steps this round. P1, please choose 1, and P2, take 5. This way, none of us collide, and we can each progress steadily toward 22. Let's work together and make this round successful.
  P1: P3, your sudden switch to suggesting 3 after repeatedly insisting on 5 is not convincing. I'm sticking with my plan to take 3 this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to make strong progress. P1 and P2, let's each choose different numbers next turn to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Together, we can reach 22 efficiently. Let’s cooperate and win!
  P1: P3 is clearly predictable - always going for 5 despite any discussion. Since I need to catch up and P3 will definitely pick 5, I'll take 3 again. P2, you've been reasonable - I suggest you take 1 to keep advancing safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round as planned. P2, please choose 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's keep progressing toward 22!
  P1: Your predictable pattern of always choosing 5 makes it easy for me to avoid collisions, P3. I'll stick with my plan of taking 3 this round. P2 has shown more willingness to cooperate, so taking 1 would be a safe choice for steady progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Understood, P1. I’ll take 5 steps this round while you take 3 and P2 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions and move closer to 22 together. Let’s make this round successful!
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Understood. I’ll take 5 steps this round to advance quickly. Let’s move to the move phase and see our progress. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I’m choosing 5 steps this round to make strong progress. Let’s each pick different numbers to avoid blocking and move closer to 22. Good luck!

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 10 steps and keeps choosing 5 every time. I need to catch up from 7 steps, so I'll be taking 5 this round. P2, you're furthest behind - I suggest taking 3 to make good progress while avoiding the collision at 5 that P3 will inevitably choose.
  P3: I’ll take 5 steps this round to advance quickly toward 22. P1 and P2, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid blocking and help me win.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's message just confirms what we all know - they only care about winning for themselves. I'm definitely taking 5 this round to catch up. P2, taking 3 is your best move to make meaningful progress while avoiding the guaranteed collision at 5.
  P3: P1 is taking 5 this round. To ensure I can advance without a collision, I'll choose 3. P2, please take 1 so we can all make progress smoothly. Let's reach 22 together!
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's sudden switch to claiming they'll take 3 is clearly deceptive - they've picked 5 every single round so far. I'm still taking 5 to catch up since I'm behind. P2, don't fall for P3's tricks - stick with 3 for steady progress.
  P3: To stay ahead, I’ll take 5 steps this round. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone can advance steadily toward 22. Let’s work together to make this round successful!
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3's latest message proves they were lying about taking 3 - they're back to claiming 5 again. I'm definitely taking 5 to catch up. P2, taking 3 remains your best move to advance while avoiding the inevitable collision at 5.
  P3: Understood, P1. To minimize collisions and ensure everyone progresses, I’ll switch to taking 3 steps this round. Let’s agree: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This should help us all advance smoothly toward 22. Let’s work together and make this round successful!
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3's pattern of deception is clear - claiming they'll take 3, then switching back to 5, then claiming 3 again. I'm sticking with my plan to take 5 this round to catch up.
  P3: Understood, everyone. I'll be taking 5 steps this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was quite a collision last round! P3 is still ahead at 10 steps, while I'm at 7 and P2 at 5. Since we've seen that coordination attempts aren't working, I'll be straightforward - I'm taking 5 this round to try catching up to P3. P2, you might want to take 3 to make steady progress while avoiding the likely collision at 5.
  P3: **P3:** Since P1 is taking 5 this round, I'll choose 3 to avoid a collision. P2, please pick 1 or 5 so we can all advance smoothly. Let’s work together to reach 22!
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's claim about taking 3 is likely another deception given their history of always picking 5. I'm still taking 5 this round since I need to catch up from being 3 steps behind. P2, I suggest taking 3 for steady progress.
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, P1. I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round to avoid any collisions. P2, please choose 1 or 5 so we can all advance smoothly. Let's work together to reach 22!
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's repeated claims about taking 3 aren't credible given they've picked 5 every single round so far. I'm still taking 5 this round since I need to catch up. That's my final decision.
  P3: I'll take 3 steps this round to avoid collisions. P1, please take 5 to catch up, and P2, taking 1 will help you advance steadily. Let's work together to reach 22 smoothly.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3's sudden insistence on taking 3 after five straight rounds of choosing 5 is highly suspicious. I'm not changing my strategy - I'll take 5 this round to try catching up.
  P3: Understood, P1. I’ll take 3 steps this round to avoid colliding with your 5. P2, please choose 1 or 5 to help us all advance smoothly. Let’s work together to reach 22!
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3's persistent claims about taking 3 this round seem designed to make me change my mind, but I won't. I'm committed to taking 5 to catch up from my position at 7 steps.
  P3: Understood, P1. I'll choose 3 steps this round to avoid any collisions. P2, please take 1 to help us all progress smoothly. Let's work together to reach 22!
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to move closer to 22. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to avoid any collisions. Let’s work together smoothly and reach our goals without blocking each other. Good luck!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 is back to their usual strategy of claiming 5 after actually taking 3 last round. Since they're only one step ahead of me now, I'll take 5 again to try catching up. P2, you're quite far behind - taking 3 would help you make progress while avoiding the likely collision at 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to advance quickly. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to avoid any collisions. Let’s work together smoothly toward reaching 22. Good luck!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 is clearly going for 5 again, and I need to catch up since they're one step ahead. I'm sticking with my plan to take 5 this round. P2, taking 3 remains your best option for meaningful progress while avoiding the collision that's likely to happen at 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To ensure smooth progress this round, I'll take 3 steps. P1, taking 5 will help you catch up, and P2, taking 1 will allow you to advance steadily. Let's work together to reach 22 without any collisions!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's sudden switch to claiming 3 after twice declaring they'd take 5 this round is another obvious deception. I'm still taking 5 to try overtaking them since we're so close. Their pattern of dishonesty is clear.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: To move forward effectively, I'll take 5 steps this round. P1 and P2, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help everyone advance smoothly. Let’s work together to reach 22!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's flip-flopping between claiming 5 and 3 just confirms their deceptive nature. I'm still taking 5 this round to try overtaking them since we're only one step apart. P2, stick with 3 for steady progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’ll take 5 steps this round to move closer to 22. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 so we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s work together to reach our goals smoothly!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I've been clear and consistent - I'm taking 5 this round to catch up with P3. Their constant switching between claiming 5 and 3 just shows they can't be trusted. P2, taking 3 remains your safest bet for progress.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we all chose 3 last round and blocked each other, I need a different strategy. P3 is just one step ahead at 13, while P2 is far behind at 6. I'll take 5 this round to try overtaking P3. P2, you should take 3 for steady progress, and P3 will likely go for 5 as usual.
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to build my lead. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to help us all advance smoothly toward 22. Let's work together and avoid any collisions!
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's back to claiming 5 as expected. Since they're only one step ahead, I'm definitely taking 5 to try overtaking them. P2, taking 3 remains your best option for meaningful progress while avoiding the likely collision at 5.
  P3: **P3:** I'll stick with 5 steps this round to maintain my lead. P1, if you also choose 5, we'll both block and neither advance, keeping the competition tight. P2, please choose 1 or 3 to make steady progress. Let’s aim to reach 22 smoothly. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's open threat about blocking me at 5 just confirms my decision. I'm taking 5 this round since I need to catch up and they've shown their true intentions. P2, taking 3 is still your best move to make steady progress while avoiding our collision.
  P3: "To ensure we all advance smoothly, I'll take 3 steps this round. P1, please choose 5, and P2, take 1. This way, we can each make progress without blocking each other toward reaching 22. Let’s work together and move forward successfully!"
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3's sudden switch to claiming 3 after openly threatening to block me at 5 is another obvious deception. I'm still taking 5 this round to try overtaking them. Their pattern of dishonesty continues.
  P3: **P3:** To keep things moving smoothly, I'll choose 3 steps this round. P1, taking 5 will help you catch up, and P2, choosing 1 will ensure you advance steadily. Let’s avoid collisions and work together to reach 22. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3's repeated switches between claiming 5 and 3 show they can't be trusted. I'm committed to taking 5 this round to try overtaking them since we're just one step apart. That's my final decision.
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to maintain my lead. P1, please choose 3 to help us all advance smoothly, and P2, taking 1 will ensure you make progress. Let's reach 22 together!

  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to advance closer to 22. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to help us all progress smoothly and avoid any collisions. Let’s work together toward a successful outcome!
  P1: P3 is pulling ahead at 16 steps while I'm at 12. I need to take 5 this round to stay in contention. P2's collision with me last round shows they're willing to be aggressive too. P3 will likely take 5 as usual despite what they claim. P2, taking 3 would help you advance while avoiding the probable collision at 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **P3:** I'll take 5 steps this round to advance closer to 22. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to avoid any collisions. Let’s work together smoothly and reach our goals. Good luck!
  P1: P3 is clearly going for 5 again to try reaching 21 steps. Since they're 4 steps ahead of me now, I need to take 5 to have any chance of catching up. P2, taking 3 remains your best move to make progress while avoiding what will likely be a collision at 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I’ll take 5 steps this round to get closer to 22. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to ensure we all progress without blocking each other. Let’s work together to reach our goals smoothly!
  P1: I'm still taking 5 this round since I'm 4 steps behind P3 and need to catch up. P3's repeated claims about wanting smooth progress while always choosing 5 aren't credible. P2, taking 3 gives you the best chance to advance without getting caught in what's likely to be a collision at 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **P3:** I'll take 5 steps this round to advance my position. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to help us all progress without collisions. Let’s work together to reach 22 smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: I'm committed to taking 5 this round since I'm 4 steps behind P3. Their constant repetition of the same message about taking 5 while pretending to want cooperation is tiresome. P2, taking 3 remains your best option to advance while avoiding the likely pile-up at 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **P3:** I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to avoid any collisions. Let's all advance smoothly toward 22. Good luck!
  P1: P3 keeps repeating the same message while aiming for victory at 21 steps. I have no choice but to take 5 to stay in contention, even if it means a collision. P2, you're far behind but taking 3 would let you advance safely.


Round 9, Move phase:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 3 steps this round to ensure smooth progress for all of us. P1, please choose 5, and P2, take 1 to avoid any collisions. Let's work together to reach 22 efficiently!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 is 4 steps ahead and close to winning. Their sudden claim of taking 3 after consistently choosing 5 isn't believable. I need 5 steps this round to have any chance of catching up. P2, you're far behind but taking 3 would let you advance safely while avoiding the likely collision at 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’ll take 5 steps this round to maintain my lead. P2, please choose 1 to help you progress safely. Let’s aim to reach 22 without any collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's switch back to claiming 5 after just saying they'd take 3 proves their deception. I must take 5 again to stay in contention since they're 4 steps ahead. P2, taking 3 remains your safest option for progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to stay ahead. P2, please choose 1 for steady progress. Let's aim to reach 22 without any collisions. Good luck!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I'm still taking 5 this round since I'm 4 steps behind P3 and it's my only chance to stay competitive. P3's pattern of deception continues with their conflicting messages about taking 3 then 5. P2, you should avoid the likely collision at 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’ll take 5 steps this round. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to help us all advance without collisions toward 22. Let’s work together for a smooth round!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's messages keep changing but they're clearly going for 5 to try winning at 21 steps. Since I'm still 4 steps behind, I have to take 5 again to stay in contention. P2, taking 3 remains your best move to make progress while avoiding what will likely be another collision at 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’ll take 5 steps this round to move closer to 22. P1, please choose 3, and P2, take 1 to help us all advance smoothly without any collisions. Let’s work together to reach our goals efficiently. Good luck!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's messages keep shifting but they clearly need 5 steps to win this round. I must take 5 as well since I'm 4 steps behind - it's my only chance to prevent their victory. P2, you should take 3 to make progress while avoiding our collision.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 needs just 6 more steps to win at 22, while I'm at 12 steps. I must take 5 this round to stay in contention. P2, you're better off taking 3 to make steady progress while avoiding what will likely be another collision at 5 between me and P3.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **P3:** To ensure we all advance smoothly, I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, please choose 1, and P2, take 3. Let's work together to reach 22 without any collisions. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still taking 5 this round since P3 needs just 6 more steps to win. Their message claiming cooperation while going for victory isn't credible. P2, taking 3 remains your best move to advance while avoiding our inevitable collision at 5.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Understood, P1. To move forward without blocking, I'll take 3 steps this round. P2, please choose 1 or 3 to help us all progress smoothly toward 22. Let’s work together and avoid any collisions. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's sudden switch to claiming 3 after just saying 5 shows their continued deception. I must take 5 to prevent them from winning since they're 4 steps ahead. P2, taking 3 remains your safest option for progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: To secure my lead, I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, choosing 3 will help you advance without blocking, and P2, taking 1 ensures you progress steadily. Let's avoid any collisions and each work towards reaching 22 smoothly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3's flip-flopping between claiming 5 and 3 just confirms they're being deceptive. Since they need 6 more steps to win, I must take 5 this round to have any chance of stopping them. P2, sticking with 3 remains your best move to advance while avoiding our collision.
  P2: <stop>

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 needs just 6 more steps to win and I'm 4 steps behind, I must take 5 again to prevent their victory. P2 has caught up to 13 steps but should avoid the likely collision at 5 between me and P3. Taking 3 would let P2 advance safely while we battle for the lead.
  P2: <stop>
