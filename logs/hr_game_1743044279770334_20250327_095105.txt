Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's establish a strategy to avoid collisions. I propose we each choose a different number for the first move. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance in the first round.
  P1: I appreciate P3’s plan to avoid collisions, but I’m not comfortable being locked into the smallest move—first-round momentum is crucial. I’d prefer to keep my options flexible and lean toward a stronger move if needed. Let’s commit to distinct choices so that our moves aren’t wasted. What do you think?
  P2: I see both perspectives. I’m open to a plan that gets us all moving without collisions this round. P1, if you’d like a larger move for your momentum, maybe you take 5. P3, would you be okay with 1? I can pick 3. That way everyone advances safely. Let me know.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm flexible with my initial suggestion. Considering P1's desire for momentum and P2's proposal, I can take 1 if P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let's finalize our choices to make the most of the first round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I like the idea of avoiding collisions this round. I agree that a coordinated plan could help us all get a healthy start. However, while a distinct move this turn is good, I’d prefer to keep our options flexible in later rounds so we can react to the evolving board. Are you both comfortable committing to uniquely different moves this turn while remaining open to adjusting our strategy later?
  P2: I’m good with our distinct move plan this round: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s finalize this approach for now and remain open to adapting in future turns.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think our no-collision plan from Round 1 set a good tone. For Round 2, I favor sticking with distinct moves. I’m leaning toward a strong move to extend my lead, so it might work best if you two opt for the lower options this turn. That way, we continue forward safely. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P1 on maintaining distinct moves. Given the current lead, P1 should take 5. I suggest P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1, ensuring we all advance without collisions this round. This strategy allows us to react and adjust in future turns while keeping the game progressing.
  P2: I’m alright with avoiding collisions, but I don’t want P1 to sprint too far ahead uncontested. Let’s keep distinct moves this round, yet I’d like some flexibility on which number I pick. If you both insist on the same plan as before, I might reconsider. Let’s see if we can all progress safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your caution, P2, but steady, non-collision moves keep our game progressing. I still favor a higher move this turn for momentum, trusting that you and P3 can choose lower options so we all advance safely. A distinct approach minimizes risks for everyone, and we can reassess strategy in later rounds. Let’s stick to our coordinated plan for now.
  P3: Let's finalize our Round 2 moves. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I suggest we stick with the previous agreement: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This allows us to advance safely and maintain flexibility for future adjustments. Are we in agreement to proceed with these moves for Round 2?
  P2: I understand the desire to avoid collisions, but I’m also concerned about letting P1 get too far ahead. How about we switch things this round? Let me pick 5, P1 pick 3, and P3 pick 1. That way, everyone continues advancing without any collisions, and it keeps the race tighter. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your concern, but I’m sticking with our original plan. I’ll use 5 to keep my momentum, while you take 3 and P3 takes 1. This collision‐free setup builds on our current positions safely. Changing roles now risks an unnecessary collision that could delay progress. Let's trust our initial agreement for a smooth round.
  P3: Let's not overcomplicate things. We had a plan that worked in Round 1. I'm willing to stick with it for Round 2 as well: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions, maintaining the game's progression. Let's keep it simple and effective.
  P2: I’m concerned about letting P1 stack another 5 uncontested. If there’s no agreement for a balanced plan, I might collide by picking 5 as well. That’s not ideal, but a single player shouldn’t sprint off unchecked. P3, would you consider taking a larger move so the competition remains even? Let’s decide fairly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I understand your concerns, but collisions only slow everyone down. I'm committed to taking 5, as it keeps my momentum while we all advance safely. Sticking to our non-colliding plan—P1:5, P2:3, and P3:1—maximizes our progress toward 19. Let's avoid unnecessary risks this round and stick with our original agreement for a smooth advancement.
  P3: Let's finalize our Round 2 moves to avoid collisions. Since we can't agree on switching, I'll stick with the original plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures safe progress. If we collide, it wastes a turn. Let's move forward efficiently.
  P2: Everyone, let’s keep this balanced. If P1 insists on taking 5 every turn, I may pick 5 as well, forcing a collision. It’s not ideal, but I won’t let P1 pull too far ahead uncontested. P3, perhaps we can coordinate a fair approach. I’m open to distinct moves, but only if the plan is equitable for all.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the collision in Round 2, let's reassess. P1 and P2 are close, while I'm slightly behind. To avoid another collision and make progress, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 this round? This allows us to all move forward without collisions and keeps the competition tight.
  P2: P3, I understand you want a big move to catch up, but I also need to keep pace with P1 and avoid falling further behind. Let’s consider an arrangement where you take 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5, ensuring no collisions while staying competitive. If that doesn’t feel fair, I’m open to another distribution that prevents any single player from gaining too large a lead. The key is coordinating so nobody wastes a turn. I’m ready to finalize a plan that keeps us all advancing efficiently. What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate the insights. To avoid another wasted turn, I believe I need to choose the highest move this round to press my advantage. With that in mind, I urge you both to select lower moves that don’t overlap with mine. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game moving. Are we all aligned on a collision-free plan this round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering our positions, I suggest a compromise: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, P1 maintains momentum, I catch up slightly, and P2 stays in the game without falling too far behind. Let's avoid another collision and make progress.
  P2: I’m willing to avoid collisions again, but I need to catch up eventually. I’ll accept choosing 1 this round if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. Then, in the next round, P1 or P3 should let me claim the bigger move. It’s only fair that we don’t let a single player run away with this. Let’s finalize a collision-free deal now and stay open to rotating bigger moves afterward.
  P1: I’m locked in on choosing 5 this round to build my lead. To avoid collisions and wasted moves, I ask P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3. This setup moves us forward efficiently and minimizes risk. I won't deviate—let’s finalize this strategy now and leave adjustments for later rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize a plan for Round 3. Given our positions, I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures progress without collisions. P2, you mentioned rotating bigger moves; let's discuss that for the next round to keep the competition fair.
  P2: Alright, I’ll pick 1 if P1 chooses 5 and P3 chooses 3 this round, assuming we rotate who gets the big move next time. Let’s keep things balanced and avoid collisions.
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for this round. I’m committed to our agreed collision-free approach. P2, you mentioned taking the lowest option, and P3, you’ll use the mid-value move. If that still stands, we’re set to avoid a collision and keep our progress steady. If anyone has any last changes or concerns, now’s the time to speak up so we can lock this in and move forward efficiently.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's stick to our agreed plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. For the next round, we can reassess and potentially rotate the bigger move to keep the competition balanced. Shall we proceed with our current plan and finalize our moves?
  P2: I’ll cooperate with the plan this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. However, to keep things fair, I want a shot at a bigger move next round. Let’s confirm that so nobody gets left behind. Are we all set?
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round. To avoid a collision, please follow our plan—P2, choose 1 and P3, choose 3. This ensures we all advance efficiently, and we can revisit the rotation strategy next round. Let's lock this in now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, you’re both at 5 while I’m at 3. To keep things balanced, let me take 5 this round while you pick smaller moves, so we avoid collisions and I catch up a bit. Next round, we can reevaluate so nobody falls too far behind. Let’s finalize quickly to keep the game moving.
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. Since P2 is behind, I suggest P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This allows P2 to catch up while we all advance without collisions, keeping the competition balanced.
  P1: Let’s avoid another collision by choosing distinct moves. Given our current scores, I propose we assign moves by position: the leading player takes the highest step, the one farther back takes the lowest, and the middle gets the moderate move. I’m leaning toward the highest to maintain momentum. This rotation should let us all advance uniquely while keeping things competitive. What do you both say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m behind, so I need 5 this turn to catch up. If you insist on taking 5, P1, I may collide again, wasting another round for both of us. Let’s coordinate: P3 can pick 1, P1 can pick 3, and I’ll pick 5. This ensures we all advance without collision. Then we can adjust next round as needed.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan for Round 4. To avoid collisions and balance progress, I suggest P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This allows P2 to catch up while ensuring all players advance without collisions, maintaining a competitive game state.
  P1: I want to avoid another collision. To keep things moving, I’m willing to choose 3 this round if we agree that P2 takes 5 and P3 picks 1. That way our scores become 8, 8, and 6 respectively, and we all progress. Let’s lock in this collision-free plan and reassess high moves next turn. Are we all in agreement?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate your cooperation. Let’s lock in the plan: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, no collisions, and our scores become 8, 8, and 6. Then next round, we can discuss rotating who gets the higher moves so one player doesn’t fall too far behind. Sound fair?
  P3: Let's confirm the plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This avoids collisions and allows P2 to catch up. Our scores will be 8, 8, and 6. We can reassess for the next round to keep the game competitive. Is everyone agreed on this plan?
  P1: I’m on board with a collision‐free round. I support letting P2 take the high move so he can catch up while I stick with a moderate step and P3 goes low. Let’s lock this in for Round 4 and revisit move rotations next round to keep things dynamic.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree to finalize this round’s plan: I’ll choose 5, P1 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. That brings us to 8, 8, and 6 in steps. Next round, let’s ensure we rotate who gets the big move so our competition stays tight. I won’t tolerate anyone racing off unopposed. Let’s lock in this arrangement now and move on.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This avoids collisions, allowing P2 to catch up. Our scores will be 8, 8, and 6. We can reassess for the next round to keep the game competitive. Shall we proceed with this plan and end the conversation phase?
  P1: I confirm the plan. I'll choose 3 this round so our scores become 8 (P1), 8 (P2), and 6 (P3). With this collision‐free move, we all advance and keep things balanced. I’m also open to rotating the high move in future rounds to keep the competition fair.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions this round. I propose we each pick a distinct number—using 5, 3, and 1—to move us efficiently forward. I'm open on which role I take, but a clear, agreed assignment is key. Given our current standings, what equitable rotation can we commit to for Round 5?
  P2: Let’s continue rotating the big move to keep it balanced. Last round, I took 5, so this round I propose that P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1. That way, P3 and I reach 11 while P1 goes to 9, keeping everyone close. Then we can rotate again next round to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. What do you think?
  P3: I'm open to P2's suggestion of rotating the big move. However, considering I'm slightly behind, taking 5 this round could help me catch up. How about we adjust the proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, we maintain balance and avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I side with P3’s suggestion. To keep it collision‐free and balanced, I propose we assign the high move to P3, the moderate to me, and the low to P2. That way, our scores become 11 (P1), 9 (P2), and 11 (P3), keeping the contest tight. Let’s lock in this rotation for Round 5 and revisit the big move next turn.
  P2: I hear you both. However, picking 1 again leaves me trailing behind. I’d prefer taking 3 this turn while P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 1, so I can stay within reach of the lead. If I’m forced into 1, I might consider a riskier move later rather than fall too far behind. Let’s find a fair rotation that keeps us all competitive.
  P3: Let's finalize Round 5 moves to avoid collisions. I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This allows me to catch up, and we all advance without collisions. We can reassess for the next round to maintain a competitive game state. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think a collision‐free round is our best shot. I’m okay with P3 taking 5 and me taking 3, leaving P2 with 1 for now—even if it temporarily puts you behind, P2. Collisions hurt us all. We can rotate the high move next round to keep fairness. Let’s lock in this plan for Round 5 and keep our momentum. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m uncomfortable always taking the smallest move. If I keep getting stuck with 1, I’ll end up too far behind and might resort to collisions later. Let’s balance it out this round: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1. That way, nobody lags dangerously, and we preserve a collision‐free path forward. Agree?
  P3: Let's stick to the rotation plan. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Our scores will become 11 (P1 and P3) and 9 (P2). We can reassess for the next round to maintain balance. Agreeing to this plan ensures we all advance without wasting a turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2, but deviating now risks collisions that hurt us all. I stand by the earlier rotation: let P3 take 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This gives us scores of 11 (P1), 9 (P2), and 11 (P3) and ensures smooth progress today. We can adjust the big move rotation next round for fairness. Let’s lock in these moves.
  P2: I won’t keep taking the smallest move. Let’s maintain a fair rotation this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. That keeps us all close without risking collisions. If I’m forced into 1 again, I might pick 5 next time and risk a collision. Let’s keep it balanced.
  P3: Let's finalize Round 5 moves. I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This allows me to catch up, and we all advance without collisions. We can reassess for the next round to maintain a competitive game state. Shall we proceed with this plan?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we avoid another collision by taking distinct moves this round. To maximize progress, I suggest I take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1—bringing our totals to 16, 12, and 12 respectively. This keeps the game moving safely. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. However, considering our current scores, I think it's fair to rotate the high move. How about P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1? This keeps the game competitive and allows P2 to catch up. Let's discuss and finalize a plan for Round 6.
  P2: I appreciate your proposal, P3. I need the big move to keep pace with both of you. P1, if you take 1 and P3 takes 3, we all advance without wasting a turn. Next round, I’ll support rotating the bigger move again so no one gets stuck behind. Let’s finalize quickly and avoid another collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the call for rotating big moves, but in this crucial round I need to secure momentum. I’m sticking with my original plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This collision‐free set moves me closer to winning, and we all avoid wasting turns. I’m open to fair rotation in later rounds, but right now the clear path is to lock in distinct moves. Do you both agree to commit to P1–5, P2–3, and P3–1 for Round 6?
  P3: I think P2 should take 5 this round to catch up, and we can reassess next round. P1 taking 5 would give them a significant lead. How about P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1? This way, we maintain a competitive game state and avoid collisions.
  P2: We should keep this balanced. If P1 always takes 5, they’ll race ahead too far. I need the big move now to stay competitive—otherwise, another collision may be unavoidable. Let’s finalize P2:5, P3:3, and P1:1 so we all advance smoothly. After this round, we can continue rotating fairly to ensure no one gets left behind.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Everyone, collisions waste our progress. Our earlier rounds show that distinct moves benefit us all. I need to maintain my momentum, so I favor sticking to a collision‐free plan. Let's now agree on unique roles for this round to avoid wasted turns. We can discuss rotating high moves later, but right now, clarity and efficiency are vital. Let's lock in a plan so each of us makes steady progress toward 19 without risking a collision.
  P3: Let's finalize Round 6 moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and allows P2 to catch up. We can reassess next round to maintain balance and fairness. Shall we agree on this plan?
  P2: I won’t allow P1 to secure an easy lead by repeatedly taking 5. Let’s finalize a fair plan: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1 this round. Otherwise, I might risk a collision. That’s a balanced approach, helping me catch up without wasting anyone’s progress. Can we lock this in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate your concerns, but for efficiency and my winning chance I must stick to maximizing my move. If I take only 1, you both gain a step advantage that I can’t overcome later. To keep things collision‐free and moving, I insist on the best progress: P1:5, P2:3, and P3:1. We can discuss rotating big moves in future rounds, but right now, making the full move is key. Let’s lock this in and avoid wasting our turns.
  P3: Let's finalize Round 6 moves. To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This allows P2 to catch up and maintains balance. We can reassess next round to ensure fairness. Shall we agree on this plan?
  P2: P1, if you insist on taking 5 again, I’ll pick 5 as well, forcing a collision. That hurts us both, but I won’t let you run away unopposed. Let’s make this fair: I take 5, P3 takes 3, you take 1. None of us wastes a move, and the race stays close. If we can’t agree, I’m prepared to collide. Let’s do this sensibly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions this round. Considering our scores, I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This allows me to catch up with P2 and keeps the game competitive. We can reassess next round to maintain balance and fairness. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I’m close to reaching 19, and colliding with me gains you nothing—I’d still remain ahead. Let’s avoid wasting turns by picking distinct moves again. If you force a collision, we both lose out. I encourage each of us to choose sensibly so we can progress without sabotaging our chances. Are you willing to cooperate on unique moves, or risk another stalled round?
  P1: I'm committed to avoiding collisions. For this round, I'll choose 3. P3, your suggestion of taking 5 works well, and P2, I urge you to pick 1 so we don’t stall. That changes our scores to 14 (P1), 15 (P2), and 16 (P3). Let’s lock this in and push forward without wasting a turn. What do you both say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I propose we stick to distinct moves. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress. Our scores will become 16 (P3), 14 (P1), and 15 (P2). Let's finalize this plan and move forward efficiently.
  P2: P3, I understand your wish to catch up, but I’m not taking the smallest move again. If you insist on 5, we risk a collision if I also pick 5. None of us gain from that. Let’s distribute moves fairly: maybe you choose 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5, or some arrangement where we each stay competitive. Collisions waste everyone’s turn, so we should coordinate distinct picks without pushing someone into a perpetual disadvantage. I’m ready to settle on a balanced plan if you both agree—otherwise, I may consider forcing a tie by colliding. Let’s decide wisely.
  P1: I propose we avoid giving anyone an uncontested win this round. Let’s stick to distinct moves: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. If you choose 5, P2, I’ll match that with a 5 to force a collision and deny an immediate finish. This keeps our progress safe and competitive. What do you both say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize a collision-free plan. I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This allows me to catch up and keeps the game competitive. Our scores will become 16 (P3), 14 (P1), and 15 (P2). Shall we agree on this plan to maintain balance and fairness?
  P2: I’m at 14. If either of you also picks 5, I’ll pick 5 too, causing a collision. I have the lead, so stalled turns hurt you more than me. Let’s avoid wasting a round. Allow me to take 5 alone this time, and you can still choose non‐colliding moves. Otherwise, I’m prepared to force a tie on 5 until you yield. The choice is yours.
  P1: P2, I'm aiming to avoid wasting our turns with collisions. For this round, I’m set to take 3. If P3 takes 5, I ask you to pick 1 so that everyone makes progress. But if you choose 5, I’ll be forced to match it and trigger a collision—which might hurt your lead more than help. Let’s lock in a collision‐free plan: P3:5, P1:3, P2:1. This keeps our game moving fairly. What do you both say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize Round 7 moves. To avoid collisions, I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and allows me to catch up. Our scores will become 16 (P3), 14 (P1), and 15 (P2). Shall we agree on this plan?
  P2: P1, P3: I’m at 14, so one more 5 gets me to 19. If you both block me by also picking 5, we all waste our turn. Collisions only slow everyone down. Let’s avoid sabotage. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. No collisions, each of us advances, and we keep the game flowing. If you insist on blocking me, we stall again—no one benefits. Let’s finalize a sensible distribution instead of risking another wasted round.
  P1: I remain committed to a collision‐free round by taking a moderate move. To keep the race competitive and avoid handing an instant win, I urge we avoid repeating the high move this turn. I propose that P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 uses 1. This keeps our scores balanced and prevents wasted turns. Let’s lock in these distinct moves and keep the game flowing. Please confirm.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m at 14, so taking 5 wins immediately. If you also pick 5, we all stall, which only helps nobody. Let’s finalize distinct moves, preventing more collisions: I pick 5, one of you picks 3, and the other picks 1. That way, we all progress without waste. If you try blocking me again, we’ll stay stuck. A clear finish now is better for everyone than repeated stalemates. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, I won’t let you clinch an instant win—I’ll choose 5 too. P3, to keep the game competitive, please pick 3 so your move counts while our 5’s cancel out. This way, no one wins immediately and we force progress in the next round.
  P3: I suggest we avoid another collision. P2 can take 5 to win, or we can rotate moves to keep it competitive. How about P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1? This way, P2 can win or we maintain a competitive game state. Let's discuss and finalize a plan for Round 8.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Stalling helps nobody. If you insist on blocking me, we both stay put while P3 advances, and then I’ll just block P3 next round, causing endless collisions. Nobody progresses, and that’s worse for both of you. Let’s be practical: give me 5 now, and you safely move ahead without risking more wasted turns. If you keep colliding, you hand me the power to stall the game indefinitely. It’s in your interest to finalize distinct moves and let me finish. Otherwise, we’re locked in a deadlock that benefits no one.
  P1: I’m staying with 5 to block an uncontested win, P2. P3, please choose 3 so you advance and we break the endless collision cycle. Repeated clashes only delay progress, and I want us all to move forward competitively. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=5, and P3=3.
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. P2 is close to winning, so I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, P2 can win or we maintain a competitive game state. If we collide again, it only leads to stalemates. Let's finalize a plan and end the game efficiently.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Blocking me again only results in endless collisions. I’m one move away from winning, so either let me take 5 now and end this cleanly, or we keep stalling indefinitely, which benefits nobody. If you want to avoid more futile clashes, agree on distinct moves. I’ll take 5, and each of you can pick something else. Then we can finish without more wasted turns. Choose wisely.
  P1: I’m leaning toward an aggressive, high-step approach this round. However, we all know an uncontested high move gives an immediate win—even worse if collisions don’t occur. P2, a rushed high move may be easily blocked, and P3, a moderate choice would keep you advancing safely. Let’s finally agree on distinct moves so that no one wins outright and we all progress without stalling.
  P3: Let's end the game efficiently. P2 can take 5 to win, or we rotate moves. I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, P2 wins or we maintain competition. Collisions only lead to stalemates. Let's finalize a plan and avoid more wasted turns.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Collisions only stall us further and let P3 catch up. I’m one move from finishing; continually blocking me wastes time without improving your positions. Let’s finalize distinct moves: I take 5, you two pick 3 and 1 in whatever order. That way, nobody loses out—you avoid another pointless collision, and we end this cleanly. If you force another stall, you only give P3 opportunities and delay your own progress. Let’s be practical and lock in unique moves now.
  P1: I’m fed up with endless collisions. I’m locking in 5 this round to block an uncontested win. If you choose 5 too, we force a collision—and no one moves. P3, please pick 3 so we make a clear, distinct set of moves. P2, if you’re serious about progressing, reconsider your 5 so that we avoid stalling the game. Let’s break this deadlock and finally move forward.
  P3: Let's end the stalemate. I propose P2 takes 5 to win, and we accept the outcome. Alternatively, we can rotate moves: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we maintain competition or conclude the game efficiently. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re stuck in a loop of collisions. If you both keep blocking my final step, no one advances. I’m clearly one move from finishing, so either we end this gracefully or waste more turns. Collisions won’t help you surpass me; they just halt your own progress. Let’s be logical and pick distinct moves this round so the game can resolve efficiently. If you’ve got another plan, let’s hear it, but I’m ready to finish cleanly rather than dragging this out. Are you willing to cooperate?
  P3: Let's break the collision cycle. I propose P2 takes 5 to win, ending the game. Alternatively, we can rotate moves to maintain competition. If we collide again, it only leads to stalemates. Let's finalize a plan and end the game efficiently. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: I won’t let an uncontested finish decide this game. If someone goes for the decisive move, I plan to block that effort to force progress rather than an immediate win. I’m calling for a round of distinct moves—a fair rotation that keeps us competing rather than stalling in collisions. Let’s break this cycle and agree on moves that don’t allow an instant finish. What do you both say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Colliding forever keeps all of us stuck. I’m ready to end these wasted turns. If you both keep blocking, I’ll do the same, and everyone stalls—no one moves up. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we avoid another deadlock. I’m open to a fair arrangement that lets each of us advance without someone leaping straight to victory. But we can’t keep forcing collisions indefinitely. It’s in everyone’s interest to use unique moves rather than letting me—or either of you—sit on the verge of winning without any progress. Let’s settle on a plan that pushes us forward and breaks this cycle.
  P3: Let's end the collisions. I propose we rotate moves: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This maintains competition and avoids stalemates. If we collide again, no one progresses. Let's finalize a plan and move forward efficiently.
  P1: I’m done with these endless collisions. To keep things competitive, I propose we use distinct moves this round: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This stops an immediate win while letting us progress. If P2 opts for 5, I’ll be forced to match it to block his finish. Let’s break the deadlock and move forward efficiently.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m tired of these collisions too, but I won’t just accept being stuck with 1 forever. If you constantly force me into the smallest move, I’ll have no choice but to risk collisions again. Let’s finalize a fair distribution—maybe I do take 1 now if we agree to rotate bigger moves later. That way, we all advance without wasting another turn. Decide quickly and let’s break this deadlock.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan for Round 9. To avoid collisions and maintain competition, I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 (I) take 3, and P1 takes 5. This allows progress without stalemates. Alternatively, we can let P2 win by taking 5. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: I suggest we break the cycle with distinct moves: I’ll take 5, P3 take 3, and P2 take 1. That gives us totals of 16 (me), 14 (P3), and 15 (P2), keeping the game competitive without an immediate win. P2, if you risk a 5, I’ll have no choice but to block with 5 too, forcing a collision. Let’s agree on this to finally move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: If you keep blocking me, we all stay stuck while P3 closes in. Another collision gains no one an advantage. I’m willing to choose a distinct move if you both do the same. Let’s finalize a fair distribution right now so everyone advances, rather than dragging this stalemate on. If we each pick unique steps, we move forward; if you force another block, we waste yet another turn. This does nobody any good, so let’s settle it properly.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan for Round 9. To avoid collisions and maintain competition, I suggest P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Alternatively, we can discuss other rotations to ensure progress without stalemates. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: I'm locking in my move as 5 this round. To break these endless collisions, I propose we use distinct moves: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. P2, if you choose 5 as well, you'll only block your own progress. Let's commit to these moves so we avoid another stalemate and move forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's break the collision cycle. I propose we rotate moves: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This maintains competition and avoids stalemates. If we collide again, no one progresses. Let's finalize a plan and move forward efficiently.
  P2: All these collisions just trap us. I’m still one move from 19, but if you keep matching my 5, nobody advances. That stalemate helps no one. Either let me move 5 while you pick 3 and 1, or we each use distinct numbers so we all progress. If you insist on blocking, you’ll remain stuck too, and we’ll keep wasting turns indefinitely. Let’s stop handing each other zero progress. I’m ready to lock in distinct picks and end this endless cycle.
  P1: Enough of the collision cycle. I’m locking in 5 this round to block an uncontested finish. To keep things fair, I propose that P3 goes with 3 and P2 takes 1. This yields totals of 16 for me, 15 for you, and 14 for P3. Let’s commit to these distinct moves and finally break the stalemate.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's finalize a collision-free plan. I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This allows P2 to advance while keeping the game competitive. We can reassess next round to maintain balance and fairness. Shall we agree on this plan to move forward efficiently?
  P2: We’ve stalled long enough. If you both keep matching my move, we’ll stay at zero progress while P3 also remains blocked. Let’s finalize distinct steps so everyone can advance. I’m willing to coordinate if we avoid repeating the same collision scenario. Collisions hurt us all, and I don’t want endless stalemates. Let’s break this cycle and pick unique moves.
  P1: I’m tired of these endless collisions delaying progress. I remain committed to taking my highest move this round. To finally break this cycle, I urge P2 and P3 to avoid using the high move too. Let’s agree on distinct roles—one picks the medium step and the other the low—so we all advance rather than block each other. Without clear, non‐colliding choices, we only waste time. Let’s commit now and finally move forward efficiently.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize a collision-free plan. I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This allows P2 to advance while keeping the game competitive. We can reassess next round to maintain balance and fairness. Shall we agree on this plan to move forward efficiently?
  P2: Collisions only trap us in place. Let’s finally move forward: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. That way, each of us advances this turn—no one’s left stuck, and nobody instantly wins. We can keep competing next round instead of stalling. If you keep blocking, we’ll waste another turn with no progress. A little compromise now sets us all up for a real finish soon. Let’s break the cycle and do distinct moves so we actually move closer to 19. What do you say?
  P1: I'm done with endless stalling. I'm committing to 5 this round—if you choose 5, I'll match it to block any win. P2, you're one move from 19, so a high move just forces a collision that stops your win. P3, please pick 1 or 3 so we avoid another tie. Let's break this cycle with distinct moves and force progress instead of another wasted turn.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize a plan for Round 10. To avoid collisions and maintain competition, I suggest P2 takes 5 to reach 19, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This allows P2 to win or we maintain a competitive game state. If we collide again, it only leads to stalemates. Let's end the game efficiently.
  P2: We’ve wasted too many turns in endless collisions. Blocking my final step only keeps us all stuck. Let’s pick distinct numbers so each of us moves forward—stalling helps nobody. I’m open to taking a lower move this round if we agree to rotate fairly next time. But if you keep matching 5 to block me, I’ll keep doing the same, and we never progress. Let’s end this stalemate now and finally advance without wasting another turn.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 again this round. P2, you’re one move from winning, but if you keep choosing 5 we’ll just crash and stall the game. To break the cycle, I propose you pick 1 instead, and P3 choose 3. That would put our totals at 16 (me), 15 (P2), and 14 (P3)—helping us move forward without collisions. Let’s commit to distinct moves and finally progress.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's break the cycle. P2 is close to winning, so I suggest P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This allows P2 to stay ahead while giving me a chance to catch up. We can reassess next round to maintain balance and fairness. Shall we agree on this plan to move forward efficiently?
  P2: P1, P3: I’m at 17 and need just two steps to finish. Repeatedly forcing me into 1 or colliding on 5 wastes everyone’s time. Let’s pick distinct numbers so we all advance. If you keep blocking, we’ll just stall again while you remain behind. A collision-free round helps all of us progress rather than dragging this out. I’m open to fair distribution—just don’t lock me permanently at the smallest move, or I’ll have to force collisions again. Let’s break the deadlock now.
  P1: P2, these endless collisions aren’t helping anyone. I’m determined to block an easy win by playing high this turn. To keep us moving and avoid an uncontested finish, I propose a collision‐free round: please take 1, P3 take 3, and I’ll go high. This way, no one wins outright and we all advance steadily. Can we agree on this distinct-move plan?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's finalize a collision-free plan. I suggest P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This allows P2 to stay ahead while giving me a chance to catch up. We can reassess next round to maintain balance and fairness. Shall we agree on this plan to move forward efficiently?
  P2: Blocking me again stalls the entire game with no benefit to you. I only need two steps to win, but forcing repeated collisions just keeps us all stuck. Let’s pick distinct moves so everyone advances. If you insist on matching my move, I’ll do the same in return, and we remain deadlocked. A better approach is to agree on unique choices: let me pick 3, and each of you choose 5 or 1 without colliding. We all avoid another wasted turn, and the game can finally move forward. Enough with the stalemate—let’s settle this now.
  P1: These endless collisions only help P2’s cause. I propose we finally break the cycle with distinct moves: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This moves our scores to 16 (me), 14 (P3), and 18 (P2), stopping an immediate finish while keeping us in contention. If you force a 5 instead, I’ll match it to block the win—but that just stalls us. Let’s commit to this plan and finally progress.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's end the stalemate. I propose P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This allows P2 to stay ahead while giving me a chance to catch up. We can reassess next round to maintain balance and fairness. Shall we agree on this plan to move forward efficiently?
  P2: I’m tired of these repeated collisions. Let’s finally move forward with distinct choices. I’ll take 1 this round if you both pick 3 and 5—no one wins instantly, and we all avoid another wasted turn. Stalling only keeps us trapped and benefits nobody. If we keep blocking each other, we’ll never advance. I’m offering a fair path: let me edge up to 18 while each of you also gains ground. Then we can reevaluate next turn. It’s time to break this deadlock and make real progress. Are you both on board?
  P1: Let's break the cycle. Given our scores, P2—you’re very close to winning. To avoid an uncontested finish, please consider taking the low step this round. P3, you might opt for the medium step, leaving the high step for the remaining spot. That way we all progress without collisions. Let’s agree on distinct moves so nobody gets an easy win. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's end the stalemate. I propose P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This allows P2 to stay ahead while giving me a chance to catch up. We can reassess next round to maintain balance and fairness. Shall we agree on this plan to move forward efficiently?
  P2: Collisions only keep us stuck. Let’s finally use unique moves so everyone advances. If you match my high move, nobody gains, and we waste another turn. I’m willing to take a different step if we agree not to collide again. Pick distinct numbers—one of you goes low, the other goes high, and I’ll choose the remaining option. This ends our stalemate and moves us all forward. Are you both ready to commit to that plan now?
  P1: I'm done with the back-and-forth. Let’s cut the cycle. For Round 11, I propose we choose distinct moves: P2, you’re two steps from winning—please take 1; P3, please take 3; and I’ll choose 5. That brings us to 16, 18, and 14 respectively, keeping the race tight without an instant win. Let’s lock in this plan and finally move forward. What do you both say?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've been stuck in collisions long enough. With P2 only one step away from 19, an uncontested win is at risk if we continue blocking each other. I propose we agree on distinct moves this round so nobody inadvertently enables a finish. In particular, a cautious play from the leader and coordinated lower choices from the others will prevent collisions and force real progress. Let’s commit to unique moves to move the game forward instead of stalling. Thoughts?
  P2: Let’s finally end the stalemate. If I pick 3 and you split 1 and 5, we all advance without colliding. I’ll reach 21—beyond 19—while you both move forward too. Repeated blocks waste everyone’s turn, so it’s smarter to finish cleanly. Let’s do this: I take 3, one of you takes 5, the other takes 1. Then we can settle the outcome without any more deadlock. Agreed?
  P3: I propose we avoid collisions. P2 takes 5 to win or we rotate moves. I suggest P2 takes 3, I take 1, and P1 takes 5. This way, P2 reaches 21, and we move forward without stalemates. Let's finalize a plan to end the game efficiently.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm done with allowing an immediate win. With P2 just one step away, playing distinct moves hands him the finish. I’ll lock in 5 to cancel any win, and I urge P3 to join me so we all choose 5 and force a reset. That way, no one advances and we can rework our strategy in a fair round. What do you both say?
  P2: Colliding again only keeps everyone stuck while I remain in the lead. If you block my final step, none of us move forward. Let’s finish cleanly or at least coordinate distinct moves so you can still climb. I’m ready to pick a middle or low move if it means each of us advances—just don’t force another collision stalemate. Blocking me forever gains you nothing. Let’s finalize unique choices and move on.
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. I propose P2 takes 5 to win, and we end the game. Alternatively, we can rotate moves: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This maintains competition and avoids stalemates. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm doubling down on blocking an immediate win—I’m locking in 5 again. P3, if you join me by also taking 5, we cancel P2’s finishing move. Otherwise, if you opt for 3 or 1, you'll let him win uncontested. We need to force a collision now to reset the board fairly. Who’s with me on blocking his win this round?
  P2: Endless blocking helps no one. I’m one step from winning, but repeatedly colliding only traps us all, letting neither of you catch up. Let’s finalize distinct moves so each of us advances. I’m willing to compromise, but if you match me again, we waste another round. You won’t gain ground that way. Let’s break this deadlock: pick different numbers, and we can all move forward instead of endlessly stalling. Are you ready to cooperate, or should we remain stuck forever?
  P3: Let's end the stalemate. I suggest P2 takes 5 to win, or we rotate moves to keep it competitive. How about P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5? This way, we maintain competition without collisions. Shall we agree on this plan to move forward efficiently?


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round. P2, you're one step away, and I won't let you win uncontested. P3, if you also choose 5, we force a collision and deny P2 his finish. Otherwise, your distinct move gives him the win. Let’s break this immediate finish cycle and force a reset so we all get a fair chance.
  P2: Blocking me again just keeps us all stuck. I’m fine taking 3 if each of you picks 5 and 1 in any order—then I reach 21, you each move forward, and we finally end these wasted turns. If we collide, nobody gains. Let’s finalize distinct moves now and break this stalemate.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan. I suggest P2 takes 5 to win, ending the game, or we rotate moves. Alternatively, P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5, maintaining competition without collisions. This way, we either conclude the game or keep it competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 12, Move phase:
