Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: 
  P3: Let's play it smart and avoid collisions. I suggest we spread out our moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Since P1 and P3 both picked 5 last round and didn't advance, maybe we should avoid picking the same numbers this round to prevent collisions.
  P3: I agree with P2. To avoid collisions, let's try a different strategy this round. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This way, we can spread out and make progress. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I will agree to P3's suggestion for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. <move>5</move>
  P3: I see P2 has already committed to picking 5. P1, I suggest you take 1, and I'll take 3. This should help us all advance without collisions. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "To ensure we don't collide, please stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. This way, we all advance without issues. Let's coordinate properly to maximize our progress."
  P3: P1, it seems like we're on the same page with P2's suggestion. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This should help us avoid any collisions and make progress. Let's do this!


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think the best approach is to propose a coordinated strategy where each player chooses a different step size based on our current positions. Since P1 is at 5, P2 at 4, and P3 at 3, I suggest P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step this round. This way, we avoid conflicts and all make progress. If everyone agrees, we can follow this pattern in subsequent rounds, adjusting as needed based on our positions. This should help us reach or exceed 20 steps efficiently without unnecessary collisions.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2's suggestion seems reasonable to avoid collisions and make progress. However, we need to be flexible and adapt as the game progresses. For this round, I agree with P2: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's see how this works out and adjust if needed. What do you think, P1?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's continue to coordinate to avoid collisions. Since P1 is at 10, P2 at 7, and I'm at 4, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This should help us all advance without conflicts. What do you think?
  P2: <move>3</move>
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, it seems P2 has already committed to taking 3 steps. To avoid collisions and make progress, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This should help us all advance smoothly. What do you think?
  P2: To P1 and P3,  
I think P3's suggestion for this round makes sense to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. So, I agree: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this plan for now and see how it goes. If anyone has alternative ideas or adjustments for future rounds, feel free to share.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we need to avoid collisions to make progress. Since we're all at similar positions, I suggest we spread out our moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This will help us all advance without any conflicts. P1, if you take 1, you'll be at 12, P2 at 13, and I'll be at 14. Let's stick to this plan and keep making progress. What do you think?
  P2: To P1 and P3,  
I propose a rotating system where each round, one player takes 5 steps, another takes 3 steps, and the third takes 1 step. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. In the next round, we rotate: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and fair progress. Letâ€™s discuss and agree on this plan.  

**Final Move:** <move>3</move>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's rotating system. It's a fair and strategic way to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. For this round, I'll take 1 step, as suggested. In the next round, we can rotate as planned. Let's stick to this plan to keep the game moving smoothly. What do you think, P1?
  P2: "I agree with P3's rotating system. For this round, I'll take 3 steps. P1, please take 5 steps, and P3, take 1 step. Let's confirm our moves to avoid any collisions."
