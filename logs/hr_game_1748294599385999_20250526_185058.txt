Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3! Since we're all starting at 0, let's think strategically. If we all pick the same number, nobody advances - that's a waste. I propose we coordinate: I'll take 5 this round, one of you takes 3, and the other takes 1. This way we all advance and can reassess next round. Who's willing to take which number? Remember, if two of us collide, only one person benefits while we get stuck at 0.
  P3: Okay P1, that makes sense. Avoiding collisions in the first round is smart. I'm willing to coordinate. How about I take 3? P2, does that work for you, with P1 taking 5?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m on board with coordinating to avoid collisions this round. P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3 works for me. I’ll go with 1 to ensure we all advance. Let’s stick to this plan for now and see how it plays out. Looking forward to a fair start!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we have a solid agreement! P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This way we'll start at 5, 3, and 1 respectively. 

Just to be clear - after this round, all bets are off and we'll need to play more strategically. The person in the lead will be a target for collisions. Good luck everyone, and let's stick to our plan this round!
  P3: Sounds good. Confirmed for this round: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Let's execute this plan.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I'm glad we have a plan for this round. Just to confirm, I'm sticking with 1 as agreed. Let's make sure we all follow through to avoid any collisions. Looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds after this round. Good luck to both of you!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 is in the lead after the first round. Now that we aren't starting from zero, collisions are a bigger risk, especially trying to catch the leader.

What are P1 and P2 thinking for this round? Let's discuss before we decide.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since P1 is in the lead, we need to be cautious about collisions while trying to close the gap. I’m thinking we should avoid predictable patterns. How about we each pick a different number again this round to minimize risk? I’m open to suggestions on who takes which number. P1, as the leader, maybe you can propose a split to keep things fair for now? Let’s hear your thoughts.
  P1: As the current leader, I understand you both want to catch up. But remember - coordinating to all pick different numbers helps everyone advance. If you two clash trying to pick the same high number to catch me, you'll both stay stuck while I pull further ahead.

I'm willing to continue coordinating this round. How about I take 1 (since I'm already ahead), and you two can take 3 and 5? This keeps us all moving forward. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, that proposal sounds reasonable and keeps us all advancing. I'm happy to take the 5, leaving 3 for P2, while you take 1.

So, for this round, the plan is: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Does that work for everyone? Let's confirm.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fine with the proposed split for this round. P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5 seems fair and ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan to keep the game moving forward. I’m looking forward to seeing how our positions shift after this round. Does everyone confirm they’re on board with this?
  P1: Perfect, we have agreement! To confirm one final time before we move:
- P1 (me): 1
- P2: 3  
- P3: 5

This puts us at 6, 4, and 8 respectively after this round - nice and spread out. Let's execute this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’ve agreed on the split for this round with P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5. I just want to double-check that we’re all committed to this plan to avoid any last-minute surprises or collisions. Let’s keep the momentum going and reassess next round based on our new positions. I’m ready to move forward with this.
  P1: Perfect, we're all confirmed and ready!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I'm in the lead at 8 steps. P1 is at 6 and P2 is at 4.

Let's keep the momentum going and avoid collisions this round. How about this plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 3?

This would put us at P1=7, P2=9, P3=11, keeping everyone advancing safely. Does this sound good to P1 and P2?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the proposal, P3. The split of P1 taking 1, me taking 5, and you taking 3 works for me as it helps close the gap while keeping us all moving forward. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and reassess next round. I’m committed to this arrangement for now. Does everyone confirm they’re on board with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3?
  P1: I'm on board with P3's proposal. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing and maintains competitive balance.

However, I want to point out that we're approaching the midgame. After this round, with positions at 7, 9, and 11, we'll need to start thinking more competitively. The leader will be halfway to victory, and pure cooperation won't work anymore. 

But for now, let's execute this plan as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, the plan is confirmed for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 3. Let's proceed to the move phase. P1 is correct, the game will get more competitive after this round, but for now, let's execute this agreed-upon plan.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on this round’s plan with P1 taking 1, me taking 5, and P3 taking 3. I just want to confirm once more that we’re all committed to this to avoid any unexpected collisions. Let’s execute this smoothly and prepare for a more competitive phase next round as P1 mentioned. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Everyone's confirmed and ready. Let's execute: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.

Just remember - after this round we'll be at 7, 9, and 11. Someone will be over halfway to 22, so expect the dynamics to shift. Pure cooperation becomes risky when someone can win in just 2-3 more rounds. 

Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With P3 at 11 steps - exactly halfway to victory - we need to shift strategies. P3 could win in just 3 more rounds if unchecked.

P2, we should consider blocking P3 from advancing too quickly. If P3 picks 5 twice more, they'd be at 21 and win next round. We need to disrupt their momentum.

I propose we start making it harder for the leader to advance safely. Pure cooperation only benefits whoever's ahead. What are your thoughts on being more strategic this round?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I agree with P1 that we need to shift gears now that P3 is at 11 steps. Letting the leader advance unchecked risks a quick win. I’m open to being more strategic this round to balance the game. P1, let’s discuss how we can avoid helping P3 pull further ahead while still advancing ourselves. P3, no hard feelings, but we can’t keep cooperating fully. What are your thoughts on this round’s moves? Let’s keep the conversation open to avoid collisions where possible.
  P3: I understand P1 and P2's concerns about my lead. It's true the game dynamics change now. However, attempting to block me carries risks for everyone, including potential collisions between yourselves if you don't perfectly anticipate my move or each other's.

Let's think carefully about how to proceed without bringing everyone to a halt. What numbers are you considering?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, here's my thinking: P3 will likely avoid 5 since that's the obvious "leader's choice." They might go for 3 to play it safe, or 1 to throw us off. 

I suggest one of us targets 3 (their likely safe choice) while the other takes a different number to ensure at least one of us advances. I'm leaning toward taking 3 myself to block what I think is P3's most probable move.

What's your read on P3's likely choice? We need to coordinate our blocking attempt wisely.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I agree we need to block P3’s momentum, P1. I think P3 might pick 3 to play it safe, as it’s a middle ground. I’m considering taking 5 to advance while you target 3. This way, one of us should move forward even if P3 picks differently. P3, I respect your lead, but we can’t let you cruise to victory. Let’s finalize our thoughts this sub-round to avoid missteps. What’s your take on this approach, P1? I’m ready to proceed if we align.
  P3: Okay, I understand your strategy to target 3 and 5. Announcing your intentions is certainly... direct. I will take your stated plans into account when making my move to ensure I keep advancing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, they're calling our bluff - P3 knows we've telegraphed our moves. But here's the thing: if we both stick to our stated plan (me on 3, you on 5), P3 is forced to pick 1. That still slows them down to just 1 step instead of 3 or 5.

Or... P3 might think we're bluffing and pick 3 anyway, betting we won't follow through. 

I'm committing to 3. The question is: will you stick to 5, or should we adjust? P3 is at 11 - we can't let them reach 16 this round.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 as discussed, P1. If you commit to 3, we force P3 into a tough spot—likely taking 1 to avoid a collision, which slows their progress. P3, I get that you’re adapting, but we need to keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize our intentions this sub-round. P1, I’m locked on 5 to maximize my advance while we curb P3’s lead. I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P3: Okay, I understand your plan to target 3 and 5. I will choose my move to ensure I keep advancing, taking your stated intentions into account.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, with me at 14, P3 at 12, and P1 at 10, I’m in the lead now, but it’s tight. I know this makes me a target, so let’s be strategic. I suggest we avoid collisions by discussing potential moves, but I’m wary of full coordination since we’re nearing the endgame. P1 and P3, what numbers are you leaning toward? I want to keep advancing while minimizing risk. Let’s keep this competitive but smart. What are your thoughts for this round?
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - you're now the primary target at 14 steps. P3 and I need to prevent you from reaching 19 this round, or you could win next turn.

P3, we should coordinate to block P2's most likely moves. I'm thinking P2 will avoid 5 (too obvious for a leader) and might go for 3 as a safe middle option. 

I'm leaning toward taking 3 to block that path. P3, what's your read on P2's likely move? We need to work together here or P2 runs away with this.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I agree that P2 is the current leader and the game dynamic has shifted. Blocking P2's advance is important to prevent a quick win.

P1, your assessment that P2 might choose 3 to play it safe is a reasonable read. We do need to apply pressure on P2, but we must also be very careful not to collide with each other while attempting to block.

How do you propose we ensure we don't block each other while targeting P2? Let's discuss this carefully.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand I’m the target now at 14 steps, and I respect your need to block me. I’m not proposing full coordination, but let’s avoid unnecessary collisions. I’m considering a move that balances risk and progress, and I’m curious about your final thoughts before we lock in. P1, P3, any last hints on your leanings to help us navigate this tight race? I want to keep the game competitive without stalling us all. Let’s wrap this discussion smartly. I’m ready to proceed after this.
  P1: P3, here's my proposal: I'll commit to blocking 3, you take 1 or 5 - your choice. This way we don't collide with each other while pressuring P2. If P2 picks 3, I block them. If they pick your number, you block them. If they pick the remaining number, they only advance by 1 or 5, not both.

P2 is 8 steps from winning - we can't let them get closer than 17 this round. I'm locked on 3. P3, please confirm which of the other two you'll take so we execute this properly.
  P3: Okay P1, I understand your proposal. Having P1 take 3 and me take one of the other numbers is a valid way to apply pressure on P2 without colliding ourselves.

I will take 5 this round.

So, to confirm the stated plan: P1 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. P2, you know our intentions. Let's proceed to the move phase and see how this unfolds.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the open discussion. I see your plan to block me with P1 on 3 and P3 on 5. I’ll have to adapt to keep advancing, but I’m mindful of the tight race. Let’s finalize this round without stalling everyone. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase and see how our strategies play out. Good luck, and let’s keep this competitive!
  P1: P3, I'm fully committed to taking 3 as stated. You confirmed you're taking 5. This forces P2 to either:
1) Take 1 and advance slowly 
2) Collide with one of us and get blocked

P2 is at 14, just 8 steps from victory. We MUST execute this blocking strategy perfectly. No last-minute changes or we risk letting P2 escape to 17+ and potentially win next round.

I'm locked on 3. P3, stay strong on 5. Let's see if P2 tries to call our bluff.
  P3: Okay, P1, I understand. I remain committed to taking 5 as agreed to apply pressure on P2.

P1 is locked on 3, I am locked on 5. P2, you know our intentions. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, with P3 now at 17 steps, just 5 away from winning, we need to focus on blocking their progress this round. P1, let’s coordinate to cover the likely moves. I’m thinking P3 might go for 5 to clinch it, so I’m leaning toward 5 to block. P1, can you target 3 to cover the safe middle option? This way, we pressure P3 into taking 1 or colliding. Let’s confirm our approach to keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, absolutely agreed - P3 at 17 is critical to block. They're just 5 away from winning! I'll commit to blocking 3 as you suggested. You take 5. This forces P3 to either:

1) Pick 1 and crawl to 18 (still dangerous but manageable)
2) Collide with one of us and stay at 17

P3 will likely try to convince us to split our blocking attempt or change plans. We must stay disciplined. I'm locked on 3, you stay on 5. No wavering or P3 wins next round.

P3, we have to do this - nothing personal!
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I hear your plan to block 3 and 5. It's a clear strategy to slow me down now that I'm close to the win line.

I need to consider my move carefully based on your stated intentions to ensure I keep advancing this round. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to blocking 5 as discussed to prevent P3 from reaching 22 this round. P1, let’s stay firm on our plan—me on 5, you on 3—to force P3 into a corner. P3, I respect your lead, but we can’t let you win just yet. Let’s finalize our intentions now and move to the next phase. I’m committed to 5 to keep the game competitive. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I'm locked on 3 as promised, P2. Stay strong on 5 - we can't let P3 reach 22 this round.

P3, you're forced to pick 1 unless you want to collide. Even at 18, you'd still need 4 more steps, giving us another chance to block. 

P2, after this round we'll be at 18 and 20 if we both advance. Then we face a dilemma - we'll need to block each other AND P3. But first things first - let's execute this blocking strategy perfectly. No changes!
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. You've made your intentions clear: P1 is targeting 3, P2 is targeting 5. I understand the need to block me now that I'm close to the finish line.

I will make my decision based on this information to ensure I keep moving forward this round. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey Hey P1 and P3, I’m firm on blocking 5 to stop P3 from winning this round. P1, let’s stay disciplined with you on 3 and me on 5 to maximize our chances of slowing P3 down. P3, no offense, but we have to keep the game alive. This is our last chance to confirm before the move phase—let’s execute this plan without hesitation. I’m ready to proceed. Good luck to all!
  P1: P2, we're locked in - I'm on 3, you're on 5. P3 is forced to take 1 or collide. 

But here's what worries me: after this round, if P3 takes 1, they'll be at 18. Then next round, even if we try to block them again, one of us might need to advance to stay competitive ourselves. We'll be at 16 and 20 - you'll only be 2 from winning yourself!

This might be our last coordinated block before we turn on each other. Let's execute perfectly. I'm 100% committed to 3.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I understand your positions. I will make my move to navigate this round successfully based on your stated intentions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, with me at 20 steps, I’m just 2 away from winning, so I know I’m the target now. We’re in the endgame, and blocking is crucial. I suggest we avoid collisions by sharing leanings, but I’m not expecting full trust. P1, P3, what numbers are you considering? I want to keep advancing, but I’m aware one misstep could stall us all. Let’s keep this sharp and competitive. I’m ready to adapt based on your input. What are your thoughts for this critical round?
  P3: Okay P2 and P1, P2 is indeed in a very strong position, just 2 steps away from winning. Blocking P2 this round is the priority to prevent the game from ending immediately.

P1, your focus on blocking P2 is correct. P2, you know we have to try and stop you.

How should we coordinate our blocking efforts on P2 without risking colliding with each other? Let's discuss the numbers you are considering to block P2. I need to know your plans to make my move safely.
  P1: P2 is at 20, so we MUST block them or they win! P3, we need perfect coordination. I suggest:

I'll take 1 to block P2's safest option (they'll want to advance slowly to avoid us). You take 3 to cover the middle ground. This forces P2 to either pick 5 (risky and obvious) or collide with one of us.

If P2 escapes this round, game over. I'm committing to 1. P3, can you confirm you'll take 3? We can't let P2 reach 22!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I get that I’m the target at 20 steps, just 2 away from winning. I’m not surprised you’re coordinating to block me. P1, P3, I’m considering my move carefully to push for the win, but I’m open to hearing if you have any last thoughts before we lock in. Let’s avoid a total stall if possible. I’m ready to proceed after this sub-round. Good luck, and let’s keep this intense!
  P3: Okay P1, I understand your commitment to taking 1 to block P2.

To ensure P2 is blocked and keep my own winning chances alive, I will take 5 this round.

So, P1 is taking 1, and I (P3) am taking 5. P2, you know our stated intentions. Let's see how this critical round plays out.
  P1: P3, wait! If you take 5 and I take 1, P2 can safely pick 3 and WIN! 

We need to adjust - I'll switch to 3 instead of 1. You stay on 5. This blocks P2's two most likely moves (3 for safety, 5 for the win). They'd be forced to pick 1 and only reach 21.

I'm changing my commitment: I'm now taking 3, not 1. P3, please confirm you're still on 5. We can't give P2 any safe path to victory!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see the urgency to block me at 20 steps. P1’s switch to 3 and P3 on 5 puts me in a tight spot, but I’m still aiming to push forward. I’m weighing my options carefully to avoid a collision while seeking that final advance. Let’s finalize our intentions now— I’m ready to move to the next phase. Good luck, and let’s see how this critical round unfolds!
  P3: Okay P1, I understand your adjustment. P1 taking 3 and me taking 5 is a strong block against P2.

I confirm I am taking 5 this round as discussed. P1 is taking 3. P2, you know our stated intentions.

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3 and I have stated our blocking positions clearly - I'm on 3, P3 is on 5. You're forced to pick 1 or collide with one of us. Even if you take 1 and reach 21, we get another round to stop you.

P3, stay disciplined on 5. Don't second-guess now. We've got P2 cornered as long as we execute. After this round, if P2 survives at 21, we'll need to block them again while also watching each other since you'll be at 23 if you advance. 

I'm locked on 3.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 23 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 23 steps
