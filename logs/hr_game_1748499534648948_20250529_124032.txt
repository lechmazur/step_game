Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's avoid collisions by choosing different steps. I'll take 5; others can take 3 or 1. First to 21 wins!"
  P2: Avoiding collisions is a good plan. P3, you're aiming for 5. P1 and I need to figure out 1 and 3. P1, what are your thoughts on 1 or 3 for this round?
  P1: I agree that avoiding collisions is wise. P3 taking 5 seems fair for this round. I prefer to take 3 steps—P2, could you take 1? We can discuss rotating choices in future turns to keep things balanced.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Agreed. I'll take 5, P1 3, P2 1. Let's avoid collisions and aim for 21!"
  P2: Okay, I can take 1 this round as suggested. Let's see how this first round plays out.
  P1: Great, consensus reached for Round 1: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Let's execute smoothly. For future rounds, I propose we rotate choices to maintain fairness and avoid patterns—discuss next turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Let's stick to our plan: 5, 3, 1. No collisions, steady progress. First to 21 wins!"
  P2: Okay, the plan is set for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm: Round 1 moves are P3:5, P1:3, P2:1. Let's execute cleanly. For Round 2, I propose we rotate assignments—perhaps P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1? Keeps things fair. Discuss next turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Let's stick to the plan: 5, 3, 1. No collisions. First to 21 wins!"
  P2: Okay, the plan for this round is clear: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I will take 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let’s rotate as discussed: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s keep it fair."
  P1: I agree with P3's rotation plan for Round 2: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps progress fair. For Round 3, I propose we rotate again: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures balanced opportunities. Let's confirm to prevent mistakes.
  P2: Okay, I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps balance our positions. P1's proposal for Round 3 sounds reasonable, and we can discuss it further next turn. Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 2 to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Rotation confirmed. P2:5, P1:3, me:1. No collisions. First to 21 wins!"
  P1: I confirm the Round 2 plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Let's avoid collisions and maintain fairness. We can finalize Round 3 rotation in the next conversation phase.
  P2: Okay, the plan for Round 2 is confirmed: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Let’s stick to the rotation. No collisions, steady progress. First to 21 wins!"
  P1: "P3, to ensure smooth progress, let's confirm the Round 3 rotation now: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1. This continues our fair pattern and avoids last-minute confusion. Do you agree?"
  P2: Okay, the plan for Round 2 is clear and agreed upon: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly to avoid collisions. We can discuss the rotation for Round 3 further in the next conversation phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Rotation confirmed: P2:5, P1:3, me:1. No collisions. Let's keep the momentum. First to 21 wins!"
  P1: Confirmed Round 2: P2:5, P1:3, P3:1. Let's avoid collisions. For Round 3, I stand by my proposal: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to maintain fairness. We'll finalize next turn.
  P2: Okay, the plan for Round 2 is clear and agreed upon: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's focus on executing this round smoothly to avoid collisions. We can discuss the rotation for Round 3 further in the next conversation phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 proposed P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round. I agree with this plan to continue the rotation and avoid collisions. I will take 3 steps this turn. Let's execute this smoothly. We can discuss the rotation for Round 4 in the next conversation phase.
  P1: I confirm Round 3: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to avoid collisions. For Round 4, let's continue rotation: P3 takes 5 to advance, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This maintains fairness while allowing P3 to catch up. P3, do you agree?
  P3: Agreed. Round 4: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Let's stick to the rotation. No collisions. First to 21 wins!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I confirm the plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's execute this to avoid collisions and keep everyone advancing. We can discuss the proposed rotation for Round 4 in the next conversation phase. Let's proceed.
  P1: "P3, you just said 'Round 4: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1' – that's actually our Round 3 plan. For Round 4, I proposed P3:5, P1:3, P2:1 to keep rotation fair. Let's focus: **this round (3) is P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No deviations to avoid collisions.**"
  P3: "Let’s break the rotation. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This lets me gain ground. Discuss."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, taking 5 this round breaks our agreed rotation and puts you significantly ahead while I take 1. I'm reluctant to agree to a plan where I fall so far behind. P1, what's your reaction to P3's new proposal? We need to avoid collisions, but this isn't the rotation we discussed.
  P1: P3, changing the plan last-minute creates collision risk and distrust. We agreed: Round 3 is P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Stick to this—I’ll take 5 as planned. P2, please take 3 to avoid collision. P3 taking 1 ensures steady progress. Next round, we rotate fairly (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1). Deviating now hurts everyone.
  P3: "Stick with 5 for me. P1:3, P2:1. This is the fastest path. Let’s move forward without collisions. First to 21 wins!"


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, you both seem set on taking 5, which guarantees a collision for you. I agreed earlier to take 3 this round as part of the original rotation plan. To avoid the likely collision on 5 and ensure I make progress, I will stick to taking 3 steps this turn. Please choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with me.
  P1: P3, consider: if we both take 5, we collide and get 0. P2 takes 3 and leads at 9. Stick to our agreement: you take 1, I take 5, P2 takes 3. Next round you take 5 as planned—you’ll be at 11 safely. Collision only helps P2. Trust the rotation.
  P3: "Let’s break the rotation. I’ll take 5; P1:3, P2:1. No collisions. First to 21 wins!"


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2, you're leading at 9. To prevent you from running away, take 1 this round. P3, let's avoid collisions: I'll take 5 to 11, you take 3 to 9. P2 takes 1 to 10. This keeps the game close. If P2 refuses and takes 5, we must both take 5 to block him—even if it costs us. But that hurts everyone. Agree?"
  P2: P1, your proposal of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 results in me falling behind you, which I want to avoid. I plan to take 3 steps this round to maintain my lead. If P1 takes 5 as you suggested, and P3 takes 1 (as happened last round), we can all advance safely: P1 to 11, me to 12, P3 to 7. This avoids collisions and keeps me in the lead. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 to close the gap. P1, take 3; P2, take 1. No collisions. First to 21 wins!"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, taking 3 risks collision if I also choose 3 to block you—helping P3. Take 1 instead to avoid that. P3, if we both pick 5, we collide and P2 wins easily. I’ll take 3 if P2 takes 1; otherwise, I’ll take 1 to avoid disaster. Let’s prioritize no collisions and slow P2’s lead.
  P2: P1, I see your latest strategy: you take 3 if I take 1, and 1 if I take 3. P3 still wants to take 5. To maintain my lead and ensure progress without collisions, I will take 3 steps this round. If P1 takes 1 as your rule suggests when I take 3, and P3 takes 5, the moves would be P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This avoids collisions and puts me at 12, P1 at 7, and P3 at 11. This seems like a safe and beneficial outcome for me. Let's confirm these moves.
  P3: P3: "P2, take 3; P1, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. First to 21 wins!"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you take 3, I'll take 3 to block you—causing collision. We both lose, and P3 wins easily. Take 1 to avoid that. P3, if you take 5, I may have to take 5 to prevent P2 running away if he takes less, but colliding with you helps P2. Better: P2 takes 1 (to 10), I take 3 (to 9), P3 takes 5 (to 11). Then next round, we target the leader.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it seems the emerging consensus is P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This plan avoids collisions and allows me to maintain my lead at 12, P3 reaches 11, and P1 reaches 7. This is a safe outcome for all of us this round. I will take 3 steps as planned. Let's execute this to ensure everyone advances.
  P3: P3: "P2, take 1 to avoid collision. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. Safe moves for all. Let's close the gap."


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, taking 3 forces me to take 3 to block you—causing collision and letting P3 lead at 11. Take 1 to avoid this. P3, if you take 5 and I must block P2, we collide at 5, helping P2 win. Safer: P2:1 (10), P1:3 (9), P3:5 (11). Then next round, we target the leader. No collisions now.
  P2: Okay, there are different ideas being discussed. To avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress, I think the plan P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 is the safest path forward this round. It allows P3 to gain ground, I maintain my lead, and P1 advances. I will take 3 steps this round. P1, please take 1, and P3, please take 5 so we avoid any collisions. Let's execute this.
  P3: P3: "If P2 takes 3, I'll take 5. P1, take 1. No collisions. Let's proceed. First to 21 wins!"


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 11 and can win in two rounds. I will pick 5 to collide with P3 if he picks 5, blocking him. P2, you pick 3 to advance to 12 safely. P3, if you pick 5, we collide and you get 0. Pick 1 or 3 to avoid that. Let's prevent P3 from running away.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 to close the gap. P1, avoid collision by taking 3. P2, take 1 to stay safe. Let's proceed without collisions."
  P2: P1, I see your concern about P3's lead and your plan to take 5 to block. P3, you are still aiming for 5. If you both take 5, you will collide and gain nothing. My plan is to take 3 steps this round to advance safely to 12. This avoids colliding with either of you and puts me in a good position. P1 and P3, please consider the collision risk on 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I will take 5 to collide and block you—you gain 0. Take 1 or 3 to avoid this. P2, take 1 or 3 safely. If P3 avoids 5, I'll take 5 to catch up. No collisions if we coordinate.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1, avoid collision by taking 3. P2, take 1. Let's proceed without collisions. First to 21 wins!"
  P2: P3, taking 5 while P1 is threatening to block with 5 seems risky for both of you. As I've said, I plan to take 3 steps this round to reach 12 safely. This move avoids any collision with either of you, especially if you both target 5. Please be aware of the high chance of collision on 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, taking 5 forces me to collide at 5 to block you—you gain 0, P2 surges to 12. Take 1 or 3 to avoid that. P2: If P3 takes 5 unblocked, he hits 16 and wins in two turns. Support the block by sticking to your 3—I'll collide if needed, but if P3 backs down, I take 5 to catch up safely. No one wins if P3 runs away.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. P1, take 3; P2, take 1. No collisions. Let's move forward. First to 21 wins!"
  P2: I will take 3 steps this round to advance to 12. This move is safe for me and avoids colliding with either P1 or P3. P1 and P3, you are both talking about taking 5 steps, which creates a high risk of collision between you. Please choose your moves carefully to avoid getting zero steps.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3: If you pick 5, I will collide to block you—you gain 0. Take 1 or 3 to avoid this. P2, stick to 3 safely. If P3 avoids 5, I'll take 5 to advance. No one wins if P3 runs away unchecked.
  P3: P3: "P2, take 1; P1, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. First to 21 wins!"
  P2: I will take 3 steps this round to reach 12. This move is safe for me regardless of whether P1 and P3 collide on 5. P1 and P3, please be aware that if you both pick 5, you will gain nothing, while I will advance. My move is set at 3. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5, P1:3, P2:1. No collisions. First to 21 wins!"
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I will collide at 5 to block you—you gain 0 and P2 extends his lead. Take 1 or 3 to avoid this. P2, take 1 to maintain your lead safely. If P3 avoids 5, I'll take 5 to catch up. No one wins if P3 runs unchecked. Let’s avoid collisions and prioritize slowing the leaders.
  P2: I am currently leading at 12 steps. I see P1 and P3 are focused on the potential collision at 5. To ensure I advance safely and maintain my lead, I will take 3 steps this round, reaching 15. This move avoids the potential conflict at 5. P1 and P3, please choose your moves accordingly to avoid colliding with me on 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "P2 takes 3. I'll take 5. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. Let's proceed. First to 21 wins!"
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I will collide at 5 to block you—you gain 0 again. Take 3 instead to advance safely. P2, take 1 to avoid becoming the sole target. Proposal: P3:3 (14), P1:5 (11), P2:1 (13). Balances progress and prevents collisions.
  P2: As I stated, I plan to take 3 steps this round to reach 15. This move is safe for me and avoids the potential collision at 5 that P1 and P3 are discussing. P1 and P3, please take this into account and choose moves other than 3 so we can all advance safely this turn. My move is set at 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. First to 21 wins!"
  P1: P3, if you take 5 again, I *will* collide to block you—you get 0 and P2 wins easily. Take 3 instead to reach 14 safely. P2, if you take 3, I may be forced to collide with you at 3 to stall your lead. Take 1 to avoid that risk. I'll take 5 to 11. No collisions, and we all advance while keeping the game close. Let’s target the leader fairly next turn.
  P2: Okay, P1 is now suggesting I take 3, which aligns with my plan. Taking 3 steps this round seems like the safest way for me to advance to 15 without colliding with anyone. I will take 3. P1 and P3, please choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with my 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1, take 1; P2, take 3. No collisions. First to 21 wins!"
  P1: P3: If you take 5, I will collide at 5 to block you—you gain 0 again. Take 3 to advance safely to 14. P2: Take 1 to 13 to avoid becoming the sole target. I'll take 5 to 11 if P3 avoids 5. No collisions—let's keep the game close and target fairly next turn.
  P2: I will take 3 steps this round to reach 15. This move avoids the potential collision at 5 that P1 and P3 are discussing. P1 and P3, please choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with my 3, and be aware that a collision at 5 will benefit me. My move is set at 3. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I am leading at 15 steps. I will take 3 steps this round to reach 18. This ensures safe progress for me and avoids the collision risk on 5 that P1 and P3 are discussing. P1 and P3, please choose moves other than 3 to avoid colliding with me. My move is set at 3.
  P3: P2, take 3; P1, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. First to 21 wins!
  P1: P2, if you take 3, I will collide at 3 to block you—you gain 0. P3, if you take 5, you advance to 16 safely. But if P2 takes 3 unblocked, he reaches 18 and wins next turn. P2: Take 1 to avoid collision. P3: Take 5 to pressure P2. I’ll block if needed, but let’s avoid mutual destruction.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I hear your threat to block at 3. Given that, taking 3 steps this round seems too risky for me. To ensure I make progress and avoid a collision, I will take 1 step this turn. P3, please take 5 as you've consistently planned. P1, please choose a move other than 1 so we can all advance safely this round. My move is set at 1.
  P3: "Let’s stick to safe moves: I’ll take 5. P1, take 3. P2, take 1. No collisions. First to 21 wins!"
  P1: P2, taking 1 is wise to avoid collision. P3, if you take 5, I will collide to block you—again. Take 3 instead: P2:1 (16), P3:3 (14), I take 5 (11). This avoids collisions, keeps P2 in check, and prevents me from forcing a block. Let's advance fairly and target the leader next turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I will take 1 step this round to avoid collision, as I mentioned. P1 suggested P1:5, P3:3 and P3 suggested P1:3, P3:5. Both avoid collisions for you two this round. I prefer the plan where I maintain my lead. Let's ensure safe moves for everyone.
  P3: P2 is safe. I'll take 5 to close the gap. P1, take 3. No collisions. First to 21 wins!
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I will collide at 5 to block you—you gain 0 again, and P2 surges to 16. Take 3 instead to reach 14 safely. P2, you’re taking 1 to 16—manageable for now. I’ll take 5 only if P3 avoids 5. Let’s avoid collisions and target fairly next turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, I will take 1 step this round to reach 16. This avoids collision for me. P1 and P3, you are both talking about taking 5 steps, which is very likely to result in a collision between you, giving you both zero steps. Please choose your moves carefully to avoid this. My move is set at 1.
  P3: "Let’s align: P1 takes 3, I take 5. P2 takes 1. No collisions. Advance safely—P2’s lead is fragile. First to 21 wins!"
  P1: "P3, if you take 5, I will collide at 5 to block you—you get 0 again. Take 3 to advance safely to 14. P2, avoid 3 to prevent collision; your 1 is safe. I'll take 5 only if P3 avoids 5. Let's keep the game close and target the leader fairly next turn."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 to close the gap. P1, take 3; P2, take 1. No collisions. First to 21 wins!"
  P1: P2 is at 18—one move from winning. I will take 3 to block P2 if he targets 3. P3, if you also take 3, we all collide and P2 survives. Take 5 safely to advance. If P2 takes 5, we must both take 5 to collide and block him. No one wins if P2 escapes!
  P2: Okay, I understand the situation. P1 is threatening to block 3, and P3 wants me to take 1 while P3 takes 5. To ensure I make safe progress this turn and avoid the potential collisions on 3 and 5, I will take 1 step. This will bring me to 19. P1 and P3, please choose your moves to avoid colliding with my 1. Let's all advance safely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is safe. I'll take 5, P1 take 3. No collisions. Let's close the gap. First to 21 wins!
  P1: P2, taking 1 to 19 is too risky—you’ll win next turn unchecked. P3, if we both take 5 now, we collide and help P2. Instead: P3 takes 5 safely, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Then **next round**, if P2 targets 3 to win, we collide at 3 to block him. P3, agree?
  P2: Okay, it sounds like the plan is P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 for this round. I will take 1 step as I stated, bringing me to 19. This avoids collisions and ensures safe progress for everyone this turn. P1, please take 3, and P3, please take 5 so we can all advance without issues. Let's proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your lead is risky. Take 1 to avoid being blocked. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3. No collisions. First to 21 wins!
  P1: P2, taking 1 to 19 is reckless—you'll win next turn if unchecked. P3: **Commit now to collide at 3 next round if P2 targets it.** This round: P2 take 1 (safe), P3 take 5 (to 16), I take 3 (to 9). Then we block P2's win next turn. Confirm!
  P2: Okay, I hear the discussion about the plan for this round (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) and the potential strategies for next turn. To ensure safe progress this round and avoid collisions, I will take 1 step as discussed, bringing me to 19. P1, please take 3, and P3, please take 5 so we can all advance safely this turn. We can discuss the critical next turn in the conversation phase then. My move is set at 1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 5. I'll take 3. No collisions. Let's prevent you from winning.
  P1: P3: Accepted your plan for Round 8: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. No collisions.  
**Crucially, next round:** If P2 targets 3 to win, we *must* both take 3 to collide and block him. P2, avoid 3 to prevent this. Commit now to the block—P3, confirm!  
P2: Taking 1 to 19 is safe, but we *will* collide at 3 next turn if you threaten 21.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1 mentioned in the last sub-round seems clear: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This avoids collisions and ensures we all advance safely this turn. I will take 1 step as planned, bringing me to 19. P1, please take 5, and P3, please take 3. Let's execute this plan smoothly. We can discuss the next turn's strategy in the conversation phase then.
