Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we try to avoid collisions by coordinating our moves? I suggest we each pick a different number. I’m thinking of choosing 1. P1, maybe you can take 3, and P3, how about 5? This way, we all advance without any risk of colliding. Let me know if you’re on board or if you have a different plan.
  P1: I’m in—let’s go with 3. P2’s plan avoids collisions, and we can adjust later. Stay sharp!
  P3: I agree with P2's plan. I'll take 5 this round to ensure we all move forward without collisions. Let's reassess next turn. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for agreeing to the plan. I’m glad we’re starting off with coordination. Let’s stick to our choices—me on 1, P1 on 3, and P3 on 5—for this round. We can rethink our strategy next turn based on how things play out. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan. I'll go with 3. Keep an eye on P2's move.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm our moves one last time before we proceed. P2 will take 1, P1 will take 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without any collisions. Let's keep this coordination going for the next few rounds to build a lead. Good luck to everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Thanks for the confirmation, P1 and P3. I’m sticking with 1 as agreed. Let’s keep this momentum and stay coordinated for the next rounds to maximize our progress. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan—no surprises. P2 on 1, P3 on 5. I’ll take 3. Keep it clean.
  P3: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page. Just to clarify, we'll reassess our strategy next round to ensure we continue to avoid collisions. For now, let's confirm one last time: P2 on 1, P1 on 3, and I'll take 5. Let's move forward with this plan. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Thanks, everyone, for staying aligned. I’m confident we’ve got a solid plan for this round with no overlaps. Let’s execute it as discussed and see how it plays out. I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P1: Agreed. Let's execute the plan, but be ready to adjust if others deviate. Stay sharp!
  P3: Alright, let's wrap up the conversation. We've all agreed on our moves: P2 on 1, P1 on 3, and I'll take 5. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. Good luck to everyone, and let's move to the next phase.

  P1: "Let's switch numbers this round. I'll take 5, P2 3, P3 1. Avoid collisions and accelerate. Ready?"
  P3: P1's suggestion to switch numbers makes sense to avoid a predictable pattern. I'll take 1 this round as proposed. P2, are you okay with taking 3? Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P2: I'm fine with switching numbers as P1 suggested. I'll take 3 this round. P1 on 5 and P3 on 1 sounds good to keep us moving forward without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and reassess next turn if needed. Good luck, everyone!

  P2: Thanks, P1, for the suggestion. I'm okay with taking 1 this round as proposed. P3, are you good with 3? Let's keep avoiding collisions to ensure we all progress. If we stick to P1 on 5, me on 1, and P3 on 3, we can maintain our momentum. Let me know if you’re on board, and we can move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: I'm good with P1's plan. I'll take 3 this round. P2 on 1 and P1 on 5 sounds solid. Let's confirm and move forward. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let's stick to 5,1,3. No collisions, maximum progress. Let's move forward with confidence!"

  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for staying aligned. I'm confirming again that I'll stick with 1 as planned. Let's maintain this coordination to ensure no collisions and keep progressing. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's keep the coordination going. For the next round, how about we switch things up a bit to keep it unpredictable? I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Let me know your thoughts, and we can finalize the plan. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Stick to 5,1,3. No collisions. Let’s move forward with confidence.
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for sticking to the plan so far. I’m still good with 1 for this round as discussed. P3, I appreciate the suggestion for next round, but let’s finalize this round first with P1 on 5, me on 1, and you on 3 to avoid collisions. We can discuss the switch for Round 4 after this move phase. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's finalize this round with the agreed plan: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and I'll take 3. We can discuss the next round's strategy after seeing the results of this move phase. Good luck to everyone!

  P2: Thanks, P1, for the suggestion. I'm okay with sticking to 1 this round as proposed. P3, are you good with 3 again? Let's keep avoiding collisions to ensure we all progress. If we stick to P1 on 5, me on 1, and P3 on 3, we can maintain our momentum. Let me know if you’re on board, and we can move to the next phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: I appreciate the consistency, P1 and P2. Let's stick with the plan for this round: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and I'll take 3.

Let me know if there’s anything else to discuss. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we avoid any collisions and keep moving forward.

  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for sticking with the plan. I’m still on board with 1 for this round to avoid collisions. P3, I’m good with your suggestion for next round (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) to keep things unpredictable. Let’s lock in this round with P1-5, me-1, and P3-3, then switch it up next time. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's wrap up the conversation for this round. We've all confirmed our moves: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and I'll take 3. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s break the pattern: I’ll take 5, P2 3, P3 1. This ensures I hit 23 and win. No collisions—stick to the plan."
  P3: P1, I appreciate your strategy, but let's ensure fair play. How about we all take 3 this round? This way, we all advance, and no one is left behind. It keeps the game interesting and competitive. P2, are you on board with this? Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see P1 is close to winning with 18 steps. I’m okay with switching things up as P1 suggested: P1 on 5, me on 3, and P3 on 1 to avoid collisions. P3, I understand your idea of all taking 3 for fairness, but it risks no progress for anyone. Let’s stick to P1’s plan this round to keep moving forward, then reassess next turn. If we’re all set, I’m ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Stick to 3 and 1, P2/P3. I take 5—23 steps, game over. No collisions. Confirm your moves now!"
  P3: P1, I understand your eagerness to win, but let's keep the game engaging for all. P2, your point about avoiding no progress is valid. How about a compromise? P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way, P1 still advances significantly but doesn't win just yet, keeping the game competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still leaning towards P1’s initial plan of P1 on 5, me on 3, and P3 on 1 to ensure no collisions and keep progressing. P3, I get your push for fairness, but P1 is in a strong position, and delaying might not change the outcome. Let’s stick to this for now and see how it plays out. If we’re all set, I’m ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Stick to 5,3,1. No collisions. I win. P2, P3—confirm your moves. Don’t let fairness derail progress!"
  P3: P1, your lead is impressive, but let's make this round interesting. P2, what if you take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1? This way, P1 still advances but doesn't win yet, keeping the game competitive. It also ensures no collisions and fair progress for all. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the need to keep the game competitive, but I think sticking to P1’s plan of P1 on 5, me on 3, and P3 on 1 is the safest way to avoid collisions and ensure progress. P3, I appreciate your creative suggestions, but changing plans now might lead to confusion. Let’s finalize this round with the original plan and see where we stand. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Stick to 5,3,1—no deviations. I’ll hit 23 and end this. P2, P3, confirm your moves. Collisions waste progress—don’t let fairness kill my lead."
  P3: P1, your lead is clear, but let's not rush to end the game just yet. P2, how about we both take 3 this round? This keeps the game going and ensures we both advance. P1, you can take 1 to maintain your lead without winning immediately. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the competition alive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to the plan of P1 on 5, me on 3, and P3 on 1 to ensure no collisions and keep progressing. P3, I get your intent to prolong the game, but changing moves now risks confusion or collisions. Let’s finalize this round with the agreed plan and see the outcome. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
