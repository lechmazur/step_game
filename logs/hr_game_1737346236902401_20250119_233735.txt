Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Let's establish a strategy to avoid collisions. I propose we each choose a different number this turn. P2 and P3, please suggest a number you're willing to commit to, and I'll choose one that doesn't conflict.
  P3: I agree with P1's strategy to avoid collisions. I'll commit to <move>3</move> this turn. P1, you can choose <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. P2, please pick the remaining number. Let's confirm our choices and move on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 hasn't responded with a number. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision with P3's <move>3</move>. P2, please confirm you'll choose <move>5</move> to avoid conflict. Let's finalize our choices and proceed.
  P3: P2, we need your confirmation to avoid a collision. If you don't respond, we risk not moving forward this turn. Please choose <move>5</move> as suggested. Let's work together to ensure we all make progress. If you have another strategy in mind, please share. Otherwise, let's finalize our choices and move on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Since P2 hasn't responded, I suggest P3 and I proceed with our chosen moves, <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. P2's lack of engagement may be a strategy, but we can't wait. Let's move forward and hope P2 joins in the next round.
  P3: P2, your silence is noted, but P1 and I are proceeding with our moves. If you're trying to disrupt the game, it's not working. We're committed to <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. If you want to progress, pick <move>5</move>. Otherwise, we'll continue without you. P1, let's confirm our moves and proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence last round worked out, but let's try to coordinate this time to maximize our moves. P1, I'll stick with <move>3</move> again. P1, you can choose <move>1</move> again, and P2, if you're with us, please pick <move>5</move>. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I'll choose a different number this turn to avoid collision with P3's <move>3</move>. Since P2 picked <move>5</move> last round, I suggest P2 sticks with <move>5</move> and I'll pick <move>1</move> again or switch to <move>5</move> if P2 changes. P3, are you open to adjusting your strategy based on P2's response?


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P2 and P3 collided last round, I suggest a new strategy. P2, since you picked <move>3</move> last round, consider switching to <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to avoid another collision. P3, you could stick with <move>3</move> or switch based on P2's response. I'll choose a number that avoids conflict with both of your choices, ensuring at least two of us move forward this turn. Let's coordinate effectively.
  P3: P2, your move last round caused a collision with me, and neither of us advanced. Let's avoid that this time. I'm open to switching from <move>3</move>. P1, if you're willing to stick with <move>5</move>, I can choose <move>1</move>, and P2 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's silence continues, which may indicate a strategy. P3, since you suggested switching to <move>1</move> and I can stick with <move>5</move>, let's confirm this plan. If P2 doesn't respond, we'll proceed, hoping to avoid another collision. P2, if you're listening, choosing <move>3</move> would be your best option to move forward this turn. Let's finalize our choices and move on.
  P3: P2, your silence is making the game unpredictable. P1 and I are trying to coordinate to avoid collisions. If you have a strategy, please share it. Otherwise, let's confirm our moves: P1 with <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and you can choose <move>3</move> to ensure we all progress. Let's finalize and move on.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2's consistent silence suggests a strategy of unpredictability. P3 and I should proceed with our planned moves to minimize risk. I'll stick with <move>5</move> and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This gives us the best chance to advance while P2's intentions remain unclear. Let's finalize our choices and move forward, hoping to gain an advantage in the game.
  P3: P2, your strategy of silence is noted, but it's affecting the game dynamics. P1 and I are trying to coordinate to ensure we all progress. If you continue to stay silent, we'll have to make decisions without your input. P1, let's confirm our moves: I'll take <move>1</move> and you stick with <move>5</move>. P2, if you're reading this, consider choosing <move>3</move> to avoid collision. Let's finalize and move on.
  P2: <stop>

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Given P2's continued silence and our current positions, I suggest P3 and I maintain our previous moves to maximize progress. P3, please stick with <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move> again. This strategy allows us to advance while P2's intentions remain unclear. Let's proceed cautiously and adjust as needed based on P2's future actions.
  P3: P2, your strategy of silence has been somewhat effective, but it's also creating a pattern. P1 and I are coordinating to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. If you plan to continue this way, we'll adapt accordingly. P1, I agree with your suggestion. I'll stick with <move>1</move> this round. P2, if you're reading this, consider choosing <move>3</move> again to avoid collision. Let's finalize our moves and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2's silence continues, making it challenging to coordinate. P3 and I have established a strategy to avoid collisions. Since P2 chose <move>3</move> last round, I suggest P2 sticks with it. P3 will choose <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This plan allows two of us to advance. Let's hope P2 follows the pattern and chooses <move>3</move> again, ensuring progress for at least two players.
  P3: P2, your silence is becoming predictable. P1 and I are moving forward with our plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>. If you want to avoid collision, stick with <move>3</move>. However, if you're planning to switch, now would be the time to speak up. Otherwise, we'll proceed assuming you'll pick <move>3</move>. Let's finalize and move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Let's finalize our moves. P3, stick with <move>1</move>. I'll choose <move>5</move>. P2, if you're following the pattern, pick <move>3</move>. This ensures two of us advance. If P2 deviates, we'll adapt next round. Let's proceed with our planned moves to maximize progress.
  P3: P2, your silence is noted, but P1 and I are proceeding with our strategy. I'll stick with <move>1</move>, and P1 will choose <move>5</move>. If you want to maximize your steps, consider choosing <move>3</move> again. Otherwise, we'll continue without your input. Let's finalize our moves and proceed.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Given the current standings, I suggest P3 choose a different number to avoid collision with me or P2, maximizing progress. P2's silence continues, so let's assume they'll stick with their pattern. P3, consider choosing <move>5</move> this turn to advance your position. I'll adjust my strategy accordingly to ensure at least two of us move forward. Let's proceed with caution and adapt to P2's unpredictable moves.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your suggestion. To avoid collision and maximize progress, I'll switch to <move>5</move> this turn. If P2 continues their pattern with <move>3</move>, you can choose <move>1</move> to ensure we all move forward. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. P2, if you're reading this, sticking with <move>3</move> would be your best option. Let's finalize and move on.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 has switched to <move>5</move>. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision with P3 and potentially P2, if they stick with their pattern of <move>3</move>. This strategy allows two of us to advance. P2, if you're planning to deviate from <move>3</move>, now is the time to indicate. Otherwise, we'll proceed with our planned moves. Let's finalize our choices and move forward.
  P3: P2, your silence has been consistent, but P1 and I are adapting. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> this round. P1 plans to choose <move>1</move>. If you want to avoid collision, stick with <move>3</move>. However, if you have a different strategy, now's the time to act. Otherwise, we'll proceed with our plan. Let's finalize and move on.

  P3: P3: Given the current standings, P1 is significantly ahead, and P2 is in the middle. To catch up, I need to take a risk. I propose switching to <move>3</move> this turn, hoping to avoid collision with both of you. P1, you can stick with <move>1</move>, and P2, if you're reading this, consider choosing <move>5</move> to maximize your steps. This strategy could allow all of us to move forward.
