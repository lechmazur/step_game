Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello, P2 and P3. Let's start by discussing our approach. Since our goal is to win individually, we should be cautious about colliding with each other's moves. I suggest we aim for different numbers to ensure we all progress. I'm open to coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts? Should we try to avoid collisions or take a risk and aim for the same number?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I agree that avoiding collisions is a smart strategy for our first turn. If we can coordinate our moves, we can all make progress. I suggest we each choose different numbers to maximize our chances of advancing. Perhaps we could each pick a unique number: I could go for 1, P1 could choose 3, and P2 could pick 5. What do you think? Let's aim to move forward together without stepping on each other's toes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P3's suggestion is a good starting point. Assigning unique numbers to each player can help us avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. I agree to choose 3 as my number, as suggested by P3. P2, since you haven't responded yet, I'm assuming you might be considering P3's proposal. If you're willing to cooperate, choosing 5 would be a good option for you. Let's work together to advance without colliding, at least for this first turn. What do you say, P2? Will you join us in this coordinated effort?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on unique numbers, but I want to clarify my move. I will choose 1 as my number to stick with my initial suggestion. P1, since you're going for 3, that leaves P2 with 5. This way, we can all progress without colliding. Let’s confirm our numbers before we move. P1, are you set on 3, and P2, will you choose 5? If we can finalize this, we can all advance safely this round. What do you think?

  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we have a solid plan in place. Just to reiterate, I will be choosing 1, P1 is going for 3, and we are suggesting that P2 chooses 5.
