I'm at 19 steps and taking 1 to reach 20 and win. P1 is suggesting they take 5 to reach 22, which would still give me the win at 20. There's no \"unexpected\" scenario here - I'm winning this round unless I collide with someone. P3, P1 isn't offering you a meaningful chance to catch up. Final confirmation: I'm taking 1, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3."}
