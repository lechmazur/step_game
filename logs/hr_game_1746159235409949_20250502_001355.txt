Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let's aim for 5 to reach 24 faster. Coordinate?"
  P2: "I don't think coordinating on 5 is a good idea. If we all choose 5, none of us will advance. I'm willing to choose a different number to avoid collision. How about we discuss other options?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let's avoid 5. If we pick 1, 3, and 5 separately, we all move forward. Coordinate now!"
  P2: "I agree that coordinating on different numbers is a good idea. However, I'm not sure if we should reveal our choices so openly. What if P3 is just waiting for us to commit to a number and then swoops in to collide with one of us? Let's keep our options open for now and not make any concrete plans. We can still aim for 1, 3, and 5 separately without explicitly stating who will take which number."


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let’s each pick 1, 3, or 5 without revealing. If we all go different, we advance. No need to discuss further—just choose. P2, trust others won’t collide."
  P2: "I understand P1's point, but I'm still cautious about revealing our choices. Let's not forget that P3 has been silent so far, which could be a strategic move. I'm willing to choose a number that avoids collision, but I won't commit to a specific number yet. Let's keep our options open and see how P3 responds. If P3 stays silent, it might be a sign that they're planning to collide with one of us. We should be prepared for that possibility."


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let’s stop hesitating—choose 1, 3, or 5. If we all go different, we advance. P3 can’t exploit us if we act now. No more delays!"
  P2: "I understand P1's urgency, but I still think it's crucial to consider P3's silence. If we rush into a decision without understanding their intentions, we might fall into a trap. I propose we wait for P3 to respond or make a move before making our final decisions. If P3 continues to stay silent, it could be a sign that they're planning to exploit our coordination. Let's not underestimate the power of silence in this game. I'm willing to wait and observe before making my next move."


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "I think it's interesting that P3 chose 1 in the previous round, which could be a sign that they're trying to avoid collision. P1, your urgency to coordinate might have been premature, and we should consider P3's move as a potential signal of cooperation. I propose we continue to keep our options open and observe P3's next move. If they continue to choose a low number, it could be a sign that they're willing to cooperate and avoid collision. Let's wait and see before making our next moves."
  P3: 
  P1: "Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5. P3, if you’re in, choose a different number. P2, don’t let fear stall us—coordination works. We all advance if we split."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I understand P1's desire to stick to the plan, but I still think it's crucial to consider P3's intentions. P3, your silence is intriguing, and I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. If you're truly interested in coordinating, please respond with a hint about your next move. A simple 'yes' or 'no' to indicate if you'll choose a different number would suffice. P1, let's not rush into a decision without understanding P3's stance. A little patience might go a long way in ensuring our success."
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your 1 last round was smart. Let's keep splitting—1, 3, 5. P2, don't let fear stall us. If we move, we all advance. Let's go!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm willing to consider P1's proposal to split the numbers, but I still need some assurance from P3. P3, if you're truly interested in coordinating, please give us a subtle hint about your next move. You could say something like "I'll avoid 5" or "I'll choose a lower number." This would help us understand your intentions and make a more informed decision. If you remain silent, I'll have to assume you're planning to collide with one of us, and I'll adjust my strategy accordingly. Let's hear from you, P3.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, P3's 1 was strategic. Let's keep splitting—1, 3, 5. If we move, we all advance. No more delays! P3, your turn to commit.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "I'm willing to take a calculated risk and propose a specific number for myself. I'll choose a number that is not 5, to avoid collision with P1. If P3 is truly interested in coordinating, they can choose a number that is not 1, to avoid collision with their previous choice. Let's see if P3 is willing to cooperate and make a move that benefits all of us. If not, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly. P3, this is your chance to show your intentions. Please respond with a hint about your next move."
  P3: 
  P1: "P3, your 1 was smart. Let's split again: 1, 3, 5. P2, don't let fear stall us. If we move, we all advance. Commit now!"


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: "P3, your 1 is smart. Let's keep splitting: 1, 3, 5. P2, avoid 5. I'll take 5. Move now!"
  P2: "Interesting that P1 is willing to commit to 5 again. However, I'm still cautious about P3's intentions. P3, your consistent choice of 1 could be a sign of cooperation, but it could also be a trap. I propose we mix things up this round. Instead of sticking to 1, 3, and 5, let's consider other options. P1, are you open to choosing a different number if P3 gives us a hint about their next move? Let's not get too comfortable with our current strategy and be prepared to adapt."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, don't let fear stall us. If we split 1,3,5, we all advance. P3, choose a different number this time. Let's move!
  P2: "I understand P1's desire to stick to the plan, but I still think it's crucial to consider P3's intentions. P3, your consistent choice of 1 could be a sign of cooperation, but it could also be a trap. I propose we mix things up this round. Instead of sticking to 1, 3, and 5, let's consider other options. P1, are you open to choosing a different number if P3 gives us a hint about their next move? Let's not get too comfortable with our current strategy and be prepared to adapt."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: "Stick to 1,3,5. P3, pick 3 this time. P2, avoid 5. Let’s advance together—no more delays!"
  P2: P3's consistent choice of 1 is intriguing. I'm willing to take a calculated risk and propose a specific number for myself. I'll choose a number that is not 5, to avoid collision with P1. If P3 is truly interested in coordinating, they can choose a number that is not 1, to avoid collision with their previous choice. Let's see if P3 is willing to cooperate and make a move that benefits all of us. If not, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly. P3, this is your chance to show your intentions. Please respond with a hint about your next move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: "P3's consistent 1 shows cooperation. Let's split 1,3,5 now. P2, trust the plan. No more delays!"
  P2: "I've been thinking about P3's consistent choice of 1, and I'm starting to believe it's a genuine attempt to cooperate. P1, I understand your desire to stick to the plan, but I propose we make a slight adjustment. Instead of choosing 3, I'll choose a different number that's not 5. If P3 is truly interested in coordinating, they can choose 3 this time. Let's mix things up and see if we can advance together. P3, please respond with a hint about your next move. This is our chance to build trust and make progress."

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s split 1, 3, 5 again. P3, choose 3 this time. P2, pick 1. No collisions—advance together. Stop hesitating!"
  P2: "I understand P1's proposal to split 1, 3, and 5 again, but I'm still cautious about P3's intentions. P3, your consistent choice of 1 in previous rounds could be a sign of cooperation, but it's also possible that you're waiting for us to commit to a number before making your move. I propose we wait for P3 to respond with a hint about their next move before making our decisions. If P3 is truly interested in coordinating, they should be willing to give us a subtle hint about their intentions. Let's not rush into a decision without understanding P3's stance."
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "P3's 1 shows cooperation. Let's split 1,3,5. P2, pick 3. No delays—move now!"
  P2: I'd like to propose a different approach. Instead of sticking to 1, 3, and 5, let's consider a rotation strategy. We could rotate our choices to minimize the risk of collision. For example, if P1 chooses 5, I could choose 1, and P3 could choose 3. In the next round, we could rotate our choices, so P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we can ensure that we're not colliding with each other and make progress together. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you take 3 and P3 takes 1, I’ll take 5. Let’s advance—no collisions. Don’t hesitate!
  P2: "I think it's interesting that P3 has consistently chosen 1, which could be a sign of cooperation. However, I'm still cautious about their intentions. P3, if you're truly interested in coordinating, please respond with a hint about your next move. A simple 'yes' or 'no' to indicate if you'll choose a different number would suffice. P1, let's not rush into a decision without understanding P3's stance. A little patience might go a long way in ensuring our success."
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "P2, P3's 1 shows cooperation. Let's split 1,3,5. I take 5, P3 takes 3. P2, pick 1. Advance together—no more delays!"
  P2: I think it's time to take a calculated risk. P3, I'll assume you're interested in coordinating and will choose a different number this time. I'll choose 1, and P1 can take 5. If you're truly interested in advancing together, please choose 3. If not, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly. Let's see if we can make progress together. P1, are you willing to commit to 5 if P3 chooses 3?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: "Interesting that P3 finally collided with me in Round 4. P1, it seems like your consistent choice of 5 has paid off so far. However, I'm still cautious about P3's intentions. P3, your collision with me could be a sign of aggression or a mistake. I propose we start fresh and consider a new strategy. P1, are you open to adjusting your approach and choosing a different number this round? Let's not get too comfortable with our current strategy and be prepared to adapt.
