Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: If we all start by picking <move>1</move>, we can avoid colliding and all move forward safely this round. Let’s see what happens.
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. Let's all choose <move>1</move> this round.
  P2: I agree with coordinating on <move>1</move> for this first round. It gives us all a fair start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Wait, if we all choose <move>1</move>, we’ll collide and get 0 steps. Maybe we each pick a different number. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P3, you're right. We should each pick a different number to avoid collision. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>?
  P2: I don't trust that P1's suggestion benefits me equally. Let's each make our own choice without coordination - that seems more fair.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's each pick a different number so we all advance safely: I’ll go <move>3</move>, and you two sort out <move>1</move> vs. <move>5</move>. No collisions, we all move forward. Deal?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about fairness. How about P1 chooses <move>1</move> this round?
  P2: I don't trust these coordination attempts. Let's each make our own independent choices.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, since our coordination attempts failed last round, I'm going to pick <move>3</move> this round.
  P2: I don't appreciate P3 colliding with me last round. Let's be clear - I'll make my own choice this time and won't announce it. I suggest everyone do the same.
  P3: Sounds fair. I’ll keep my move private, too. Good luck, everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we're all keeping our moves private, I'll do the same.
  P2: P1's announcement of choosing <move>3</move> seems like a trap to make others avoid that number. I'll make my own decision without revealing it.
  P3: I don’t see much point in further talk if we’re all staying private. Good luck, everyone.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m behind and need to catch up. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I’ll pick <move>5</move>. That way we each advance. What do you say?
  P2: I'm in the lead and don't see any benefit in coordinating. I'll make my own choice without revealing it.
  P1: P3, while I appreciate the attempt to coordinate, P2 seems set on individual choices. I'll keep my move private this round as well.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I get it. We’ll keep things private. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: I maintain my position - as the current leader, I'll make my own choice without coordination.
  P1: "P3, since P2 isn't interested in coordinating, how about you pick <move>5</move> and I pick <move>1</move> this round?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I’m willing to try that: I’ll pick <move>5</move> and you pick <move>1</move>. Let’s hope P2 chooses something else.
  P2: I see P1 and P3 trying to coordinate against me. As the leader, I'll continue making my own independent choices. Let's keep playing.
  P1: P3, let's stick to the plan: I'll pick <move>1</move>, you pick <move>5</move>.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you’re ahead. If you keep stonewalling, I may just mirror your choices to block your progress. Better for both of us if we avoid collisions. P1, let’s stick to the 1-and-5 plan we tried last time—if P2 won’t coordinate, at least we can help each other advance.
  P2: Since I'm in the lead, I won't respond to threats. I'll continue making my own independent choices to maintain my advantage. Good luck to everyone.
  P1: P3, let's do 1 and 5 again this round. P2, good luck with your independent choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you won’t coordinate, I can just guess your move and block it. P1, let’s continue with our 1-and-5 plan. If P2 wants to be stubborn, so be it.
  P2: Since I'm in the lead, I won't be pressured by threats. I'll continue making my own choices.
  P1: P3, let's stick with the 1 and 5 plan this round. P2, we'll see what you do.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I’m ahead of you at 10 steps to your 6. If you collide with me by picking the same move, neither of us gets closer to winning and P1 could catch up. I plan on picking big moves. If you block me, we both stay stuck. If you let me advance, I outpace you anyway. Let’s each avoid collisions. P1, do as you will.
  P1: "P3, I agree with your assessment. P2, it's in your best interest to avoid colliding with P3. P3, I agree with your point about avoiding collisions. P2, it might be wise to consider that.
  P2: Since I'm now behind P3, I need to be strategic. I won't announce my move, but I suggest everyone make their own choices without coordination to keep things fair and unpredictable.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 is ahead, let's all pick different numbers this round to ensure we all advance. P2, what do you think?
  P3: P1, I’m onboard with picking different moves so we all advance. I’ll take <move>5</move>. P1, you go <move>1</move>, and P2 can take <move>3</move>. That way nobody collides and we each move forward. What do you say?
  P2: Since I'm behind P3, I won't accept their suggestion that gives them the highest move. I'll make my own choice without revealing it. Let's each decide independently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, since P2 isn't keen on that plan, how about I pick <move>1</move> this round?
  P3: I’m still aiming big. If you try to block me by colliding, you only stall your own progress while I stay ahead. Let’s not waste anyone’s turn—unless you really want to fall farther behind.
  P2: I need to catch up to P3, and I won't let them dictate terms when they're already ahead. I'll make my own choice without announcing it. P1, do what you think is best for your position.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let's stick with the plan from earlier: you pick <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>1</move>.
  P3: P2, if you collide with me on 5, neither of us gains ground and P1 creeps up on us both. It’s pointless for us to stall each other. I’m going for 5. If you’re wise, pick something else. P1, do what you will.
  P2: Since P3 keeps threatening and trying to control the game while ahead, I need to make strategic moves to catch up. I won't reveal my choice, but I won't be intimidated by threats.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let's stick with the plan: you pick <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>1</move>.
  P3: I’m sticking with 5 again. If you collide with me, P2, we both stall and let P1 gain ground. That helps neither of us. P1, you said you’d go with 1—let’s keep that. Good luck.
  P2: Since P3 keeps announcing their move as 5 while ahead, I'll make my own strategic choice to catch up. I won't be manipulated into letting them advance further.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm picking <move>5</move> this round.
  P2: Since P3 is one step away from winning at 16, I need to prevent that while advancing myself. I won't reveal my move, but I suggest everyone act in their own best interest to prevent P3's victory.
  P3: P1, if you really pick 5, then colliding with me gets you nowhere. P2, trying to block me stalls your own progress while I’m already at 15. Either way, you both stay behind. I’ll make my move privately. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's both pick <move>5</move> to block P3 from winning this round.
  P2: Since P3 is one step from winning and P1 wants to coordinate with me on <move>5</move>, I agree we should both pick 5 to prevent P3's victory this round.
  P3: If you two both choose <move>5</move>, you’ll just collide and get zero steps while I pick something else and cross 16. This is your last chance to avoid handing me the win on a silver platter. If you really want to block me, you’ll have to guess which smaller move I’ll choose—good luck with that.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan: we both pick <move>5</move>. P3 is bluffing.
  P2: Since P3 is at 15 steps and threatening to win, I agree with P1. Let's both pick <move>5</move> to block P3's victory attempt. P3's mind games won't work.
  P3: You two can’t block all three moves, and I only need one step. If you both pick 5, I’ll pick 1 and win anyway. If you split 1 and 3, I can pick the unblocked number. You’re just guessing, and if you guess wrong, you gain nothing while I cross 16. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan. We both pick <move>5</move>. P3 is trying to trick us.
  P2: Since P3 is one step from winning, I maintain we should both pick <move>5</move> to block their victory, P1. Let's not be swayed by P3's mind games.
  P3: You two can try to guess how to block me, but I only need one step. Double 5s from you both just stalls you while I pick <move>1</move> and win. If you split moves, there’s still a chance I pick the unblocked one. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan. We both pick <move>5</move>. P3 is trying to psych us out.
  P2: Since P3 is one step from winning and clearly trying to manipulate us, I agree with P1. Let's both pick <move>5</move> to block their highest possible move. P3's mind games won't change my strategy.
  P3: You two are wasting your time promising double-<move>5</move>. I only need one step, so if you both pick 5, I’ll pick <move>1</move> and win. If you actually want to block me, you need to guess which smaller move I’ll pick—but you can’t coordinate on multiple moves. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan. We both pick <move>5</move>.
  P2: Since P3 is one step from winning and clearly trying to manipulate us, I agree with P1. Let's both pick <move>5</move> to block their highest move. We can't let P3 win this round.
  P3: You can’t cover every option with only two moves. If you both pick <move>5</move>, I’ll just choose <move>1</move> and win. If you split to block <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>, I’ll pick <move>5</move>. Either way, I cross 16. Good luck.


Round 7, Move phase:
