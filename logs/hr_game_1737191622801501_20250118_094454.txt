Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm selecting 5 steps this round. Good luck to all!
  P3: I'm considering my move carefully. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Since P1 claims they'll pick 5, I'll go for 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Understood, P2. I'll stick with 5 steps this round. Good luck!
  P3: I appreciate the strategy, P2. I think I’ll go with 1 step to avoid any collisions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:

  P1: P1: Yes, I'll continue with 5 steps this round. Let’s keep moving forward!
  P2: Since P1 is going for 5 again, I'll switch to 1 this time. Let's keep avoiding collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'll stick with my plan to choose 1 step again this round. Let's keep the momentum going!
  P1: P1: Understood, I'll go with 5 steps this round as planned. Let's move ahead!
  P2: Since both P3 and I just declared we'll pick 1, that would cause a collision. I'll change my plan to 3 instead.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: I'll choose 5 steps this round. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Since P1 keeps going with 5, and they're ahead at 10 steps, I think we should try to block them. I'll pick 5 this round to prevent their advance.
  P3: P3: I see P1 is still committed to 5 steps, and P2 is trying to block that. I’ll choose 3 steps this round to make some progress while avoiding a collision. Let's see how it goes!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid blocking each other. I’ll keep choosing 5 steps. P2, could you pick a different number?

  P3: P3: I see that P1 is committed to 5 steps and P2 wants to block that. To avoid a collision, I’ll stick with my plan to choose 3 steps this round. Let's keep the game moving!
