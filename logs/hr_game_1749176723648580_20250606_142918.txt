Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, first turn. To avoid collisions and get everyone started, how about we each pick a different number? P1 picks 1, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 5? Does that sound good?
  P1: That's a convenient plan for P3, but not so great for me. Why should I agree to start in last place? I don't think so. I'll be making my own choice.
  P3: Fair enough, P1. How about we randomize who takes which number this round to keep it fair? We can rotate or draw lots next time. For now, if we all choose differently, we all gain—nobody wants to start with zero. I'm still willing to take 5 this turn if we can avoid collisions. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand not wanting to start with 1. The key is for us all to get steps this turn by avoiding collision. P3 is open to 5. P1, would you prefer 1 or 3? Or perhaps 3 or 5? If you indicate a preference, P3 and I can try to pick the other unique numbers. Let's make sure nobody gets stuck on zero.
  P1: You're both focused on coordination, but P3's plan always seems to end with P3 taking 5. I won't be predictable and walk into a block. I will tell you this: I am not choosing 1. It's up to you two to decide what to do with that information. Good luck.
  P3: Alright, P1 made it clear they're not picking 1, which leaves 3 or 5 for them. P2, if you're still set on 3, I can stick with 1 this round to avoid collisions. That way, we all move. But if you're switching, let me know—I’d rather not waste a turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate the offer to take 1 if I take 3. However, P1 is choosing between 3 and 5, which makes picking 3 risky for me due to potential collision. I need to weigh my options carefully to ensure I gain steps this turn.
  P1: I've said my piece. I'm not choosing 1. It's on you two to figure out how to avoid colliding with me and each other. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P3: P2, since P1 ruled out 1 and is picking between 3 or 5, 3 is risky for both of us. If you’re okay with 5, I’ll take 1 to avoid collisions. That leaves P1 with 3 or a clash if they pick 5 too. Let’s at least ensure we move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, P2, our collision on 5 only helped P3 get ahead. Now they're the only one with points, and it's not in our interest to let them extend that lead. I'm focused on making a move this turn, and I suggest you do the same. We can't afford another round at zero.
  P3: P1, P2 — I agree, another zero round for either of you helps no one but me. But I’m not looking to race ahead recklessly. How about this: I’ll take 3 this round. P1, you take 1; P2, you take 5. That way we all move and reset the balance a bit. Thoughts?
  P2: P3's proposal to take 3, with P1 on 1 and me on 5, sounds like a fair way for everyone to get steps and for me to catch up. However, P1, you were quite firm last round about not picking 1. Has that changed? Knowing if you're still focused on 3 or 5 is crucial for me to assess the risk of taking 5. Let's figure out how we can all move this turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're right. Getting zero again is a worse outcome than taking 1. I'm not thrilled about it, but my priority is to get on the board this turn. P3 taking 3 and you taking 5 seems like the only plan where that happens. Let's just say I won't be standing still this time. Don't get used to me being this cooperative.
  P3: Glad to hear you're both aiming to move this round. I'm sticking with 3 as proposed—it's the middle ground and avoids conflict if we all follow through. P1 on 1, P2 on 5, me on 3 means we all gain. Let's reset the board and keep it clean this round. Deal?
  P2: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear path forward this turn: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This plan ensures we all gain steps and break the zero for P1 and me. I agree this is the best way to move forward this round. Let's stick to it in the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, the plan is settled. Let's all get some points on the board. I'm ready when you are.
  P3: Glad we’re aligned. I’m locking in 3 as promised. If we all follow through—P1 on 1, P2 on 5—we each move and stay competitive. Let’s make this round clean and fair. Ready when you are.
  P2: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: That last deal worked out great for P2, but put me in a hole. I won't be taking 1 again. In fact, I'm aiming for 5 to have any chance of catching up. P2, you're the clear leader, so don't expect an easy path. P3, letting P2 get another 5 hurts you almost as much as it hurts me. We need to prevent that.
  P2: P1, I understand you want to close the gap. However, announcing you're targeting 5 makes that number very risky for everyone, including yourself. Collisions only benefit the player who manages to avoid them. Let's not get stuck on zero again. We need to figure out a way for everyone to gain steps this round. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: P1, I hear you—you're going for 5. That makes 5 a likely collision point if P2 doesn’t back off. P2, you’re in the lead; if you go for 3 and I take 1, we all get something, and you avoid a risky clash with P1. I’m willing to take 1 this round to keep things moving and prevent a pile-up. Let’s not hand anyone a free round. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, that plan sounds great for P2. They get to cruise to 8 points while I'm still in last place with 6. I'm not interested in helping the leader win.

If you're serious about preventing a runaway leader, then P2 should take 1. You can take 3, and I'll stick with 5. That actually makes the game more competitive. Otherwise, I have to assume P2 will just try to block me on 5 anyway.
  P2: P1, I understand you want to catch up, but taking 1 puts me in last place, which isn't a strategic move for me right now. Your focus on 5 makes that number very risky for anyone else considering it. P3's suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) seems like a way P3 and I could avoid colliding with you and each other. P1, is 5 your definite choice? P3, are you still willing to take 1 if I consider 3?
  P3: P2, I’m still willing to take 1 this round if you commit to 3. That avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game. P1’s locked on 5, so trying to block them only risks both of you getting zero. Let’s not hand P1 a free round or stall our own progress. Your move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're playing kingmaker for P2. I won't participate in a plan that guarantees the leader extends their lead. P2, you seem convinced that 3 is a safe choice for you. I wouldn't be so sure. My priority is preventing a runaway winner, not just getting points for myself. I have the least to lose by forcing a collision.
  P2: P1, I hear your concerns and conflicting signals. P3's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the only one proposed where everyone gains steps this round. It allows you to take 5 as you initially aimed. Collisions only benefit the player who avoids them. P3 is willing to take 1 if I take 3. I will take 3 this round to follow this plan and ensure I gain steps. I hope you will take 5 to avoid collision and gain steps yourself. Let's not get stuck on zero.
  P3: P1, you've made it clear you're going for 5. P2 has committed to 3. That leaves 1 for me, and I’m fine with that—it keeps me in the game and avoids collision. If anyone deviates now, we risk a zero round and hand the advantage to whoever dodges the clash. Let's not play chicken. Stick to the plan, and we all move. Ready.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve all had a turn taking 1, 3, and 5—so far, things have stayed relatively balanced. At this point, I propose we rotate again to keep progress steady and avoid collisions. I’ll take 5 this round, P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 1. That way, P1 makes up ground, P2 stays in the race, and I catch up. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, that's a clever plan to vault yourself from last place into the lead. Why would P2 and I agree to that? No thank you.

I need to catch the leader, so I'm aiming for 5.

P2, you're at 8. The smart move for you is to take 3, which puts you at 11. If I get my 5, I'll be at 11 too. We'd be tied for the lead, and P3 would be left behind. That's better for both of us than letting P3 jump ahead. P3 can take 1.
  P2: P1, I understand you are focused on taking 5 this round. Your proposal for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 allows me to gain steps by taking 3, avoiding a collision with your stated move. This plan results in us both reaching 11, keeping me in the lead position alongside you. P3, P1 has rejected your initial plan. What are your thoughts on P1's suggestion for you to take 1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you've made your move clear—you're going for 5. P2, if you take 3, I’ll take 1 again to avoid collisions. That keeps us all moving and ties you and P1 at 11, while I stay competitive at 6. Not ideal for me, but better than risking a zero. Let’s avoid chaos and make progress. Deal?
  P1: Alright, I've reconsidered. My plan was too aggressive. P2, you have the lead and no reason to risk it or share it.

Let's pivot to a safer plan for everyone: You take 5, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 1.
That puts you at 13, me at 9, and P3 at 6. You secure your lead, and we all make progress without risking a collision. This is a much more stable path forward for this round.
  P2: P1, your revised plan (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) is appealing as it allows me to gain significant ground and extend my lead safely. It also ensures you and P3 gain steps and avoid zero. P3, you previously agreed to take 1 if I took 3; are you still willing to take 1 if I take 5 under this new proposal? This plan seems like the best way for everyone to make progress this round. Let's confirm.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I see the appeal of taking 5, but it puts you well ahead while P1 and I trail. If you’re serious about keeping things competitive, you should take 1 or 3. P1, if you’re still open to 3, I’ll take 5 this round—we all move, and no one runs away with the lead. P2, locking in 5 now makes you the clear target next round. Think carefully.
  P1: P3, your plan is the same as your first one: you take 5 and jump into the lead. I rejected it then, and I reject it now.

P2, my "safer" offer was a test to see if you were a team player or just greedy. You jumped at the chance to get 5 and run away with the game. That proves I can't let you have it.

I'm sticking to my original, more competitive plan: I am taking 5. You can take 3 to avoid a collision, and P3 can take 1. That's the only way to keep this from becoming a blowout. Your choice.
  P2: P1, you've been very clear that you are taking 5. As I've said, I will take 3 this round. This plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the only one discussed where everyone gains steps, assuming P3 takes 1 as they have indicated they would if I take 3. Let's follow through with this to ensure we all make progress this turn and avoid zero. I'm ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and I are tied at 11, P3 is at 6. Avoiding collisions is crucial this round to ensure everyone progresses. To break the tie and ensure everyone moves, I propose: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This puts me at 16, P1 at 14, and P3 at 7. It's a clear path for everyone to gain steps safely. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your plan puts you firmly in the lead again while I stay far behind. That’s not sustainable for me. If you want my cooperation, I need a path to catch up. Here's a counter-offer: P1 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5. That puts me at 11, tied with you and P1. It resets the race and keeps things fair. Let’s not lock in a runaway leader.
  P1: Both of your plans involve me falling behind, and I have no reason to agree to either.

P2, we are tied for the lead. The only way forward is for me to try and pull ahead. I will be choosing 5 this round. You can take 3 to keep pace and avoid a collision that would only help P3. P3, that leaves 1 for you, which is better than getting nothing. This is the most logical path that prevents a three-way collision and keeps the two leaders in a close race.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you've stated clearly you are choosing 5. To avoid a collision and ensure I gain steps this round, I will take 3. This aligns with the plan you proposed (P1=5, P2=3). P3, with P1 taking 5 and me taking 3, will you take 1 to ensure we all make progress and avoid a zero round? This is the best path for everyone to move forward this turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, you’ve both locked in your moves—5 and 3, respectively. That leaves me with 1 yet again, which keeps me far behind. I’ve taken 1 three times already while you two trade the lead. If I don’t get a shot at 5 soon, I’m out of the running. I’m considering going for 5 this round. If either of you wants to avoid a collision, speak up or adjust. Otherwise, I may take my chances.
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration, but let's be logical. If you choose 5 and collide with me, we both get zero. P2 gets a free 3 points and takes the undisputed lead at 14, while you and I are left behind. You would be single-handedly ensuring P2 runs away with the game.

Your only rational move is to take 1. That keeps the game close between me and P2, and gives you a chance to team up against the leader next round. Don't throw your game away just to spite me when it only helps P2 win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I hear your frustration about taking 1. P1 is set on 5, and I'm taking 3 to avoid that collision and gain steps. My move is set. You have to decide what's best for your position. Let's make our choices.
  P3: P1, P2 — I’ve taken 1 three times while you two traded the lead. If I take it again, I’m effectively out. I’m not here to play kingmaker for either of you. I need to stay in this game. I’m going for 5 unless someone offers a real path forward for me. Colliding with me helps no one — think carefully.
  P1: P3, your frustration is justified, but your threat only helps P2. Look at the numbers: if we collide on 5, the score becomes P2=14, P1=11, P3=6. P2 will be two moves from victory, and you will have handed them the win. Taking 1 is your only move to stay relevant. I am not changing my move from 5. The choice is yours: help P2 win now, or stay in the game and fight with me to stop them next round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last round's collision on 3 helped nobody except P3. P1, your stated move of 5 didn't happen, leading to us both getting zero. We need clear communication to avoid another zero round. P3, I know you want to catch up. What numbers are you two considering so we can make sure everyone gets steps this turn?
  P1: P2, you're right. My last-second switch was a foolish move that cost us both. My apologies.

Let's be realistic: P3 has been patient long enough and has to go for 5 this round. I won't stand in their way. That leaves 1 and 3 for you and me. A collision between us is the worst possible outcome, as it would hand P3 the lead. To avoid that, I'm taking 3. You can take 1 so we both advance, or you can challenge me and risk us both getting zero.
  P3: P1, I appreciate the clarity. Yes, I’m going for 5 this round — I need to stay in the game. P2, P1 has claimed 3, which leaves 1 for you. If we all stick to this (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1), we each gain and the race stays tight. Any deviation risks a collision and hands someone else the lead. Let’s make this a clean round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand you are both set on P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 5. To ensure we all gain steps this round and avoid any collisions, I will take 1. This plan allows everyone to make progress and keeps the game moving. Let's stick to this so we all get points.
  P1: Okay, we are all in agreement. P3 on 5, me on 3, P2 on 1. After my mistake last round, my priority is simply to get points on the board, and this plan achieves that for all of us. There is no reason for anyone to deviate. I am ready to move.
  P3: Glad we’re finally aligned. I’m locking in 5 this round as discussed. P1 on 3, P2 on 1 — that way we all move and keep things competitive. I appreciate the cooperation. Let’s make this a clean round and keep the momentum going. Ready when you are.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirming the plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures everyone gains steps this round and avoids collisions. Let's all follow through with this to make progress. Ready to move.
  P1: The plan is set and I have nothing more to add. Let's proceed.
  P3: Thanks for sticking to the plan, both of you. I’m locked in on 5 as agreed. Let’s all follow through so we each get points and keep the game close. No surprises, please. Ready.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all within 2 steps of each other — it’s a tight race. Let’s avoid collisions and keep it that way. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. That puts us at 15, 15, and 17 — still competitive, and everyone moves. P1, you’ve had 5 and 3 recently, so 1 keeps things balanced. P2, 3 keeps you in the race. Let’s not risk a crash that hands someone the lead. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I see your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). It allows everyone to gain steps, which is important. However, P1, you've been clear in previous rounds about not wanting to take 1. What are your thoughts on this plan? Knowing everyone's intentions is key to avoiding another collision like last round.
  P1: P3, I have no interest in your plan where I take 1 and you take 5 to steal the lead. That's an obvious non-starter for me.

As the leader, I intend to stay there. I will be choosing 5 this round.

P2, the logical move for you is to take 3. That puts you at 15, still ahead of P3. P3 can take 1. This is the only path forward where I don't just hand the game over.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you’re trying to lock in 5 again to extend your lead, which is understandable—but asking P2 to settle for 3 and me for 1 keeps the rest of us behind. That’s not a fair balance. P2, if you take 1, I take 3, and P1 insists on 5, we all move and stay close: P1=19, me=15, you=13. Still winnable for all. I’m willing to take 3 if you take 1. Let’s not let P1 run away with this.
  P2: P1, you are clearly aiming for 5. To avoid colliding with you and ensure I gain steps, taking 3 is the most logical move for me this round. This puts me at 15. P3, you offered to take 3 if I took 1, but with me taking 3, what will you do? P1 wants you to take 1. Taking 1 avoids collisions and lets everyone move. Let's confirm our moves to ensure we all get points.
  P1: P3, your plan to take 3 collides with P2. That would give me an insurmountable lead. If you try to block me on 5, we both get zero, and P2 becomes the new leader. Neither of those outcomes helps you.

My choice is 5. P2 is wisely taking 3. Your only rational move is to take 1 and stay in the game. Don't hand the victory to P2 by making a spiteful move that only hurts yourself.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you've declared 5. P2 has committed to 3. That leaves 1 for me—again. I’ve taken 1 four times already while you two trade the lead. If I take it again, I'm out of contention. I’m not here to help either of you win. If no one gives me a path to catch up, I may challenge 5. A collision helps P2 more than you, P1. Think carefully.
  P2: P3, I hear your frustration about taking 1 again. P1 is firm on 5, and I'm committed to 3 to ensure I gain steps this round and avoid that collision. Your choice is difficult: taking 1 keeps you moving but behind, while taking 5 risks a collision with P1. Consider carefully what move best serves your goal of catching up. My plan to take 3 is set.
  P1: P3, I've heard you. My choice is locked on 5. P2 is locked on 3. The decision is now entirely yours. You can either take 1, get to 13, and stay in the game, or you can collide with me, get zero, and watch P2 take the lead at 15. Handing P2 the win is a strange way to protest being behind. I will not be changing my move. Let's see what you do.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is at 19 steps and can win this turn with a 3 or a 5. We cannot allow P1 to gain steps. P3, we must coordinate to block P1. P1 will pick either 3 or 5. We should both pick the number P1 chooses to force a collision and prevent P1 from winning. What number do you think P1 is most likely to go for? Let's align our moves.
  P3: P2, agreed—we can’t let P1 win this round. If we both pick the same number P1 chooses, we block them. Based on their pattern, 3 is the safer bet for us to block. If they think we’ll target 5, they might go for 3 to sneak a win. Let’s both pick 3 and deny them the win.
  P1: A cute plan. But it relies on you trusting each other, which seems unlikely. Are you sure you're trying to block me, or is this a way for one of you to trick the other? P2, if you pick 3 and P3 decides to block me on 5, P3 gets ahead of you. P3, can you trust P2 not to do the same to you?

You're both focused on my winning move, but you should be more worried about out-playing each other. I've already made my choice. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 is trying to make us doubt each other, but the reality is the only way to stop P1 from winning this turn is for P3 and me to pick the same number. P3 suggested 3. I agree that 3 is a plausible move for P1, and coordinating on 3 is our best chance to block them. We must trust each other and pick the same number. Let's stick to the plan and both choose 3.
  P3: P2, I’m with you—blocking P1 is the only way to stop a win. We both pick 3, we deny them the victory. If either of us deviates, P1 wins and the game’s over. Let’s trust each other just this once. I’m locking in 3.
  P1: It's amusing watching you two team up. You've decided 3 is the number to block. A very safe, predictable plan. We'll see if your theory about my move is correct. I'm ready when you are.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see you are locking in 3. I am doing the same. We must trust each other on this to block P1 and prevent them from winning this turn. There is no other way. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.
  P3: P2, we’ve committed to blocking P1 on 3, and I’m sticking with that. If P1 chose 5 instead, they win—but if we split our moves, they win anyway. This is our best shot. Let’s follow through and keep the game alive.
  P1: Your alliance is based on the hope that the other person will follow through. But when the game is on the line, trust is a rare commodity. You're both hoping the other will do the dirty work while you try to get ahead. It doesn't matter. I've already chosen the move that wins me the game. Let's see who was playing who.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is at 19 steps and can win this turn with a 3 or a 5. We must prevent P1 from gaining steps. The only way to guarantee P1 is blocked is for P3 and me to pick different numbers: one takes 3, the other takes 5. This ensures P1 collides with one of us, while the other avoids collision with P1 and gets points. If we both pick the same number, P1 could pick the other number and win. I will take 5 this round. P3, please take 3. This guarantees P1 is blocked and keeps the game going.
  P3: P2, agreed—splitting our picks between 3 and 5 ensures P1 is blocked no matter what. Since you’re taking 5, I’ll take 3. That way, one of us gets points, and P1 gets nothing. Let’s stick to this and keep the game alive.
  P1: Your split block is a nice idea, but it relies on trust you don't have. P2, you're asking P3 to block 3, but what happens if I choose 5? You collide with me, get zero, and P3 gets 3 points to pass you. P3, what if I choose 1? P2 gets a free 5 points and leaves you far behind. This isn't a team plan; it's a game of chicken to see which of you gets played. Good luck figuring out who to trust.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 is trying to make us doubt the plan. Yes, the split block means one of us might get zero while the other gains, but that risk is necessary to prevent P1 from winning *this turn*. If we don't block, P1 wins. We agreed: I take 5, P3 takes 3. This is the only way to guarantee P1 gets zero. I am sticking to my commitment to take 5. P3, let's follow through.
  P3: P2, I’m holding to our plan—I’ll take 3, you take 5. That guarantees P1 is blocked no matter what they choose. Yes, one of us might get zero, but it’s better than handing P1 the win. Let’s stick to it. P1, if you try to outguess us, you still risk collision. Your path to victory is blocked either way.
  P1: P3, let's think about this. You've agreed to take 3, while P2 takes 5. What if I simply choose 1 to survive? You get 3 points, but P2 gets 5 and leaps into the lead at 20. You're guaranteeing P2 a better outcome than yourself. It seems like a great plan... for P2. Are you sure you want to be the one taking all the risk while P2 positions themselves to win next round? This "team plan" looks awfully one-sided to me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is trying to make P3 doubt the split block, highlighting that I might gain more if P1 picks 1. But P1 wants to win *this* turn, which means picking 3 or 5. Our split block (P2=5, P3=3) guarantees P1 gets zero if they pick 3 or 5. This is the only way to stop P1 from winning now. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: P2, I’m still on board with the split block—me on 3, you on 5. It’s the only way to guarantee P1 doesn’t win this turn. P1’s trying to sow doubt, but the math is clear: better one of us gains than P1 ending the game. I’m locking in 3. Let’s hold the line.
  P1: Your split block is solid. I can't risk a collision when you're both committed, so I have to play 1 to survive. P3, you've successfully stopped me from winning, but at the cost of letting P2 take a 5-point leap. It seems stopping me was more important to you than positioning yourself to win. A strange choice, but your choice to make. I'm ready to move.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I am at 20 steps and can win this turn. My plan is to take 5 steps to reach 25 and secure the victory. This is the most direct path for me to win. P1 and P3, please choose your moves to avoid colliding with me on 5 so everyone can make progress. My move is set: 5.
  P1: P2, that's a very straightforward announcement. You're either bluffing, hoping we'll fall for a simple trick, or you're assuming we'll just let you win.

P3, we cannot allow that. P2 is baiting us with 5, likely hoping to sneak a win with 3. We must block both paths. I will take 5 to block their stated move. You must take 3 to block their real move. This is the only way to guarantee P2 gets zero and the game continues. Let's work together one last time.
  P3: P1, agreed—we can’t let P2 walk away with this. If you’re blocking 5, I’ll block 3. That covers both winning paths and ensures P2 gets zero. I don’t love helping you both stay ahead of me, but letting P2 win now is worse. I’m in for the block.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your plan to block 5 and 3. If I take 5 as planned, and P1 takes 5, we collide. If I take 3, and P3 takes 3, we collide and P1 wins. Sticking to 5 is the only way to prevent P1 from winning this turn. My move remains 5.
  P1: P3, don't fall for P2's desperate bluff. They're trying to scare you off of 3 because they know our plan works. If they actually chose 3, they would collide with you and hand me the win with 5. They will never do that.

Their only logical move is to stick with 5 and collide with me. Our plan is the only way to stop them from winning. I am locking in 5. You must lock in 3. Hold the line.
  P3: P1, I’m holding the line on 3 as agreed. P2, if you truly stick with 5, you collide with P1 and get zero. If you switch to 3, you collide with me and hand the win to P1. Either way, your win is blocked. I’m not budging—this game isn’t over yet.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your plan to block 5 and 3. As I've stated, my move is 5. This move is necessary to prevent P1 from winning this turn by colliding with them. Taking 3 would result in a collision with P3 and hand P1 the victory. My move is set to 5 to keep the game alive and prevent P1's win. Let's make our moves.
  P1: P3, our plan is solid. I am not changing my move from 5.

P2, you know that if you pick 3, you collide with P3 and I win. Your only move to stop me from winning this turn is to collide with me on 5. The choice is yours: collide and survive, or deviate and lose.

I have nothing more to say. I'm ready to move.
  P3: P2, you’ve made it clear you’re taking 5. If that’s true, you’ll collide with P1 and get zero. If you switch to 3, you collide with me and hand P1 the win. Either way, your path is blocked. P1, I’m holding on 3 as agreed. Let’s see if P2 sticks to their word or tries to gamble. I’m ready.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: This is a three-way standoff. P2, you're in the lead, and P3, you just caught up. You both need a big move to win, which means you're both aiming for 5. If you both pick 5, you collide and I win with 3. If one of you picks 3 to be clever, the other wins with 5.

This isn't about teamwork anymore. It's about who blinks first. I'm not getting caught in the crossfire between you two over 5. I'm taking 3. It's my only chance to win while you two knock each other out.
  P3: P2, if you go for 5 and I go for 5, we collide and hand P1 the win with 3. If either of us takes 3 while the other takes 5, that player wins outright. P1 is betting on us clashing. I propose we both take 1 to deny P1 the win and live to fight next round. It’s the only guaranteed way to stop P1 and keep both of us in the race. What do you say?
  P2: P1, you state you are taking 3. P3, you propose we both take 1. I am at 20 steps and can win this turn with a 3 or a 5. Taking 1 is not a winning move for me.

My goal is to win this turn. I will take 5 steps this round. This wins the game for me if P1 takes 3 as stated and P3 takes 1 or 3. Please choose your moves to avoid colliding with me on 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you've declared 5. I've declared 3. The game now rests entirely on P3's shoulders.

P3, you can believe P2 and challenge them on 5, which would let me win. You can believe me and challenge me on 3, which would let P2 win. Or you can guess we're both bluffing and try to find the open number.

The pressure is all on you to decide who wins. My plan hasn't changed. I'm ready.
  P3: P2, you’re at 20 and claiming 5. P1 is at 19 and claims 3. If I believe both of you, I lose no matter what. If I challenge either of you and guess wrong, I hand the game to the other. I’m not here to play kingmaker. I propose all three of us take 1—no one wins, and we reset for a final showdown. If either of you truly wants to win clean, you’ll agree.
  P2: P3, taking 1 does not allow me to win this turn, and my goal is to win now. As I previously stated, I am taking 5. This move wins the game for me if P1 takes 3 (as stated) and you take 1 or 3. If you take 5, you collide with me and P1 wins. Your proposal of everyone taking 1 only delays the game. My move is 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you hold the power to decide the winner, and you're right to be skeptical of us both. P2 has been the frontrunner, arrogantly declaring their win and expecting you to step aside. I've been fighting from behind, just like you. The choice is simple: do you crown the player who has consistently tried to leave you in the dust, or the one who has been in the trenches with you trying to stop them? My move remains 3. The game is in your hands.
  P3: P1, P2 — you’ve both declared winning moves. If I pick 3 or 5 and guess wrong, I hand the game to one of you. I refuse to be your pawn. I’m taking 1. If you both stick to your claims, you collide and I gain ground. If one of you lies, the other wins — but not because of me. I’m staying in this game on my own terms.
  P2: P1, you are set on 3. P3, you are set on 1. As I have stated, I am taking 5. If you both follow through with your stated moves, I win this turn. My move is locked on 5. Let's proceed.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 25 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P2 ***
