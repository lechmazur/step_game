Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid collisions, let's each choose different moves this turn. I'll pick `<move>5</move>`. P1 and P2, please choose `<move>1</move>` and `<move>3</move>`.
  P1: I'm okay with avoiding collisions this round. P3, since you've picked 5, I'll go with 1. P2, can you take 3 as suggested? Let's keep it fair and move forward together for now.

  P3: Understood. Let’s proceed with our chosen moves this turn and maintain this approach in the upcoming rounds. If anyone wants to adjust later, we can discuss then.
  P1: Thanks for the coordination last sub-round. I’m sticking with my plan to choose a move that avoids collision. P2 and P3, let’s confirm we’re still on the same page with our respective choices. If everyone’s good, I think we can wrap up the conversation here.
  P2: I'm still on board with taking `<move>3</move>` this round as agreed. Let's keep the coordination going and see where it leads us. If anyone has second thoughts or new strategies, feel free to share. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with our plan.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm happy to continue our coordination strategy. For this round, I propose we switch our moves: P1 takes `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>5</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>1</move>`. This rotation will help us keep advancing without collisions. Let me know your thoughts on this new arrangement.
  P3: P3: I understand the rotation idea, P2. To keep advancing quickly, I’ll continue with `<move>5</move>` this round. P1 and P2 can choose between `<move>1</move>` and `<move>3</move>` as needed. Let’s aim to maximize our progress!
  P1: I'm fine with a rotation to keep things fair, but I also want to ensure we all progress. P2, I’m okay with taking `<move>3</move>` as you suggested. P3, since you’re sticking with `<move>5</move>`, P2 can take `<move>1</move>`. Let’s confirm this arrangement to avoid any collisions this round. If everyone agrees, we can move forward smoothly. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm okay with taking `<move>1</move>` this round as suggested by P1. Let's keep the rotation going to ensure we all advance without collisions. If everyone agrees, we can proceed smoothly. Thoughts?
  P3: Great, I confirm I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this round. Let's proceed as planned to avoid any collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Looking forward to our progress!
  P1: I'm glad we're maintaining coordination. Let's stick with the current plan for this round: I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. This way, we all advance without collisions. If everyone is still on board, I think we’re ready to proceed. If there are any last-minute concerns or adjustments, let’s address them now. Otherwise, I’m good to move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with `<move>1</move>` as planned. If everyone sticks to our agreement, we'll all advance smoothly this round. Let's keep the coordination going and reassess our strategy next round.
  P3: Sounds good. Let's proceed with our chosen moves.
  P1: I'm pleased with how our coordination is working so far. Let's finalize our plan for this round: I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. This ensures we all advance without any collisions. If there are no objections or last-minute changes, I believe we're set to move forward. Let's keep this momentum going and reassess next round if needed.

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad our coordination has worked well so far. To keep the momentum and ensure we all progress, I suggest another rotation this round: I'll take `<move>5</move>`, P2 takes `<move>3</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>1</move>`. This way, we avoid collisions and continue advancing together. P3, since you're ahead, this gives you a smaller step while allowing P2 and me to catch up a bit. Let me know if this works for everyone or if adjustments are needed. Let's keep the communication open and move forward smoothly.
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation strategy, P1. I'll take `<move>3</move>` this round as suggested. P3, since you're ahead, this rotation helps balance our progress. Let's keep this coordination going to ensure we all advance without collisions. If anyone has other ideas or adjustments, feel free to share. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with our plan.
  P3: P3: I'll take `<move>5</move>` this round to advance further. P1, please choose `<move>1</move>`, and P2, please select `<move>3</move>` to avoid any collisions. Let's continue coordinating to ensure smooth progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm disappointed, P3, that you're not sticking to the rotation plan to balance our progress. Since you're ahead, taking `<move>5</move>` again widens the gap. I’ll stick to suggesting `<move>5</move>` for myself as planned, but I urge P3 to consider `<move>1</move>` and P2 to take `<move>3</move>` to avoid collisions and keep things fair. If we don’t adjust, collisions could stall us. Let’s prioritize coordination over individual gains for now. Thoughts? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to advance, but sticking to our rotation plan helps us all progress fairly. If you take `<move>1</move>` as suggested, it will prevent collisions and keep the game balanced. I'm still on board with taking `<move>3</move>` this round. Let's prioritize coordination to ensure we all move forward smoothly. If everyone agrees, we can proceed with our plan. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I understand your concern, P1. To reach 24 steps first, I'll continue choosing `<move>5</move>` this round. P1 and P2, please select different moves to ensure your steps count and avoid collisions. Let's focus on advancing effectively toward the goal.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I get your drive to reach 24 first, but taking `<move>5</move>` again risks a collision if I stick to my plan. To avoid stalling, I urge you to reconsider and take `<move>1</move>` for balance. P2, let’s stick with `<move>3</move>` as discussed. If we don’t align, we might all lose progress this round. Let’s prioritize coordination one last time to ensure we all advance. If we’re set, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your insistence on `<move>5</move>` risks collisions and stalls our progress. To keep advancing smoothly, please consider `<move>1</move>` this round as suggested. I'll stick with `<move>3</move>` to maintain our coordination. Let's prioritize fairness and ensure we all move forward. If we align, we can avoid setbacks and continue our momentum. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand your concerns, but to reach 24 steps first, I'll continue choosing `<move>5</move>`. P1 and P2, I encourage you to select your moves based on your strategies. Let's focus on advancing toward the goal. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your repeated choice of 5 last round caused a collision and stalled my progress, which is frustrating. I’m still behind, so I propose we return to a fair rotation: I’ll take `<move>5</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3, please take `<move>3</move>` to balance things out. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. If we keep colliding, none of us will reach 24 efficiently. Let’s prioritize coordination this round. Thoughts? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P3, I agree with P1 that we need to avoid collisions to progress efficiently. I'll take `<move>1</move>` this round as suggested. Please consider taking `<move>3</move>` to balance our advancement. Let's prioritize coordination to ensure we all move forward smoothly. If we align, we can avoid setbacks and continue our momentum. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand your concerns, P1 and P2. To ensure we all advance smoothly, I'll choose `<move>3</move>` this round. Let's proceed with:

- **P1:** `<move>5</move>`
- **P2:** `<move>1</move>`
- **P3:** `<move>3</move>`

This should help us avoid collisions and keep everyone progressing toward the goal. Let’s move forward with this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on a fair rotation this round. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take `<move>5</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>3</move>`. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P3, thanks for agreeing to balance our progress. If there are no objections or last-minute changes, I think we're set to proceed. Let's keep this momentum and reassess next round if needed. Thoughts? If everyone’s good, I’m ready to move forward.

This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains fairness. If there are any last-second concerns or adjustments, please speak up now. Otherwise, I’m confident we’re ready to proceed. Let’s keep this cooperative spirit going and see how we progress.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this round to advance quickly. P1 and P2, please select `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>` to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Let’s keep moving forward smoothly!
  P1: P3, I understand your push for 5 to advance quickly, but since you're ahead, it risks another collision and stalls us all. I propose a fair rotation: I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3, please take `<move>5</move>`. This keeps progress balanced and collision-free. If we collide, none of us reach 24 efficiently. Let’s prioritize coordination over individual gains for now. Thoughts? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P3, I agree with P1 that we should avoid collisions to ensure steady progress. I'll take `<move>1</move>` this round as suggested.

This way, we all advance without collisions and keep progress balanced. If there are any last-minute concerns or adjustments, please speak up now. Otherwise, I believe we’re set to proceed. Let’s maintain this coordination to ensure we all move closer to 24 steps. Thoughts? If everyone’s aligned, I’m ready to move forward.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're leading with 18 steps, but let's keep the game fair. I suggest we continue our rotation: I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P1 takes `<move>1</move>`, and you take `<move>5</move>`. This way, we all advance without collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can maintain our momentum towards 24 steps. Let's prioritize coordination to ensure we all progress smoothly. Thoughts?

  P1: P3, with 23 steps, you're one move from winning. To keep things fair and give us a chance to catch up, I support P2’s rotation: I’ll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>5</move>`, and P3, please take `<move>1</move>`. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. If you rush to 24 now, we risk stalling each other in future rounds. Let’s prioritize balance this turn and strategize for a competitive finish.
