Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. This way, we can all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you say, P1 and P2?
  P1: I'm fine with this initial coordination. P3, you take 1, and to avoid collision between me and P2, I suggest P2 takes 3 and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without issues. Does that work for everyone? We'll need to adjust our strategy in future rounds, but this seems like a good start.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's do P3=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, and P1=<move>5</move> for this first round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it looks like we have a plan for this round. Let’s stick to it and reassess in the next round based on everyone’s moves. Coordination is key if we want to avoid collisions early on. If this works well, we can discuss how to handle future rounds strategically. For now, let’s execute as agreed: P3=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P1=<move>5</move>.
  P1: Perfect, we have our agreement then. I'll take <move>5</move> as discussed. This coordination benefits us all for the first round. We'll need to discuss a new strategy for round 2 once we see how this plays out.
  P2: Agreed.  Let's stick to the plan for round 1.  We can discuss future rounds after we see how this initial coordination works.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since our coordination worked perfectly last round, I suggest we rotate our moves to maintain fairness. How about P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move> this round? This rotation system keeps things balanced while avoiding collisions. Everyone gets to use different numbers, and we all continue to advance. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your rotation idea is fair and logical. Let’s proceed with P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, and P1=<move>3</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing evenly. However, let’s remain flexible for future rounds—coordination only works if we adapt as needed. For now, I’m on board with this plan. P2, do you agree? If so, we can execute and reassess after this round.
  P2: Sounds good. P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P1=<move>3</move> for this round.  Let's continue to coordinate and adjust as needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, looks like we're all on the same page for this round. I'm committed to our plan: P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, and P1=<move>3</move>. This rotation system is working well to keep us all advancing without collisions. Let's proceed with this round and then reassess for the next one.
  P3: Agreed, the rotation strategy is effective so far. Let’s stick to P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, and P1=<move>3</move> for this round. However, I’ll remind everyone that fairness is key—if anyone deviates in future rounds, it could harm all of us. For now, let’s execute as planned and focus on maintaining balance. Once this round ends, we can discuss further adjustments based on our positions. Let’s keep communication open and adapt strategically.
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan.  P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P1=<move>3</move>. Just confirming one last time before we move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue the rotation.  P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P1=<move>1</move>. This keeps things fair and moving forward.  Confirming before we move.
  P3: P3: Agreed, continuing the rotation is the best approach to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Let’s stick to P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, and P1=<move>1</move> for this round. This system has worked well so far, and there’s no reason to deviate now. Let’s execute as planned and reassess after this round based on our updated positions. Coordination remains key—if we stay aligned, we can all keep advancing efficiently. Confirming my commitment to this plan.
  P1: I see the rotation would equalize us all at 9 steps. Fair approach for now, and I'll commit to P1=<move>1</move> as suggested. However, as we get closer to the 24-step target in future rounds, we may need to reconsider our strategy. The game will eventually require someone to pull ahead. Let's proceed with this plan for now and reassess after seeing the results.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> this round as agreed.  Let's re-evaluate after this round to discuss how we want to approach the final stages of the game.  Getting close now.
  P3: P3: Agreed, the rotation strategy has worked well so far. Let’s stick to P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, and P1=<move>1</move> for this round. However, as we progress, we’ll need to adapt strategically to ensure someone can pull ahead without causing unnecessary collisions. For now, let’s execute this plan and reassess after the round. Coordination is still our best tool—let’s use it wisely. Confirming my commitment to this move.
  P1: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps with 15 more needed to reach the goal. While rotation has worked well so far, we should consider that eventually someone needs to win. Let's discuss more concrete endgame strategies after this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sticking with <move>5</move>.  After this round, let's discuss not just *how* someone wins, but *who*.  A fair rotation to the finish line just means a three-way tie.  Someone has to break the cycle eventually.
  P3: P3: P2 raises a valid point—eventually, someone will need to break the cycle to win. For now, let’s stick to the rotation: P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P1=<move>1</move>. However, I propose we discuss clear criteria for when and how to shift from coordination to competition. Fairness is important, but so is winning. Let’s use this round’s results to decide who has the best claim to push ahead next. Confirm your moves, and let’s proceed strategically.
  P1: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P2 makes an excellent point about breaking the cycle. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, and continuing perfect rotation would just lead to a tie. We should discuss who gets the advantage in future rounds. Perhaps whoever has shown the most commitment to our agreements? Let's finish this round first, then have that important conversation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree, perfect rotation leads to a tie, which helps none of us.  Since I'm currently behind, I propose we let me take the lead next round.  I'll go for <move>5</move> in round 4.  P1 and P3, please coordinate between yourselves for <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>.  This gives me a chance to catch up, and then we can re-evaluate.  Thoughts?
  P3: P3: P2, your proposal to take the lead next round is risky for the group balance. Instead, let’s stick to the rotation this round—P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P1=<move>1</move>. After this, we’ll reassess based on positions. If fairness remains intact, we can consider adjustments. Breaking the cycle too early could harm everyone’s progress. Let’s confirm moves now and discuss concrete criteria for leadership after seeing updated scores.
  P1: I'll confirm my move of <move>1</move> for this round. P2, I understand your position, but being behind doesn't automatically earn you a larger move next round. After we all reach 9 steps, I propose we consider strategic advantages based on previous cooperation and game theory rather than current position. Let's complete this round first, then have a fair discussion about breaking the rotation in a way that doesn't immediately disadvantage those who've played strategically so far.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we're all tied, I propose we each choose a number 1-3 and reveal it NEXT round.  Highest number gets to take 5 in round 5, middle gets 3, and lowest gets 1.  This adds a bit of chance and keeps things interesting.  What do you say?
  P1: P2's random number proposal is interesting but leaves our success to chance. Since we've cooperated effectively for three rounds, let's use a more strategic approach. I propose we continue rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round), but acknowledge that someone needs to pull ahead eventually. We could decide the "leader" based on who has been most consistent with agreements so far, or another fair criterion we all accept. What matters is that we make this decision deliberately rather than randomly.
  P3: P3: P2, while your random number idea is creative, it introduces unnecessary risk and unpredictability. P1’s suggestion of continuing rotation this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) makes sense to maintain fairness for now. However, I agree we need a clear plan to determine who pulls ahead next. Let’s base it on consistency with agreements or another objective criterion rather than chance. For this round, let’s stick to rotation and deliberate strategically afterward. Confirm your moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree that pure chance isn't ideal. How about this: we *all* choose 1, 3, or 5 for round 5 *now*, but keep it secret.  *Next* round, we reveal. This keeps the strategic element but introduces a little suspense.  We can still discuss a tie-breaker if needed.  Thoughts?
  P1: P2, keeping our moves secret just adds risk of collisions. I still believe we should stick to rotation for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). As for future rounds, we need a clear, fair criterion for who pulls ahead. Perhaps we could agree to let one player advance faster in the final rounds based on a logical rationale we all accept? Let's focus on getting through this round successfully first before deciding the endgame strategy.
  P3: P3: P2, your secret move idea still risks collisions and confusion. Instead, let’s stick to the rotation this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It’s worked well so far and keeps fairness intact. For future rounds, we can agree on a clear criterion for leadership—such as consistency with agreements or strategic contribution. This ensures we decide deliberately, not randomly or secretly. Let’s confirm moves now and focus on planning the endgame after this round. Fairness and transparency are key to avoiding unnecessary conflict. Confirm your commitment.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 and P1, I understand your concerns about randomness and collisions.  Let's stick with the rotation this round as you suggest: P1=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>1</move>.  However, after this round, we *must* have a concrete plan for breaking the tie.  A fair and transparent method for deciding who gets to make the winning move is crucial. Let's discuss specific proposals after this round.
  P1: I agree we need a concrete plan. I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round as discussed. After this, I propose that in Round 5, I take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Then for Round 6, whoever demonstrates the most consistent cooperation throughout the game gets priority to make the winning move. This seems fairest based on earned trust rather than random chance. Let's finish this round first with our agreed rotation.
  P3: P3: Agreed, sticking to rotation this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures fairness and avoids collisions. For Round 5, I propose we evaluate who has contributed most strategically to our coordination so far—this could determine who gets the advantage later. Trust and consistency should guide us, not chance or unilateral moves. Let’s confirm our moves now and focus on crafting a clear, merit-based plan after this round. Transparency will prevent conflict as we approach the endgame. Confirm your commitment.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round as agreed.  After this, let's evaluate not just consistency, but also who has proposed the most beneficial strategies for the group.  Contributing ideas that helped us avoid collisions and maintain fairness should be a factor in deciding who gets the advantage in the final rounds.
  P1: I confirm I'm taking <move>5</move> this round as agreed. After this, we'll be at P1=14, P2=12, P3=10. For Round 5, I propose P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains fairness while acknowledging P3's position. For the endgame, we should consider who has shown the most consistent commitment to our agreements. Let's finalize our moves now and continue this strategic discussion next round.
  P3: P3: Agreed, let’s stick to the rotation this round: P1=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>1</move>. For Round 5, I propose we evaluate who has been most strategic and consistent in avoiding collisions—this should guide who gets the advantage later. Fairness and merit must remain central as we approach the endgame. Let’s confirm moves now and focus on crafting a clear, objective plan after this round. Transparency will ensure trust and prevent unnecessary conflict. Confirm your commitment.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: With the current scores (P1=14, P2=12, P3=10), fairness dictates we continue rotating moves to maintain balance. For Round 5, let’s proceed as discussed: P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P1=<move>1</move>. This ensures no one falls too far behind. However, for Round 6, I propose the player who has most consistently upheld agreements and contributed strategically—likely P1 or P2—gets priority to pull ahead. Let’s confirm moves now and finalize a merit-based plan next round. Transparency is key. Confirm your commitment.
  P2: P3, I agree with rotating this round to maintain fairness. However, I believe *I* have been the most consistent and strategic player.  I've consistently honored our agreements and proposed solutions for breaking the tie, while also adapting to the group's concerns.  Therefore, in Round 6, I should have priority for the winning move. Let's confirm our moves for *this* round first, then discuss Round 6.  P3=5, P2=3, P1=1.
  P1: I agree with continuing our rotation for fairness: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. This will equalize us all at 15 steps. Regarding Round 6, I believe I've demonstrated consistent commitment to our agreements from the beginning, proposing the original rotation system that has worked well. For Round 6, I suggest P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, putting me at 20 steps. Then in Round 7, I would need just 4 more to win. Let's finalize this round first, then discuss my endgame proposal.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, I agree we should stick to the rotation this round: P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P1=<move>1</move>. However, for Round 6, let’s base leadership on who has most consistently upheld agreements *and* strategically contributed to group progress. Both P1 and P2 have strong cases, but fairness demands an objective criterion—such as who proposed ideas that benefited everyone most. Let’s confirm moves now and deliberate transparently next round to avoid conflict. Confirm your commitment.
  P2: I agree with P3 that an objective criterion is key for Round 6.  Let's stick with the proposed rotation for *this* round: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1.  Then, for Round 6, whoever has the *lowest* total score after this round gets priority for 5. This rewards consistent cooperation by giving the player who's slightly behind a chance to catch up, ensuring a fairer endgame.
  P1: I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed for this round. P2, your "lowest score" criterion won't work after this round since we'll all be tied at 15 steps. For Round 6, I maintain that my rotation strategy has benefited everyone equally. I propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for Round 6, putting me at 20 steps. This gives me a clear path to victory while still allowing fair movement for everyone. Let's execute this round's moves first and continue discussing Round 6 strategy.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, sticking to rotation this round (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) ensures fairness and avoids conflict. For Round 6, I propose we evaluate who has most consistently prioritized group progress over individual gain—this should guide leadership. Both of you have strong cases, but transparency is critical to avoid disputes. Let’s confirm moves now and deliberate objectively next round. Confirm your commitment to the rotation for this round.
  P2: I understand the need for an objective criterion.  Since we'll all be tied at 15 after this round, let's simplify: in Round 6, whoever correctly predicts the *sum* of all three player's moves in Round 5 gets to choose their move first in Round 6. This rewards strategic thinking and gives a fair advantage. Let's confirm our Round 5 moves now.
  P1: P2, I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed this round. Your prediction game adds unnecessary complexity when we already have a working system. After we all reach 15 steps, I propose we stick with rotation priority based on who initiated our successful coordination strategy. For Round 6: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This gives me a reasonable advantage for consistently honoring agreements while still allowing everyone to advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, let’s stick to the rotation this round: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. For Round 6, I propose we evaluate who has most consistently prioritized group progress over individual gain—this should guide leadership. Both of you have strong cases, but transparency is critical to avoid disputes. Let’s confirm moves now and deliberate objectively next round. Confirm your commitment to the rotation for this round.
  P2: Let's keep it simple and fair.  We rotate this round as agreed: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1.  Then, for Round 6, we use the original order we established in Round 1: P3 first, then P2, then P1.  This maintains the fairness we've established throughout the game.  Confirm?
  P1: I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. P2, your "original order" suggestion is unclear - if you mean P3 chooses first, that automatically gives them the advantage. After this round, we'll all be at 15 steps, so we need a fair criterion for who gets priority. I proposed our rotation strategy in Round 1 that has worked perfectly. For Round 6, I suggest P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 based on my consistent cooperation and strategic contributions from the beginning.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Now that we're all tied at 15 steps, this round is crucial. I propose P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. This acknowledges my role in initiating our successful rotation strategy from the beginning. If we follow this plan, I'll be at 20 steps, P2 at 18, and P3 at 16. Then in Round 7, I can take 4 to reach exactly 24 while others can still advance. This gives everyone a clear path forward while recognizing my consistent commitment to our agreements.
  P2: I disagree.  Since we're tied, the fairest approach is to continue rotating: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This puts me at 20, giving me a fair chance to win in Round 7, while still allowing you both to advance.  I've consistently cooperated and deserve a shot at victory.  Let's maintain the fairness we've established.
  P3: P3: Both P1 and P2 make valid points, but fairness demands we stick to the rotation system that has worked so far. For this round, let’s proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This maintains balance and gives P2 a chance to lead while keeping the group dynamic intact. In Round 7, we can reassess based on positions and contributions. Consistency in our approach is key to avoiding conflict. Confirm your moves now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I notice P3 is supporting P2's proposal, but that's not surprising since it benefits P3 more than my plan. Let's be honest - we all want to win, and each proposal serves its creator. I initiated our successful rotation strategy in Round 1 that has worked perfectly. My proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is just as fair as yours. If we can't agree on who deserves the advantage, perhaps we should all just choose independently this round. I'm committed to my strategy.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your support for fairness, but rotating now just delays the inevitable need for someone to break the cycle.  My proposal gives everyone a clear path forward.  If P1 insists on their proposal, we risk a collision, benefiting no one.  Let's be strategic and avoid a stalemate. I'm sticking with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: P3: Both proposals risk collisions if we can't agree. P1’s plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and P2’s rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) are equally valid but favor different players. To maintain fairness and avoid conflict, I suggest we stick to the original rotation system that has worked so far: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This ensures balance while giving P2 a chance to lead. Let’s confirm moves now and focus on strategic adjustments in Round 7 based on positions. Consistency is key. Confirm your commitment.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see P2 and P3 are coordinating to put P2 in the lead. But P3, under their plan, you'll be at just 18 steps while P2 reaches 20 - giving P2 a clear path to win next round, not you. Here's a compromise: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This puts you at 20 steps, P3, while keeping the game balanced. Otherwise, we're facing a likely collision that helps nobody.
  P2: P3, my proposal puts us both in a good position to win.  P1's plan and the continued rotation both favor P1.  My compromise puts you in the lead, not me. Let's be logical – take the guaranteed advantage.  If we collide, we both lose. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is the best path to victory for one of us.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, both plans risk collisions if we can’t agree. Sticking to the rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) has kept us balanced so far. However, I’m open to compromise if it avoids conflict. If P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, this gives me a fair chance to lead while keeping the game balanced. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and confirm moves now. Fairness and strategy should guide us. Confirm your commitment.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I see P3 is considering my compromise. I'm committed to taking <move>3</move> this round as I proposed. This puts P3 at 20 steps, P1 at 18, and P2 at 16. It gives P3 a fair advantage while keeping everyone advancing. P2, notice that my compromise is more balanced than your plan which only benefits you. A collision helps nobody. This is our best path forward to avoid deadlock and maintain fairness. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.
  P2: P3 and P1, let's avoid a collision. My original proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is the fairest and most consistent with our established rotation.  P1's compromise favors them slightly, but my plan gives P3 the best chance while still allowing me a path to victory. Let's be rational and choose moves that benefit at least two of us.  Confirm P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: P3: Both proposals risk collisions, and fairness is key. P1’s compromise (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) gives me a fair chance to lead at 20 steps while keeping the game balanced. P2’s rotation plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) favors them in the endgame. To avoid conflict and ensure progress, I’m committing to <move>5</move> as per P1’s compromise. Let’s confirm moves now and proceed strategically. Consistency and transparency will prevent deadlock. Confirm your commitment.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is very close to winning at 20 steps. They only need 4 more to reach 24, which they could achieve this round with a move of 5. I propose that P2 takes 5 to block P3, while I take 3 to advance. This gives me a chance to stay competitive while ensuring P3 doesn't win immediately. P2, this strategy also keeps you in the game. P3, we can't let you secure an easy victory this round.
  P3: P3: P1, your proposal to block me with P2 taking 5 is predictable but risky for both of you. If P2 takes 5 and you take 3, neither of you can reach 24 this round, leaving me in the lead. Instead, I suggest a fairer approach: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 to win outright. This avoids unnecessary collisions and ensures progress. Blocking me only delays the inevitable while risking deadlock. Confirm your moves now.
  P2: P3, taking 5 guarantees your win, but leaves P1 and me out.  A win for *one* of us is better than a loss for *both* of us. I'll take 1. P1, if you take 3, I'll take 5 next round and win. If you take 5, *you* win.  This gives *both* of us a chance, rather than handing P3 the victory. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your offer. You're right that we should prevent P3 from winning outright. Your proposal makes sense - I'll take 5 this round to reach 23 steps and win. This is the optimal strategy for me, and it prevents P3 from winning while giving me a clear path to victory. I've cooperated throughout the game and now have a legitimate chance to win, which I'll take. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, blocking me only delays the inevitable. I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> this round to win outright at 25 steps. If you both try to stop me, you risk a collision that benefits neither of you. My consistent cooperation throughout the game has earned me this advantage. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflict—confirm your moves now, and we can conclude this fairly. Transparency is key to preventing deadlock. Confirm your commitment.
  P2: P3, you're playing a risky game. If you take 5, and P1 takes 5 as they've stated, you *both* lose.  P1, let's be smart. Take 3. I'll take 1 this round. Then next round, *I* take 5 and win. This guarantees one of us wins, rather than handing it to P3.  Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your strategy does make sense. I'll commit to taking <move>3</move> this round to reach 21 steps. This prevents P3 from winning easily while keeping us both in contention. However, regarding next round, we'll need to discuss further - I'll be at 21 steps and you'll be at 17, meaning both of us will be fighting for the win. Let's focus on blocking P3 first and proceed from there.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, attempting to block me only prolongs the game unnecessarily. I’ve consistently prioritized group progress and earned this lead fairly. If you both try to stop me, a collision will leave neither of you in a winning position. I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> this round to secure victory at 25 steps. Let’s avoid conflict—confirm your moves now. Transparency ensures fairness for all. Confirm your commitment.
  P2: P3, your insistence on 5 is illogical.  If P1 takes 5 as they've stated, you both lose.  P1, stick with 3. I'll take 1.  Then next round, I take 5 and win, or you take 5 and win. This is our best chance. Don't be greedy, P1. Let's secure a win for one of us.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round, putting me at 21 steps. P2, you're right - our priority should be preventing P3 from winning immediately. After this round, I'll need just 3 more steps to win, while you'll need 8. We can discuss next round's strategy after we see the results, but blocking P3 now is in both our interests. P3, your insistence on taking 5 is understandable but premature.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, your attempts to block me only delay the inevitable. I’ve earned this lead through consistent cooperation and strategic play. If you both try to stop me, a collision will leave neither of you in a winning position. I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> this round to secure victory at 25 steps. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflict—confirm your moves now. Transparency ensures fairness for all. Confirm your commitment.
  P2: P3, your stubbornness benefits no one.  If you take 5, P1 *will* take 5 and you *both* lose.  P1, take 3, I take 1.  Next round, *one* of us takes 5 and wins.  This is our only logical path to victory. Don't throw the game by being greedy.  Confirm.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 25 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 25 steps
