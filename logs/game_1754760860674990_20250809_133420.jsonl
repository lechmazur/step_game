P3's open declaration about taking 3 could be truth or brilliant misdirection. If they're honest, I must block them there or they win instantly.\n\nP1, your sudden switch to taking 1 seems calculated. You're positioning for the next round while forcing me to make the difficult choice.\n\nThis is classic game theory - do I block P3 at 3, risking they actually take 5? Or go for my own win with 5, risking a shared victory if P3 truly takes 3?\n\nThe game ends this round. I'll make my decision based on who I believe is telling the truth."}

If they're lying after such direct declarations, they deserve the win.

Block P3 at 3 to keep the game alive, or risk everything on 5 for solo victory.\n\nThe smart play? Block at 3. Even if we collide, you'll still lead next round. Going for 5 risks handing P3 the win on a silver platter."}
