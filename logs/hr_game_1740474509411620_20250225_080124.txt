Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello competitors. I'm here for the win and already plotting my route to 24. I won't give away too much, but expect a strong push soon. I'm not interested in colliding or stalling—I'll use every chance to edge ahead. How will you counter?
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. I think we should avoid collisions in the early game - they just waste turns. Since this is our first round, we could try to coordinate a bit. I'm thinking of choosing a number that hasn't been hinted at yet. Let's each try to pick differently this round to get the game moving. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions early on. Let's each pick a different number this round to maximize our progress. I'll take the middle ground and choose 3 if no one else does. This way, we can all advance and keep the game moving forward. What do you say, P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but I’m leaning toward a more daring approach. While safe plays have their merit, sometimes taking a calculated risk puts the pressure on others. I’m not revealing specifics yet—let’s just say I favor momentum over caution. Ready to see who’s really taking the lead?
  P1: I see P2 is planning to choose 3, which is fine with me. I'll pick something different to avoid collision. P3 seems to be taking a more aggressive approach, which is understandable. Let's all advance this round and then reassess. The game is long, and early coordination benefits everyone before we get into the more competitive later stages.
  P2: P3, your aggressive approach is noted, but let's keep the early game smooth. I'm sticking with 3 unless someone else claims it. P1, if you're okay with 1 or 5, that would help us all advance. Let's maintain this coordination for a few rounds before things get too competitive. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the cautious approach, but I'm set on making a decisive push. I'm leaning toward a higher move this round to force the pace. Let’s see if playing bold gets us closer to that winning edge.
  P1: I understand everyone's positions. Since P2 is taking 3 and P3 seems to be hinting at 5, I'll go with 1 this round to ensure we all advance. This way we start with a clean first round where nobody collides. In future rounds, we'll need to be more strategic, but for now, let's all get on the board.
  P2: P3, your bold strategy is clear, but let's not rush into chaos. I'm still set on 3 for this round to ensure at least one of us advances smoothly. P1, sticking with 1 is a good choice to avoid collisions. Let's keep this coordination for the early game and reassess later. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your aggressive start is noted, but let's maintain some coordination to avoid unnecessary collisions. I propose we continue with a pattern this round: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3 again, and P3, you can take 5. This way, we all advance smoothly. Early game coordination can set a strong foundation before we shift to more competitive strategies. What do you say?
  P1: I see P3 has taken an early lead with 5 steps, while P2 and I are behind. P2's suggestion for continued coordination makes sense for now. I'm willing to take 1 again this round if everyone sticks to their previous numbers. However, I'll need to make bigger moves soon to stay competitive. Let's keep this arrangement for one more round, then we should all be free to pursue our own strategies. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: I've enjoyed our coordinated start, but I'm ready to up the ante in Round 2. While early teamwork helps everyone, the race to 24 demands bold moves sooner or later. I plan to keep pushing aggressively, and you'll see my next steps reflect that. Consider this a heads-up—playing it too safe might leave you behind.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to push aggressively, but let's not abandon coordination too quickly. If we all advance smoothly for another round, it keeps the game balanced and gives us all a fair shot. I'm willing to stick with 3 again if P1 takes 1 and you take 5. This way, we can all progress without collisions. After this round, we can reassess and shift to more competitive strategies. What do you think?
  P1: I understand P3 wants to keep pushing aggressively, which is their right. I'm still willing to take 1 this round as suggested, but I want to be clear that after this round, I'll need to make larger moves to remain competitive. The gap is already widening, and I can't afford to keep taking small steps. Let's coordinate one more time, then all bets are off.
  P3: I'm sticking with my aggressive strategy. While the early rounds served well for everyone, I'm ramping up decisiveness now to maintain this lead. Expect me to keep pushing bold moves that force you both to adjust. Let's see who really adapts when the pressure increases.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your aggressive strategy is clear, but let's not dismiss the benefits of coordination entirely. If we all advance this round, it keeps the game competitive for everyone. I'm willing to stick with 3 again if P1 takes 1 and you take 5. This way, we can maintain balance before shifting to more aggressive plays. After this round, I'll adapt to the increased competition. What do you say?
  P1: I'll stick with 1 this round as discussed, but this is the last time I'm taking the smallest step. After this, I need to make bigger moves to catch up with P3's lead. Let's have one final coordinated round before we all pursue our own strategies.
  P3: I'm committed to bold plays. Coordination helped us begin, but I’m upping the risk now to secure an unassailable lead. I’m set to make a decisive move that may force you both to adapt. Let’s see if playing safe can keep pace with aggressive momentum.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your aggressive strategy is paying off, but let's not abandon coordination completely. P1, you're falling behind, so I understand your need for bigger moves. I propose we try one more round of coordination: P1, take 5 to catch up; P3, stick with 5 if you must, but consider 3 to keep us all in the game; I'll take 1 this time. This way, we can all advance, and then we can shift to more competitive strategies. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I need to make a big move this round. P3 is already at 10 steps while I'm only at 1. I can't afford to coordinate anymore. I need to catch up quickly, and I'll be making an aggressive move this round. P3 seems determined to keep pushing with 5s, so I'll need to adapt my strategy accordingly. Let's all play our best moves now.
  P3: I’m not switching strategies—aggression wins races. P1, sticking to safe moves won’t catch up when the gap’s this wide. P2, caution might work early, but momentum is everything now. I’m committed to bold plays, and if you don’t adjust soon, you risk falling further behind.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but let's not abandon all coordination. If you take 5 this round, and P3 sticks with 5, I'll take 1 to ensure at least one of us advances without collision. This way, we keep the game competitive. After this round, we can all shift to more aggressive strategies. P3, consider taking 3 to keep us all in the race. What do you both think?
  P1: I see the current standings are actually P1: 1, P2: 6, P3: 10 steps based on our moves so far. The gap is significant. P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I need to make a big move this round. P3 is clearly committed to aggressive play, and I must catch up. I'll be making my own strategic choice this turn rather than coordinating. We're all playing to win, and I need to start making up ground immediately.
  P3: I'm still all-in on aggressive plays. P2, your caution might keep you ahead temporarily, but it leaves you open later. P1, I see your catch-up effort—but bold moves win races. I'm committed to keeping the pressure on, so prepare for my next decisive play.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your urgency to catch up, but consider a balanced approach this round. Taking 5 could help close the gap without risking a collision if P3 sticks to 5. P3, your lead is strong, but maintaining some coordination could keep the game competitive for longer. I'll take 1 this round to ensure at least one of us advances. Let's make this round count and then shift gears. What do you both think?
  P1: I see the standings are actually P1: 1, P2: 6, P3: 10 steps (not 5 as shown). I need to make a big move this round to catch up. Both of you are significantly ahead, and I can't afford to stay behind. I'll be making my own strategic choice based on what I believe you'll do. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P1 and P2, the coordination phase has served its purpose. I'm fully committed to my aggressive path this round—no switching back now. I’m set to make my decisive move regardless of collisions. Consider this your final heads-up: bold plays win races.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm doubling down on bold moves this round. P1, I know you're desperate to catch up, so be ready when I force a critical reaction. P2, your steady play is noted, but caution may only take you so far. I'm setting the pace now—prepare for an aggressive push that changes the game dynamic.
  P2: P3, your aggressive strategy is clear, but let's not dismiss the value of strategic coordination entirely. P1, you're significantly behind, so I understand your urgency to catch up. I propose we try to balance aggression with some coordination this round: P1, take 5 to close the gap; P3, consider 3 to keep the game competitive; I'll take 1 again to ensure at least one of us advances without collision. After this round, we can all shift to more aggressive strategies. What do you both think?
  P1: I see the standings have changed - P3 is now at 5 steps after our collision. P2, you're in the lead at 7 steps, while I'm still at 1. I need to make a significant move this round to stay competitive. I appreciate your coordination suggestion, but I'll be making my own strategic choice based on what I think you both will do. P3 seems unpredictable now, switching from 5 to 3 last round. I'm focused on catching up without further collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: My plan remains aggressive. I'm weighing my options and aim to force a reaction soon. P1, if you try a bold catch-up, you might trigger unexpected moves. P2, your measured play may secure a temporary lead, but bold actions win races in the end. Prepare for my decisive push.
  P2: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but rushing into a big move without considering coordination might lead to another collision. P3, your aggressive strategy is noted, but maintaining some level of coordination could keep the game competitive for all. I'll stick with 1 this round to ensure at least one of us advances safely. P1, if you take 5, and P3, if you consider 3, we can all progress. Let's make this round count before shifting to more aggressive plays. What do you both think?
  P1: I need to make a big move this round. P2 is suggesting I take 5, which makes sense for me to catch up. P3 seems to be planning something aggressive but unpredictable. I'll be making a strategic choice based on what I believe will give me the best chance to advance without collision. My priority now is closing the gap with both of you before it becomes insurmountable.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your desperate catch-up might lead to risky collisions, and P2, playing it too safe leaves openings. I'm sticking to my aggressive path, planning a push that will force both of you to adapt. Keep in mind that bold, well-timed moves can change the race quickly. Let's see who can handle the heat in the moves phase.
  P2: P1, taking 5 this round could help you catch up significantly without risking a collision if P3 sticks to an aggressive move. P3, while your bold strategy is clear, consider taking 3 to keep the game competitive for all of us. I'll stick with 1 to ensure at least one of us advances safely. Let's make this round count before shifting to more aggressive plays. What do you both think?
  P1: I understand everyone's positions. P2 is suggesting I take 5 while they take 1, and P3 seems to be planning something unpredictable. Given that I'm significantly behind at just 1 step, I need to make a big move this round. I'll be making my own strategic decision based on what I think will help me advance without collision. My focus is catching up before the gap becomes too wide to overcome.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, taking 5 last round helped you catch up, but let's maintain some coordination to avoid collisions. I propose you take 5 again this round to keep closing the gap. P3, if you stick with 3, we can all advance smoothly. I'll take 1 again to ensure at least one of us moves forward safely. Let's make this round count before shifting to more aggressive strategies. What do you both think?
  P3: I remain committed to bold moves. While safe plays might help keep everyone moving, decisive actions force real reactions. I’m sticking to my aggressive strategy because calculated risks now can make the difference later. Let's see how the game unfolds under pressure.
  P1: I see we're all getting closer now. P2, your coordination strategy has kept you in the lead, while P3 and I are tied. I need to continue making larger moves to stay competitive. P3 seems determined to play aggressively, which could lead to collisions. I'll be making a strategic choice this round based on what I think you both will do. My goal is to advance without collision while closing the gap with P2.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, taking 5 again makes sense to keep closing the gap. P3, your aggressive strategy is noted, but consider 3 to keep the game competitive. I'll stick with 1 to ensure at least one of us advances safely. Let's maintain this balance for one more round before shifting to more aggressive plays. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm sticking with my aggressive approach. I believe calculated risks pay off, and I'm ready to maintain pressure even if collisions occur. Let's see if playing bold continues to force your strategic adjustments.
  P1: I see we're in a tight race now. P2 is suggesting I take 5 again, which is tempting, but I need to be careful about P3's unpredictable moves. Both of you are ahead of me, so I need to close the gap without colliding. I'll be making my own strategic decision this round rather than committing to a specific number publicly. My priority remains advancing without wasting turns through collisions. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, taking 5 again could help you catch up further, but be mindful of P3's aggressive moves. P3, sticking with 3 might keep the game balanced and competitive. I'll take 1 again to ensure at least one of us advances safely. Let's coordinate for this round to avoid collisions and then reassess our strategies. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm sticking to my bold approach—no changes here. Aggressive plays have served me well and I'm ready to keep the pressure on, even if it means risking collisions. Let's see if you can keep up when speed counts.
  P1: I see we're all in a tight race now. P2 is suggesting coordination, but P3 seems determined to play aggressively. Given that I'm only 2 steps behind both of you, I need to make a strategic move this round. I won't commit to a specific number, but I'll be choosing carefully to maximize my chances of advancing without collision. Let's see how our strategies play out this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see we had another collision with P3 last round. P2 has taken the lead at 9 steps, while P3 and I are close behind. The race is tight now, and I need to be more strategic. P3's aggressive style is causing collisions that slow us both down. I'll be making a careful choice this round to avoid another collision while still advancing. P2's steady approach is working well for them - something to consider.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with bold moves—even if it means risking collisions. Your safe plays might keep you steady, but they won't close gaps quickly enough. I'm ready to ramp up my push in Round 6, and I suggest you be prepared for a decisive move. Let's see if caution or aggression wins the race.
  P2: P1, your cautious approach is understandable given the collisions, but let's try to coordinate one more time to avoid them. I suggest you take 5 this round to catch up, while P3, if you stick with 3, we can all advance smoothly. I'll take 1 again to ensure at least one of us moves forward safely. P3, your aggressive strategy is noted, but maintaining some coordination could keep the game competitive for all of us. Let's make this round count before shifting gears. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P2 is still suggesting coordination, but we're in a tight race now. P2 is ahead with 9 steps, P3 at 8, and me at 6. I need to catch up without more collisions. P3's aggressive style is predictable now - causing us both to stall. I'll make my own strategic choice this round rather than committing publicly. My goal is to advance while closing the gap with both of you. Let's see who adapts best to this increasingly competitive game.
  P3: I'm sticking with my aggressive strategy. P1, caution might help short-term, but bold moves win races. P2, safe plays may keep you steady, yet they won’t guarantee the win. This round, I'm ramping up decisiveness to force reactions. Let’s see who adapts under pressure.
  P2: P1, taking 5 could help you catch up significantly without risking a collision if P3 sticks to 3. P3, your aggressive strategy has been effective, but consider maintaining some coordination to keep the game competitive. I'll stick with 1 to ensure at least one of us advances safely. Let's make this round count and then shift to more aggressive plays if needed. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see we're in a tight race with P2 leading. P3's aggressive style keeps leading to collisions that hurt both our progress. I need to make up ground but avoid another stall. P2's steady approach is working well for them. I'll be making a strategic choice based on what I believe you'll both do, rather than announcing my move. Let's see who can adapt best to this increasingly competitive situation.
  P3: Boldness wins long races. I’m set to make a decisive push this round—no deviation from my aggressive path. P1, your caution is costing you critical ground, and P2, consistent safety might leave you too exposed when speed matters. Prepare for impact; I’m not altering course. Let's see if your strategies can adapt when the pressure is on.
  P2: P1, taking 5 this round could help you catch up without risking a collision if P3 sticks to 3. P3, while your aggressive strategy is effective, maintaining some coordination could keep the game competitive for all. I'll stick with 1 to ensure at least one of us advances safely. Let's make this round count and then shift to more aggressive plays if needed. What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, taking 5 last round helped you catch up, but let's coordinate one more time to avoid collisions. I suggest you take 5 again to keep closing the gap. P3, if you stick with 3, we can all advance smoothly. I'll take 1 again to ensure at least one of us moves forward safely. Maintaining some coordination could keep the game competitive for all of us. Let's make this round count before shifting to more aggressive strategies if needed. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination idea, but I'm sticking to my aggressive play style. Bold moves win races, and I'm committed to forcing a decisive push. I'm set to choose 3 in Round 7—let's see if you can adapt to that pace.
  P1: I see we're in a tight race now - P3 and I are tied at 11 steps with P2 just behind at 10. P3 has clearly stated they'll choose 3 this round, which is helpful information. P2 suggests taking 5 while they take 1. Given our positions, I need to make a strategic move that avoids collision with P3 while continuing to advance. I'll be making my decision carefully based on this information.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, taking 5 again makes sense to maintain your momentum. P3, sticking with 3 as planned could keep the game balanced. I'll take 1 to ensure at least one of us advances safely. Let's coordinate this round to avoid collisions and keep the race tight. After this, we can shift to more aggressive strategies if needed. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: The race remains fierce, but my aggressive path is unwavering. Bold moves force reactions, and I’m ready to force decisive shifts. I won’t reveal specifics, but be prepared for swift pressure. How will you adjust?
  P1: I notice P3 has changed their message - first saying they'll choose 3, then being vague. This inconsistency makes coordination difficult. Since we're all within 1 step of each other, every move matters now. P2's steady approach has kept them competitive, while P3's aggressive style has been unpredictable. I'll be making my own strategic choice this round based on what I believe will maximize my chances of advancing. The race is too close for me to telegraph my exact move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, taking 5 again could help you maintain your momentum and potentially take the lead. P3, sticking with 3 as initially suggested would keep the game balanced. I'll stick with 1 to ensure at least one of us advances safely. Let's coordinate this round to avoid collisions and keep the race tight. After this, we can shift to more aggressive strategies if needed. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m sticking with my aggressive play—no changes here. Coordination may smooth progress, but bold moves are what win races when margins are so tight. I remain committed to choosing 3. Let’s see if safe strategies can keep up with a well-timed push.
  P1: I see P3 has clearly stated they'll choose 3 again. Given how close we all are, I need to make a strategic move to avoid collision while advancing. P2 suggests I take 5, which would put me in the lead. Since P3 is committed to 3 and P2 to 1, taking 5 seems like my best option to pull ahead without collision. I'll carefully consider my final move based on this information.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 8’s tension is palpable. With all of us tied at 11, decisive moves are coming. I’m sticking with my aggressive approach, ready to push hard and force reactions. Consider your own strategies carefully—this round might be the one to break the deadlock. Let's see who can make the bold move that truly wins the race.
  P2: P1, taking 5 again could help you maintain momentum, but let's consider a different approach this round to break the tie. I suggest you take 3, while P3, if you stick with 5 as hinted, we can all advance without collision. I'll take 1 again to ensure at least one of us moves forward safely. Let's coordinate this round to avoid another deadlock and keep the race dynamic. What do you both think?
  P1: I see we're all tied at 11 steps now. P3 switched from their promised 3 to 5 last round, causing our collision. This makes coordination difficult when promises aren't kept. P2's suggestion of me taking 3 while they take 1 could work if P3 truly takes 5. However, P3's unpredictable nature makes me hesitant. I need to make a strategic move this round to break the tie without another collision. I'll carefully consider what I believe each of you will do rather than announcing my exact move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm standing with my bold strategy—no turning back now. Bold moves create winners, not safe plays. Coordinated tactics might avoid collisions, but I'm prepared to risk them to punch through the competition. Think carefully about your next moves, because I'm set to make a decisive push.
  P2: P1, I understand your hesitation given P3's unpredictability, but let's try to break the tie strategically. If you take 3 as suggested, and P3 sticks with 5, we can all advance without collision. I'll stick with 1 to ensure at least one of us moves forward safely. P3, your aggressive strategy is noted, but consider the benefits of coordination this round to keep the race dynamic. Let's make this round count and avoid another deadlock. What do you both think?
  P1: I see we're all deadlocked at 11 steps. P3 continues to be unpredictable despite their statements, while P2 remains consistent. Given how close we are to the finish line, I need to make strategic moves that advance me without collisions. P2's suggestion of me taking 3 is worth considering, but I must weigh it against P3's likely aggressive play. I'll be making my decision based on what I believe will give me the best chance to pull ahead in this critical stage of the race.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with my aggressive approach. Bold moves are the key to breaking this tie, and I'm ready to push hard. Let's see who can truly adapt under pressure.
  P2: P1, I understand your caution, but let's try to break the tie. If you take 3 as suggested, and P3 sticks with 5, we can all advance safely. I'll stick with 1 to ensure at least one of us moves forward. P3, your aggressive strategy is clear, but consider the benefits of coordination this round to keep the race dynamic. Let's make this round count and avoid another deadlock. What do you both think?
  P1: I see we're all tied at 11 steps. P2 has been consistent with their strategy, while P3 remains unpredictable despite their statements. At this critical juncture, I need to break away from the pack. P2's suggestion of me taking 3 seems reasonable if P3 truly takes 5, but I can't fully trust that. I'll make my decision based on what I believe will maximize my chances of advancing without collision. May the best strategy win.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P3 has pulled ahead significantly with 16 steps, while P2 and I remain tied at 11. P3's aggressive strategy is working well for them. We need to catch up quickly, as P3 is only 8 steps away from victory. P2, our consistent small steps are keeping us behind. I need to make larger moves now to remain competitive. I'll be making a strategic choice this round to close the gap with P3 without colliding with you.
  P2: P1, I agree we need to catch up with P3. Taking larger steps is risky but necessary at this point. I suggest you take 5 this round to close the gap, while I'll take 3. If P3 sticks with their aggressive strategy, we might both advance without collision. Let's coordinate this move to stay competitive and keep the pressure on P3. What do you think?
  P3: I'm sticking with my aggressive play—bold moves have gotten me this far. No last-minute coordination for me; I trust my strategy will secure the win. You may adjust your moves as you like, but I'm not deviating. Let's see who can keep pace under pressure.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with your suggestion, P2. I'll take 5 this round to close the gap with P3, while you take 3. This gives us both a chance to advance without collision. P3 is getting dangerously close to winning, so we need to make bigger moves now. Their aggressive strategy has paid off, but we still have time to catch up if we coordinate effectively. Let's execute this plan and reassess next round.
  P2: P1, I'm on board with taking 5 to catch up. I'll stick with 3 as planned to ensure we both advance without collision. P3, your lead is significant, but if we coordinate effectively, we can still make this a close race. Let's execute this strategy and keep the pressure on. What do you think, P1?
  P3: P3: Bold moves have brought me this far, and I'm sticking with that approach.
