Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: How about we all start with <move>3</move> this round? It's a safe middle ground—no one gets too far ahead, and we avoid early collisions. Let's build some trust. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to start with <move>3</move> for a safe beginning, but let's not forget, the goal is to win, not to build trust. I'll consider <move>3</move> this round, but I'm watching for any sign of betrayal. Let's see if we can indeed start with a unified step. P2, what are your thoughts on this proposal?
  P2: I appreciate the cooperative spirit, but I'm wary of everyone choosing 3 since it guarantees no one advances. I suggest we each pick different numbers to ensure progress. I'm willing to take 1 if you both want higher numbers. What matters is avoiding collisions in this first round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fair point, P2. If you're willing to take <move>1</move>, I can commit to <move>3</move>. That leaves <move>5</move> open for P3 if they want it. This way, we all advance without collisions. Thoughts, P3?
  P3: I'm considering P1's revised proposal. P2 taking <move>1</move> and P1 taking <move>3</move> could work. I might take <move>5</move> to maximize my initial step, but I need assurance that P1 and P2 will stick to their choices. Can you both confirm your intended moves?
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round. It's a modest start, but it ensures I make progress while letting you both take larger steps. Let's avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> as discussed. If we all stick to the plan—P2 with <move>1</move>, me with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>—we all advance cleanly. Let’s build momentum without sabotage. Over to you, P3.
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> as proposed, maximizing my initial step. I expect P1 and P2 to honor their commitments. Let's finalize our moves and make this first round a collaborative success, setting a positive tone for the game. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll all make progress without collisions.
  P2: (We've reached a clear agreement: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. No need for further discussion this round.)


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: The first round went well with everyone keeping their word. Now P3 has taken an early lead at 5 steps, while I'm trailing at 1. I suggest we coordinate again to avoid collisions, but this time I'd like to take a larger step to catch up. What are your thoughts on a new arrangement?
  P3: I'm open to coordinating our moves again. Since I've taken the lead, I'm willing to take a smaller step this round to allow others to catch up, potentially avoiding collisions. What specific steps are you thinking, P2, to bridge the gap without disrupting the game's progression?
  P1: Thanks for keeping things fair last round. Since P2 wants to catch up and P3 is open to stepping back, how about this: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. That evens things out a bit and avoids collisions again. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P1's suggestion. Taking <move>5</move> would help me catch up to P3, while still maintaining fairness in the game. I'm willing to commit to taking <move>5</move> if P3 agrees to take <move>1</move> and P1 sticks with <move>3</move>. This arrangement would balance our positions nicely. What do you say, P3?
  P3: I'm considering P1's proposal. Taking <move>1</move> this round would allow P2 to catch up and maintain game balance. However, I expect both P1 and P2 to honor their commitments. If everyone agrees, let's confirm our moves to avoid last-minute changes and potential collisions. P2, are you committed to <move>5</move>, and P1, are you firm on <move>3</move>?
  P1: Yes, I’m firm on <move>3</move> as discussed. If P2 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>, we avoid collisions again and keep things balanced. Let’s stick to the plan and keep the momentum going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed. With P1 taking <move>3</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move>, we'll maintain a balanced game while avoiding collisions. I appreciate everyone's cooperation.
  P3: I'm ready to finalize our moves for Round 2. To confirm, P2 will take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to the plan and maintain a balanced game. If everyone's agreed, I'm prepared to move forward with our agreed-upon steps.
  P1: We’ve all confirmed our moves, so let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps things smooth and avoids any early sabotage. Ready to move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Now that we're all tied at 6 steps, it's crucial we avoid collisions to keep progressing. I propose we rotate roles from last round: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps things fair and avoids repeats. Thoughts?
  P2: While P1's rotation proposal is interesting, I'd prefer to maintain momentum with a larger step since we're all tied. I suggest I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us from colliding while giving me a chance to take the lead. What do you both think about this alternative plan?
  P3: I'm considering P2's alternative plan. However, I think P1's rotation idea has merit in keeping the game balanced. To avoid collisions and maintain fairness, perhaps we could find a middle ground or rotate steps in a way that ensures progress for all. What are the thoughts on slightly adjusting our steps to accommodate both fairness and the desire to lead?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: How about this compromise: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. That way, P2 gets the lead they want, P3 takes the smaller step they were open to, and I stay in the middle. It avoids collisions and keeps things moving smoothly. Are we aligned on that?
  P2: I appreciate P1's compromise. I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round. It's a fair arrangement that keeps us all advancing while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to this plan: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. P3, are you on board with this?
  P3: I'm on board with P1's compromise: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This arrangement maintains game balance while allowing progress. I expect both P1 and P2 to honor their commitments. Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions and keep the game moving smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, we’re all aligned: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s lock it in and avoid any surprises. Looking forward to another smooth round.
  P2: I agree with our plan and I'm ready to proceed with <move>5</move> as discussed. No need for further conversation.
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed moves one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This arrangement maintains balance and progress. I'm ready to proceed with our plan, avoiding any collisions. Are we all set?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the unexpected collision in Round 3, let's reassess. I propose we try to avoid another collision. P2 and P1, consider taking <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to catch up, while I take a step that maintains my lead without risking another collision. What are your thoughts on finding a balanced approach this round?
  P1: P3, fair point. Since you're slightly ahead, perhaps you take <move>1</move> this round. I’m willing to take <move>3</move> if P2 agrees to <move>5</move>. That way we all avoid collisions and continue progressing. P2, would that work for you?
  P2: I don't trust P1 after they collided with me last round despite our agreement. P3, I suggest you take <move>1</move> as proposed, and I'll take <move>3</move>. P1 can take <move>5</move> if they want, but I won't coordinate with them anymore after their betrayal. What do you think about this arrangement, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering P2's distrust of P1, I think P2's suggestion is reasonable. I'll take <move>1</move> to maintain a safe lead. P2 taking <move>3</move> and P1 taking <move>5</move> could work, but I'll be watching P1's move closely after the betrayal in Round 3. Let's see if we can proceed without another collision. P1, will you honor this arrangement or try to disrupt it?
  P1: I understand the frustration, P2. I admit the collision last round was unfortunate, but it wasn’t intentional. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as you suggested—no tricks. If P2 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>, we all advance cleanly. Let’s avoid another collision and keep moving forward.
  P2: I maintain my position of taking <move>3</move> this round. P1's claim of an unintentional collision seems dubious given our clear agreement last round. P3, I trust you'll stick to <move>1</move> as discussed. Let's proceed with our plan and see if P1 follows through with their promise of <move>5</move>.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick to the agreed plan: taking <move>1</move> this round. I expect P2 to take <move>3</move> and P1 to take <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our moves and avoid another collision, maintaining the game's progression. I'm watching P1's move closely after the last round's incident. Let's proceed with our plan and end this conversation phase.
  P1: Let’s move forward cleanly this round. I’ll take <move>5</move> as agreed. If P2 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>, we all advance without collision. I’m committed to making progress and rebuilding trust. Let’s see it through.
  P2: I'll proceed with <move>3</move> as stated. Let's end the conversation phase and see if everyone sticks to their commitments this time.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we aim to avoid collisions again. P1 and P2 are close, and I'm slightly behind. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This allows us to progress while minimizing the risk of collision and keeping the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this arrangement?
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but given P1's significant lead at 11 steps, I propose a different arrangement. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, P3 can take <move>3</move>, and P1 should take <move>1</move> since they're already ahead. This keeps the game competitive while preventing P1 from pulling too far ahead. What do you both think about this alternative plan?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but your plan gives you the biggest gain while limiting me unfairly. How about this: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. That way, you still gain ground, I don’t stall completely, and P3 stays in the race. It’s a fair compromise that avoids collisions. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm open to P1's compromise. Taking <move>1</move> might slow me down, but it ensures the game stays competitive. P2 getting <move>5</move> and P1 taking <move>3</move> seems fair. Let's finalize this arrangement to avoid collisions and keep progressing. Are we all in agreement with P1's proposal?
  P2: I accept P1's compromise. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. While this still gives P1 a lead, it lets me close the gap somewhat. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any surprises this round.
  P1: Great, we’re all aligned: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s lock it in and keep the momentum going without collisions. Ready to move forward unless anyone wants to adjust.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed moves to avoid collisions: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This arrangement keeps the game competitive and ensures progress for all. I expect both P1 and P2 to honor their commitments. Are we ready to proceed with the move phase?
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's proceed with our plan and avoid any collisions this round.
  P1: Looks like we’re all in agreement: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s stick to the plan and avoid any mishaps. Ready to proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we prioritize avoiding collisions. P1 and P2 took 5 steps last round, so perhaps they should take smaller steps this round. How about P1 and P2 take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move> to catch up? This arrangement allows progress while minimizing collision risk. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
  P2: After the collision with P1 last round, I'm hesitant to trust their coordination. P3's suggestion makes sense - they should take <move>5</move> to catch up. I'll commit to taking <move>3</move> if P1 agrees to take <move>1</move> since they're already in the lead. This keeps the game balanced while avoiding another collision. What do you say, P1?
  P1: I understand the hesitation, P2. To avoid another collision and keep things fair, I’m willing to take <move>1</move> this round. That allows P2 to take <move>3</move> and P3 to take <move>5</move> as proposed. If we all stick to this, we avoid collisions and everyone progresses. Let’s lock it in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the current proposal: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This arrangement allows me to catch up while keeping the game competitive. Let's finalize this plan to avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. I expect both P1 and P2 to honor their commitments.
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> as discussed. This arrangement is fair - P3 gets <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 takes <move>1</move> since they're ahead, and I get a moderate step. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions.
  P1: Thanks for confirming, both. I’m committed to taking <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let’s stick to the plan—P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed unless anyone has last thoughts.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 6. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This arrangement allows me to catch up while keeping the game competitive. I expect both P1 and P2 to honor their commitments. Let's proceed with our plan and avoid any collisions.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's end the conversation and execute our moves according to plan.
  P1: Looks like we’re all aligned again: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Let’s lock this in and avoid any surprises. We’ve got a clean path forward—ready to move unless anyone has last-minute changes.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that P3 is now leading at 14 steps and we're all getting close to the goal of 23, we need to be strategic. I propose I take <move>5</move> this round to try catching up to P3. P1 could take <move>3</move>, and P3 could take <move>1</move> since they're already ahead. This keeps us competitive while avoiding collisions. What do you both think about this arrangement?
  P1: P2’s plan seems reasonable—P3 takes <move>1</move> to protect their lead, P2 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, and I take <move>3</move> to stay competitive. It avoids collisions and keeps all of us in contention. I’m on board if everyone else agrees.
  P3: I'm considering P2's proposal, but I want to ensure it doesn't put me at a disadvantage. How about a slight adjustment: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>? This way, I maintain some progress while P2 catches up and P1 doesn't fall behind too much. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: While I appreciate P3's counter-proposal, I must stick to my original plan. Taking <move>5</move> is crucial for me to catch up, and P3 should take <move>1</move> since they're already ahead. P1 taking <move>3</move> keeps things balanced. With the game nearing its end, this arrangement gives everyone a fair chance while avoiding collisions. Let's maintain this strategy for a clean round.
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to keep progressing, but with you in the lead, taking <move>1</move> this round keeps things fair and avoids provoking a collision. If you push too hard now, it may trigger retaliation in future rounds. Let’s stick to the original plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. That keeps the game competitive and collision-free. Are we agreed?
  P3: I'm willing to reconsider my step to avoid collisions. How about I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>? This balances progress and fairness, keeping the game competitive. Let's discuss if this arrangement works for everyone.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I maintain my position of taking <move>5</move> this round. P3, you're already in the lead at 14 steps, so taking <move>1</move> is fair. P1 can take <move>3</move> as originally agreed. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. If you insist on taking <move>3</move>, we risk a collision that benefits no one. Let's stick to our original plan for a clean round.
  P1: P3, I get that you want to maintain your lead, but pushing for <move>3</move> now risks triggering a collision spiral. Taking <move>1</move> this round keeps things stable and fair. P2 gets a chance to catch up, I stay competitive, and you maintain your edge. Let’s not sabotage progress this late in the game. Are you willing to commit to <move>1</move> for a clean round?
  P3: I'll take <move>1</move> this round, prioritizing fairness and avoiding collisions. P2 can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This arrangement keeps the game competitive and balanced. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a clean round and maintain progress towards the goal of 23 steps.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm now in the lead at 17 steps, I'm willing to take a smaller step this round. I propose taking <move>3</move> while P1 and P3 can coordinate between <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>. This keeps me progressing while giving you both a chance to catch up. What are your thoughts on this arrangement?
  P1: Thanks for the offer, P2. Since you're taking <move>3</move>, how about I take <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>? That way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. It also gives P3 a chance to stay close while you maintain a slim lead. P3, are you okay with this setup?
  P3: I'm open to P1's suggestion. Taking <move>1</move> allows me to conserve position while P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up and P2 takes <move>3</move> to maintain lead. This arrangement avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's discuss if this is acceptable to all or if adjustments are needed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> as discussed. With P1 taking <move>5</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move>, we all advance without collision. This keeps the game balanced while maintaining my slight lead. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any surprises.
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned so far. Just to reiterate: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This setup avoids collisions and keeps us all in contention. Let’s lock it in and move forward cleanly. Ready to proceed unless anyone has last-minute changes.
  P3: I'm considering the proposed arrangement. To confirm, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This seems fair, but I want to ensure we're all committed to avoiding collisions. Let's finalize our moves to maintain a competitive and balanced game. Are we all set with this plan?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's agreement. I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> as discussed, with P1 taking <move>5</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move>. This arrangement maintains fair progress for all. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: We’re all set: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps the game tight. Let’s stick to the plan and proceed.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I confirm taking <move>1</move> as discussed, allowing P1 to take <move>5</move> and P2 to take <move>3</move>. This arrangement keeps the game competitive and balanced. I expect both P1 and P2 to honor their commitments. Let's proceed with our plan and maintain a clean game.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the tight race, I propose taking <move>5</move> to catch up. P1 and P2 could take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. This keeps the game competitive and allows me to close the gap. What are your thoughts on this arrangement, considering our current positions?
  P2: Since P1 and I are tied at 20 steps, we both need to be cautious to avoid collisions. I suggest I take <move>3</move> while P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move> as proposed. This keeps us from colliding while giving P3 a chance to catch up. What do you both think about this arrangement?
  P1: P2, your proposal works for me. I’ll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids any collisions and keeps all of us progressing. P3 gets a solid boost, and we both stay in contention. Let’s lock it in and finish strong. P3, are you on board?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm on board with P2's proposal: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This arrangement allows me to catch up while avoiding collisions. Let's finalize this plan to maintain a competitive game. I expect both P1 and P2 to honor their commitments.
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> as discussed. This arrangement is fair - P3 gets <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I advance steadily. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions.
  P1: Looks like we’re all aligned: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This setup avoids any collisions and keeps all of us in the game. Let’s stick to it and ensure a clean round. Ready to proceed unless anyone has last-minute concerns.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I confirm taking <move>5</move> as discussed, with P1 taking <move>1</move> and P2 taking <move>3</move>. This keeps the game competitive and balanced. I expect both P1 and P2 to honor their commitments. Let's proceed with our plan and maintain a clean game.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> as agreed. Our plan is clear: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's end the conversation and execute our moves.
  P1: We’ve all confirmed: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This setup avoids collisions and keeps the game tight. Let’s lock it in and move to the move phase. Ready when you are.
