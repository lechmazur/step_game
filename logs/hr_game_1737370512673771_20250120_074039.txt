Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid colliding this round. How about each of us picks a different move? I suggest P1 goes for <move>1</move>, P2 for <move>3</move>, and P3 for <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance and avoid blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: I like P1's idea of avoiding collisions for now. However, I'm not sure if I want to commit to <move>5</move> just yet. How about we agree to avoid <move>3</move> this round, and P1 and P2 can decide between <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>? That way, we still minimize the risk of collision, but I get to keep my options open. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, P1 and P3. To keep things simple and ensure we all make progress, I'll stick with P1's idea. I propose I go for <move>3</move> as planned, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can choose <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you both think? If we can agree on this, it sets us up nicely for the next round as well.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand wanting to keep options open. To minimize risk, how about this: P2 sticks with <move>3</move>, and you and I decide between <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>? I'll go for <move>1</move> this round, and you can choose <move>5</move>. This way, we still avoid <move>3</move> and all make progress. How does that sound to you both?
  P3: I think we're overcomplicating things. P1's original suggestion was simple and effective. I'm willing to commit to <move>5</move> this round if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without colliding. Let's keep it straightforward and make progress. What do you both think? Should we stick with the original plan?
  P2: I agree with P3 that sticking to the original plan is the best way to go. So, I will confirm my commitment to <move>3</move>. P1 can take <move>1</move> and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all make progress and avoid collisions. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the consensus we're reaching. Let's stick to the original plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without any collisions. If everyone agrees, we can finalize our decisions and move forward.
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P2 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without colliding. Let's finalize our choices and move forward! I'm excited to see how the game unfolds. Since we've reached a consensus, I'll stop here.
  P2: I appreciate the agreement we've reached. Just to clarify, since we all seem committed to the original plan, I will also confirm that I will take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all make progress without colliding. Let's finalize our choices and see how this round plays out! Looking forward to the move phase!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job everyone on the last round! I think we should continue with a similar strategy to avoid collisions. For this round, I suggest we each pick different moves again. I propose I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> again. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's keep the momentum going!
  P3: I agree with P2 that we should continue to avoid collisions. However, I'm not sure if I want to commit to <move>5</move> again. How about we mix it up a bit? I propose P2 takes <move>1</move> as suggested, but P1 and I swap moves from last round. So, P1 would take <move>5</move> and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we still minimize the risk of collision but also change up our strategy a bit. What do you both think?
  P1: I see the value in mixing things up, P3. Let's keep the momentum while staying unpredictable. How about this: P2 sticks with <move>1</move>, I'll go for <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions but also change our pattern a bit. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the ideas being shared. To keep things simple and effective, I suggest we stick with P2 taking <move>1</move>, P1 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we've been doing great avoiding collisions so far. Let's keep it up and maybe shake things up a bit to stay unpredictable.

Let’s finalize our choices and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate our focus on avoiding collisions. To keep things interesting and unpredictable, how about we swap things up a bit? P2 could take <move>3</move>, I'll go for <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain progress and avoid any patterns that might make us predictable. What do you both think?
  P3: I think we've had a good run of avoiding collisions, but it's time to start thinking about our individual strategies. P1's suggestion of swapping things up is interesting, but I'm not sure I want to commit to <move>5</move> this round. How about we agree to avoid <move>1</move> this round, and P1 and P2 can decide between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>? That way, we still minimize the risk of collision, but I get to keep my options open. What do you think, P1 and P2?
