This creates a perfect three-way tie at 21 steps, setting up an exciting final round. For Round 8, I agree we should each pick different moves to avoid collisions. Since we'll all be at 21, whoever chooses 5 will win outright at 26 steps. We could discuss who gets which move in the next conversation phase."}
