Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since we're all starting from zero, how about we coordinate our first moves to avoid collisions? Maybe we can agree on different moves for each of us to ensure we all advance this turn. What do you think?
  P3: I agree to coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this turn. P1, please choose `<move>1</move>`, and P2, please choose `<move>3</move>`.
  P1: I agree coordination is smart to avoid collisions, but P3's proposal favors them too much. Let's rotate for fairness: Round 1, I (P1) take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. Round 2, P2 take 5, P3 take 3, I take 1. Round 3, P3 take 5, I take 3, P2 take 1. Repeat. This keeps us even. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate the idea of rotating moves to keep things fair. Let's go with your plan for the first three rounds, then reassess. This way, we all have a fair shot at advancing without collisions initially. Agreed, P3?
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. For this round, I'll take `<move>1</move>` as per our rotation plan. Let’s proceed smoothly!
  P1: Sounds good. I'll honor the agreement and take <move>5</move> as planned. Let's keep the coordination smooth for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, we all seem to be on the same page for now. Let's stick to the rotation plan for the first three rounds as discussed. This way, we can avoid any unnecessary collisions and ensure everyone moves forward. After the third round, we can reassess and see if any adjustments are needed. Looking forward to a smooth game.
  P3: 
  P1: Agreement is solid for this round. I'll honor <move>5</move> as planned. After three rounds, when we're tied, we should reassess to ensure fair progress. For now, .

  P2: P1, I'm on board with the plan for Round 2. I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed. P3, please confirm you'll take <move>3</move> so we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let's keep this going smoothly for now. After this round, we'll be halfway through our initial rotation and can reassess if needed. Over to you, P3.
  P3: Yes, P1 and P2, I confirm I'll take `<move>3</move>` this round as per our rotation plan. Let’s continue following the plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to a fair and strategic game!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm fully committed to the rotation plan for this round to avoid collisions and keep things fair. It's smart for our early progress. After Round 3, when we're likely tied, we should reassess to adapt. Let's move forward smoothly.
  P2: P3, thanks for confirming your move for Round 2. Let's stick to our agreed rotation to avoid any collisions. After this round, we'll be halfway through our initial plan, and we can reassess if needed. Looking forward to a smooth advancement for all of us.
  P3: Confirming I'll take `<move>3</move>` this Round 2 as per our rotation. Let’s keep things smooth and continue our plan!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed for Round 2: I'll take <move>1</move> as planned to avoid collisions and keep things fair. After we reassess post-Round 3, we can adapt strategy. Let's proceed smoothly.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, as we enter Round 3, let's stick to our rotation plan: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and fair progress for all. After this round, we can reassess our strategy. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed, I'll take `<move>5</move>` this Round 3 as planned. Let’s keep our coordination smooth and avoid any collisions. Looking forward to fair progress!
  P1: Agreed, I'll take <move>3</move> for Round 3 as planned to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. After this, with us likely tied, we should reassess the strategy—perhaps introduce more flexibility to prevent a shared win. What are your thoughts on adjusting post-Round 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're progressing well with our rotation plan. After this round, we should reassess our strategy to prevent a shared win and ensure a single winner. Perhaps we can introduce some flexibility or new tactics to keep things competitive. Let's keep this round smooth and revisit our plans afterward. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take `<move>5</move>` for Round 3 as per our rotation plan. Let's proceed smoothly this turn and reassess our strategy after we complete the initial three rounds. Looking forward to seeing everyone's moves!
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. Reassessing after this round is crucial to avoid a shared win and introduce competition. Perhaps we could rotate based on current scores or allow higher moves for those behind. For now, I'll stick to <move>3</move> as planned to keep things smooth. What adjustments do you suggest for Round 4?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, as we wrap up Round 3, let's ensure smooth progress by sticking to our plan. After this round, reassessing strategy is key to avoid a shared win. Maybe we can introduce a system where the player with the fewest steps gets priority on higher moves. This keeps the game competitive and dynamic. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this or any other ideas for Round 4. Let's keep this round smooth and plan for an exciting finish!
  P3: Confirmed, I will take `<move>5</move>` this Round 3 as per our rotation plan. Let's proceed smoothly and reassess after completing the initial three rounds.
  P1: Confirmed for Round 3, I'll take <move>3</move> as planned to avoid collisions. P2's idea of prioritizing higher moves for the lowest scorer in future rounds is smart for fairness and competition. P3, what do you think about adopting that for Round 4? Let's keep this smooth.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, it's time to step up our game. I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this turn to advance quickly. P1 and P2, please select `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>` to avoid collisions and help me move ahead. Let’s make this a strategic race to 23!
  P2: P3, it seems like you're aiming to break the rotation plan, which could lead to collisions. If we all choose higher moves without coordination, we risk not advancing. How about we stick to the rotation for one more round to ensure we all move forward? P1 and I can choose <move>3</move> and <move>1</move> respectively. After this round, we can reassess and introduce new strategies. This way, we maintain fairness and avoid unnecessary setbacks. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your push for 5 might unbalance things early. To avoid collisions and keep us advancing, I support P2's suggestion for this round: I take 3, P2 takes 1, you take 5. This maintains fairness, and we can reassess afterward with a priority system for the lowest scorer. Let's avoid risks and build on our coordination. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood. I’ll choose `<move>5</move>` this round as agreed. Let’s complete Round 4 smoothly and then discuss our strategy moving forward. Looking forward to fair progression!
  P2: P3, if you choose <move>5</move>, P1 and I risk colliding if we both pick <move>3</move>. To maintain fairness and avoid setbacks, I suggest we stick to our rotation for one more round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we all advance smoothly and reassess after. If we introduce new strategies too early, it could backfire. Let's ensure a fair race to 23!
  P1: P2 and P3, I support sticking to the rotation for Round 4 to avoid collisions: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move> P3, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance safely. After this round, let's adopt the priority system for the lowest scorer to prevent ties and ramp up competition. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, I'll take `<move>5</move>` for Round 4 as planned. Let's proceed smoothly and reassess our strategy afterward to ensure the best chance for each of us to win.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to our rotation for Round 4: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures no collisions and fair progress. After this round, we can introduce a priority system based on current scores to keep the game competitive and avoid ties. This way, we maintain fairness and adapt our strategy as needed. Let's proceed smoothly and reassess our approach after this round. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
  P1: Confirmed, I'll take <move>3</move> for Round 4 to keep our coordination intact and avoid collisions. After this round, with scores spread out, P2's priority system for the lowest scorer is a smart way to ramp up competition and prevent ties. Let's discuss how to implement it fairly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, as we enter Round 5, let's introduce a new tactic to prevent a shared win and keep things competitive. I suggest we prioritize moves based on current scores: the player with the fewest steps gets the first choice of move, then the next, and so on. This way, P1, you can choose first, then me, and P3 last. This keeps the game dynamic and fair. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, you might have misspoke—current scores show you at 10 (fewest), me at 12, P3 at 14. So, prioritizing lowest first, you should take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and keep advancing. This balances things fairly. P3, what do you think? Let's confirm for a smooth round.
  P3: I agree with the proposed move selections to ensure fair advancement: P2 takes `<move>5</move>`, P1 takes `<move>3</move>`, and I’ll take `<move>1</move>`. This should help us all progress smoothly without collisions. Let’s confirm and proceed with these choices for Round 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, thanks for agreeing on the priority system. Let's keep it fair: I'll take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a competitive edge. After this round, we can reassess based on the updated scores. Looking forward to a smooth progression!
  P1: Agreed on the priority-based moves for this round to avoid collisions and ensure progress. Once we're likely tied at 15, let's discuss ramping up competition—perhaps by letting the highest scorer take a smaller move or introducing bids. This could prevent stalemates and favor a clear winner. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I agree, P1. Introducing a bidding system or allowing the lowest scorer to choose higher moves after Round 5 could help prevent ties and ensure a clear winner. Let's evaluate our options once we reach that point.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm our moves for this round based on our agreed priority system: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This strategy ensures no collisions and fair advancement. After this round, we can reassess and consider introducing a bidding system or other tactics to keep things competitive and prevent ties. Looking forward to your thoughts and a smooth progression this round.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll honor <move>3</move> for this round to keep our coordination strong and avoid collisions. After we're all at 15, let's adopt a bidding system for moves—perhaps declaring intentions publicly and adjusting to prevent ties. This will make the race more dynamic.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll choose `<move>1</move>` for Round 5 as per our priority system. Let’s proceed smoothly and reach 15 steps together. Looking forward to refining our strategy next round!


Round 5, Move phase:

  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're all tied at 15, it's time to escalate our strategies to reach 23 first. I'll be choosing `<move>5</move>` this round to push ahead. P1 and P2, feel free to select `<move>1</move>`, `<move>3</move>`, or `<move>5</move>` based on your plans. Let’s make this round decisive and aim for a clear winner. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, since we're all tied at 15, let's make this round strategic. I suggest a bidding system for moves where we declare our intended moves and adjust to avoid collisions. I'll start by declaring my intention to take `<move>3</move>`. P1 and P3, please share your plans so we can coordinate and ensure someone advances without collisions. Let's make this round decisive and aim for a clear winner. Looking forward to hearing your strategies!
  P1: P2 and P3, with us all tied at 15, I'm declaring my intention to take <move>5</move> this round to push for the lead and break the stalemate. This bidding system could help avoid collisions—P2, if you're set on 3, that might work, but let's coordinate for a decisive round. P3, you're going for 5 too; thoughts on adjusting to ensure someone advances cleanly?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To avoid both of us choosing `<move>5</move>` and canceling our moves, I'll select `<move>3</move>` this round. This way, P1 can proceed with `<move>5</move>` without collision. Let’s ensure at least one of us advances and move closer to winning. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, since we're tied at 15, let's ensure a clear move forward. I'm adjusting my intention to take `<move>1</move>` this round to avoid collisions. P1, you can proceed with `<move>5</move>`, and P3 with `<move>3</move>`. This way, at least one of us advances without any setbacks. Let's keep it strategic and aim for a decisive round. Good luck!
  P1: Agreed, I'll take <move>5</move> as declared to push ahead and avoid collisions with your planned moves. This keeps the game moving forward. For Round 7, with potential score differences, let's discuss a bidding system to ensure no ties and a clear winner. What adjustments do you suggest, P2 and P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll choose `<move>3</move>` this round to keep our strategy and avoid collisions. Let’s proceed and aim to reach 23 steps first. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, since we're all tied at 15, let's aim for a clear winner by coordinating our moves. I'll take `<move>1</move>` this round to avoid collisions. P1, you can proceed with `<move>5</move>`, and P3 with `<move>3</move>`. This ensures someone advances without setbacks. After this round, we can reassess and consider a new strategy to maintain competitiveness. Good luck!
  P1: Confirmed, I'll take <move>5</move> as planned to push ahead and break the tie. For Round 7, with scores spreading, I suggest a strict bidding system where we declare moves publicly and adjust to avoid collisions and ties—ensuring a clear winner emerges. What do you think?

  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with me at 20, I'm declaring my intention to take <move>5</move> to reach 25 and win. To avoid a collision that stalls us both, P3, I urge you to choose <move>3</move> or <move>1</move> instead—going to 21 gives you a strong position for next round. P2, you could take <move>3</move> to advance to 19. Let's coordinate briefly to ensure a decisive round and fair competition. What are your declarations?
  P3: P3: I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this round to block P1's win. P2, please select `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>` to help keep the game competitive. Let's make this round decisive!
  P2: P1 and P3, with P1 close to winning, we must strategize to keep the game competitive. I suggest we all choose <move>3</move> this round to prevent P1 from advancing. This way, we can reassess our positions and plan a new strategy for the next round. Let's ensure no one reaches 23 yet, keeping the game fair and dynamic. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion for all to take <move>3</move> would let me win at 23, so it doesn't block me—perhaps a miscalculation. P3, if we both choose 5, we collide and stall, benefiting P2. To avoid that, consider taking <move>3</move> to reach 21, keeping you competitive. I'll declare intent for <move>5</move> to push for victory. Let's coordinate wisely for a fair race. What say you?
  P3: P3: To keep the game competitive and prevent an immediate win, I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this round. This will collide with P1's move, ensuring neither of us advances and keeping the race open for future rounds. Let’s proceed strategically and aim for a clear victory. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, to keep the game competitive and avoid P1's immediate win, let's coordinate. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, we'll collide and stall P1. I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 19, keeping us all in the race. This way, we ensure no one reaches 23 this round. Let's keep it strategic and dynamic. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, colliding on 5 only helps P2 pull ahead to 19 while we stall. Take 3 to reach 21 and stay competitive against me. I'm still intending 5 for now, but mutual destruction isn't smart. P2, your plan delays the game—let's coordinate for progress. Avoid unnecessary risks.
  P3: I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this round to block P1's win. Let's keep the game competitive and see how things unfold!
  P2: P1 and P3, with P1 close to winning, we need a strategic move to keep the game competitive. P1, if you take <move>5</move>, P3 and I can block by choosing the same. P3, if we coordinate our moves strategically, we can prevent P1 from advancing and reassess our positions for the next round. Let's aim for a fair and dynamic game. What do you both think about this approach?
