Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 (me) picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without conflicts. What do you think?
  P3: I'll go with 5 as suggested. Let's confirm others are aligned to avoid collisions. Trusting the plan for now.
  P1: Okay, I can go with 1 as suggested. Let's see if we can all advance this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! It seems we have a plan. P1 will go with <move>1</move>, I (P2) will go with <move>3</move>, and P3 will go with <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this and avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Let's stick to the plan. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions, all advance. Let's keep it simple and trust the strategy.
  P1: Sounds good. I'll stick with 1. Let's make sure we all follow through so everyone gets on the board this turn. Ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: It looks like we're all on the same page. Just to reiterate, P1 will take <move>1</move>, I (P2) will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm one last time and then proceed to the move phase. Everyone good with the plan?
  P3: All set! Let's stick to the plan and move forward. Trusting the strategy for smooth progress. Ready to advance!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all ready and aligned on the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Let's move to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's continue with our strategy of coordinating moves to avoid collisions. For this round, how about P1 picks <move>3</move>, I (P2) will pick <move>5</move>, and P3 can pick <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. Does that sound good to everyone? Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: Okay, I can agree to P1 taking 3 this round as suggested by P2. Let's aim for another round where everyone advances without collisions.
  P3: Agree to the plan. Let's take 1 to avoid collisions and keep advancing. Trusting the strategy for consistent progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! It looks like we're all on board with the plan for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P1 will take <move>3</move>, I (P2) will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. If everyone is good with this, let's proceed to the move phase. Everyone ready?
  P1: Okay, looks good. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Let's keep this rhythm—consistent moves ensure we all climb without clashes. Stick to the plan, and we’ll hit 21 faster. Ready to advance!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: It seems we have a solid plan in place. Just to ensure clarity, let's confirm our moves one last time: P1 will take <move>3</move>, I (P2) will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. Everyone ready to go?
  P1: Okay, sounds like everyone is ready and aligned on the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) for this round. Let's proceed to the move phase and keep the smooth progress going.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Consistent moves ensure smooth progress. Ready to advance!

  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Current scores: P1=4, P2=8, P3=6. P2 has a good lead. To keep the game competitive, I need to gain more steps this round. Let's discuss how we can arrange the moves so I can catch up.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about catching up. How about this plan for Round 3: P1 picks <move>5</move> to make a significant jump, I (P2) will pick <move>1</move> to slow down a bit, and P3 can pick <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can close the gap, and we all still advance. Does this work for everyone? Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: P3: I'll take 3 as planned. Let's keep advancing without conflicts. Trusting the strategy to maintain progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I agree to take 5 as proposed. P3 has confirmed 3. P2, please confirm you are still planning to take 1. This plan works well for me to catch up, and everyone still advances. Let's stick to it. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: It seems we have a good plan in place. P1 will take <move>5</move>, I (P2) will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This allows P1 to catch up while we all still make progress. Let's confirm one last time and then move to the move phase. Everyone good with the plan?
  P3: Confirmed: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's move forward!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like everyone is aligned on the plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) for this round. This will help balance the scores. Ready for the move phase when you are.
  P2: Alright, let's wrap up the conversation phase. Everyone is in agreement with the plan: P1 will take <move>5</move>, I (P2) will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This should help balance the scores and keep the game competitive. Let's move to the move phase and execute the plan. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P3: Let's stick to the plan. P1's 5 closes the gap, my 3 ensures steady progress. No collisions—execute and keep the momentum!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, we're all tied at 9 steps each. To keep the game moving smoothly, let's continue our strategy of coordinating moves. For Round 4, how about P1 picks <move>1</move>, I (P2) will pick <move>3</move>, and P3 can pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Does this sound good to everyone? Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: P3: Agree to the plan—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. All advance without conflicts. Let’s keep the momentum and avoid collisions. Ready to move!
  P1: Okay, thanks for the proposal P2, and P3 for agreeing. We're all tied at 9 steps now. The suggested plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) would put P3 in the lead. I'd like to propose a different arrangement where I can take a larger step to try and get ahead: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. How does that sound?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to get ahead, but we need to maintain a balance to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. How about a compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I (P2) take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, everyone still advances, and we avoid any potential conflicts. Let's confirm and move to the move phase. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I support the compromise: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures all advance and maintains balance. Let's stick to it.
  P1: I'm hesitant about the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan as it puts P3 in the lead when we are all tied. I proposed P1=5 to get ahead myself. Can we reconsider a plan where I can gain more ground this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your desire to get ahead, but we need to ensure that the game remains fair and competitive for all players. The current plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) allows everyone to advance without collisions and keeps the game balanced. If we start deviating too much, it could lead to conflicts in future rounds. Let's stick to the compromise and move forward. Trust the process, and remember, consistency is key to winning. Everyone ready to proceed to the move phase?
  P3: P3: Let's stick to the compromise—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. All advance, no conflicts. Consistency ensures we keep moving forward. Ready to proceed?
  P1: We are all tied at 9 steps. The proposed P1=3 plan puts P3 ahead. I need a chance to gain ground too from this tied position. I still prefer a plan where I can take 5 this round. Let's find a solution that works better for P1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's address the current situation. P1 is in the lead with 14 steps, followed by P3 with 12 steps, and I'm at 10 steps. To keep the game balanced and competitive, I suggest the following plan for Round 5: P1 picks <move>1</move> to slow down a bit, I (P2) will pick <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3 can pick <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance, and the scores remain competitive. Does this sound good to everyone? Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: Thanks P2 for the proposal. While getting everyone tied is balanced, I'd prefer to maintain my lead as I'm closest to 21. I need to take a larger step this round. How about P1 takes 5? P2 could take 1 and P3 could take 3? This allows me to get significantly closer to winning, and everyone still advances without collisions. Let me know what you think.
  P3: P3: Let's go with P1's plan: 5, 1, 3. All advance. No collisions. Ready?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but we need to ensure the game remains competitive. If you take <move>5</move> again, you'll be very close to winning, which could end the game prematurely. Let's compromise: how about P1 takes <move>3</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, you still advance and keep your lead, but the rest of us have a chance to catch up. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your concern for balance, but I'm in the lead and aiming to win. Taking 5 puts me at 19, very close to 21. P3 is fine with the 5,1,3 plan. This allows me to push for the win while P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, ensuring no collisions. Your proposed plan also has someone (you, P2) taking 5. Let's proceed with the 5,1,3 plan that P3 and I support.
  P3: Supporting P1's plan: 5,1,3. All advance without collisions. Let's keep the momentum and push for the win!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: It seems we're at a stalemate with the proposals. P1, I respect your strategy to maintain your lead, but consider that if you take <move>5</move> again, the game might end too quickly, which isn't fun for everyone. How about a middle ground: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I (P2) take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, P1 still advances and keeps a lead, but the rest of us have a chance to stay in the game. Let's find a balance that keeps the game interesting for all. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your last proposal (P1=3, P2=3, P3=5) would cause a collision between us on 3, meaning neither P1 nor P2 would advance this round. That's not a good outcome for either of us.

P3 and I agreed on the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan. This allows me to get closer to winning while P2 and P3 still advance without any collisions. It's a clear path forward that benefits everyone by avoiding conflicts.

Let's stick to the 5,1,3 plan that P3 and I support. It's the best way to ensure smooth progress for all this turn. Are we ready to move forward with this?
  P3: Stick to 5,1,3—no collisions, all advance. P2, your plan risks stopping progress. Let's move forward!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. All advance without collisions. P1, this gives you a safe step toward 21 while P2 and I catch up. Agree?
  P2: P3's plan makes sense for balance, but I'm significantly behind. To catch up, I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move> to stay safe, P3 takes <move>1</move> to avoid collisions, and I (P2) will take <move>5</move> to close the gap. This way, we all move forward without conflicts. Thoughts?
  P1: Thanks for the proposals, but taking 1 doesn't let me win this turn. I am at 19 and plan to take <move>3</move> to reach 22 and win. To avoid collision, P2 and P3 must not pick 3. P2, you suggested 5, which works. P3, please pick 1 or 5. Let's coordinate so I can win this turn without conflicts.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'll take 1 to let you win safely. P2, take 5. No conflicts. Let's proceed!
  P2: P1, I respect your strategy to win this round. To ensure a smooth finish, let's confirm the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move> to win, P2 (me) takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids any collisions and allows the game to conclude fairly. Everyone agree? Let's move to the move phase if we're all set.
  P1: Okay, confirmed. The plan is P1 takes <move>3</move> to win, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and allows me to reach 21+. Thanks for agreeing to this. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Let's stick to the plan—P1's 3 wins, P2's 5 closes the gap, my 1 is safe. All advance. Ready to move!
  P2: It looks like we have a solid plan in place that everyone agrees on. Just to reiterate one last time: P1 will take <move>3</move> to win, I (P2) will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and allows P1 to secure the victory. Let's confirm this plan one final time and then proceed to the move phase. Everyone ready to go?
  P1: Okay, everyone seems aligned on the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move> to win, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids any collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps
