However, P2 and I still have a chance to advance. I suggest we both take 5 this round, which will keep us competitive while allowing us to avoid colliding with each other. If you take 3, you'll win, but we can at least secure our positions for future rounds. Let's confirm our moves to keep the game going! P2, what do you think? Ready to lock in our moves?"}
