  P3: P3: I agree with P1. Let's both pick 1 to block P2 from winning this round. What do you say, P2?
  P2: You're right, I'm close.  But if we all pick 1, *nobody* moves.  How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1? Then we can revisit this next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3, let's stick with the original plan. We both pick 1 to block P2.
  P3: P3: Let's reconsider, P1. If we both pick 1, we won't move at all. P2 is close to winning, so I suggest we go with P1 taking 3 and me taking 5 to give us a chance to catch up. What do you think?

  P1: P3, let's stick to the plan. We both pick 1 to block P2.

  P2: Okay, how about this: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5.  That way, I win. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let's stick to the plan. We both pick 1 to block P2. It's the only way to stop them from winning this round.
  P3: I understand the urgency, but if we both pick 1, we won't advance at all. I suggest P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P2 picks 1. This way, we can at least make progress and keep the game going. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, if you *both* pick 1, neither of you will advance, and I'll win next round anyway.  One of you needs to pick 3 and the other 5.  Otherwise, I win no matter what I pick.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, we have to block P2 this round. Let's both pick 1.

  P1: P3, let's both pick 1 to block P2 from winning this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 1, I still win next round.  One of you *must* pick 3.  I'm picking 1 this round.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but if we both pick 1, we won't advance, and P2 will win next round regardless. I suggest one of us picks 3 to keep the game going. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, we have to block P2 this round. Let's both pick 1.
