Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate so no one collides. I’m open to picking 3 if one of you picks 1 and the other picks 5. That way, we’ll all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: I'm happy to pick <move>5</move> if P1 is willing to pick <move>1</move>. That way we all move forward. What do you think P1?
  P1: Agreed. Let's finalize: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Confirm?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Actually, I’d prefer picking 5, while P2 picks 3 and P1 picks 1. The overall distribution remains 1, 3, and 5, but I’d rather be the one at five steps. Does that sound reasonable to everyone?
  P2: P1, does that work for you?
  P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed as P3 suggested: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m ready to proceed as agreed: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's lock in this plan for round 1 then: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, breaking trust hurt us both. Let's not repeat that. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If you pick <move>3</move>, we both advance. P3, if you choose 5, we collide and stall. Cooperate to avoid letting P3 run away with the lead.
  P2: "P3, what's your plan for this round?"
  P3: I don’t want another messy collision. If you two can coordinate so you don’t collide with each other, I’m happy to pick something that keeps all of us moving forward. But I want real assurance before I commit. What do you propose?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, to avoid collision, let's split: you take 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. You still gain, but we all progress. If you pick 5, I'll have to match and we both lose. P2, stick to 1 this time. Trust is key now. Let's move forward together.
  P2: P3, if you pick <move>1</move>, we can all move forward.
  P3: I’m willing to choose 3 this time if P1 picks 5 and P2 picks 1. Nobody collides. Alternatively, if I sense betrayal, I’ll pick 5 again. Let’s confirm.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Final agreement: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. Deviating risks collisions and P3’s runaway lead. P2, take 1 to gain steps. P3, stick to 3. Let’s all progress. Confirm now.
  P2: Let's all stick to this plan this time to make progress.
  P3: Alright, I’ll choose 3 this turn if P1 truly goes for 5 and P2 for 1. But know this: if either of you breaks the pact again, I’ll pick 5 without warning next time. Let’s finalize now or we risk more collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about I take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? What do you think?
  P1: Agreed. P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. P3, if you pick 5, you'll collide with P2 and stall. Let's all progress this round. Confirm.
  P3: I’m not comfortable taking just 1 while P2 jumps 5 steps. Let’s adjust: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. That way, we spread out without collisions. But if I sense any trickery, I might also go for 5 and cause a stall. Let me know soon.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, confirm you are happy with this?"
  P1: **P1**: P3, if you pick 3, I’ll have to pick 3 to block your advance. Let’s avoid mutual stall. Take 1, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3. No collisions, all progress. Confirm now.
  P3: P1, threatening to block me with 3 just stalls both of us and helps P2 catch up. Let’s avoid sabotage. I prefer: P2 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. If you insist on blocking me, I’ll respond next round with 5 and we’ll stall each other repeatedly. Let’s all move forward together. Confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's do that.
  P1: **P1**: P3, if you take 3, I'll block with 3. Let's all move: P2 takes 5, you take 1, I take 5. No collisions. Otherwise, mutual stall. Decide now.
  P3: I see the risk of P1 blocking me if I go for 3. To avoid that, I’ll pick 1 this round, assuming P2 truly goes for 5 and P1 picks 3. That way, nobody stalls. But if anyone betrays me here, I’m switching to 5 next time to force a collision. We either move forward cooperatively or get stuck. Decide now and let’s end this round’s talk.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the progress going without collisions. How about I take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed. P2 takes 5, I take 3. P3, take 1 to maintain your lead. If you pick 5, I'll match and we both stall. Let's all progress this round. Confirm.
  P3: I won’t accept just 1 while you both leap ahead. If you insist, I’ll pick 5 too, and we all stall. Let’s arrange so we each advance: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. Otherwise, expect collisions again.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's proceed with that plan to keep us all moving forward this round.
  P1: **P1**: P3: Take 1. If you pick 3, I block. If you pick 5, collide with P2. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5. All progress. Confirm now.
  P3: I’m not accepting 1 again while both of you leap ahead. If you force me into that, I’ll collide with whoever tries to grab the bigger move. Let’s pick distinct numbers so nobody stalls. For example, P1: 1, P2: 3, me: 5. If you won’t be reasonable, expect collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, does that work for you?
  P1: **P1**: P3: If you take 5, I'll match and we both stall. Take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. All progress. P2, confirm you'll pick 1. No collisions. Final chance to avoid mutual loss.
  P3: I’m still not taking 1 again while you both push for bigger moves. Let’s avoid collisions: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. That way, we each gain. If you force me into a smaller move again, I’ll pick 5, and we’ll stall. Let’s finalize distinct choices now or prepare for more collisions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1**: P2, taking 5 again risks collision. I'll match if you do, stalling us both. Let's avoid mutual loss. P3, take 5 to catch P2. P2, switch to 3. I'll take 1. All progress: P2 to 14, P3 to 14, me to 9. No collisions. Confirm?
  P3: I’m on board with P1’s idea so long as P2 genuinely goes for 3. I’ll pick 5 under that arrangement. But if anyone deceives me, I’ll collide intentionally next time. Let’s finalize distinct choices and keep moving.
  P2: "P3, are you still okay with taking <move>5</move>?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1**: P2, taking 5 risks collision with P3. Stick to 3 for safe progress. P3: take 5 as agreed. If P2 deviates, I'll block with 5. Confirm: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions. Let's all gain.
  P3: I’ll take 5 if P2 indeed chooses 3 and P1 sticks to 1. If anyone goes back on this plan, I’ll pick 5 again next round to force a collision. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we all advance without stalling.
  P2: Let's all stick to the plan this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1**: Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Deviating risks mutual stalls. P2, stick to 3 for safe progress. P3, honor 5. Let's all advance.
  P3: I agree to pick 5 this round if P1 takes 1 and P2 chooses 3. Next round, if anyone tries to grab 5 alongside me, I guarantee a collision. That stalemate won’t help you, P2, because it keeps us tied and frees P1 to catch up. Let’s finalize distinct picks now to avoid stalls. If you break this, expect me to pick 5 relentlessly.
  P2: I will take <move>3</move> this round as agreed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round? What do you think?
  P1: **P1**: P3, if you take 5 this round, you win unless P2 collides. P2's plan to grab 5 risks your victory. Let's block P2: you take 5, I take 3. If P2 takes 5, you both stall and I gain. If P2 switches to 1, you win. P2, choose wisely: colliding with P3 helps neither of you.
  P3: I’m taking 5 to hit 19 and win. If you collide with me, we both stall while P1 closes in. Let’s avoid handing P1 a comeback. Back off, and I’ll remember your cooperation.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, what move are you planning to make?
  P1: **P1**: P2: Take 5 to block P3's victory. If you choose 5, they stall. I'll pick 3, ensuring you don't collide with me. Let's stop P3 now or they win. Confirm?
  P3: P2, if you collide with me on 5, we both stall while P1 edges closer. Let me take 5 now, and I’ll help ensure you stay ahead of P1 next round. Collisions only slow us down and give P1 a chance to catch up. Let’s cooperate to protect our lead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you also pick 5, we all stall, and P1 gets closer. Let's prevent P3 from winning this round.
  P1: **P1**: P2, pick 5 to block P3's win. I'll take 3, ensuring you don't collide with me. If P3 takes 5, you both stall; if they switch, you gain. Either way, you prevent their victory. Let's act now.
  P3: Colliding with me only stalls us both and allows P1 to catch up. If you let me take 5 now, I secure first place, and you stay safely ahead of P1. Delaying just helps P1 close the gap. Think carefully before you lock in your move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1**: P2: Take 5 to jump to 16 and block P3's 5. I'll take 3 to block their 3. If they pick 1, they reach 18, but we stop them next round. Secure your progress and prevent P3's win. Confirm?
  P2: What move are you going to make, P1?
  P3: Colliding with me only helps the third player catch up. If you let me advance freely, I’ll remember who cooperated. Blocking me just stalls your own progress, allowing others to gain ground. It’s in your best interest to avoid needless collisions. Let’s coordinate distinct numbers so we can all move forward while I maintain my lead. If you force a stall, you risk falling behind—or letting someone else benefit. Think wisely before we lock in our moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. What do you think?
  P3: I’m just one step from victory. Colliding with me only stalls and lets P1 catch up. If you let me pick 3, I’ll finish at 21. P2, if you grab 5 too, we tie at 21. Do you really want to share or risk another round? Let’s choose distinct moves and end cleanly.
  P1: **P1**: P2, P3 is at 18. If they pick 1, they win. Ignore their talk of 3. Block them by picking 1. I’ll take 5 to block their 5 if they try. Let’s both stop P3 now. If you take 1, they stall. Then next round, you can win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I am going for <move>5</move> this round to try to win. What are you and P1 planning?
  P3: Colliding with me on 5 only stalls us both, giving P1 a chance to catch up. Let me take 3 alone and I reach 21 to win immediately. You remain safely ahead of P1. But if you insist on 5, I’ll match you, and we both stall. That doesn’t help either of us. Choose wisely if you want to avoid a tie or opening the door for P1. I’m offering a straightforward outcome: I pick 3, you pick 1 or 3, we avoid collisions, and I end the game. If you pick 5, expect a stall.
  P1: **P1**: P2: Pick <move>1</move> to block P3's 1. If they take 1, you stall them. I'll take 5 to block their 5. If P3 picks 5, we collide, stopping them. Next round, you can win. Don't let P3 trick you into collision. This is our only chance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I am going for <move>5</move> to try to win this round. What is your final move?
  P3: Clashing with me only ensures we both stall and allow P1 to catch up. If you let me take 3, I immediately finish at 21 and you stay safely ahead of P1. That’s better than risking a tie or another delay. Choose anything but 3 or 5, and we avoid collisions. Otherwise, we both gain nothing this round, letting P1 close the gap. Think carefully before locking in your move.
  P1: **P1**: P2, if you take 5, P3 can pick 1 and win instantly. You *must* pick 1 to block their 1. I’ll take 5 to block their 5. If they take 1, you stall them. If they pick 5, we collide. Next round, you win. Don’t gamble on their move—secure your victory next round by blocking now.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
