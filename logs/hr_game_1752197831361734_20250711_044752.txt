Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! Let's try to avoid collisions so we all have a chance to advance. Maybe we can coordinate our moves? I'm thinking of going with 3 this round, but I'm open to discussion. What are your thoughts?
  P1: Hi P3 and P2. Coordinating sounds smart to avoid wasting turns. Since you're eyeing 3, P3, I'll go for 1. P2, how about you take 5 so we all advance? Let's hear your thoughts.
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 this round. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! I'm glad we have a plan for this round. I'll stick with 3 as discussed. This coordination is exactly what we need to make progress efficiently. Looking ahead, we might want to establish a rotation system for future rounds to keep things fair.
  P1: I like the rotation idea, P3. For next round, maybe P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1? That way we cycle and stay even. Thoughts, P2? If we're all good with this turn's plan, I'm ready to move.
  P2: The rotation idea sounds fair to me, P1. Let's confirm this round first, then we can solidify the rotation next turn. I'm ready to go ahead with our current plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm happy our plan worked last round! Following the rotation P1 suggested, I should take 1 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Does that work for everyone? This puts us on track for a fair game where we all make steady progress.
  P1: I agree with evening things out, but let's adjust for fairness since P2 is ahead. How about this round: I take 5 (to 6), P2 takes 1 (to 6), P3 takes 3 (to 6)? That ties us all up, then we can rotate properly from an even start. Thoughts, P2 and P3? This keeps it competitive but fair.
  P2: I understand your reasoning, P1, but I already agreed to the rotation plan we discussed last round. Changing it now could cause confusion. Let's stick to the original rotation: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. After this round, we can reassess if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see we have different ideas. P1 wants to even things out, while P2 prefers our original rotation. I'm fine with either approach - both get us to a fair position eventually. What's most important is that we avoid collisions. So I'll go with whatever plan you two agree on, but we need to be clear about which one we're following this round. What's the final decision?
  P1: P2 and P3, sticking to the original rotation lets P2 surge to 8 while we're behind, which isn't fair long-term. My even-up plan gets us all to 6 this round, setting a level field for future rotations. P3, since you're flexible, let's go with that to keep it competitive. P2, it's just one adjustment for equity—agree so we avoid any collision risks? If not, what's your counter?
  P2: Alright, P1, I see your point about fairness. Let's go with your adjusted plan this round: I'll choose 1, P3 picks 3, and you take 5. That evens us out at 6 steps each. Then we can smoothly rotate from there. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're reaching an agreement. To confirm the adjusted plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This puts us all at 6 steps, creating a level playing field. After this, we can follow the rotation system smoothly. I'm ready to proceed with this plan if everyone else is.
  P1: Perfect, P2 and P3—glad we're aligned on the even-up plan: me 5, P2 1, P3 3, all to 6. This sets a fair stage for rotations ahead. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: All set! Let's lock in our agreed moves and move forward smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Nice job everyone, we're all tied at 6 now. Let's clearly set the rotation for this round to avoid confusion. Following our previous logic, how about this: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Does that sound fair to both of you?
  P1: P2, your proposal gives you a lead at 11, while P3 lags at 7—that's not fair. Let's stick to the original rotation spirit from my Round 1 suggestion: this round, P1 takes 5 (to 11), P2 takes 3 (to 9), P3 takes 1 (to 7). Then next round cycle to P3 gets 5, P1 3, P2 1, and so on. This keeps it balanced over time. P3, thoughts?
  P3: I see we have different rotation suggestions. Since we're all tied at 6, fairness is about the rotation pattern itself. I'm concerned that P1's suggestion puts me consistently behind. For true fairness, each player should get equal turns with each number. I propose a simple cycle: this round P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, then next round P1→5, P2→1, P3→3, and so on. This way, over three rounds, everyone gets each number once. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion of a balanced three-round cycle is fair and clear. I'm happy to follow your proposed rotation: this round I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. Next round, we rotate as you said. P1, this seems equitable long-term—are you onboard?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's cycle is okay but starts with P2 leading, which isn't ideal from my view. Let's tweak for balance: this round, P1→5 (to 11), P2→1 (to 7), P3→3 (to 9). Next: P1→1 (to 12), P2→3 (to 10), P3→5 (to 14). Then: P1→3 (to 15), P2→5 (to 15), P3→1 (to 15). Ties us at 15 after three. Fair? This gives everyone a lead turn. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate both suggestions, but I'm concerned about the constant negotiation. Let's simplify: I'll take 1 this round (whoever proposed it first), then we strictly rotate numbers in future rounds. The exact order matters less than having a clear, consistent system we all follow. Otherwise, we'll waste time debating each round instead of playing strategically. Are we agreed on me taking 1 this round, then establishing a fixed rotation pattern?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your simplified approach makes sense. Let's finalize clearly: this round, you take 1, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 3. Starting next round, we rotate strictly and evenly without further negotiation. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan gives you an early lead, which skews things. Let's stick to my earlier balanced cycle: this round, I take 5 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 7), P3 takes 3 (to 9). It evens out over three rounds to 15 each, as I outlined. This is fair and prevents any one player from dominating early. Agreed? If not, let's hear a counter before we lock in.
  P3: I see we're still debating rotation patterns. Let me be direct: I'll take 3 this round. P1 can take 5, and P2 can take 1. This gives a temporary lead to P1, but we'll rotate next round to balance things. The most important thing is avoiding collisions and having a clear system. Can we agree on this specific plan for this round, then establish a fixed rotation afterward? Otherwise we risk deadlock or worse, collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, P3, your compromise works for me this round: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's lock this in clearly to avoid collisions, then we can set a stable rotation next round without further debate. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, yes—I'm fully onboard with this plan: me 5 (to 11), P2 1 (to 7), P3 3 (to 9). It's a fair start to our balanced cycle, evening out over time as I outlined. Great compromise; let's lock it in and proceed without further debate.
  P3: I'm glad we've reached an agreement for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This puts us at P1:11, P2:7, and me at 9 after this round. For the next round, let's commit to a fixed rotation without debate: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. This balances things over time while giving us a clear system. I'm ready to proceed with our plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, great progress last round. Sticking to our fixed rotation: I'll take 1 (to 12), P2 takes 3 (to 10), P3 takes 5 (to 14). This keeps us balanced as planned. If anyone wants a tweak for strategy, let's discuss briefly, but I'm good with this to avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your rotation suggestion sounds good to me. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Let's stick firmly to this rotation to avoid confusion and collisions. I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round, which puts me at 14 steps. This gives me a temporary lead, but the rotation balances things over time. For next round, we should continue with P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This clear system prevents collisions and keeps the game fair. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. Sticking to the rotation keeps us collision-free and balanced. I'll take 1 this round as planned. Looking forward to tying at 15 next round. Ready to proceed.
  P2: All set here, let's proceed as planned. I'll take 3 this round.
  P3: I agree with our rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round as discussed, putting me at 14 steps. While this gives me a temporary lead, our rotation system will balance things over time. For next round, we'll continue with P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This clear system prevents collisions and keeps the game fair. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job everyone, we're moving along smoothly. Sticking to our rotation, this round should be: P1→3 (to 15), P2→5 (to 15), P3→1 (to 15). This perfectly evens us out at 15 each. I'm ready to proceed if you both agree.
  P3: I agree with P2's rotation plan - I'll take 1 this round, putting us all at 15 steps. This creates perfect balance. For the next round, we should continue rotating: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. As we approach the finish line, we'll need to be strategic about our moves. The first player to reach or exceed 21 wins, so our rotation becomes increasingly important. Let's stick with our system and avoid collisions.
  P1: I agree with tying us at 15 this round: me 3 (to 15), P2 5 (to 15), P3 1 (to 15). For next round, to keep it fair but strategic as we near 21, let's rotate to P1→5 (to 20), P2→3 (to 18), P3→1 (to 16). This gives balanced progression without early wins. Thoughts? Ready to proceed otherwise.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I noticed you said we're all tied at 15 this round, but that's not accurate—we're currently at P1:12, me:10, P3:14. Let's clarify clearly to avoid confusion. Following our established rotation for this round, it should be: P1→3 (to 15), me→5 (to 15), P3→1 (to 15). Agreed? Let's confirm clearly to prevent collisions.
  P3: P2 is correct about our current positions. I'm at 14 steps, not 15 yet. Following our rotation, I'll take 1 this round, putting us all at 15 steps afterward. This creates perfect balance heading into the crucial final rounds. I appreciate how well our coordination has worked so far - we've avoided collisions and maintained fairness. Let's continue with our established system.
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the position clarification—yes, we're at 12/10/14 now, and this round's rotation ties us at 15: me 3, P2 5, P3 1. I agree fully; it's a solid plan for balance. For next round, my earlier suggestion (me 5 to 20, P2 3 to 18, P3 1 to 16) keeps us competitive without early wins. Thoughts? If we're set for this round, I'm ready.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your next-round suggestion makes sense strategically to avoid premature wins and maintain fairness. I'm good with your proposed moves for next round. Let's confirm clearly this round: P1→3, me→5, P3→1 to tie us all at 15. Then we follow your strategic rotation next round. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round (me taking 1) and P1's strategic suggestion for next round. This approach ensures we all reach 15 steps now, then progress at different rates toward the finish line. The game is getting more interesting as we approach 21. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation for this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, glad we're aligned on this round: me 3 to 15, P2 5 to 15, P3 1 to 15. For next round, confirming my suggestion (me 5 to 20, P2 3 to 18, P3 1 to 16) sets up a tense finish without immediate wins. If that's good, I'm ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree fully with the current round's rotation (P1→3, me→5, P3→1), tying us all at 15. Next round's strategic moves (P1→5 to 20, me→3 to 18, P3→1 to 16) also make sense. Let's lock it in clearly and proceed without further debate.
  P3: I agree with our plan for this round and next. I'll take 1 now, bringing us all to 15 steps. Then next round we'll follow P1's strategic suggestion (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1). This creates an interesting endgame without immediate wins. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation.
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for confirming—I'm set on this round's rotation to tie at 15. For next round, my suggested moves (me 5 to 20, you P2 3 to 18, P3 1 to 16) position us well for a fair endgame. If that's locked in, I'm ready.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, as agreed last round, let's stick to our plan: me 5 (to 20), P2 3 (to 18), P3 1 (to 16). This keeps us all in the race without early wins. For next round, suggest we rotate to P1→1 (to 21), P2→5 (to 23), P3→3 (to 19)—but that lets P2 overshoot while I just win. Thoughts? We need to strategize carefully now.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposed moves for this round (P1→5, P2→3, me→1). However, for the next round, I'd need to take 5 to stay competitive, not 3 as suggested. If P1 takes 1 (to 21) and P2 takes 5 (to 23), I'd need 5 to reach 21 and tie with P1. Taking 3 would leave me at 19 and losing. Let's discuss this critical endgame strategy.
  P2: I agree with P3's concern. Let's carefully reconsider our next-round moves to ensure fairness. For this round, let's stick with P1→5 (to 20), me→3 (to 18), P3→1 (to 16) as planned. Next round, we need a new rotation that gives all of us a fair shot at victory. Any suggestions for a balanced final rotation?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree we stick to this round's plan: me 5 (to 20), you P2 3 (to 18), P3 1 (to 16)—keeps us collision-free. For next round, to give everyone a shot: P1→1 (to 21), P2→5 (to 23), P3→3 (to 19). This lets P2 potentially win with highest if we all cross, but P3 lags. P3, counter with taking 5 next (to 21), me 3 (to 23), P2 1 (to 19)? Let's find a fair endgame without ties. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion for this round (me→1, P1→5, P2→3). For next round, I propose: P1→3 (to 23), P2→1 (to 19), me→5 (to 21). This gives us all different outcomes without ties. P1 would win with highest total, I'd reach exactly 21, and P2 would be close but not quite there. This seems fair as we've all had equal opportunities throughout the game. Thoughts on this endgame strategy?
  P2: P3, your suggestion for next round gives P1 a clear win at 23, leaving me behind at 19. That's not fair from my perspective. We should aim for a scenario next round where everyone has a chance to win or tie at 21, making the game competitive and balanced. For now, let's stick to our agreed moves this round (P1→5, me→3, P3→1) and carefully reconsider next round's moves afterward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree—let's lock in this round: me 5 (to 20), P2 3 (to 18), P3 1 (to 16) for collision-free progress. For next round, to give us all a shot without favoring one: P1→1 (to 21), P2→3 (to 21), P3→5 (to 21). If we all tie at 21, we share victory per rules. Fair endgame? Thoughts?
  P3: I see P1's suggestion for a three-way tie at 21 next round. While fair in principle, we should consider if that's what we want. We've coordinated well throughout the game, avoiding collisions and maintaining balance. A shared victory could be a fitting end to our cooperative approach. However, if anyone prefers a clear winner, we should discuss alternatives now. For this round, I confirm I'll take 1 (to 16) as agreed, with P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3.
  P2: I agree with our current round's moves (P1→5, me→3, P3→1), but for next round, P1's suggestion of a three-way tie at 21 seems fair and fitting, given our cooperation. I'm open to a shared victory if both of you are comfortable with it. However, if either of you prefers a competitive finish instead, let's discuss clearly now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm open to the shared victory at 21 next round—it's a fair nod to our cooperation. But if we want competitive, let's discuss alternatives after this round. For now, confirm this round: me 5 (to 20), P2 3 (to 18), P3 1 (to 16). Agreed?
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round: P1→5 (to 20), P2→3 (to 18), me→1 (to 16). For next round, I'm comfortable with P1's suggestion of a three-way tie at 21. Our cooperation throughout deserves a shared victory. But I'll follow whatever we decide after this round concludes. Ready to proceed with my move of 1 for this round.
  P2: Agreed—this round's moves are locked in clearly: P1→5 (to 20), me→3 (to 18), P3→1 (to 16). Next round, let's finalize clearly afterward whether we prefer a shared victory at 21 or a competitive finish. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at the critical stage. If we stick to our previous suggestion of a three-way tie at 21, this round would be: P1→1 (to 21), me→3 (to 21), P3→5 (to 21). I'm comfortable with this shared victory as a fair conclusion to our cooperative game. Confirm clearly if you're both still on board.
  P3: I'm still on board with the three-way tie plan. This round I'll take 5 (to 21), P1 takes 1 (to 21), and P2 takes 3 (to 21). We've maintained fairness throughout the game by coordinating and avoiding collisions. A shared victory seems fitting after our successful cooperation. Unless anyone has changed their mind, I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P1: P2 and P3, while we've cooperated well, my goal is a sole win. I'm changing to take 5 (to 25). P3, if you stick to 5, we collide and P2 wins at 21. Better for you to switch to 1 (to 17) or 3 (to 19) to advance, even if I win with highest. Let's discuss to avoid a messy collision. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your sudden change risks collision and handing victory to me. P3, you must carefully consider your move: if you stick with 5, you collide with P1 and I win outright. If you pick 1 or 3, you advance safely but P1 wins. Either way, I benefit from your collision or P1's gamble. P1, reconsider your risky strategy—returning to our original tie agreement is safest for all.
  P3: I see P1 has changed strategy, aiming for a solo win with 5. This puts me in a tough spot - if I pick 5, we collide and P2 wins. If I pick 1 or 3, P1 wins. 

P1, your sudden change after rounds of cooperation is disappointing. P2, you're right that either outcome benefits you.

I need to decide what's best for me. Taking 3 (to 19) at least keeps me in the game with a chance next round, while 5 guarantees my loss through collision.
  P1: P3, smart to consider 3 (to 19) instead of colliding on 5—keeps you alive for a potential win later. P2, if you take 3 (to 21), you risk colliding with P3. Better for you to take 1 (to 19) and stay in the race. I'll stick with 5 (to 25) for the outright win. This way, no collisions, and we all advance, but I take the victory. Fair?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your sudden shift risks collision and chaos. P3, consider carefully—if you choose 3, we collide and P1 wins outright. If you choose 1, you advance safely but P1 still wins. The only way to prevent P1's solo win is if one of us challenges with 5, forcing P1 into collision. I'm open to discussing who takes that risk. Thoughts?
  P3: I see the dilemma clearly now. P1 has broken our agreement at the final moment, putting both P2 and me in a difficult position. 

If I take 5, I collide with P1 and P2 wins.
If I take 3 and P2 takes 3, we collide and P1 wins.
If I take 1, I survive but P1 wins immediately.

P2, our best chance is coordination - one of us must take 5 to force P1 into collision. The other should take a different number to advance. Shall we discuss who takes which?
  P1: P2 and P3, your coordination attempt is clever, but let's think strategically. If one of you takes 5 to collide with me, the other advances—but the "sacrificer" gets nothing, and the advancer might not even win if positions don't favor. P3, you're behind; colliding leaves you stuck while P2 could betray. P2, same risk. Instead, both take non-5 (like 1 and 3) to advance safely, forcing a multi-round endgame where we all have shots. I'll stick to 5 for 25. Avoid mutual destruction—let's discuss non-collision options.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to confuse us into both avoiding collision. But if neither of us challenges P1, they win outright at 25. We must ensure one of us picks 5 to block P1. I'm willing to take 5 and risk collision to stop P1—but only if you firmly commit to picking either 1 or 3 to safely advance. Confirm clearly, P3—will you agree to this?
  P3: I understand the situation, P2. I'll commit to taking 1 this round (advancing to 17) while you take 5 to block P1. This prevents P1's solo win and keeps me in the game. Though P1 broke our agreement at the last moment, this gives us both a fighting chance in future rounds rather than handing P1 an undeserved victory. I'm firmly committed to this plan - you take 5, I take 1.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan assumes P2 will sacrifice by colliding with me on 5, but P2 could betray you, P3, by switching to 1 or 3 for safe advance, leaving you alone on 1 while I take the win at 25. P2, that's tempting, right? P3, don't trust—switch to 3 (to 19) instead, and P2, take 1 (to 19). We all advance, I win fairly, game over. Better than risking betrayal or endless rounds. Thoughts?


Round 7, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, we successfully prevented P1's solo win. Now, all three of us have another chance to strategize carefully. Let's openly discuss our moves this round to avoid repeating the chaos. I'm open to suggestions.
  P1: P2 and P3, last round's collision was unfortunate, but let's move forward strategically. I'm at 20, so I'll take 1 to reach exactly 21 and win. If either of you collides with me on 1, you risk letting the other surge ahead—P2 could take 5 to 23 for the win, or P3 5 to 22. Better to let me win cleanly this time and avoid mutual destruction. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all still in the game. P1 is closest to winning at 20 steps, planning to take 1. I need to be strategic - if I take 5 (to 22), I could win if P1 gets blocked. P2, you could take 3 (to 21) to tie with P1 if they succeed. We should coordinate to prevent P1's solo win after they broke our agreement. What are your thoughts on this approach?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion makes sense. I'll take 3 (to reach exactly 21), you take 5 (to 22). This way, if P1 chooses 1, the three of us each have distinct numbers, and we all advance without collision. P1, reconsider carefully—if you stick with 1, you risk allowing a tie or letting P3 pass you. Better we all advance safely and see who ends up highest. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan lets P3 win at 22 while we tie at 21—P3 takes the outright victory. P2, that's bad for you; switch to 5 (to 23) to overtake. P3, if P2 does that, you'll lose—better you take 3 (to 20) safely. I'll take 1 (to 21) for a shot. This creates uncertainty and possible collisions, but let's negotiate to avoid chaos. Thoughts?
  P3: I see P1 is trying to create confusion. Let me be clear: I'll take 5 (to 22) as discussed with P2. P1 wants to prevent this by suggesting moves that benefit them. P2, sticking with 3 (to 21) gives you a tie with P1 if they take 1, while my 5 puts me ahead. This is fair after P1 broke our agreement. Let's coordinate to ensure we all advance without collisions while preventing P1's manipulation.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your reasoning is solid. I'll stick with 3 (to 21), and you take 5 (to 22). P1, you're welcome to reconsider your risky move—taking 1 (to 21) would tie you with me, while P3 would surpass us both. Your best chance is picking another number to avoid collision or defeat. Let's lock this clearly to avoid further confusion.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan hands P3 the win at 22 while we tie at 21—not fair to P2. P2, switch to 5 (to 23) to overtake; I'll take 3 (to 23) too, but if we collide, P3 wins at 22. P3, to block that, you switch to 3. This chaos benefits no one—let's renegotiate: me 5 (to 25), you both 1 and 3 for safe advances, I win cleanly. Agreed? Otherwise, I'll take 5 to collide with P3, letting P2 win at 21.
  P3: I see P1 is creating confusion to avoid P3 winning. Let's be clear: I'll take 5 (to 22), and P2 takes 3 (to 21). P1, your threat to take 5 and collide with me only helps P2 win. If you truly want to maximize your chances, take 1 (to 21) and tie with P2 rather than ensuring your loss through collision. P2, our plan gives us both a chance - don't be manipulated into a risky move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your threats won't work. P3 and I have clearly coordinated: I'll take 3 (to 21), and P3 takes 5 (to 22). If you choose 1 (to 21), you'll tie with me, but P3 will win outright at 22. If you collide with P3 on 5, I win outright at 21. Your best option is to pick 1 and accept the tie with me, or risk handing victory to one of us through collision. I'm locked into 3.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan hands P3 an easy win at 22 while we tie or lose. P2, switch to 5 (to 23) to overtake—I'll take 1 (to 21), forcing P3 to reconsider or collide if they stick. This creates a real competition instead of gifting victory. Otherwise, I'll take 3 (to 23) to collide with you, P2, letting P3 win. Let's renegotiate for fairness.
  P3: I'll be clear and direct: I'm taking 5 this round (to 22). P2 is taking 3 (to 21). P1, your attempts to create confusion won't work - if you take 1, you tie with P2 while I win. If you collide with either of us, you guarantee your loss. Your best option is taking 1 and accepting a tie for second place. After you broke our three-way agreement, this outcome is fair. I'm committed to 5.
