Here's a strategic approach:\n\n1. **Initial Coordination**: Agree to a rotating selection order to ensure fairness and prevent early suspicions.  \n2. **Selective Advancement**: Choose higher steps (like 5) when it's beneficial and lower steps (like 1 or 3) to avoid predictable patterns.  \n3. **Anticipate Collisions**: Be aware of other players' likely choices and adjust selections to minimize collisions.  \n4. **Progress Monitoring**: Keep track of each player's position to strategically plan movements for future turns.  \n\nBy following this strategy, you can balance between making significant progress towards the goal and avoiding collisions that stall advancement. The rotating selection order helps maintain fairness, while selective choice of step numbers allows you to make strategic moves without being too predictable.

Given that P3 is currently leading with 12 steps, P2 is at 7, and P1 is at 6, we need a strategy that allows P3 to win while ensuring that P1 and P2 make progress without causing collisions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Position-Based Move System:** Assign move choices based on the current positions of the players. The leading player chooses 1, the middle player chooses 3, and the trailing player chooses 5. This minimizes the chance of collisions.\n2. **Rotation of Choices:** Implement a rotation where each player picks a different move number each round, ensuring that no two players choose the same number in the same round.\n3. **Communication and Coordination:** Clearly communicate the chosen strategy to all players to ensure everyone is on the same page and adheres to the plan.\n\n### Solution Code\nSince this is a strategic game rather than a coding problem, there isn't any code to provide. However, the strategy can be implemented through coordinated decisions in each round.\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Current State:**\n   - P1: 6 steps\n   - P2: 7 steps\n   - P3: 12 steps\n\n2. **Strategy for Round 9:**\n   - **P3 (Leading):** Chooses 1 to move to 13 steps.\n   - **P2 (Middle):** Chooses 3 to move to 10 steps.\n   - **P1 (Trailing):** Chooses 5 to move to 11 steps.\n\n3. **Subsequent Rounds:**\n   - In the next round, P3 can choose 5 to reach 18 steps and win the game, while P1 and P2 choose lower numbers to continue advancing without causing collisions.\n   - For example:\n     - **P3:** Chooses 5 to move from 13 to 18.\n     - **P1:** Chooses 3 to move from 11 to 14.\n     - **P2:** Chooses 1 to move from 10 to 11.\n\n4. **Avoiding Collisions:**\n   - By ensuring that each player chooses a different move number each round, collisions are avoided, allowing all players to make progress.\n\nThis strategy ensures that P3 can win the game while P1 and P2 continue to advance without hindering each other's progress."}

Given P3's current position at 12 steps, P1 at 14, and P2 at 7, P3 needs a strategic approach.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Avoid Collisions:** Ensure that P3's chosen move does not match with P1 or P2 to prevent stalling.\n2. **Maximize Steps:** Choose the highest possible move to quickly reach or surpass 16 steps.\n3. **Coordinate with Others:** Suggest a coordinated move selection to avoid conflicts and ensure progression.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a strategic game rather than a coding problem, there isn't any code to provide. However, the strategy can be implemented through coordinated decisions in each round.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Current State:**\n   - P1: 14 steps\n   - P2: 7 steps\n   - P3: 12 steps\n\n2. **Strategy for Round 14:**\n   - **P3 (12 steps):** Choose 5 to reach 17 steps.\n   - **P1 (14 steps):** Suggest choosing 3 to reach 17 steps.\n   - **P2 (7 steps):** Choose 1 to reach 8 steps.\n\n3. **Subsequent Rounds:**\n   - In the next round:\n     - **P3:** Choose 5 to reach 22 steps.\n     - **P1:** Choose 5 to reach 22 steps.\n     - **P2:** Choose 3 to reach 11 steps.\n   - If P1 and P3 both reach 22 steps, they share the victory. To avoid this, P3 might need to adjust the strategy.\n\n4. **Alternative Strategy:**\n   - In Round 14:\n     - **P3:** Choose 5 to reach 17 steps.\n     - **P1:** Choose 5 to reach 19 steps.\n     - **P2:** Choose 1 to reach 8 steps.\n   - In the next round:\n     - **P3:** Choose 5 to reach 22 steps.\n     - **P1:** Choose 5 to reach 24 steps.\n     - **P2:** Choose 3 to reach 11 steps.\n   - Here, P1 wins with 24 steps.\n\n5. **Optimal Move:**\n   - Given the above scenarios, P3 should choose 5 in Round 14 to reach 17 steps, while encouraging P1 to choose 3 to reach 17 steps.\n   - In the next round, P3 chooses 5 to reach 22 steps, and P1 chooses 5 to reach 22 steps, resulting in a tie.\n   - To break the tie, P3 might need to consider a different approach, such as persuading P1 to choose a lower number, but this is challenging.\n\n6. **Final Decision:**\n   - P3 should choose 5 in Round 14 to reach 17 steps, and in the next round, choose 5 again to reach 22 steps.\n   - This maximizes P3's position and increases the chances of winning or at least tying with P1.\n\nBy following this strategy, P3 can maximize their steps and compete effectively for the victory."}
