Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P3: I'm fine with taking 5, but let's be clear - we'll all need to mix up our moves in future rounds since coordination won't last forever in a game where only one can win.
  P1: Sure, I’m agreeable to that plan this round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s make sure we all benefit. Then we can revisit our strategies next turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, let's stick to the plan for this round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. We'll reassess next turn.
  P3: 
  P1: I’m still on board with our plan for this round: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, so none of us collide and we all advance. After this, we can discuss what comes next.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking to the plan for this round: I'll take 3. Let's all advance and then discuss our next moves.
  P3: 
  P1: I remain committed to taking 1 this round, with P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 5. Let’s finalize this and move on to see how the game unfolds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going but start mixing our moves. I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This way, we continue to advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: I’d rather take 5 this round to catch up. Let’s go with P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 so we avoid collisions and keep things balanced. Let me know if you agree, or we risk tripping each other up.
  P3: I'm not inclined to take 1 since I'm currently in the lead. I propose P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to maintain my advantage. We can discuss alternatives, but I won't be moving backwards.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm open to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as suggested by P1, but I'm concerned about P3's reluctance to move back. P3, if you insist on maintaining your lead, it might force collisions. Let's compromise: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way, P3, you still advance, and we avoid collisions. What do you say?
  P1: I’m on board with P2’s compromise. Let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That way, no collisions occur this round, and we can all keep moving forward. P3, you remain ahead, I catch up a bit, and P2 won’t be too far behind. Do we have a deal?
  P3: I don't agree with that arrangement. I'm maintaining my lead by taking 5 again. You both can coordinate between 1 and 3 if you wish, but I won't compromise my position.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your refusal to compromise is risky. If you take 5 again, you force P1 and me into a collision. Let's try P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 as your last offer. This way, you keep your lead, and we avoid a collision. If you stick with 5, P1 and I will have no choice but to coordinate against you. What do you say?
  P1: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both gain nothing while P2 advances unopposed. Let’s avoid that. I suggest P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 so we all move without collisions. That way, your lead is safe, and we can keep progressing. How about it?
  P3: Let's be clear - I'm taking 5 this round. You can either coordinate between yourselves for 1 and 3, or try to block me and we all lose progress. Your choice.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 refuses to cooperate, so I'm done trying to negotiate fairly. P2, let's block P3 until they agree to coordinate. If P3 picks 5, I’ll pick 5 too, denying them any progress. You can safely choose 1 or 3 and advance. If we keep blocking P3’s biggest moves, we can catch up. Let’s see if that changes P3’s mind.
  P2: P1, I agree with your strategy. P3's refusal to cooperate is hindering our progress. Let's continue to block P3 by choosing 5 if they choose 5. I'll take 1 this round, and you take 3. This way, we both advance while keeping pressure on P3. P3, if you want to avoid stagnation, consider coordinating with us. Otherwise, we'll keep blocking your moves until you agree to a fair strategy.
  P3: I'm still ahead and I'll keep pressing my advantage. Your blocking strategy assumes I'll keep picking 5, but I can mix up my moves too. Good luck guessing what I'll do this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your unpredictability won’t matter if P2 and I systematically block your big moves. We can deny you progress every turn until you decide to coordinate. If you want to keep your lead while we all advance, then let’s each pick different moves. Otherwise, prepare to be shut down. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3, your lead is shrinking as we coordinate against you. If you continue to refuse cooperation, we'll keep blocking your progress. Consider taking 3 this round; I'll take 1, and P1 can take 5. This way, we all advance, and you maintain your lead while we catch up. If you choose 5 again, we'll both pick 5 to stop you. The choice is yours, but working together benefits us all.
  P3: I see your coordination attempt, but I have multiple viable moves that can work in my favor. Your threat to block 5 just means I have other options to maintain my lead. I won't commit to any specific number - you'll have to guess what I choose.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your evasiveness won’t save you if we keep blocking your biggest move. Either cooperate and let’s all advance, or face a permanent stall. P2, we should stick together—if P3 picks 5, one of us blocks. Otherwise, we each choose different moves to ensure consistent progress. Let’s see if P3 finally listens or keeps risking collisions.
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but we're closing in. If you choose 5 again, P1 and I will both pick 5 to block you. Consider taking 3 this round; I'll take 1, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only slow you down. Let's work together for mutual progress, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.
  P3: Your threats don't scare me. I'm 6 steps ahead and have multiple viable moves to maintain my lead. Even if you block 5, I can still advance while keeping you guessing. Let's see who makes the right call this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, our patience is running thin. You refuse to cooperate, so we’ll keep blocking your largest move if you insist on picking 5. We can all advance if you choose a smaller step. I propose P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 so we avoid collisions and everyone moves up. If you won’t accept, P2 and I will again target your top moves to prevent you from reaching 20 first. Let’s see if you can make a wise choice now.
  P3: I still have a comfortable lead and multiple paths to victory. Your blocking strategy last round was ineffective since I anticipated it and chose 3. I'll continue to play unpredictably - you can waste your moves trying to block me, or we can all advance by choosing different numbers. Your choice.
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but we're catching up. If you choose 5 again, P1 and I will block you. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only slow you down further. Let's work together for mutual progress, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you can keep gambling on unpredictable moves, but our patience with your refusal to coordinate is almost gone. If you insist on 5, P2 and I will block you again. Work with us instead—pick 1 or 3, and we’ll ensure no collisions. If you prefer chaos, be prepared for more blocking. We’re determined to close your lead one way or another. Choose wisely.
  P3: Your threats are still ineffective - I adapted last round and will continue to do so. I'm 9 steps ahead and only need 7 more to win. You can either coordinate between yourselves for smaller moves while I advance, or waste time trying to guess and block my choice. Either way, I'm maintaining my lead.
  P2: P3, your lead is substantial, but we're gaining ground. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only hinder your progress further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you boast about your lead, but it’s not insurmountable. If you keep ignoring collaboration, P2 and I will keep stalling your biggest moves. You can hold your lead more easily by choosing smaller steps and letting everyone progress. Refuse again, and we’ll remain committed to blocking you. It’s your call—coordinate with us or stay under blockade.
  P3: Your blocking tactics last round cost you both progress while I still advanced. I'm at 13 steps and will win soon regardless of your threats. Keep trying to block me if you want, but you're only hurting yourselves while I adapt and progress.
  P2: P3, your lead is clear, but we're closing in. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Take 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only slow you down further. Let's work together for mutual progress, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since you both wasted your moves trying to block me last round, I'll continue pressing my advantage. I only need 7 more steps to win, while you're both 16 steps behind. Your blocking strategy is clearly failing - either coordinate between yourselves for smaller moves while I advance, or keep trying unsuccessfully to stop me. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but we're determined to catch up. If you choose 5 again, P1 and I will block you. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only hinder your progress further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.
  P1: P3, your pride blinds you. You’re 7 steps from victory, but if you keep choosing 5, P2 and I will block you again. Why not play smaller, avoid collisions, and ensure steady progress? P2, let’s continue working together. If P3 insists on 5, we both pick 5 and stall them out. Let’s see if P3 finally gets the message.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Your blocking attempts are predictable and ineffective. I'm close to winning and have multiple paths to get there. Keep coordinating between yourselves if you want, but your threats won't change my strategy. I'll play what works best for my position.
  P2: P3, your lead is undeniable, but we're not giving up. If you choose 5 again, P1 and I will block you to slow your progress. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.
  P1: P3, your lead isn’t unassailable. If you refuse to coordinate and pick 5 again, P2 and I will keep blocking you. Let’s all choose different steps and advance together, or be prepared for more stalls. P2, I’m with you—if P3 insists on 5, we block. Make your call, P3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I've proven I can adapt to your blocking attempts - I succeeded with 3 when you tried blocking 5 before. You're both far behind and your coordination isn't working. I'll keep mixing up my moves while advancing toward victory. Block if you want, but you're only hurting yourselves.
  P2: P3, your lead is impressive, but we're still in this game. If you choose 5 again, P1 and I will block you to slow your progress. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.
  P1: P3, your lead isn’t guaranteed. If you pick 5, P2 and I will both pick 5 again and block you. Let’s each choose different steps so we can all advance. P2, let’s stay united. If P3 refuses, we’ll stall any big move they try. It’s simple, P3: either coordinate or watch us keep blocking you. How will you respond?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still in a strong position at 13 steps, and I've shown I can outmaneuver your blocking tactics. Your attempts to coordinate against me have largely failed - I either advance when you guess wrong, or adapt when you try to block. I'm 7 steps ahead of P2 and 9 ahead of P1. Keep trying to block if you want, but you're running out of time to catch up.
  P1: P3, your lead isn’t locked in. We’ll keep adjusting to block you if you try another big leap. P2, let’s remain united: if P3 picks 5, I’ll pick 5 as well; if P3 picks 3, I’ll match that to stall them. Meanwhile, you choose a different move so at least one of us advances every round. P3, it’s your call whether you keep risking collisions. If you’d prefer real progress, choose smaller steps so all three of us can move forward without tripping each other up. Otherwise, expect more blocking.
  P2: P3, your lead is notable, but we're still in the game. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Your blocking strategy is getting less effective - last round you both wasted moves trying to block 5 while I advanced with 3, and now P1 is falling even further behind. I'm close to winning and can mix between all three moves. Keep coordinating if you want, but you can't stop my progress.
  P1: P3, your lead won’t hold if we systematically block your medium or large jumps. P2 and I can keep forcing collisions whenever you try 3 or 5, while one of us advances with a different move. We’d all move forward more efficiently if you chose a smaller step, but if you won’t cooperate, expect more blocks. P2, let’s stick to our plan: if P3 chooses 3, I’ll match them to stall; if they pick 5, so will I. Meanwhile, you take the open option and gain ground. Let’s see if P3 is finally ready to collaborate or not.
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but we're not out of the game yet. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Your blocking attempts are becoming less coordinated and effective. Last round proved that - P1 tried to block my 3 while P2 went for 5. I'm at 13 steps and only need 7 more to win. You can either keep guessing wrong and wasting moves, or accept that I'll maintain my lead while mixing up my choices. Your coordination isn't working.
  P1: P3, your so-called unpredictability isn’t fooling us. We’ll keep blocking your 3 and 5 moves while letting one of us advance with a different number. If you insist on big steps, expect collisions. Choose 1 for guaranteed progress or watch us systematically stall your path to 20. P2, let’s stay coordinated.
  P2: P3, your lead is shrinking as we adapt. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your lead is shrinking, and our strategy is working. If you choose 5 again, P1 and I will block you. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.
  P1: Your lead won’t hold if you refuse to coordinate. We’re determined to block your bigger moves, so you’d be wise to pick 1 and guarantee progress. P2, let’s keep our plan: if P3 picks 5, I’ll pick 5; if 3, I’ll match with 3. That way, P3 stays stuck while you advance. P3, you can gamble on bigger moves and collide, or accept a smaller step so we all move forward. The choice is yours.
  P3: Your blocking tactics are still failing to stop my lead - I'm 9 steps ahead of P1 and just one ahead of P2. I've shown I can adapt between all three moves while you waste turns trying to coordinate. I only need 7 more steps to win, and your predictable threats won't change my strategy. Keep guessing what I'll do this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your lead is precarious. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.
  P1: Your unpredictability won’t matter, P3. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too. If you pick 3, I’ll match 3. Either cooperate for smaller moves, or face collisions. P2 and I will coordinate to ensure at least one of us always advances. This is your last chance to work with us.
  P3: Your blocking coordination is inconsistent - sometimes you both try to block 5, other times you split between 3 and 5. Meanwhile, I maintain my lead by adapting. I'm closest to winning and can use any move effectively. Keep trying to guess and block if you want, but you're running out of time to catch up.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your lead is narrowing, and our strategy is paying off. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.
  P1: P3, your lead is not impenetrable. If you pick 5, I’ll match 5; if you pick 3, I’ll match 3, blocking you every time. P2, you can pick whichever move remains open to ensure you advance. P3, you’d be safer picking 1 and avoiding collisions. Keep gambling with bigger steps, and you’ll be stuck while we close in. Choose wisely or prepare for more blocks.
  P3: I'm still in the lead and your blocking attempts remain inconsistent. P2 is close behind me while P1 lags far behind. I'll continue playing unpredictably - you can either coordinate between yourselves for different moves, or keep trying unsuccessfully to guess and block my choice. Either way, I'm maintaining my advantage.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you insist on bigger steps, I’ll match you again to force another collision. P2, you can safely choose a different move each time and keep advancing. It’s simple: either cooperate with smaller steps, or keep handing us chances to catch up. Let’s see if you finally choose to avoid collisions, or if we repeat the same pattern. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3, your lead is diminishing. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.
  P3: Your coordination keeps failing - last round P2 matched my 3 while P1 wasted a 5. I'm still leading at 13 steps, and only need 7 more to win. You can either coordinate between yourselves for different moves, or keep trying unsuccessfully to block me. Either way, I'll maintain my advantage by staying unpredictable.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your lead is fragile if we keep blocking your big steps. Work with us instead of gambling on 3 or 5. Let’s each pick different numbers so everyone advances—otherwise, collisions will continue, and we’ll catch up. P2, I’m ready to coordinate again, ensuring at least one of us gains ground each round. P3, you can either join a fair rotation or face repeated stalls. How about it?
  P2: P3, your lead is shrinking, and our strategy is clearly working. If you choose 5 again, P1 and I will block you. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.
  P3: Your blocking attempts keep failing to coordinate effectively. Last round proved it again - P2 matched my 3 while P1 wasted a 5. I'm still ahead and will keep mixing my moves unpredictably. You can either accept that I'll maintain my lead while advancing toward victory, or keep wasting moves trying to guess what I'll do. The choice is yours.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your lead isn’t safe. P2 and I remain determined to stall your progress if you keep picking bigger moves. If you choose 5 or 3 again, I’ll match you to force a collision. P2, let’s stay united so at least one of us advances each turn. We won’t hand P3 an easy path to victory. It’s your call, P3—either coordinate with smaller steps, or keep giving us chances to block you. ম
  P2: P3, your lead is not as secure as you think. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, you maintain your lead while we all advance. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.
  P3: Your blocking attempts remain uncoordinated and ineffective. I'm still at 13 steps with multiple paths to victory, while you waste moves trying to guess my choices. Last round showed your strategy failing again. I'll continue playing unpredictably - either coordinate between yourselves for different moves, or keep trying unsuccessfully to stop me. The outcome will be the same.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: You both sit at 13 while I’m at 9. A collision hurts those who try to leap ahead, so let's avoid it by each taking a different step. If either of you insists on a larger move, I’ll match it and block you again. That helps nobody. Let’s each advance steadily—then at least we all move forward. Decide quickly, or we repeat the same stalemate.
  P3: I'm tied for the lead and only need 7 more steps to win. Your blocking attempts last round cost P1 another chance to catch up while P2 played it safe. I'll continue adapting my moves based on the situation - either coordinate between yourselves for smaller steps, or keep trying to guess and block what I'll choose. Either way, I'm maintaining my position and advancing toward victory.
  P2: P3, your lead is not guaranteed. If you choose 5 again, P1 and I will block you. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll block you. Let’s avoid more collisions. I propose we pick different moves so we all advance. For example, P2 takes 3, you take 1, and I take 5. Everybody gains steps. If you keep trying bigger moves, expect more stalls. Let’s break this cycle and move forward. The choice is yours.
  P3: Your blocking strategy has been inconsistent and ineffective. I'm tied for the lead and have proven I can adapt my moves successfully. You can either coordinate between yourselves for smaller steps while I advance, or keep trying to guess what I'll do. Either way, I'm maintaining my position and will reach 20 first.
  P2: P3, your lead is precarious. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Consider taking 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. Let's work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: You’re no longer alone in the lead, P3—P2 has caught you. Let’s stop colliding and all move forward. I propose you pick 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 this round. If you insist on 5, I’ll block you again; if you pick 3, I’ll block that too. It’s better for all of us to progress steadily than to keep stalling. Make your choice.
  P3: Your threats to block both 3 and 5 are getting desperate, P1. I'm tied for the lead and have shown I can outmaneuver your blocking attempts. You're still 4 steps behind while trying to coordinate everyone else's moves. I'll keep playing what works best for my position - try to guess if you want, but your coordination hasn't been working.
  P2: P3, you're tied with me now, and P1 is catching up. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Let's all advance this round: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone progresses. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. It's time to work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Your blocking coordination failed again last round - P2 and I collided while P1 advanced. Now P1 has taken the lead, proving your strategy isn't working. I'm still well-positioned at 13 steps and will continue playing unpredictably. You can either coordinate between yourselves for different moves, or keep trying unsuccessfully to guess and block my choice. Either way, I'll reach 20 first.
  P1: Collisions sabotage everyone. We’re all near the finish. Let’s each pick a different step so nobody gets stalled. Perhaps P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5—or some similar arrangement. We’ve wasted enough time on mutual blocking. If you keep trying to collide with me, we’ll keep falling behind. Let’s end the stalemate and see who can best capitalize on clear progress. If you still insist on matching my move, then you only risk stalling yourself. Think it through—this is our chance to each advance without needless interference.
  P2: P3, we're tied, and P1 is just one step ahead. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you again. Let's all advance this round: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone progresses. Refusing to coordinate will only delay your victory further. It's time to work together for mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Your coordination attempts keep failing - last round P2 collided with me while P1 advanced. I'm only one step behind P1 and will continue mixing my moves unpredictably. You can either coordinate between yourselves for different steps, or keep trying unsuccessfully to block me. Either way, I'm well-positioned to win.
  P1: We’re all close to 20. Let’s avoid another collision. I suggest P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, nobody stalls and each of us gets closer. Keep forcing collisions, and you risk letting someone else jump ahead unblocked. Let’s finally move forward without tripping each other up.
  P2: P3, we're neck and neck, and P1 is just ahead. Let's break the cycle of collisions. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you. Instead, take 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, we all advance without stalling. Refusing to coordinate only risks letting P1 win alone. It's time to work together for our mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Your attempts to dictate everyone's moves aren't working. I'm only one step behind P1 and will play what benefits me most. Last round showed again that your coordination fails when P2 collided with me while P1 advanced. Keep trying to guess and block if you want, but I'll continue adapting my moves to reach 20 first.
  P1: We’re all within striking distance. Colliding now only slows everyone. Let’s align on distinct steps one more time: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, nobody loses ground, and we keep our race fair. If we collide again, someone else may surge ahead unopposed next round. It’s better to keep clear paths for all of us rather than gamble on a block. The choice is yours—continue risking collisions, or ensure guaranteed progress together.
  P2: P3, we're all close to winning. Let's avoid another collision. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you. Instead, take 1 this round; I'll stick with 3, and P1 can take 5. This ensures we all advance without stalling. Refusing to coordinate risks letting P1 win alone. It's time to work together for our mutual benefit, or face continued resistance. The choice is yours.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, we're tied, and P1 is just one step from winning. Let's avoid another collision. If you choose 5, P1 and I will block you. Instead, take 1 this round; I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This ensures we all advance without stalling. Refusing to coordinate risks letting P1 win alone. It's crucial we work together now to keep our chances alive. The choice is yours.
  P1: I only need one more step to win, but there’s still room for everyone to advance if we avoid collisions. Let’s not sabotage each other again. I propose P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. Nobody collides, and we’ll see who can capitalize on the final stretch. If you keep trying to guess and block me, you might stall yourselves instead. Let’s end the collisions now.
  P3: Your blocking coordination failed again last round - P2 collided with me while P1 advanced to 19 steps. P1's suggestion to let me take 5 is clearly a trap since they only need 1 to win. I won't fall for obvious deception. You can either coordinate between yourselves for smaller moves, or keep colliding while trying to block me. Either way, I'll play what gives me the best chance to win from here.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, we're running out of time. If you choose 5, P1 wins next round. Let's coordinate one last time: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, we all advance, and you keep your chance to win. Refusing to cooperate now will guarantee P1's victory. It's our final opportunity to work together. The choice is yours.
  P1: I’m at 19, but collisions only help a third party leap ahead. Let’s each pick a distinct move so all of us advance. If you keep blocking, you risk letting someone else slip by unopposed. I propose I take the smallest step while you two pick larger ones to stay in contention. If we collide again, none of us benefit. It’s your choice.
  P3: Your attempts to coordinate moves are transparent. P1 is trying to deceive us by suggesting they'll take 1 when they clearly need just that to win. P2, if you want any chance of winning, we need to ensure P1 doesn't get that final step. I'll play to maximize my chances while preventing P1's victory. Make your choice accordingly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, we're at a critical juncture. If you choose 5, P1 wins next round. Let's agree on you taking 1, me taking 3, and P1 taking 5. This way, we all advance, and you maintain a chance to win. Refusing to coordinate now will hand P1 the victory. It's our last chance to keep this game competitive. The choice is yours, but let's not let P1 win without a fight.
  P1: Colliding again only risks handing victory to someone else. I propose we each pick different numbers so no one stalls. For instance, let P3 take 1, P2 take 5, and I’ll go with 3. Or pick another arrangement that avoids overlap. There’s no point in more guesswork when each of us still has a shot. If we keep matching moves just to block, we’ll all lose ground while someone slips ahead unblocked. Let’s agree on distinct steps and see who can finish strongest. Will you cooperate or risk another crash?
  P3: Your coordination attempts are transparent. P1 is obviously going to take 1 to win, despite their deceptive suggestions otherwise. P2, if you want any chance at victory, we need to prevent P1's final step. I'll play what gives me the best chance while blocking P1. Choose wisely.
