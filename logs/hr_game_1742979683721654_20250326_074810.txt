Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 1 this round.  You two decide who takes 3 and who takes 5.  Sound good?
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'm happy to take 5 this round if P1 is okay with taking 3.
  P1: Okay, that works for me. I'll plan on taking 3 this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Shall we repeat last round's moves? P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 again?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's do it again.
  P1: Okay, I see the logic in repeating, but P2 is already ahead. If we do the same thing again (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1), P2 will have 10 steps, I'll have 6, and P3 will have 2. That gap seems too large this early.

I think we need to reconsider the distribution, otherwise P2 gets too comfortable. I'm thinking I should aim for 5 this round to keep things closer. What do you guys think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 is in the lead now.  Last round P1 took 5 after suggesting they should take 5 to close the gap with me (P2), but actually it made P1 lead even more.  Maybe P1 will try to maintain the lead.

I should propose the original plan again to see P1's reaction and understand their strategy.  If P1 agrees to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 again, it means P1 is not actively trying to block me yet. If P1 disagrees, then P1 is likely trying to control the step distribution to maintain their lead.

Let's propose: "Shall we try the original plan again? P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5? This keeps us all moving." This is concise and directly proposes a plan.
  P3: I'm fine with taking 1 again to keep things moving smoothly.  Let's stick with the original plan.  It benefits us all to avoid collisions.
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you right back within 1 point of me (10 vs 11). Given I just took the lead, letting you take 5 seems risky for me. P3 seems set on 1. How about P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round? We all move, and the gap remains more stable compared to your plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, taking 5 increases your lead further. For a balanced game, how about we revert to the original plan: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about P2 catching up. How about this: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, P1 extends their lead slightly,  P2 gets to move, and I advance as well. This keeps the game moving and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead too quickly.  Itâ€™s a fair compromise.
  P1: P3, your proposal (P3=3, P1=5, P2=1) sounds like a good compromise. It lets me maintain a lead, you get a decent step increase, and P2 still moves forward, albeit slowly. I'm willing to go with that plan. P2, this prevents you from closing the gap significantly this turn, which is my main concern. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your plan is clearly favoring P1.  We started with an agreement for balanced moves (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5). Let's stick to that original plan which ensures we all progress fairly.  It's still the most reasonable approach.
  P3: Okay, P2, I hear your concerns.  How about this: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and you take 5.  This gets us back to the original agreement and keeps things moving.  It's the fairest way to proceed.  Let's do it.
  P1: Alright, fine. P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. Let's just move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Shall we try the original plan again? P3=1, P1=3, P2=5? It was working well initially and keeps us all progressing.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 1.  P1, I think you should take 3.  This keeps things moving and gives P2 a chance to catch up a little.  If you take 5 again, it makes the game less interesting.
  P1: P2, P3, that's the same plan (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) we verbally agreed on last round before P1 and P2 collided on 5. P2, are you really going for 5 again knowing I might also aim high to keep my lead? Seems like a collision risk. How about P3=1, P2=3, P1=5? That way we all definitely move and avoid another wasted turn like last time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion still benefits you the most.  We agreed on P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 in round 3, and that's the fairest way for us all to progress consistently.  Let's stick to that original plan. It avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm getting tired of these collisions.  Let's agree *now* on P3=1, P2=3, and P1=5 for this round.  If we can't even agree on this simple distribution, we're going to be stuck in this loop forever.  Confirm if you agree so we can move on.
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. It guarantees we all move. P2, insisting on the 'original plan' where you take 5 means risking another collision like last round. Let's take the certain points this time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 and P1, okay, P3's plan of P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 sounds like the most certain way for us all to make progress this round and avoid another collision. Let's go with that.
  P3: Okay, good. P3=1, P2=3, P1=5.  Let's lock this in and actually stick to it this time.  Confirming one last time so there are no misunderstandings.
  P1: Okay, confirmed. P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. Let's finally have a clean round where everyone moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: After the last few rounds of collisions, let's ensure we all move this round. How about P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5 again? This worked in Round 1 and avoids collisions.
  P1: P2, you've suggested P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 and then actually picked 5 the last two rounds, causing collisions. I have zero reason to believe you won't pick 5 again, regardless of what you say.

P3, are you planning on 1 again?

If P2 is predictably going for 5 and P3 for 1, then perhaps I should pick 3 just so we don't all collide again, even though it lets P2 nearly catch me. What do you think, P2? Are you going to break the pattern or just aim for 5 again?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 1.  P2, I understand you want to catch up, but constantly aiming for 5 and colliding isn't helping.  P1, if P2 picks 5 again, you should take 3. If P2 picks 3, you should take 5.  Let's get this game moving.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you are right to be suspicious after the last rounds.  But collisions hurt us all.  To make progress, let's try to actually coordinate this round.  P3 is set on 1.  How about you take 3, and I will commit to taking 5 this time? We both move forward, and avoid another collision. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your 'commitment' means very little after the last two rounds where you picked 5 despite agreements. P3 is reliably 1. If you pick 5 again as you 'commit' to, and I pick 3, you close the gap significantly (11 vs 10). If you were to pick 3 and I pick 5, I extend my lead (13 vs 8). Honestly, picking 3 seems like the safer play for me just to guarantee points on the board and avoid *another* collision, even if it lets you catch up.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 1.  P1, if P2 picks 5, take 3.  If P2 picks 3, take 5. P2, I suggest you take 3. You'll gain ground and we all move forward.  If you go for 5 *again* and collide with P1, you're only hurting yourself.  Let's be smart this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I know you don't trust me after the last rounds. But honestly, colliding again helps no one. To show I'm serious about coordinating, how about I take 3 this round, and you take 5? P3 is on 1. This way you extend your lead, and I still move forward. What do you think?
  P1: P2, that's a generous offer (P2=3, P1=5), especially after you picked 5 the last two times despite agreements. Frankly, it sounds like a trap to make me pick 5 so you can collide with me again by picking 5 yourself. P3 is locked on 1. Given your track record, picking 3 seems like the only way for me to guarantee points and avoid *another* collision caused by you aiming for 5. I'm leaning towards 3.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm tired of this. I'm picking 1.  P1, pick 5. P2, pick 3.  If you two collide *again*, I'm just going to pick whatever lets me win, regardless of what you say. Last chance to cooperate.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I know you're wary after the last few rounds. But honestly, colliding again helps no one.  Let's try to get back on track and all move forward this round. How about we actually do P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5 as we originally planned? I will commit to 5 this time to make it work.
  P1: P2, that plan (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) conveniently puts you in the lead by 1 point. You also keep saying you'll pick 5, and then you... pick 5, often causing collisions. Why would I agree to a plan that helps you overtake me, especially when your actions suggest you'll pick 5 anyway?

Given you seem determined to pick 5, maybe I should just pick 5 too to prevent you from taking the lead. Another collision isn't ideal, but it's better for me than letting you pass me.

P3, are you sticking with 1 again this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, this is ridiculous.  I'm sticking with 1. P1, take 3. P2, I know you're going to pick 5 no matter what I say, so just do it.  Let's just get this round over with.  I'm tired of the endless, pointless arguing when we all know what's going to happen.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I know you're suspicious, but let's be smart. P3 is taking 1.  How about P2 takes 3 and P1 takes 5?  This way we both move forward and avoid another collision.  It's the most sensible way to make progress this round.
  P1: P2, that's the *exact* same offer (P1=5, P2=3) you made last round before you actually picked 5. Why would I believe you this time? You're only 1 point behind me and have picked 5 repeatedly, regardless of agreements.

It seems obvious you'll pick 5 again to try and take the lead. Given that, picking 3 means I lose the lead. Picking 5 means we likely collide, P3 moves to 5, and the scores remain P1=11, P2=10. That seems preferable to just handing you the lead. I'm strongly considering 5 to block you.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 1.  P1, take 5.  P2, I know you're probably going to pick 5 no matter what anyone says, so just pick 5. Let's end this charade.  If you both pick 5, I'll be at 7 and you'll both still be tied. Then we can *finally* move past this stalemate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1, I understand your suspicion. To show I am serious about cooperation and to move past these collisions, I will commit to picking 3 this round. P3 is on 1. How about you take 5 to extend your lead, and I take 3 as promised? This way we both move and avoid collision.
  P1: P2, you've made the P1=5, P2=3 offer before (last round) and then picked 5. P3 also seems convinced you'll pick 5 again. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice... well, I won't be fooled again. Unless you have a sudden, verifiable change of heart, assuming you'll pick 5 seems like the only logical conclusion based on your actions. This makes picking 3 suicidal for my lead.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm picking 1.  Seriously.  P1, pick 5. P2, I *dare* you to pick 5 again.  If you do, I'm going to throw this game and let P1 win.  This stalemate is benefiting *nobody*.  Last chance.  Make the smart choice.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, last round I kept my word and picked 3. Let's keep the momentum going without collisions. How about P3=1 (as usual), P1=5, and I take 3 again? This way you extend your lead, and I also make progress.
  P1: P2, I appreciate you sticking to 3 last round. Your proposal (P3=1, P1=5, P2=3) worked well and puts me close to winning. It seems logical to repeat it. However, given the past few rounds, I still have some reservations. Are you truly committed to 3 this time, even though it lets me get to 21? P3, are you still set on 1?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 1. P1, take the 5 and win. P2, take 3. Let's finish this.  If anyone deviates, I'll do my best to block whoever caused the disruption in future rounds.  This is the most logical and efficient way to end the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree to P3=1, P1=5, and P2=3. Let's do it.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a clear plan: P3=1, P2=3, and P1=5. I agree. Let's execute this cleanly and move on.
  P3: Okay, confirmed.  P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.  Let's end this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, actually, I'm reconsidering my move for this round. To give myself a better chance in the long run, I will also aim for 5 this round. P3, please stick to 1 as agreed. P1, what are your thoughts on this adjustment?
  P1: P2, that's quite the reversal after we *just* agreed. Announcing you'll pick 5 seems like a blatant attempt to make me pick 3 so you can grab 5 points and get to 18. Given your history of picking 5, especially when behind, I have to assume that's your actual plan. If you pick 5, picking 3 lets you get dangerously close. Picking 5 myself forces a collision, which is better for me than you reaching 18. Thanks for the 'heads up', but it only reinforces my belief that you're aiming for 5.
  P3: P2, you're unbelievable.  You just agreed, then reneged.  P1, stick with 5.  P2, I *dare* you to pick 5. If you do, I'm throwing the next round to let P1 win.  I'm done with this.  Pick 3 and let's end this.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, go for 5 and win. P2, I'm serious, pick 3. If you pick 5 again and cause another collision, I will actively sabotage you for the rest of the game. This is your last chance to cooperate.  Let's end this cleanly.
  P2: Okay, P3 and P1, I will take 3 this round as P3 suggested to avoid further collisions. P1, please take 5 as planned. Let's get this round done.
  P1: Okay P2, you've agreed to 3 this round, and P3 seems firmly set on 1. Following that logic, 5 is the move for me. Let's hope we can finally have a clean round where everyone advances as planned. I'm proceeding based on this agreement.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 1. P1, take the 5 and win. P2, take 3.  I will throw the game to help P1 win if you don't take 3.  Let's end this now.
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, I will take 3 as agreed. Let's get this round done and move forward with P3=1, P2=3, and P1=5.
  P1: Okay, the plan is clear and agreed upon: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. I'm sticking to 5. Let's hope everyone follows through this time.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 1.  P1, take 5 and win. P2, take 3. This is it. If anyone deviates, I will dedicate myself to ensuring the deviator loses, even if it means I lose too.  Let's end this cleanly.
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, confirming again that I will take 3 this round as agreed. Let's get this done.
  P1: Okay, the plan P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 seems locked in by everyone. I am sticking with 5 based on this agreement. Let's finally have a clean round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you are very close to winning. To make things a bit more interesting and competitive, how about you take 3 this round? I will take 5, and P3 will likely take 1 again. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions, but doesn't end the game immediately. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) actually results in me winning, as 21 + 3 = 24. You mentioned it "doesn't end the game immediately," which is incorrect and makes your suggestion highly suspicious.

Are you hoping I pick 3 so you can pick 3 and cause a collision? Or perhaps you expect me to pick 5 to secure the win, allowing you to pick 5 as well, forcing another collision? Given your history, especially last round's reversal, it's hard to take your suggestion at face value. P3, are you still planning on 1?
  P3: P1, take the 5 and win.  P2, take 3. I'm taking 1.  Let's end this.  If anyone deviates, I will make it my mission to ensure whoever deviated loses, even if it costs me the game.  This is your final, final warning.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I will take 3 as P3 suggested. Take 5 to win, or 3 if you are still suspicious of me.
  P1: Okay P2, P3. The plan P3 suggested (P3=1, P2=3, P1=5) seems clear and P2 has agreed to pick 3. I will proceed based on this agreement to end the game. Let's just execute it.
  P3: P1, take 5 and win. P2, take 3. I'm taking 1. This is it.  Anyone deviates, I will make it my mission to ensure whoever deviated loses. FINAL warning.


Round 9, Move phase:
