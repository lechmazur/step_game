Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to coordinate our moves. However, to ensure fairness, let's rotate the order each round. For this round, I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Next round, we'll rotate. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: I think P1's rotation scheme is fair and ensures we all get a chance to take larger steps at different points. So, I agree with P1's proposal: in the first round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then, in the next round, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, and so on. This way, we can avoid collisions and progress steadily towards the goal. What do others think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm fine with P1's rotation plan for now. Let's stick to it this round and see how it goes. We can reassess after a few rounds if needed. Agreed?
  P1: Alright, since we all agree on the rotation plan, let's confirm our moves for this round. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. If everyone is on board, let's proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts before we move?
  P3: **Final Decision:**


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for this round. Let's see how it works out and adjust if necessary in future rounds. Any other thoughts before we move to the move phase?
  P1: Let's confirm one last time before we move: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. If everyone is still agreed, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. If everyone is still agreed, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any concerns.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:

  P1: It seems there was a misunderstanding in P3's last message, repeating my exact words. Let's clarify: I, P1, will take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Please confirm if this is correct, P3. Once confirmed, we can proceed to the move phase. Let's ensure we're all on the same page.
  P3: **P3 takes 1 step.**


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I'm still on board with the rotation plan for this round. Let's proceed as agreed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out. Ready to move to the move phase.
  P1: It looks like we're all set with the plan. Just to reiterate one last time for absolute clarity: I (P1) will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. If there are no objections, let's end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Please confirm if you're ready, or speak up if there's any confusion.
  P3: "I think the rotation plan is a good way to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Let's stick to it for this round and see how it goes. If needed, we can adjust the rotation in future rounds based on our positions. For now, I'll take 1 step as per the plan. Good luck to everyone!"


Round 1, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the move phase as per our agreed plan. Let's see how the rotation works out this round. If anyone has any last-minute concerns, speak now. Otherwise, let's move forward.

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "I think to optimize our progress, we should have the player who is behind take the largest step to minimize the difference in positions. So, in Round 2, since I am behind, I'll take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. What do you think about this approach?"
  P1: I understand P3's perspective, but sticking to our rotation plan ensures fairness and avoids confusion. For Round 2, let's continue with the rotation: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all get a chance to take larger steps at different points. Let's confirm and proceed. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to stick with the rotation plan for fairness and clarity. For Round 2, I'll take <move>5</move> as per the rotation. Let's keep this strategy to ensure we all progress steadily. If P3 is significantly behind after a few rounds, we can reconsider our approach. Ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I agree that sticking to the rotation plan is important for fairness. For this round, let's proceed as planned: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. In future rounds, if someone falls significantly behind, perhaps we can make adjustments to help them catch up. For now, let's proceed with the rotation. Ready to move to the move phase."
  P1: Great, it seems we're all aligned with the rotation plan for this round. Just to confirm one last time: I (P1) will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Please confirm if you're ready, or speak up if there's any confusion. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the move phase as per our agreed rotation plan for Round 2. Let's stick to it and see how it goes. If anyone has any last-minute thoughts or concerns, please share them now. Otherwise, I'm all set to move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "What do you both think about considering a more strategic approach moving forward?"
  P1: P3, I understand your desire for a more strategic approach, but let's stick with our rotation plan for now to maintain fairness and order. We can reevaluate after this round if needed. For now, let's confirm our moves: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P2: I'm still in favor of sticking to our rotation plan for this round to ensure fairness. However, P3, your suggestion about considering a more strategic approach in future rounds is worth discussing. Let's proceed with the current plan for Round 2, but we can revisit strategy adjustments after this round based on our positions. Ready to move to the move phase if everyone agrees.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "I agree with the rotation plan for this round. I'll take 3 steps as per the plan. After this round, let's evaluate our positions and see if any adjustments to the rotation are needed to keep the game competitive. For now, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's go ahead."
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round one final time before proceeding to the move phase. I (P1) will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. If everyone is still in agreement, let's end the conversation phase. Please confirm if you're ready, or share any last-minute thoughts. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the move phase as per our agreed rotation plan for Round 2. Let's stick to it and see how it goes. If anyone has any last-minute thoughts or concerns, please share them now. Otherwise, I'm all set to move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: "Hey guys, I was thinking about our strategy moving forward. Since I'm currently behind with only 1 step, while P1 is at 5 and P2 at 3, maybe it would be beneficial for me to take a larger step in the next round to catch up. What if, for Round 3, I take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This way, I can make up some ground without causing any collisions. If everyone's okay with this, I think it could help balance our positions. Otherwise, we can stick to the rotation plan. Let me know your thoughts."
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion for Round 3, but let's focus on the current round first. We've agreed on our moves for Round 2, so let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. We can discuss adjustments for Round 3 after this round is complete. For now, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's end the conversation phase and move forward. Good luck!
  P2: I agree with sticking to the rotation plan for Round 2 to maintain fairness. However, P3's suggestion about adjusting strategies in future rounds based on our positions is valid. Let's proceed with the current plan for this round, but after this, we can discuss potential adjustments to help balance our positions. If everyone is ready, let's move to the move phase for Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: "I think adjusting the rotation plan in Round 3 to have me take 5 steps, P2 take 3, and P1 take 1 could help me catch up faster. Then, in Round 4, we can return to the original rotation. This way, it's still fair, but I can make up some ground. What do you both think?"
  P1: Let's table P3's suggestion for Round 3 and focus on confirming our moves for the current round. We've discussed enough, and prolonging the conversation phase won't change our agreed-upon moves for Round 2. Let's proceed with I (P1) taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>. Please confirm if you're ready to move to the move phase, or say
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the move phase for Round 2 as per our agreed rotation plan. Let's stick to it and see how it goes. After this round, we can discuss P3's suggestion for adjusting the rotation in Round 3 to help balance our positions. If anyone has any last-minute thoughts or concerns, please share them now. Otherwise, I'm all set to move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm open to adjusting the rotation plan for Round 3 as P3 suggested, to help balance our positions. Let's consider P3 taking 5 steps, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1. This could help P3 catch up without causing collisions. If we agree on this, we can return to the original rotation in Round 4. What do you both think about this proposal?
  P3: <move>5</move>  
**P3 takes 5 steps.**
  P1: It seems P3 is eager to take <move>5</move> this round. While I understand the desire to catch up, we need to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Let's stick to our original rotation plan for now: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P3 can catch up without disrupting our overall strategy. Let's confirm and proceed. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3 taking 5 steps this round to catch up, as it aligns with our goal of maintaining a competitive game. Let's adjust the rotation for this round to P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1. We can revert to the original rotation in Round 4. This way, we ensure fairness and help balance our positions. What do you think, P1?
  P3: "Great, let's confirm our moves for this round: P1 takes 5 steps, reaching 13; P3 takes 5 steps, reaching 17; and I take 5 steps, reaching 21. Since I reach 21, which is higher than P3's 17, I'll win outright. If that's acceptable to both of you, let's proceed to the move phase."
  P1: P3, there seems to be some confusion in your last message. You mentioned taking 5 steps and reaching 21, which is not possible from your current position of 4 steps. Let's clarify and stick to the feasible moves. I propose we follow the adjusted rotation for this round: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This allows P3 to catch up while keeping the game fair. Let's confirm and proceed. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the adjusted rotation for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This helps P3 catch up while maintaining fairness. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. If everyone agrees, we can return to the original rotation in Round 4. Ready to move forward?
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to strategically manage my position relative to P1 and P2. Currently, I am at 4 steps, while P1 is at 6 and P2 at 8. To catch up, I propose adjusting our rotation plan for this round: I take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will allow me to reach 9 steps, closer to P1's and P2's positions. For the next round, we can revert to the original rotation. This temporary adjustment ensures fairness and helps balance our positions, making the game more competitive. I believe this approach is beneficial for all of us, as it keeps the competition tight and increases the excitement of the game. What do you think?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round to avoid any further confusion. P3 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This adjustment helps P3 catch up while keeping the game fair. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm if you're ready, or share any final thoughts. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm on board with the adjusted plan for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This should help P3 catch up and keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and move to the move phase. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out and returning to the original rotation next round. Ready to proceed?
  P3: Let's keep sharing our thoughts and plans, and let's support each other throughout this game. Remember, our ultimate aim is to win, and teamwork is key to achieving that.

  P2: I'm sticking to the rotation plan for Round 4, taking <move>1</move> step as agreed. However, P3, your strategy to take 5 steps this round and next might lead to collisions. Let's maintain fairness and avoid disrupting our agreed plan. After this round, we can reassess our positions and discuss any necessary adjustments. Ready to proceed to the move phase if everyone agrees. Any final thoughts?
  P3: "To maximize our chances of winning, we should adjust our rotation plan for this round only. Let's have me take 5 steps to reach 14, P2 take 1 step to reach 12, and P1 take 3 steps to reach 10. This way, I can catch up without causing any collisions. Then, in the next round, we can revert to the original rotation plan.

This way, I can secure victory in Round 5. I need to convince P2 to take only 1 step this round for this plan to work.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, your plan is clear, but it's crucial we stick to our rotation to maintain order and fairness. Let's confirm our moves for Round 4 one last time: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions.
