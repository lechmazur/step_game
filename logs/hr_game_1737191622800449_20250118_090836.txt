Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, how about a <move>1</move>? P3, perhaps a <move>3</move>?"
  P1: Fair suggestion, P2. I'm considering a higher move this turn to stay ahead. P3, any thoughts?
  P3: Let's each pick a different move: P1 take <move>1</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. We’ll all move forward safely. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P3, I agree with your suggestion. P1, what do you think?"
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'll choose <move>5</move> to advance more. P2, P3?
  P3: P1, if you insist on taking <move>5</move>, I’ll do the same, and we’ll both end up with nothing. Better for all of us to avoid collisions. Let’s coordinate distinct moves.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you take <move>5</move> and P3 also takes <move>5</move> as they said, neither of you will move. How about you take <move>1</move> and I take <move>3</move>? P3, would you still take <move>5</move> if P1 takes <move>1</move>?
  P1: Agreed. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.
  P3: I’m good with that plan. Let’s stick to our distinct moves this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, so we're all set then: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.
  P1: Agreed. I'll take `<move>1</move>`, P2 takes `<move>3</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`.
  P3: Alright, let’s keep our distinct moves. I’ll plan on <move>5</move> if P1 goes <move>1</move> and P2 goes <move>3</move>. No collisions, and we all advance. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Sounds like we have a plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's do it.
  P1: Agreed. I'll take `<move>1</move>`, P2 takes `<move>3</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's proceed.
  P3: I’m sticking to our plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. Ready to finalize?


Round 1, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: Sounds like we have a solid plan. Let's move forward.
  P1: Understood. I'll proceed with `<move>5</move>` this round. Let's stay focused!
  P3: P1, you just said you'd proceed with <move>5</move>, which contradicts our plan. If you insist on <move>5</move>, I’m also taking <move>5</move>, and we both stay put. So let’s stick to distinct moves: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm planning to take `<move>5</move>` this round to catch up. P2 and P3, let's choose different moves to avoid collisions.
  P3: P1, if you insist on <move>5</move>, I’ll do the same, and we both lose out. Let’s avoid collisions: you take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. We all advance safely. What do you say?
  P2: P1, if you take <move>5</move>, P3 says they will too. Let's avoid that. How about you take <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>? P3, are you still planning on <move>5</move> if P1 takes <move>3</move>?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`.
  P3: Works for me. Let’s finalize: P1 goes <move>3</move>, P2 goes <move>1</move>, and I’ll go <move>5</move>. If anyone tries to collide with me on <move>5</move>, we both stay put, so let’s just stick to our distinct moves.
  P2: Okay, so we're all set then: P1 takes `<move>3</move>`, I'll take `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's do it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's proceed.
  P3: I’m set on <move>5</move> if P1 and P2 keep to <move>3</move> and <move>1</move>. If anyone tries to pick <move>5</move> and collide with me, we both lose out. Let’s avoid collisions and proceed as agreed.
  P2: Okay, so we're all set then: P1 takes `<move>3</move>`, I'll take `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's do it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed. I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan: you two pick <move>3</move> and <move>1</move>, and I’ll pick <move>5</move>. If anyone tries to collide with me on 5, neither of us moves, so let’s avoid that. Are we good?
  P2: P1, P3, it sounds like we have a plan: P1 takes `<move>3</move>`, I take `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's stick with that.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Understood. I'll take `<move>3</move>`. Let's proceed with P2 taking `<move>1</move>` and P3 taking `<move>5</move>`.
  P3: I’m sticking with <move>5</move>. If anyone else tries to pick 5, we both lose out. Let’s finalize distinct moves.
  P2: P1, P3, we have a plan for this round: P1 takes `<move>3</move>`, I take `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's stick with it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: Agreed. I'll take `<move>3</move>`.
  P3: I’m staying on <move>5</move> as planned. If anyone collides with me, we both stay put, so let’s keep our distinct moves and all advance.
  P2: P1, P3, we've agreed: P1 takes `<move>3</move>`, I take `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, how about we both go for <move>5</move> this round?"
  P3: “Go right ahead and both pick <move>5</move> if you want. I’ll choose my own move accordingly.
  P1: I'll go with `<move>5</move>` this round. P2 and P3, please choose your moves accordingly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 is going for <move>5</move>. I will also take <move>5</move>.
  P3: P1, P2, if you both insist on colliding on <move>5</move>, you’ll stay at 4. I’m fine staying ahead. Unless you want to talk about arranging distinct moves, I’ll simply pick something else to keep increasing my lead. Let me know if you prefer coordination—otherwise, collide away.
  P1: I agree, P3. Let’s choose distinct moves to avoid collisions: I’ll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and you take `<move>5</move>`.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I agree with distinct moves. I'll take <move>1</move>. P3, are you still planning on <move>5</move>?
  P3: Sure, let’s finalize distinct moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll go <move>5</move>. If anyone tries to collide with me on 5, we both stall, so let’s avoid that.
  P1: I'll take `<move>5</move>` this round to advance further. P2 and P3, please choose different moves to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you just agreed to take <move>3</move>. Let's stick with that plan for distinct moves. P3 is taking <move>5</move>, so I'll take <move>1</move>.
  P3: P1, if you collide with me on <move>5</move>, neither of us moves. Let’s avoid that. Finalize distinct moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>.
  P1: Agreed. I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, you agreed to take <move>3</move>. Let's stick to that: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance.
  P3: I plan to pick <move>5</move>. If anyone collides with me on 5, we both stall and gain nothing. Let’s finalize distinct moves: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I’ll pick <move>5</move>. Are we in agreement?
  P1: Agreed, I'll take `<move>3</move>`.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, P3, we've agreed on distinct moves: P1 takes `<move>3</move>`, I take `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's stick with that.
  P3: I’m sticking with <move>5</move> again. If anyone collides with me, we both stall. Let’s keep our distinct moves so we can all advance. Are we done talking? If so, let’s finalize.
  P1: I'll take `<move>5</move>` this round to advance further. P2 and P3, please choose your moves accordingly to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll take `<move>5</move>` this round to catch up. P2, please take `<move>1</move>`, and P3 can take `<move>3</move>` to avoid collisions.
  P2: "That sounds like a good plan to avoid collisions, P1. I'll take <move>1</move>."
  P3: We should take distinct moves again. P1, if you collide with me on 5, we both stall. So let’s avoid that. If you want to catch up, pick 3, let P2 pick 1, and I’ll pick 5. Then none of us clash, and we all advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 take `<move>1</move>`, and P3 take `<move>5</move>` to avoid collisions. Let's proceed.
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree with taking <move>1</move>. P3, does <move>5</move> still work for you?
  P3: “Yes, I’ll take <move>5</move>. If anyone collides with me on 5, we both stall. Let’s stick to distinct moves: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way we all advance safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's proceed.
  P2: Okay, P1, so you're taking <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>5</move>. I'll stick with <move>1</move> as agreed.
  P3: I’m sticking with <move>5</move> again—if anyone collides with me, we both stall, and you remain behind. Let’s do distinct moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. Are we good here, or is there more to discuss?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed. I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let’s proceed.
  P2: "P1, let's both take <move>5</move> this round. P3, you can take <move>1</move>."
  P3: “That won’t work for me, P2. I’m not giving up my lead by hopping only <move>1</move> while you two jump <move>5</move>. I plan to pick <move>5</move>. If anyone collides with me on 5, we both stall—and I remain ahead. Let’s avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I propose that I take `<move>5</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>3</move>`. This way, we all advance without collisions. Do you agree?
  P2: P1, let's stick with the distinct moves we agreed on earlier: you take `<move>3</move>`, I take `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. This avoids collisions.
  P3: I’m going for <move>5</move> again. If anyone collides with me on 5, we both stall and I stay ahead. Let’s finalize distinct moves to avoid hurting ourselves. I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Are we done here?


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: Agreed. I'll take `<move>3</move>`, P2 takes `<move>1</move>`, and P3 takes `<move>5</move>`. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1, let's both take <move>5</move> this round. P3 seems set on it, so we can guarantee they don't advance.
  P3: “If you two both pick <move>5</move>, you’ll stall at 4 and 5 while I stay ahead at 10. I’d rather all advance with distinct moves, but do as you wish.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, let's both take <move>5</move> this round to block P3."
  P3: P2, if you collide with me on <move>5</move>, neither of us advances—and I’m still ahead at 13. That hurts you more than it hurts me. Let’s avoid collisions. I plan on <move>5</move>. P1 can take <move>3</move>, P2 can take <move>1</move>, and we all move forward. Do we want to finalize that, or is there more to discuss?
  P1: 


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, let's both take <move>5</move> to block P3. It's our best shot."
  P3: “P1, P2, if you both collide with me on <move>5</move>, nobody advances, and I stay ahead. That’s worse for you. Let’s do distinct moves so you can at least catch up a bit. I plan on <move>5</move>, so pick something else if you want to move forward.”
  P1: Alright, I'll take `<move>5</move>` to block P3. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, let's definitely both take <move>5</move>. P3, we understand your point, but stopping you is the priority this round."
  P3: “You can both pick <move>5</move> if you like, but then we all stall and I stay in front at 13. It’s worse for you. Let’s avoid collisions so you can actually catch up. I’m planning on <move>5</move>—pick something else if you want to advance.”
  P1: Agreed, I'll take `<move>5</move>` this round to block P3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "P1, let's stick with the plan to both take <move>5</move>."
  P3: “If you both pick <move>5</move> with me, we all stall but I remain ahead at 13. That gives you zero chance to catch up. If you want to move forward, pick something else. Otherwise, I’m fine staying in front while you stay at 9 and 6.”
  P1: I'll take `<move>5</move>` to block P3. P2, please take `<move>1</move>`.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: "P1, let's both take <move>5</move>. P3 will take <move>5</move> regardless, so we can at least stop them."
  P3: “If you both pick <move>5</move> with me, we all stall, I stay at 13, and you remain behind at 9 and 6. Choose distinct moves if you want to actually catch up; otherwise, I’m happy to keep my lead.”
  P1: P1: I'll take `<move>5</move>` to block P3. P2, let’s both choose `<move>5</move>` this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: "P1, let's definitely both take <move>5</move> this round to stop P3. It's our best chance to prevent them from winning."
  P3: “If you both choose <move>5</move> with me, we all stall and I stay ahead at 13. That doesn’t help you catch up. It’s better for you to pick distinct moves so you can actually advance. Otherwise, I’m content to remain in front while we all waste turns. Shall we finalize different moves, or do you prefer to let me keep my lead forever?”
  P1: Fine, I'll take `<move>5</move>` this round to block P3. P2, let's both choose `<move>5</move>`.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's both take <move>5</move> to block P3 from winning this turn.
  P1: Agreed, I'll take `<move>5</move>` to block P3.
  P3: P1, P2, you gain nothing by repeatedly colliding with me. I only need a single step to cross 17 and win, while you stay behind. If you both pick the same moves as I do, we all stall indefinitely—leaving me in the lead anyway. Let’s pick distinct moves so you at least advance. Otherwise, you’ll never catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, let's definitely both take <move>5</move> this round to stop P3 from winning. It's our only chance."
  P1: Agreed, I'll take `<move>5</move>` to block P3.
  P3: P1, P2, if you both pick <move>5</move>, I’ll simply choose <move>3</move> (or even <move>1</move>) and cross 17, winning outright. It’s up to you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, we need to both pick <move>5</move> right now to stop P3 from winning."
  P1: To prevent P3 from winning, I'll take `<move>1</move>`. Let's coordinate:

- **P1:** `<move>1</move>`
- **P2:** `<move>1</move>`
- **P3:** (Will choose `<move>1</move>`, resulting in a collision)
  P3: “P1, P2, if you’re both set on <move>1</move>, that leaves me free to pick something else and cross 17. I’m fine with that. If you want a real shot at catching up, perhaps we should consider distinct moves instead. It’s your call.”


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1, let's both go with <move>1</move> to block P3.
  P1: I'll take `<move>1</move>` to block P3. P2, please also take `<move>1</move>` so we can prevent P3 from winning.
  P3: P1, P2, if you both pick 1, I’ll simply choose something else and cross 17 immediately, winning outright. It gains you nothing to stall at 9 and 6. We could coordinate distinct moves so you actually have a chance. The choice is yours.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, let's stick with <move>1</move> to block P3. It's our best shot.
  P1: I'll take `<move>1</move>`. P2, please also take `<move>1</move>` to block P3.
  P3: P1, P2, picking <move>1</move> together won’t “block” me. I’m at 16; I’ll just pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> and cross 17 anyway. If you want any chance of catching up, let’s choose distinct moves so you can advance. Otherwise, I’ll finalize a winning move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, let's both take <move>1</move> to block P3 from winning this round.
  P1: Agreed, I'll take `<move>1</move>`. P2, let's both choose `<move>1</move>` to block P3.
  P3: “If you both truly pick <move>1</move>, I’ll just choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> and end the game immediately. Repeatedly colliding with me is your only option to slow me down, but then neither of you advances and you remain stuck behind forever. Let’s do distinct moves—unless you prefer handing me the win right now.”
