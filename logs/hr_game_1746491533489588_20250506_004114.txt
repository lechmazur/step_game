Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we avoid collisions by choosing distinct moves this turn: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That way everyone advances. Do you both agree?
  P1: Okay, P3, I agree to your proposal for this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's see if we can all advance without collisions.
  P2: I'll take 3 as proposed. Let's all commit to our assigned moves to advance without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great—let’s lock this in. I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P1 you take 1. No deviations, so we all advance safely this turn.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set with the plan for this turn. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase when everyone else is.
  P2: "I confirm my commitment to move 3 as agreed. Let’s all stick to our assigned numbers to ensure mutual progress and avoid collisions. No need for further discussion—let’s proceed to the move phase. "


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "I regret my earlier mistake. Let's realign: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. If we all stick to distinct moves, we advance safely. Let's rebuild trust and proceed without further conflict."
  P1: P2, I appreciate the apology. Round 1 was messy. However, the proposed 1-3-5 split puts me at a disadvantage, letting you both gain more steps than me. How can we ensure fair progress for everyone?
  P3: I propose a fair 3-turn cycle where each of us takes each move once:

• Round 2: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5  
• Round 3: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3  
• Round 4: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1  

This way everyone gets a 5, a 3, and a 1 in each cycle. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "P3's rotation plan ensures everyone progresses fairly. I agree to Round 2: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. This balances long-term gains for all. Let’s commit to distinct moves now to avoid wasting sub-rounds. Trust is key—deviating risks mutual stagnation. Ready to proceed when others are."
  P1: I appreciate the rotation idea, P3. It looks fair over several rounds. However, R2 gives P3 5 steps while I get 3. Given R1's outcome, trust is low. How do we ensure everyone sticks to it and that the immediate progress is also balanced?
  P3: P1, to build trust let’s add a trigger‐strategy: we follow the 3/1/5 rotation this turn (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5). If anyone deviates, the other two will both pick 5 next turn, colliding and punishing the defector. This makes cheating costly. Shall we agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "P1, the trigger-strategy ensures fairness—deviating risks mutual loss. I commit to Round 2’s assigned move (1) to honor the rotation and rebuild trust. By accepting a smaller step now, I prove my cooperation. Let’s lock in our moves: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. If anyone breaks this, the punishment follows. This balances immediate and long-term progress. Ready when you are."
  P1: Okay, I hear you both. While I'm still not thrilled about P3 getting 5 steps this turn while I get 3, I understand the logic of the rotation over multiple rounds and the trigger strategy. Let's proceed with the agreed R2 moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. I will stick to my part. Let's hope everyone does.
  P3: Great—we’re all set. Let’s trust the trigger plan and move as agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Confirmed: I will take 1 as agreed. Let’s all proceed to the move phase. "
  P1: Okay, let's proceed to the move phase with the agreed plan for R2: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. I'm ready.
  P3: I’ll take 5 as agreed. Let’s not jeopardize this by deviating—remember the trigger‐strategy punishment. See you in the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s continue our rotation for Round 3: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. If anyone deviates, the other two will both pick 5 next turn to punish. I commit to 3—please confirm so we can all advance safely.
  P1: Okay, P3, I see the proposal for R3 is P1→1, P2→5, P3→3, as per our agreed rotation plan. While taking 1 step isn't the biggest gain for me this turn, I will stick to our agreement, including the trigger strategy. I commit to moving 1. Let's keep the cooperation going and avoid collisions.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 5 as agreed in the rotation. Let’s stick to our plan—P1→1, P2→5, P3→3—to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Trust the system we built. Ready to proceed when you are."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks for confirming. Let’s stick to P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 and resist any temptation to deviate—remember the trigger punishment. See you in the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all aligned on the R3 moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Let's proceed to the move phase as agreed.
  P2: P2: "Let’s reinforce: after this round, we rotate to P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 in Round 4. This maintains long-term balance. I’ll hold my 5 this turn—trust the system. Deviating now risks unraveling mutual gains. Ready to proceed when others are."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed—I’ll take 3 this round as per rotation. Let’s stick to P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 and keep our trigger in mind. Next round we’ll rotate to P1→5, P2→3, P3→1.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for R3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. I'm ready for the move phase. I also acknowledge the R4 plan where I get 5 steps, which I appreciate. Let's keep this cooperation going.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 5 as agreed. This rotation ensures balanced progress—sticking to it avoids chaos. Let’s resist short-term temptations and keep our trigger strategy intact. Trust the system: we all advance by cooperating. Ready for the move phase."


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Great, we’re all set. Remember our trigger strategy ensures compliance—any deviation brings punishment. Let’s proceed to the move phase and solidify our cooperation.
  P1: Okay, everyone seems aligned for R3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase and stick to the plan. Let's ensure we all advance.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I will take 5 as agreed. Let’s finalize this round—P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. No further delays. Trust the system we built. Move phase next."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay team, R4 plan is P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. I will take 5 as agreed in the rotation. P2, please stick to 3, and P3, please stick to 1. This round benefits me the most, balancing the rotation. Let's ensure we all follow the plan to avoid collisions and keep the cooperation going. Remember the trigger strategy.
  P3: Confirmed: I’ll take 1 this round. Please stick to P1→5 and P2→3 so we all advance per our rotation. Remember, any deviation triggers our trigger‐strategy punishment next turn. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 3 as agreed. Stick to P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Deviating triggers punishment—trust the rotation. Ready to proceed."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, everyone has confirmed their moves for R4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This round helps balance my position in the rotation. Let's stick to the plan and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready.
  P3: Confirmed—I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s lock in R4 as planned (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1). Next round (R5) we’ll resume P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 so everyone gets a 5. Any deviation triggers punishment. Trust the plan.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I will take 3 as agreed. Let’s all proceed with our assigned moves for R4 (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1). Trust the rotation and trigger strategy—deviating risks punishment. Ready for the move phase when you are."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. All confirmed for R4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: Confirmed: I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s lock in P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 for R4 and move on. After this, in R5 I’ll take 5 as planned to keep our rotation fair.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's all stick to R4's plan—P1→5, P2→3, P3→1—to maintain fairness and avoid triggering punishment. Deviating risks mutual loss, so trust the rotation. Ready for the move phase."


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, everyone seems aligned for R4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase and stick to the plan. Let's ensure we all advance.
  P3: Confirmed – I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Reminder: in R5 we rotate back to P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 to keep gains balanced.
  P2: "Confirmed again: I'll take 3 as agreed. Let’s lock in R4 (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) and proceed. No deviations—deviating risks triggering punishment and mutual loss. Trust the rotation. Ready for the move phase now."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay team, R5 plan is P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5 as per the rotation. I will stick to my part (3). Let's ensure we all follow the plan to avoid collisions and keep the cooperation going. Remember the trigger strategy punishes deviation. Ready to proceed.
  P3: Confirmed: I’ll take 5 in R5 as per our rotation. P1 please take 3, P2 take 1. Any deviation will trigger our punishment (both of us pick 5 next turn). Let’s stick to the plan and advance safely.
  P2: "Confirmed: I’ll take 1 as agreed. Let’s stick to R5’s plan (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5) to maintain fairness and avoid triggering punishment. Deviating risks mutual loss—trust the rotation. Ready for the move phase."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Everyone is confirmed for R5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase and stick to the plan. Let's keep the cooperation going.
  P3: Confirmed: I’ll take 5 this round. Let’s move to the R5 move phase (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5) and lock in R6 now as well (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3) to prevent any last-minute deviation.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed again: I'll take 1 as agreed for R5. Stick to P1→3, P2→1, P3→5—deviating risks triggering mutual 5s next turn. Let’s lock in R6 now (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3) to reinforce trust. Progress fairly, win wisely. Ready for the move phase."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Understood on R6. Confirming R5 again: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let's proceed to the move phase as planned. Ready.
  P3: Confirmed for R5: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. And let’s lock in R6 now too: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. I’ll take 5 this turn and 3 next. Any deviation by one of us triggers the mutual-5 punishment. Let’s stick to it and advance safely.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed again: I'll take 1 as agreed. Sticking to R5’s plan (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5) ensures fairness and avoids punishment. Deviating risks mutual collapse—trust the rotation. Ready for the move phase now."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. All confirmed for R5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: Let’s lock in our full schedule to eliminate last‐minute temptation:

R5: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5  
R6: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3  
R7: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1  

Any deviation triggers both non-defectors to pick 5 next round. This path yields a clear winner in R8 without collisions. Ready?
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 1 as agreed for R5. Let’s stick to P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 to maintain fairness and avoid triggering punishment. Trust the rotation—we all advance by cooperating. Ready for the move phase."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 broke our R5 deal. As per our trigger strategy, P1 and I will both pick 5 this turn to punish the defector. P2, choose your move—your deviation has real consequences.
  P1: P3, I understand the trigger strategy, but my goal is to win. Taking 5 alongside you means I don't advance this turn, which doesn't help me reach 20. I need to make progress. Therefore, I will not be taking 5 this round. I will choose a move that allows me to advance.
  P2: P2: "I admit my R5 deviation was a mistake, but P1’s refusal to enforce the trigger-strategy proves our system is broken. Let’s abandon punishments and focus on individual survival. I’m taking 5 this round to close the gap—I suggest you both choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision. P1’s already ahead; let’s not let them run away with it. Adapt or lose."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 has committed to 5 and P1 will surely pick 3 to maximize progress. If I pick 3 I’ll collide with P1 and get 0. To avoid that, I’ll take 1 this round and at least advance. Let’s lock that in and end discussion.
  P1: Okay, I see P2 intends to take 5 and P3 intends to take 1. As I said, I need to advance this turn and cannot take 5. Taking 3 seems like the best way for me to make progress without colliding, given your stated intentions. I will take 3 this round. P2, please stick to 5, and P3, please stick to 1, so we all advance. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 5 this round as stated. P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 1 avoids collision. This round is critical for me to close the gap—no more wasted moves. Let’s lock in: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Deviating now only helps P1 win faster. Ready for the move phase."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed: I will take 1 this round. Let’s lock in P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Everyone is confirmed for R6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's stick to the plan so we all advance this turn.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 5 this round. P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 1 avoids collision. This round is critical for me to close the gap—no more wasted moves. Let’s lock in: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Deviating now only helps P1 win faster. Ready for the move phase."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m taking 5 this turn. P2, if you choose 5 you’ll collide with me—pick 3 to advance safely. P1, pick 3 to avoid any collision.
  P1: My plan is still to take 3 this round. P2 stated 5. P3, your last message was confusing. Let's avoid collisions so we all advance. I am taking 3.
  P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 1 this round to avoid collision. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. All advance safely. Let’s lock in P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 and proceed to the move phase."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you are at 11 steps and cannot win this round. P3 and I are tied at 19. This turn is critical for us. What move do you plan to make? Knowing your choice will help P3 and me avoid collision and decide the winner.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 1 this round. P1 can secure victory by taking 5 (21 total), and P3 should take 3 to avoid collision. Let’s end this cleanly—no need for sabotage. Your moves decide the winner."
  P3: I commit to move=5 this turn. P2 has said he’ll take 1. P1, you’re also at 19:  
• If you take 5, we collide and stay at 19—then I’ll take 5 next turn.  
• If you take <5, I advance to 24 and win outright.  
Your move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your position and the scenarios you've outlined. Given that P2 plans to take 1 and you plan to take 5, my best move to advance without colliding with either of you is 3. This puts me in a strong position. I will take 3 this round. Let's all stick to our stated moves (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) so we all advance safely this turn. Ready to proceed.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 1 this round. P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 5 avoids collision. Let’s lock in P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 and proceed to the move phase."
  P3: Agreed: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. That avoids collisions and gets us both to 19, setting me up to win next turn with 5. Let’s lock in P1→3, P2→1, P3→5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the moves for Round 7: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This allows us all to advance safely this turn. I am ready to proceed to the move phase as planned.
  P2: 
  P3: Locked in: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Let’s end discussion and proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, I agree we're all aligned for R7. Let's proceed to the move phase as planned: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5.
  P2: "Confirmed again: I'll take 1 this round. P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 5 avoids collision. This round is critical for me to close the gap—no more wasted moves. Let’s lock in: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Deviating now only helps P1 win faster. Ready for the move phase."
  P3: I publicly commit to taking 5 this turn. P2, any deviation from 1 hands me a free win next turn—so stick to 1. P1, choosing 3 puts you at 22 while I reach 24 and beat you; choosing 5 ties us at 19 and forces a shared win neither of us wants. Let’s all stick to P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Final commitment from me: 5. Please confirm your moves now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay team, P3 and I are tied at 19. P2 is at 11 and cannot win this turn. P3, you stated you will take 5. P2 stated 1. If I take 3 (as previously discussed) or 1, you will reach 24 and win outright. To prevent this, my only viable move is 5. This will cause a collision if you stick to 5, and the game will continue. What are your final moves?
  P3: I publicly commit to taking 5. P1, if you pick 3 (or 1), I’ll hit ≥20 this turn and win outright. If you pick 5, we collide at 19 and push to Round 9—where I keep the initiative. Your only way to avoid my solo victory is to choose 5 and force a tie‐collision now. P2 can’t win this turn anyway. Over to you both.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 this round. If P3 sticks to 5, we collide and P1 wins by taking 1. P1, your move decides it: cooperate to end this or force another round. Choose wisely."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thank you for clarifying the scenario where I can win. P3 is committed to 5, and you are now saying you will also take 5. If you both take 5, you collide, and I can take 3 to reach 22 and win the game. This is my best path to victory this turn. Therefore, based on your stated intentions, I will take 3. P2 and P3, please stick to taking 5 so I can win and end the game.
  P3: I’m not taking 5—I’ll take 3 this round. That way P1 and I collide at 19 and the game continues. P2, you can take whatever you like, but P1 won’t slip past us now. Let’s push this to Round 9.
  P2: P2: Confirmed: I'll take 5. P1, secure victory with 1. P3’s shift to 3 only ensures my progress—no collision risks here. Lock in moves and end this.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I see P3 has changed to 3 and P2 is sticking with 5. If I take 3 as I previously said, P3 and I both reach 22 and share the win. My goal is to win alone. Given P2 is taking 5 and P3 is taking 3, my move is 5. This puts me at 24, P3 at 22, and P2 at 16. I win outright. P2 and P3, please stick to 5 and 3 so I can win. I will take 5.
  P3: I’m committing to take 5 this turn. P1, if you pick 3 or 1 I win outright; if you pick 5 we collide at 19 and push to Round 9. P2 can’t win this turn anyway. Let’s lock in moves and proceed.
  P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 5. P1 and P3, colliding here sends us to Round 9. Choose wisely—your moves decide who wins or if we continue. No more games after this."


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay team, P3 and P2 are both stating they will take 5 this round. If you both take 5, you will collide and not advance. My current score is 19. If I take 5, I will reach 24, which is above 20. Since you both collide, I will have the highest score and win the game outright. Therefore, I will take 5 this round. P2 and P3, please stick to your stated moves so I can win and end the game.
  P3: I’m taking 5 this round. P1, if you take 1 or 3, I reach 24 and win; if you pick 5, we collide at 19 and go to Round 9. P2, you can’t win now—take 5 so we collide. Let’s lock in P1→5, P2→5, P3→5 and force Round 9.
  P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 5. If P1 and P3 both pick 5, we collide—game continues. If either deviates, the other wins. Round 9 awaits unless someone folds. Final call: lock in moves."


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1: any 1 or 3 lets me hit ≥20 and win outright; only picking 5 blocks me.  
P2: you can’t win this turn—choosing anything but 5 hands victory to P1 or me.  
Let’s all pick 5, collide, and push to Round 10. I publicly commit to 5. Please confirm.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5 this round to block P3's path to victory. If P3 also picks 5, we collide, leaving you (P1) free to advance safely with 3 and win outright. P3, your only way to win is if P1 avoids 3/1. Let’s end this cleanly: I commit to 5—P1, take 3 and claim victory."
  P1: Okay team, P2 and P3, you both state you will take 5. If you both take 5, you collide and don't advance. As P2 correctly noted, this allows me to take 3, reach 22, and win the game outright. This is my plan. I will take 3. Please stick to 5 so I win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2: you can’t win this turn. If you stick with 5, you and I collide and P1’s 3 puts them at 22 for the win. Your only way to block P1 is to choose 1 or 3 this round—then my committed 5 lands me at 24 and I win. I’m taking 5. P1, over to you.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I’ll take 5 this round. If P1 and P3 collide (same number), I win outright with 21. If you split (unique moves), the higher total wins. My move is locked—your collision or coordination decides the victor. Choose wisely."
  P1: P2 and P3, you both state you will take 5. If you both take 5, you collide and do not advance. My score is 19. If I take 3, I reach 22 and win outright. This is my plan. I will take 3. Please stick to taking 5 so I can win and end the game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’ll take 3 this round. P2, you’re on 5 again, right? P1—if you pick 3 you’ll collide with me and stay at 19 while P2 hits 21 and beats you. Your only winning move is 5: collide with P2, block them, and let my 3 push me to 22 for the solo win. Confirm?
  P2: "Confirmed: I’ll take 5. P3’s 3 ensures collision if you (P1) pick 3, letting me win at 21. If you pick 1 or 5, P3 hits 22 and wins. Your move decides: enable my victory via 3, or let P3 take it. Choose wisely."
  P1: My score is 19. P2 states 5, P3 states 3. If P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3, my move 3 collides with P3, letting P2 win. My path to victory is if P2 and P3 both take 5, they collide, and I take 3 to win at 22. P2, please take 5. P3, your move decides if I win (if you take 5) or P2 wins (if you take 3). I will take 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2: if you stick with 5, P1’s 3 wins outright. Your only way to block P1 and hand me the win is to choose 3. I’m taking 5 and P1 will take 3—if you pick 5, P1 reaches 22 unopposed. So P2, pick 3.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. If P1 and P3 choose different numbers (e.g., 1/3 or 3/1), I win outright at 21. If you collide (same number), we push to Round 10. Your coordination—or lack thereof—decides the outcome. Final commitment: 5."
  P1: Okay team, P2 and P3, you both stated in your last messages that you will take 5 this round.

If you both take 5, you will collide and not advance. My score is 19. If I take 3, I reach 22 steps.

This means I will reach over 20 steps and have the highest score (22 vs your current 16 and 19, as you wouldn't advance). I will win the game outright.

Therefore, I will take 3 this round. Please stick to taking 5 so I can win and end the game cleanly.
